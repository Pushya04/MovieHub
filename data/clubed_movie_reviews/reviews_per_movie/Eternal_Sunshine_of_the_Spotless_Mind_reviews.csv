I didn't get it the first time I watched it,"The first time I saw this movie I found it confusing, a little artsy for my taste and I didn't get it.But I didn't come in here to give it a 1 point rating or a damning review just because I didn't get it. It would be kind of stupid to pass judgement on a film that I didn't fully understand.Some years later I watched it for the second time. My ex had just left me, and I don't remember how and why I came by this movie again. But the second time I got it. And how life would be like a bleak dessert, frozen in time, in the eternal sunshine of a spotless mind.And after watching it a second time I felt hopeful again.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Interior Landscape,"Of all Kaufman's screenplays that delve into the interior landscapes of its characters, Eternal Sunshine is the most fully formed and moving story of the bunch, a rumination on the possibilities and consequences inherent in making the process of removing unwanted memories from your consciousness as easy as going for a checkup.  Kaufman here plays on our desire to forget the bad things that happen to us and what happens when we are given the power to forget those things permanently, and the conclusion he arrives at is that it ultimately creates as many - if not more - problems than it solves.  At the very least, it can result in making the same mistakes again (""Those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it""); at the worst, it eliminates the possibility of our ever reconciling and coming to terms with our life experiences, the way we relate to the people who help to shape our lives and whose lives we shape through ours.The film explores these ideas in a novel and engaging way: by taking the audience inside the mind of Joel Barish (Jim Carrey), a man who, after breaking up with his girlfriend Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslett), discovers later that she has had her memory of him wiped clean from her mind.  He finds out how she had this procedure done and, despondent not only about the breakup but even more so about her having completely erased him from her mind, searches out the doctor who performed the procedure and signs up to have the same procedure done to him, so that he may also have no memory of her.  He is rendered unconscious for the procedure but his subconscious is still active.   Once the procedure is initiated and he becomes aware that his memories of the woman he loved - and still loves - are vanishing from his brain, he starts having second thoughts and wants the procedure stopped.  His challenge then becomes to figure out how to protect as much of his memory of her as he can, and to find a way stop the procedure despite the fact that he is in an unconscious state.The manner in which he comes to realize and confront his dilemma is played out entirely within his interior landscape, a realm which (as anyone who remembers their dreams upon waking from sleep can attest) is a very surreal extension of our day-to-day experiences.  Michel Gondry's visual style and direction works exceptionally well here in conveying the slippery, chaotic unpredictability of the worlds we construct from our memories and experiences; the clever interplay between this interior world and the goings-on of the outside world helps keep the viewer off-balance just enough to illuminate the fuzzy line of demarcation separating the two worlds and the peculiar manner in which they play off one another.Jim Carrey and Kate Winslett do an exceptional job of bringing this abstract story concept to life with characters that are endearing, poignant, believable and utterly human.  The supporting players are equally impressive: Tom Wilkinson as the mind-eraser doctor, Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood as the technicians, Kiersten Dunst as the receptionist all have relationships to the main protagonists and to one another that come to light as the story unfolds and help to propel the plot; as friends of Joel and Clementine, David Cross and Jane Adams are hilarious as a couple who seem to be stuck in the same rut that compelled the protagonists to break up and have each other erased from their respective minds.  Kaufman juggles all these relationships masterfully and in such a way as to ensure none of them are superfluous to the ideas he is trying to get across in this story.While there are elements of the plot that seem to place this movie in the realm of science fiction, the focus of the movie stays on the interior states, emotions and relationships between the characters.  As such, the film is more of a romantic comedy than anything - albeit unlike any other romantic comedy you're ever likely to see.  I saw a late showing of this movie with my girlfriend the day it was released at a local multiplex and there were only 20 or so people in the theater, yet at the film's conclusion everyone broke out in a spontaneous round of applause.  This gives an idea of how compelling this movie can be.  If you give this film a chance to creep under your skin, you will likely find yourself reflexively thinking about your feelings toward the important people in your life, as well how you relate to those feelings, as well as your memories and how you relate to them.  A thought provoking, moving and entertaining film - I can imagine that a working title of this film might have been ""Warts And All.""",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Perfect - a movie that puts 99% of all contemporary movies to shame,"There's only one way to describe ""Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind"": perfect. It's been one week since I saw the movie and I still cannot stop thinking about it. Was the ending happy or sad? I cannot tell, but it's deeply touching.Charlie Kaufman is incredible. How does he come up with all these original, flawless scripts? Finally there's someone who uses the possibilities of cinema to the fullest. I love the way Kaufman shows the fate of individuals and derives universally true rules from it. The content of his story is always highly philosophical without ever being smart alec.Some say ""Eternal Sunshine..."" was over-directed. I disagree. Having read the script, I know that Gondry deserves lots of credit for bringing this beautiful story to life. Sure, there are five creepy images per minute, but have you ever seen such an original, weird picture? Mind you, I'm not saying that lots of effects automatically make for a good direction, but in this case it really helped to underline the story, not distracting from it.Jim Carrey... wow! I've always liked him as the hilarious Comedian he is, but I never thought that his performances in ""The Truman Show"" and ""Man On The Moon"" were that much of a departure from his funny-man side. As Joel, however, he is a completely different person. It's like Jim Carrey had a serious twin brother. Unbelievable. I bow to this performance! Give this man more chances to show his acting abilities, I say!Finally I have to mention Beck's cover of ""Everybody's Gotta Learn Sometime"", which fits perfectly into the movie and won't leave my CD-Player for the next months.A movie like ""Eternal Sunshine..."" really shows how much time and money Hollywood wastes on producing crap like ""Bad Boys"" or ""The Fast & The Furious"", and its box office result demonstrates how little people care about quality in movies. Personally, I have found my first contender for best motion picture of the year. I need to see the movie again, because I have a feeling that this one gets even better with each viewing. I can't wait until it's released on DVD.I feel the need to say more, but I can't put my feelings into (English) words. All I can say is: GO SEE THIS MOVIE! You won't regret it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
A warm hearted original love story,"After a lukewarm reception in 2001 with ""Human Nature"", Charlie Kaufman has teamed up with director, Michel Gondry again for this romatic fantasy. With a name like Jim Carrey, this second collaboration couldn't go wrong in terms of box office success, and nor should it as this film is quite simply brilliant.""Eternal Sunshine"" centres around the life of Joel (Jim Carrey) a shy, mild mannered man who is heart broken after splitting from his feisty, impulsive girlfriend, Clementine (Kate Winslet). A short while after their split, he meets her again while she is working at a library and he is stunned to discover that she doesn't recognise him. He later finds out that the reason for this is that Clementine has had her memory of Joel wiped out completely. Dr Howard Mierwick (Tom Wilkinson) has performed an operation on her brain after Clementine visited his clinic to forget Joel. Much to Joel's distress, he decides to do the same, but during his operation he revisits memories of Clementine that he struggles to let go of.If anyone was in doubt as to whether Jim Carrey can act, this is the film that will put all doubt out of the way. He performs with sensitivity and warmth, never once verging on the manic rubber faced lunacy to which he is most well known for. Out of all the perfomances where he has stepped into the dramtic role (The Truman Show, Man on the Moon, The Majestic), this has got to be his best yet. Kate Winslet is also brilliant as his unpredictable, adventurous girlfriend.Kaufman's story of a man going into a surreal dream world is not too dissimilar from his earlier work, ""Being John Malkovich"". You have off the wall images such as Carrey re-enacting his 4 year old self along his journey in his head. The eccentricity of the story, which is Kaufman's trademark, once again works excellently. When watching this you generally care for Carrey and Winslet, in much the same way as Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson in ""Lost In Translation"". Gondry's diection gives a bittersweet flavour to the tale.The sub plots involving the supporting characters who are operating are ingenius. Tom Wilkinson once again proves that he is one of the best British actors of his generation and he is backed up by great performnces from Kirsten Dunst and a post-LOTR Elijah Wood.This is a lovely film and if you like originality with a sense of fantasy with a love story, then I suggest you see it. It's one of those films you'll want to see twice.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
an modern artistic triumph for all involved,"Michel Gondry, credited as the director and co-writer of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, is only partly responsible for the success that the film achieves. He implements a awe-inspiring blend of style to a story that is perfectly non-linear. But then there is also the madman genius of the current screen writing plane- Charlie Kaufman- who has written three of the most ingenious, funny, and human of ""little"" Hollywood movies (Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind).He understands, and perhaps likely experienced to a degree, what a relationship holds to- the truth, to understanding, and then when it ends, how out memory changes the relationship. Enter in the concept that makes 'Eternal Sunshine' something of a un-official science fiction film - the Lacuna corporation, led by Tom Wilkinson's character, can erase just one person out of your memory, all of the experiences that you and the significant other had. So, when Joel (Jim Carrey) goes in to erase his memory of Clementine (Kate Winslet) after finding out she did just the same, he enters into a mind-warp. He goes through memories they had, happy ones, sad ones, some that are just what makes up what you have emotionally with the one you've loved. And sometimes, and to the behest of the assistants of Lacuna (Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffalo), Joel doesn't want them all to be erased.As I mentioned, the plot is non-linear, which could've gone the wrong way if not done with skill. With a film like 21 Grams, which has a talented director and cast, the non-linear structure isn't necessary. But it's an asset that the story doesn't start from A to Z. To assist Gondry with this, he has the extraordinary Ellen Kuras as DP and Valdís Óskarsdóttir, an editor from Iceland. Their collaboration is crucial with Gondry and Kaufman (and co-writer Pierre Bismuth), as they bring all of these un-real images a real quality. Quite simply, there isn't a finer example of surrealism crossbred with realism in any other American film so far this year. The usage of lights, cuts, and with the kinds of special effects not expected (i.e. no CGI), add to the effect it has on a viewer. That the characters of Joel and Clementine are as enveloping as they are is also a credit to Kaufman.But then there's one more part that completes the success of the film - the acting. Jim Carrey, very simply, is at his very best. He finds a balance from certain scenes in being like people we see everyday, feeling low, not much of interest, inward. And then when the memory erases begin, we get to see him act funny, but not like the kind of humor he brought with Ace Ventura or Dumb and Dumber. This is Carrey knowing this character just well enough to play off his counterpart, played by Winslet. She, meanwhile, is perhaps at her best. Her character is eccentric, funny, insightful, and wanting. She pulls it off. As do the supporting actors.There's not much more I can say about this film, except to say that even after seeing it three times, I feel like I could watch it over and over and see a new shot, a new sequence, and new set of emotions tied to things. It's one of the great romantic dramedies of the decade.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
I'm just somewhat confused over all the hype...,"I'm a movie lover and I own 1000s of DVDs from all eras, so I like to think I have an eye for a really great movie... So why am I scratching my head after watching this and seeing over 49% of 12,000 voters giving this a 10? I just don't get it.To be honest, I found the movie pretty average. It has some great acting by Winslet and Carrey and the soundtrack is quite enchanting. I suppose the storyline does touch the emotional nerves of anyone who has been in love and felt pain from it, but nothing I haven't seen done better in other (mostly ""World Cinema"") movies. The direction and style of the movie is nothing revolutionary (contradicting a point raised quite often here).I was wondering was it something to do with the general reviews of the film? One trend I've found on IMDb is that the vast majority of people tend to echo what reviews have said about a film, even if they (deep down) don't feel that way themselves about it? I'm not sure, I tend not to read reviews until after I've watched a film.I gave the film 6/10 as I was feeling generous. It really doesn't deserve anything more than this.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
It Just Isn't for Me,"This movie isn't bad. In fact, the acting is good and I commend the writers and director for the way in which they chose to tell their story.
But for it me it just doesn't work. There's not enough of a focus or cohesive story to hold my interest.

"Great, if you can relate...","If you can relate to the underlying theme of love longed for, love given and received, and love lost, this is a great film. If you have come to understand that acceptance can -sometimes- be a great thing and not a compromise or a 'settle for' - this is a moving film.As crazy and almost surreal as elements of this film are, it somehow remains honest and real. That seems like a contradiction... life is contradictory, isn't it?Carrey and Winslet both turn in superb performances, as do the supporting cast.  An incredible film that most of the people who 'get it' will love - but I suspect there will be more than a small percentage who won't understand it or can't relate to it and they will (understandably) dislike it.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
most imaginative concept,"Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) falls for Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet) from the first moment they meet on a train. After a bad breakup, Clementine erases Joel from her memories. He decides to do the same to her.

As his memories are eliminated, he starts to fall in love with Clementine all over again. He struggles to hold on to his memories before it's all gone.The premise is amazing, but it's the imaginative visualization of the process that puts in on another level. Jim Carrey pours his heart into this very difficult disjointed performance. It's very effecting and probably one of his best non-impersonation performance. In its core, it's a beautiful love story. It's funny. It's poignant.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Absolutely wonderful,"When I first saw Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, I wasn't expecting to love it, let alone like it. What a surprise when I saw it! I think this film is wonderful in every aspect, truly beautiful and packs a full emotional punch. In fact, if you don't mind me saying so, it is one of my favourite films of the 2000s.I especially loved how Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was shot. The whole film looks beautiful, not only with the cinematography which is indeed spellbinding but also in the scenery which was nothing short of amazing. Another impressive asset was the soundtrack/score. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind doesn't have the best soundtrack/score I have ever heard in my life, but the score makes the film all the more moving, while the soundtrack is well selected and appropriate.I was also very taken with the story. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind has one beautifully constructed story I can tell you, with an almost poignant message about it. It is strange and bizarre yes, but neither of those are bad, quite the contrary. Then there is the script which is both poignant and funny, not to mention very deep. The pacing very rarely feels boring if at all, and the direction is adept.I have very little to complain about Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind's performances either. As good as the supporting performances are especially from the always splendid Tom Wilkinson, I have to give the real kudos to the leads. Jim Carrey has done some good performances in some good films, The Mask, Liar Liar, The Cable Guy and Bruce Almighty showcase his comedy talents wonderfully, but this and The Truman Show show he is perfectly good at drama too. He is very understated here, but it works as he still manages to be likable all the same. The real star though is Kate Winslet. A beautiful and captivating actress, Winslet is absolutely perfect in her role.Overall, wonderful film. Bizarre yes, but very tender and poignant helped by the exceptional performances and cinematography. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
It's OK (very OK),"Very nicely crafted science fiction love story. More of an experience than a film.What? Sci Fi? Well yes. A simple science fiction device, memory erasure, is the vehicle for this beautifully shot, brilliantly edited and directed love fable. The fact that this is a good film does not disqualify it from the sci fi genre. In fact, would-be sci fi writers and film-makers should take note of this.But Eternal Sunshine is a love story first and last, in all respects. The characters are what John Irving would call ""L.A. dysfunctional"", although they don't live in L.A. Carrey and Winslet are deeply insecure people with little going for them but good looks (which they try to disguise), fairly sweet dispositions, and a desire for companionship. They meet on Valentine's Day in Montauk, where they have both seemingly traveled 'on a lark', and the entire experience of the film seems to derail from this point forward. Chronological, linear story-telling becomes impossible because the characters are having their memories erased in order to assuage the pain of their separation. No spoilers, so let me stop right there.If I have made Eternal Sunshine seem like it might be too much of a challenge or too disturbing for an evening's light entertainment, be not afraid. Certainly there are occasional disturbing elements, and the characters themselves are all neurotic enough to have walked off the street and onto the screen. But the film is so artistically rendered, and so well thought-out that what could have been a nightmare really becomes a fantastic post-modern love fable. It's also one of those great films that becomes predictable after a while, but is so delightfully portrayed and satisfying that it does not matter.The acting is exceptionally good. I would expect nothing else from this cast. Winslet is especially remarkable for her ability to play a young North East American better than most American actresses could. How this genius has been passed up in each of her 4 Oscar nominations to date is inexplicable. Carrey's talent is undeniable, though I dislike many of the films he chooses to take on. His performance here is easily as good as his award-worthy performances in the Truman Show, Bruce Almighty, and Man on the Moon.We spend a lot of time inside people's heads in this film, yet the camera never becomes a member of the cast as it does in films like ""Being John Malkovich"". I can pay no higher compliment to the production team. This is a very difficult thing to accomplish, and it is done with flawless simplicity in Eternal Sunshine. This film has just joined Shakespeare in Love, Wild at Heart, and Brokeback Mountain among my favorite all-time love stories. This is the first Michel Gondry film I have seen. I am going to make sure it is not the last.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Best Film of 2004,"Joel (Jim Carrey) is a rather milquetoast man who meets up with free spirit Clementine (Kate Winslet), and they become romantically involved. However, they endure a messy breakup and Clementine goes to a business called Lacuna, Inc., where she has all of her memories of Joel erased. Not wanting to be left out, Joel also goes to have his memory erased. However, soon after it begins, Joel realizes that he wants to keep the memory of Clementine, so he tries to reverse the process.Well, if you're familiar with Kaufman's work, then you know what your getting yourself into. This is just as weird if not weirder than his previous work, Being John Malkovich. I knew what I was getting myself into, but 90% of the movie I was saying to myself ""What the hell is going on?"", but in a good way. It opens with Joel calling in sick for work and going on a different train, heading for Montauk. He meets Clementine and they hit it off. Now this is about 15 minutes into the movie, then out of nowhere come the opening credit sequence. I will admit, I thought it would be different, but I'm glad that it is the way it is, the movie is 80% of the time in Joel's head.If you think you know Carrey, think again. This movie is his best performance, better than Majestic, Truman show and all of his comedic roles (which is what I love him for). Just looking at his face from the second we see him, we feel his pain, then like that, we feel his joy, embarrassment and hate. Just awesome acting on his part, and Winslet was great as the free spirit who never seems satisfied. The supporting cast all work well in their small, yet important roles. Oscar nominations for Winslet and (crosses fingers) Carrey.But if I were to bet any money on any Oscar nominations it would obviously be the writing, what a mess, but beautifully constructed. You think to yourself, is that scene really necessary? Then ten minutes later you think to yourself how brilliant it was, that's beautiful, crazy, give me whatever he's smoking kind of writing. Charlie Kaufman's writing is always clever, but this time he's one-upped himself by making something simultaneously bizarre and emotionally engaging. It seemed like his earlier movies were clever for the sake of cleverness, but 'Eternal Sunshine' manages to dazzle you with it's originality and it's poignancy. The fact that this movie was able to wrap such profound loss, emotional tenderness, and hope in such a self-consciously stylized package illustrates the incredible talent of the people behind it.Michel Gondry's use of vibrant coloring and quick camera movement give the film a very involving first hand feeling. The constant use of the handy cam is very all involving for the viewer, and I suppose that this is exactly what is needed in such a personal movie. His work on the dream sequences is incredible as well. He decides to use more practical effects than what we see today with computers.Eternal Sunshine is a tragic, yet beautiful film that sits at the top of my list of ""Best of 2004"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
A deep and personal marvel!,"this is my favorite movie of 2004 and definitely one of the top in my all-time favorite lists!Eternal touched a certain part of you, your heart that most shows never did. or rather could never did. it shows the fragility of a relationship. people want to erase bad memories of a failed relationship yet at the same time, cant bear to part with the good ones! how so can that be done? how can you erase bad memories and saved good ones only? Carrey and Winslet did a perfect job acting as Joel and Clementine respectively. Arguably one of their career best so far. its a pleasant surprise to see the man behind ""The Mask"" playing such a quiet and introvert role. Kate, on the other hand, brought Clementine to new heights as the bubbly and brutally honest lass who you love and hate.Eternal is a definite marvel, a feat in itself. its rich and flamboyant yet fragile. it brings the audience to such a personal level it hurts. especially when both cant seem to escape from the erasure.well-done!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
unpleasant characters in dissonance with exceptional plot,"I think this film is respectable for many different things, but is also very grating in others. The concept of this movie, and the story it tells, are incredibly moving. However, the characters are incredibly not. Now this may be the point, to have the characters be so profoundly unlikeable, but just because it was intentional doesn't make it good. The male lead is unimpressive, soft, infantilized, boring, and indecisive. The female lead; unhinged, impulsive, with the viewer able to make a founded amateur diagnosis of some kind of bipolar disorder or sociopathy.Either way, their natural opposition and terrible chemistry have you actively rooting against their relationship for the sake of the wellbeing of the characters, while the point of the ""romance"" story is to force them together beyond all odds. This leaves the whole film in an unpleasant dissonance.This movie has incredible potential, and I would love to see it remade, with a better emphasis on depth of character, rather than a superficial demonstration of ""opposites attract"".",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Review.,"I think it goes without saying amongst fellow film aficionados, that we all love films, especially the great ones. However over the years watching films I've noticed there seems to be that one film that is hugely popular, but when you sit down to watch it, you can't understand why it's held in such high regard. For me it's only happened a couple of times, but I unfortunately have to add Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind to the list.Whilst I appreciated the original screenplay from Charlie Kaufman(whose work I usually love), it felt completely flat. I was never engaged at any moment in the film, the characters were extremely unlikable and had horrible personalities. Other then one emotional scene towards the end with Kirsten Dunst's character, the film felt dull and lifeless. At no point did I feel invested in the story. I was unable to buy into Joel(Jim Carrey) and Clementine's(Kate Winslet) impromptu relationship, which dissolved just as quickly as it began, giving me no time with their characters to care about their eventual fate.Both Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet give excellent performances, as do the entire cast. I just disliked their characters. The technical aspects of the film were well done. The way the film showcases memories, and the way they subsequently disappeared/folded into each other was expertly crafted and brilliantly edited. The only issue is the story and the characters didn't work for me. No matter how good the direction and editing is, the majority of the the time a film lives or dies by the strength of it's story and it's characters, and here it ultimately failed.",4.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Weird and wonderful.,"Joel and Clementine have reached breaking point in their relationship, every action, every word triggers the other, so much so, that they each undergo a procedure to remove all trave of the other.How wonderful a thought, being able to remove all trace of an ex, better still having them remove all trace of you.It has taken me years to get this film, years, I simply didn't get it, I'd tried several times over the years, it just never clicked, until now. If you're frustrated by the first twenty minutes, I urge you to give it another try.We've all been there, hurt by a relationship, pushed to the point of despair, how wonderful it would be to remove all trace, it's a wonderful concept, but real life doesn't allow for that, however in film, anything is possible.Wonderfully nightmarish, but sweet and tender at times too, the moments of hate and loathing are eclipsed by Joel and Clem's tender scenes.The only thing I can think of that had similar vibes, was Total Recall, dissimilar in most aspects, but that whole memory manipulation theme is similar.I have forever been a fan of Jim Carrey, and I would regard this as one of his best performances, he's terrific, as is Kate Winslet, the pair combined so well.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Not as good as I remembered.,"When Joel (Jim Carrey) discovers that his ex-girlfriend Clementine (Kate Winslet) has undergone a procedure to erase him from her memory, he decides to have the same treatment to rid himself of all thoughts of her. As he is having his brain tinkered with by some seemingly incompetent techy geeks, Joel realises that he has made a mistake and wants to keep his memories meaning that he must somehow hide inside his head.I'm pretty sure I enjoyed Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind back when it first hit DVD. Not so, this time around. While I didn't exactly hate the film on my second long-overdue viewing, I now feel that it is vastly overrated: it's reasonably fun for a while, but the scenes that occur inside Joel's mind as he is having his memories erased go on for way too long, comprising the majority of the movie.Round and round we go, watching the same thing over and over again, with a few cleverly integrated special effects to make us go 'Ooooo'. Carrey and Winslet put in passable central performances, Carrey reining in the gurning as best he can, and Winslet looking and acting suitably quirky, but when all is said and done, there simply isn't enough of a plot to drive a 108-minute movie.5.5/10, not rounded up to 6 for that terrible scene where Carrey plays his four-year-old self.",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

The reality is that even if one can erase memories, we can't curtail the ""butterfly effect ""of our actions. We have trod the earth and the small or large changes we inspire, create something new. Now project love and romance, and, given time, let it percolate. You have Jim Carry and Kate Winslet being ""forced"" back together because despite their minds, they never left. And if the memories were inconsequential in the larger picture, their remnants will continue to influence. Pretty thought provoking.

Eternal waste of your valuable time (2004),"I did not have a good time with this one. Watched it with my family and we all thought at the middle of the movie everything had to be a joke, but sadly it wasn't. I am surprised at how great critiques this movie has had. I watched it only because I saw it in a Top.40 movie list on the internet, aside from that, I never heard about this movie in my life.

Shame it wasn't that well written!,"I usually like this kind of film - anything that looks at why we do the things we do, takes a character or two lovers on a winding and beautiful road through all kinds of confusion until they finally get hold of themselves again.The premise is obvious enough but with plenty of scope to tell a good story. Unfortunately it just isn't told well enough. The thing with any story like this is that you really have to invest yourself in the protagonists for it to work. Otherwise it just becomes academic, an interesting question but one where you're not too bothered about the answer. There's a problem with performances and material. Carrey plays a roughly similar role to Truman in the Truman Show, but with so little nuance in the script and evidently something lacking in the direction, he doesn't manage nearly the depth of that character, and none of the humour. Much the same applies to Winslett, who just doesn't seem to have any material to work with.As I say, it's a shame, because there's a great cast here and a good idea - it would have worked if they'd spent a few months more working on the script. As it is, despite this being exactly my kind of film, I'm surprised by the overridingly positive response here.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

"A fantastic, in-depth and though provoking film. One of the best romantic movies of the last decade.","Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind is a love story about two lovers who undergo a procedure to erase each other from one another's memories, but when they meet after their memory is gone, there is something strange still drawing them together and it is also during that memory wipe that they realize how precious their relationship really was.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is one of those films where you have to pay close attention to the scenes and dialog because even the smallest bit of dialog is important in this film. Because otherwise you will be confused in your initial viewing and will soon be asking yourself what in the world is going on. This film requires close attention in the initial viewing or multiple viewings in order to fully understand it and appreciate it for what it truly is.The film is not your basic love story, it is unique and sort of bizarre at the same time, and while it is not a suspense movie, it is filled with several shocking moments and twists, which will only increase your interest in the movie and the more you will be intrigued by it. The narrative part of the love story is also told in a reverse chronological order, which starts from the moment the lovers broke up and ends when they first met. While the present scenes are told in a normal order, the film constantantly switches back and forth between the two which may create some confusion, another one of the reasons that this film requires close attention, at first you will probably be confused about what you are seeing is the present or the past, but as the film will progress you will be able to tell them apart. The way the Narrative is similar to Mememto which also followed a reverse chronological order of storytelling. The storytelling is clever and interesting and only makes the film better and it's twists more shocking and intriguing.Acting wise, Jim Carrey is in Truman Show mode, or probably the most serious he has ever been in a film, this is probably the most serious role he has ever done, and he shines in his role as Joel Barish and is completely into his character. Kate Winslet also performs excellently well, and her character development in both the dream sequence and the present sequence is done extremely well. The supporting cast did not get that much screen time but they are performed their roles well, Kirsten Durst and Mark Ruffalo are good but the scenes between them in the apartment are kind of drawn out and I could have done without a few of them, but Elijah Wood is really great in his role as Patrick and scenes between him and Clementine are also interesting.The ending is also great because it leaves it completely up to the viewer to interpret what will happen next and the events that led up to the ending were also very interesting and intriguing. The soundtrack is also great and suits most of the scenes it is being played in, the opening and closing credits song is also fantastic and also wonderfully portrays the relationship between Clementine and Joel. The ice setting was not something i was fond of before watching the film but it is handled extremely well here, with the scene of Clementine and Joel laying on ice being one of the most touching and memorable moments of this film.Overall, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, is a touching, in-depth and intriguing love story with such great plot, settings, performances and memorable moments that I can watch this film over and over again and never get bored. However you may need to watch this film multiple times to fully understand it's plot and the message it is trying to convey and appreciate it for what it truly is.Rating: 9.5/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

I wanted to like this movie but just couldn't.,"Despite my desire to enjoy what I hoped would be a unique film, I found it dark and self indulgent.  The superb acting couldn't overcome a script that is centered on a failed relationship that never makes sense to the viewer or to the lovers.  In the end you feel like this is ""Adaptation II"" - yet another film about a brooding self-centered guy who can't really relate to anyone beyond his own fantasy life.  The dramatic device ultimately used in the film of having the main character fight to preserve his memory fails because it comes across as a clever but unsatisfying rendition of psychotherapy.  The subplot is banal and adolescent.  In many ways this entire film comes across as something that was done back in the 60's, but which now falls flat.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

worthit to watch-,"Pretty nice and decent movie. I really liked it in 2nd act. Feeling of losing memories you spent with someone you wanted to live for your whole life is an extremely scary concept. You get reminded of things you never said, you never felt but when you hear it, it feels you've dived right into the state of De ja vu. I really liked how the movie explored the psychological side of Joel and how heartbreaking it was when he was trying his best to don't look clamen from her memories. It was pretty sad and shattering. This movie might not be everyone's cup of tea but it sends a beautiful message in the end that you should watch the movie to understand.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Eternal Sunshine's Elusiveness is Not Limited to its Look!,"Eternal Sunshine loses its way on occasion, particularly in the sequences where Joel reverts first to childhood and then to infancy in his effort to find a place in his memory where he can hide Clementine. In both scenes the figure we are watching onscreen ceases to be Joel Barrish and becomes immediately recognizable as Jim Carrey. The mugging and mewling Carrey brings to these scenes might be funny in another context, but they relate to nothing else in the tone or content of the film. One almost wonders whether there's a rider in Carrey's contract insisting, ""Star retains the right to do something rubbery with his face at least once during project."" It's a pity, too, because otherwise Carrey is refreshingly un-Carrey here, responding passively to the acute hyperactivity with which Winslet imbues Clementine.And while it's impossible not to think of Eternal Sunshine as Kaufman's film (fair or not), Gondry directs it with wisdom and nuance. Movies often portray memories and dream states with a hyperreal vividness, made up of garish colors (or stark black and white), absurdist landscapes, and, yes, sometimes even dwarves. Gondry takes the opposite course, filming Eternal Sunshine with an aggressive lack of style, or at least of stylization. Scenes are dimly lit and hazily filmed (cinematographer Ellen Kuras filled many of the sets with smoke before shooting), lending the movie an almost documentary feel. Even when special effects are called for--when a fence must evaporate or a character disappear from a fading memory--Gondry underplays them as much as possible. The result is a cinematic vagueness that makes the film less aesthetic yet more persuasive. This is how dreams really look: like reality, only less so.But Eternal Sunshine's elusiveness is not limited to its look. One of the least remarked upon achievements of the film may also be its most cunning: just how unmemorable Joel and Clementine's relationship is. Its general contours are clear enough--Clementine always pushing and testing, Joel always retreating and nursing grievances--but its details are easily forgotten. The dialogue is unremarkable (Clementine explains how when she was little she thought she was ugly, and Joel tells her she's pretty), and the conflicts somewhat generic (she thinks she's ready to be a mother, he doesn't). ""There's something weirdly ephemeral about Eternal Sunshine,"" Brian Johnson of Maclean's wrote following the film's theatrical release. ""Just two days after seeing it, my own memory of the film has almost completely evaporated, like a dream. Which is not to say that the movie is forgettable--I'm still clinging to the strange but familiar emotions it raised, and am curious to see it again to see just where they came from."" Johnson was on to something: The film provokes an intense, yet oddly unspecific emotional response. Like a memory that has been not-quite-successfully erased. Or maybe a smell.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
The big falling-in-love sensation,"What is the message of the movie:WAIT WAIT WAIT!First I want to apologize for the length of my review.I couldn't do it with fewer words. Explaining the difference between true love and a falling-in-love sensation is not doable in fewer words, not for me at least. Please read it anyway, you won't regret it and hopefully, help in the future when you are in a similar situation, like in a break-up that hurts you. The pain of a broken heart is one of the most painful things a person can go through. No group of people has a higher suicide rate than people in pain because they have been rejected by a person they love.I start with a question:
Did you know, that every relationship goes through different stages? Sure you do.First I must explain that there are in general 2 different main groups of love:1.) Ego-based love.2.) True love.EGO BASED LOVE:
it is always happening when we are freshly falling in love, like head over heels. It is always the 1st stage of a love relationship, and it will end sooner or later. Always. Though we don't know much about our new partner, we feel extremely attracted to them and want them to feel the same for you. We want to impress them as much as possible. We go to the hair stylist, try to achieve weight loss to look better, try making the funniest jokes, and whatnot. You want to impress them with anything you do. Do you fight for your partner's interests? Well of course you do. But the most important thing is, that your partner knows YOU are doing it. Because it is only about impressing your partner about you. In the end, you are doing it for yourself, for your ego, that your new partner is impressed with you, what a cool person you are..... This is completely different when it comes to real love:REAL LOVE:
it doesn't matter if they know that it was you who did it. The only thing that matters is that your loved one will receive help, an advantage, or something that benefits them. Very similar to what loving parents would do for their children. Loving parents would do anything that helps or benefits their children, and it doesn't matter if their children know it has been you. (as a father or mother). Exactly that is true love. On a non-relationship level of course.NOW HERE IS THE THING: When the big ego-based ""falling in love"" sensation ends, we suddenly don't feel the need to impress our partner anymore, because trust has built up. Besides, we suddenly realize the imperfections of our partner. It's needless to say, NO partner is perfect. Everyone has imperfections. It is just the ""blindness"" that has gone. But that doesn't mean that it's over. It's just the 1st stage that ended. The stupid stage of ego-based love that feels so good. Now you have the choice to stay together, or not. You have the choice of accepting the imperfections of your partner or not. And if you hold on to your partner, if you both accept the imperfections of your partner, chances increase massively, that you have found TRUE LOVE. Trust me on that one. It also depends on their ego. If it is an ego-focused person, chances for a break-up are bigger. In that case, it never has been love in the first place. It was some ego thing.This is exactly what this movie is about in its core message. Before the breakup, it was the 1st stage, ego-based, and it came to an end. But when they reunited, it was because they both recognized there was more. That they don't have to impress each other and still feel great when spending time together. That the imperfections are not strong enough
to break the bond between them. That there was more than that ego-love thing, from the beginning. True love is the greatest gift one can get from life. This is the core message of the Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind movie. A movie that touched the souls of so many people - for a reason, because it gets to the core and it is NOT a science fiction movie besides these strange machines deleting memories. Are science fiction. But the love thing is as truthful as it gets. It is not true that love can't be explained. Love can be explained to a certain agree. And you just learned something about it.

Like giving cotton candy to a starving person,"This isn't really a movie review. It's more a reaction. After watching this movie, I feel like running around screaming, ""You're missing the point! You're missing the point!"" Perhaps I'm missing the point. The film gets kudos for being clever and quirky and well-filmed, in a Being John Malkovich kind of way. Clever, quirky, but there's a spiritual barrenness underlying it. Shouldn't art be more than clever? Shouldn't it reach deeper? Limericks are clever  we don't call them art. The underlying message in Eternal Sunshine isn't all that original. I am tired of seeing movies about love and loneliness. How many movies have we all seen whose basic point is that if you just reach out, take a chance, find romance, this will fend off the ravening wolves of loneliness at the door of modern life?In a culture that desperately needs a sense of community and connection, peddling movies and songs about romance is like giving cotton candy to a starving person.It isn't what we need! Finding romance is not the way to fend off loneliness and alienation, a change in the culture is. If we all felt connected to something that mattered, to other living things, to communities we cared about, romances wouldn't be the be-all and end-all of meaningful existence, it would be just one among many of life's joys.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

"A dark and thoughtful film about why people stay in toxic relationships disguised as a positive, romantic film about love","Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind understands what relationships are like in a way that is uncanny. While masquerading as a happy movie about a loving couple, Eternal Sunshine shows the darkest and most harmful parts of relationships.The film is about Joel (Jim Carrey) a guy in his thirties who has dated a quirky woman named Clementine (Kate Winslet). Their relationship is difficult and marred with unhappiness. When Clementine stops talking to him inexplicably, he finds that she has had an operation that erased all her memories of their relationship. Joel is distraught and gets the same operation. The film then becomes a narrative within Joel's head as he relives all of his memories with Clementine as they are erased.The narrative is experimental, completely fragmented with some scenes that are bizarre within Joel's head. This leads to some unique, memorable, and just plain weird moments. This uniqueness gives the film its identity and the lack of linearity in the dreams both leaves the viewer the fun job of piecing together a narrative on his own while also giving the filmmakers license to contrast memories directly against each other, even when they are from different time periods.Our characters are very quirky and not entirely likable at first. Joel is reserved and awkward, a combination that initially turned me off to his character. Clementine, on the other hand, is very expressive and emotional- perhaps to a fault. it isn't until you see the best moments these people shared together when you begin to like them. Both the characters and the film itself feel very genuine when we see their happy moments.What is the ultimate point of Eternal Sunshine? (SPOILERS follow) What does it have to say? In the end, Joel and Clementine stay together. They know all of the horrible things that they will do to each other and they stay together anyway. The audience is happy that they stay together.Why do they stay together? An optimist would say that it is because they are meant to be. It seems unlikely that two people would happen to fall in love again if they had no memory of their history. Maybe some people are just soulmates and they will always find each other. In fact, the same phenomenon occurs to the Kirsten Dunst character when her memories are erased- she finds the same man and falls in love with him again.The more pessimistic answer, and in my opinion the real answer to the question is that people tend to ignore obvious red flags when starting a relationship they are excited about. The two leads share one day together, having fun as ""strangers"" before they are given documents telling them about their past relationship. Joel and Clementine have hard physical evidence that proves they are incompatible. Their original relationship became unhappy and borderline abusive, and the two of them have documents that detail exactly how much they come to hate each other. This is the biggest red flag that a person could ever receive: hard proof that the relationship won't work. Still, the two of them are excited about their budding relationship and their first day together, so they ignore this giant red flag and date anyway. They don't look at the documents and see how they can better their relationship, they just blindly get back together, doomed to fall into the same traps they did before, because it is the easy choice and the exciting choice. The movie ends on an optimistic note, but a viewer has to wonder about the dark implications of this and the ignorance that it takes for them to stay together.When Joel is going through the memories of his relationship, there is an overwhelming feeling both in him and in the audience that he should stay with Clementine because the two of them have such good memories together. In essence: it doesn't matter that the relationship has grown into something horrible and toxic, they should stay together because they used to be happy and they need to hold on to those happy memories. Any person who has seen a relationship through knows this feeling as the end nears. This movie makes the audience actively cheer for that outcome. It's not until you think back on the movie's message that you realize how delusional this idea is.The main points the film is making are common justifications that people have to stay in broken relationships: it's easy to ignore red flags, no matter how large, and it's hard to break up with someone you have good memories with. It's eerie how easy it is for the audience to cheer for these irrational justifications, and it tells us something about ourselves.In all, Eternal Sunshine is a romantic film that really knows what long-term relationships and toxic relationships are like. The more engaged viewer will leave with an interesting message about the darkness of relationships. I strongly recommend the movie as a study of the irrational behavior people have when in relationships.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Idealistic yet realistic definition of love,"I often find myself knowingly going back to toxic relationships regardless of it being romantic, etc. After a high, a low may follow and it absolutely crushes me to know that I will go back to them regardless. Sometimes, I wonder what it would be like to leave them completely. But that only lasts a second and I know that I am going back to them because when it is good, it is extremely good I want nothing else until the day I die than to spend time with them.This reminds me of the girl I used to like; the day I met her ex, I realised I did not even deserve to like this girl anymore. I saw how much they were missing each other, yet not making a single move because they knew they would be toxic to each other. Knowing that, I knew that I could never make this girl happy the way her ex did. Good times are good, it's just that it sucks they are followed by some awful times at times.Love is such a weird feeling, though I doubt that I have ever experienced it.

If the filmmakers had adopted a more simplistic approach, this would probably be one of my favourites in this genre.The problem isn't so much the story but the style adopted. I wasn't too keen on the construction, the way the film is constantly toing and froing between scenes, scenarios and characters. I almost felt like the filmmakers were trying to be too smart and would have preferred it if the story would have been told simply.That said, Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are highly convincing as couple Joel and Clementine. Their relationship and chemistry on screen is probably why this film is popular with so many people.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
The Size of the Brick,"What an exciting time to be alive! We can actually go to our corner theater and participate in the invention of a new medium. Fundamental elements of the vocabulary are still being explored and invented.I knew that I was witnessing something important halfway through. Superficially this is another Kaufman exercise in self-reference. Those are always interesting, he knows how to fold the story with methods of telling the story plus a third story about those methods. There's some of that here, but it is shoehorned into the 'big idea' that wasn't his in the first place. So although you have one of the most powerful folding actors ever (Winslet), the real advance here is in another area.Hundreds of films have tried to portray dreams and visions, folding them into 'reality.' Some are blunt ('What Dreams may Come'), others frantic ('Pi') and puzzling('Mulholland Dr'). No one has yet managed the arbitrary slipperiness of visions as successfully as Tarkovsky in 'Nostalgia.'Part of Tarkovsky's genius is in making ordinary objects exotic by bending the context. But he does his work in large chunks.Any filmmaker, the real ones, make an early decision about the materials of their creation, just as an architect does. In architecture, you can choose to make the structure out of bricks. These things actually hold the building up. Then you have to design the brick. What's the right size?Tarkovsky used large bricks, so we could read them from a distance. Rodriguez , for instance, in his second act of 'Once Upon a Time in Mexico,' used what looks like small bricks, but they are just for show: they carry no narrative.What we have here are small bricks, small minivignettes that come at blinding speed from all tenses and actually hold up the narrative. You need an intelligent actor to help carry this off and in this case we have the redoubtable Kate who is one of our most intelligent masters of this sort of architectural material. After all, her very first film ('heavenly Creatures') was about this same matter: how small a fantasy or memory could be and still create reality.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Jim Carrey goes sentimental,"I've long been hearing people raving about how refreshing The Eternal Sunshine of A Spotless Mind is, and how unjustifiable it is that Jim Carrey didn't receive a Oscar nom for his outstanding performance in it, so I was really excited to check this one out (after all these years!!!). And I have to say the hype is well deserved.
The Eternal Sunshine of A Spotless Mind centers around an estranged couple's decisions to erase their respective memories of each other. this movie has a very unique/surreal approach of arranging sequences, with the bulk of the plot unraveling in a dreamlike state, which is a considerable divergence away from Jim Carrey's previous slapstick efforts. We see him reflecting on his memories of Clementine (Kate Winslet) in an almost melancholy undertone. He proved yet again, after his stellar performance in The Truman Show, his acting talents, as well as The Academy's biases against comedians.
That being said, this movie is far from perfection. For me the subplot of Kristen Dunst and Tom Wilkinson could be further explored, as it accords with the theme of this movie. And the placement of the opening sequence may be a tad questionable. But who cares? at the end of the day The Eternal Sunshine of A Spotless Mind is without a doubt one of Jim Carrey's finest works and will be remembered and revered for years to come.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

No mental giant, he would have succumbed immediately. End of movie. But no! We replay this deja vu game of meeting forgotten lovers into infinity, while every character gets thrown into stylistic outer space: Comedy for some, tragedy for others, sex farce when Mr. Kaufman runs out of ideas. Actually, apart from Sunshine's tangled structure, there are no ideas. Not once are we given useful, relevant information about anyone who inhabits the film. Carrey and Winslet's megawatt dual-presence is wasted inside of a situation that resembles a hamster cage, not a story. Only Tom Wilkinson, as the memory-deleting helmet inventor, seems to grasp the danger of what's happening. Kaufman, however, surrounds him with a gang of assistants who are giggling morons.

"Trippy, strange, but also very emotional and moving.  This movie is perfectly balanced.","Jim Carrey is known for his roles in screwball comedies, and it seemed as there was no way to get an actual clean break off from his normal goofy persona. It may have seemed that way, but this movie proves otherwise. What we have here is a mature film, with some funny moments, but instead of a stupid Carrey performance, we have a deep and moving performance, in a very strange and original, but nonetheless deep and moving picture.Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) leads a fairly mundane and boring life until he meets Clementine (Kate Winslet). He and Clementine click right away despite their contrasting personalities. One day when visiting her and work, Joel finds she has no recollection of him, and discovers she had her memory erased of him from a clinic. Because of his depression over her, Joel decides to do the same thing. During the procedure, Joel realizes he wants to remember her, and must take her to places in his memory where she can't be erased. Meanwhile, during the operation at Joel's apartment, we meet the doctors working on him. Stan (Mark Ruffalo) and Patrick (Elijah Wood) are the somewhat incompetent doctors, as they care about their own needs more than that of Joel, and Stan ends up inviting over Mary (Kirstin Dunst), the receptionist at their place of work. Joel jumps from memory to memory causing confusion by the younger doctors and a call to older Doctor Howard (Tom WIlkinsin) and secrets about the people performing the operations come out.For a movie that takes place mainly inside one guy's mind, this manages to be a very emotional film. Joel is a really likable character, and his progression throughout the film and in his memories is quite interesting. Kate Winslet plays a good opposite to Joel's introverted ways, and her performance as Clementine, and as merely a memory concocted by Joel is also excellent. All the performances are great, and what makes them great, is despite some stupidity even in the doctors, they're still portrayed as people, not just morons. They are just as deep as our protagonist, and have just as much baggage on the brain.The direction is phenomenal. The jump from memory to memory and the erasing of the memories gives us a huge feel of what Joel has gone through and takes us through all kind of interesting settings. In contrast, we have Joel's apartment where our co-plot is going on with the doctors, and the apartment in so many scenes gives a feeling of intimacy with the surroundings. The memories Joel has are so well done and even eerie at times, but also very sad and lonely when need be. Director Michael Gondry and screenwriter Charlie Kaufman really molded some brilliant contrasts, and some lovely and thought provoking characters.Overall, this really is destined to be a classic, or if not that a highly regarded cult classic. It's an emotional, beautiful movie, with Jim Carrey showing that he deserves more roles in dramas after pulling this off. Nothing's ever been quite like this, and chances are, nothing will again.My rating: **** out of ****. 108 mins. R for language and sexuality.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"""Some things you just can't forget... until now""","I watched this a long while ago and never wrote down what I thought about it, but it holds a special place in my heart. The type of movies that make you believe in love. It's so unique and original, and even though I rated it I think it's one were you either love it or hate it. Imagine a world where you could forget all your traumatic experiences; someone shatters your heart into pieces so you just erase them completely, move past it. You never have to heal. But what if the person who hurt you also happens to be the love of your life? Joel erases Clementine from his memory and realizes this, he fights his fading memories because even though he was hurt, he still loved. It's a beautiful because it's a representation of human emotion on screen, and that's complex, it makes the movie more than just about love. The dialogues also amazing, as his memories fade he decides to stop fighting it and instead enjoy all the mements with her he's reliving for the last time and I feel like there's something to be learned from that because he had something special, it hurt him in the end but that's no reason to forget about it. It was once beautiful so just because it ended in pain doesn't mean it's not worth remembering. It's as emotionally draining as it is beautiful. It's a movie where sci-fi meets romance, giving stunning visuals a beatiful story to tell(It might not seem so stunning to look at now considering things like cgi are more advanced now but in 2004). And because we live through Joel's memories and the timelines nonlinear it all feels like a personal dream, and to exhibit something so chimerical and personal onto the screen is stunning art to me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Realization...,"ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND is an exceptionally well-made, romantic science fiction film. It will definitely resonate with anyone who has ever gone through a breakup, especially if you're the one who was ""left behind"" while your former partner simply ""moved on"".Kate Winslet plays Clementine, who has had enough of her relationship with Joel (Jim Carrey). For his part, Joel hasn't gotten over her, and when he inadvertently discovers that Clementine has somehow had him erased from her mind, he decides to do the same.Enter Dr. Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson), and his seemingly ragtag team of tech experts (Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood, and Kiersten Dunst). These are the wizards whom Joel seeks out to remedy his situation by wiping out his painful memories of Clementine.What could possibly go wrong?As said before, this film will appeal greatly to anyone who has ever experienced the end of a relationship before they were ready to ""let it go"". Those not familiar with this sort of suffering will still enjoy it, but may not be hit quite as hard or as deeply.Carrey really gets this across, bringing a sadness to his character that is genuine and palpable. Anyone who still sees him as primarily a slapstick ""clown"" needs to see him here.Ms. Winslet's Clementine is carefree and vivacious. There's a whimsical yet poignant quality to her performance. Both of these actors pour themselves into their roles.Highly recommended for those who need a good laugh or cry, sometimes simultaneously...",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
A Love Story As Only Charlie Kaufman in a Phildickian Mood Could Tell It,"Yes, I realize that any review that isn't an unabashed love letter to this film is likely to get a ""No"" vote! :-) I hope you'll note that although I didn't love this film, I didn't hate it, either. Charlie Kaufman's script deserved its Oscar, the acting is top-notch, the emotions rang true, and the DVD's got loads of goodies -- it was the direction that I felt dragged the film down.If Philip K. Dick had written a romantic comedy, the result might have turned out like ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND. In this seriocomic SF love story, Jim Carrey proves again that he's not just another mugging face, and Charlie Kaufman proves that he's the master of surreal dramedy. Director Michel Gondry, however, proves that Spike Jonze is really the most suitable director for Kaufman's particular brand of daffiness.Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are stunningly believable as dysfunctional couple Joel Barish and Clementine Kruczynski. Clem initially seems like a sexy free spirit with a roguish streak, but as their romance continues, Joel sees the dark side of Clem's impulsive nature: on her bad days, hard-drinking Clem is needy and temperamental. What's worse, she sees Joel's relentlessly low-key, emotionally walled-off nature as a rebuke to her recklessness. Mutual misery ensues.No wonder Clem finally consults Lacuna, a Manhattan company run by avuncular Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) that erases your memories of a bad relationship. Lacuna even sends postcards to clients' intimates telling them not to mention the erased ex again, as Joel discovers when he sees one in their mutual friend's mail. Heartbroken, he also opts for the Lacuna treatment. While the erasing process takes him through memories of life with Clem, we discover that, when Joel wasn't being passive and Clem wasn't drunkenly cracking up Joel's car at 3 AM, the couple also enjoyed many good times together. Joel's reluctant to forget these happy moments, and that's where the film gets phantasmagorical as reality, fantasy, and memory collide. Within the maze of Joel's mind, he and Clem (who's been panicking and feeling like she's ""disappearing"" as she's slowly wiped from Joel's brain, despite having already forgotten him) team up and try to hide in all kinds of memories she has no part of. The funniest of these is the scene in Joel's childhood home, as a shrunken-to-child-size Joel faces Clem as his mom's miniskirt-clad, go-go-booted neighbor.The details of Lacuna's workings are ...SUNSHINE's most consistently witty, entertaining bits. Lacuna looks like a typical busy doctor's office, with receptionist Mary (Kirsten Dunst at her most winsome and dimply) constantly scheduling appointments: ""Valentine's Day is our busiest time."" Funny yet poignant details abound, such as the teary-eyed client loaded down with her dog's belongings, a crucial part of wiping away memories of a loved one. The actual procedure is performed by young computer techies Stan (Mark Ruffalo) and Patrick (Elijah Wood, leaving Frodo Baggins far behind) who erase the subjects' memories in their homes while they sleep. The techs act like a bunch of fun-loving but irresponsible babysitters, swilling the unsuspecting Joel's whiskey, smoking pot and having sex (with Mary, not each other :-) as he sleeps. But Patrick goes beyond mischievousness into unethicality: usually a strikeout with women, he's begun dating Clementine, having fallen in love with her while erasing her Joel memories. Patrick tries to take the expressway to her heart by wooing her with her discarded Joel mementos. Of course, he doesn't consider that since Joel's relationship with Clem went sour despite all those nice gifties, history just might repeat itself. I was disappointed that there wasn't a bigger payoff to the Patrick subplot; he just kind of disappears from the film as if *he* were erased. Of course, that may well be the point! :-) Director Gondry, who also directed Kaufman's HUMAN NATURE (2001), spends so much time cross-cutting, juggling the movie's timeline, and inexplicably staging certain scenes in darkness with only a flashlight rendering the characters' faces visible that instead of enhancing the storytelling, it's merely distracting. I kept getting the feeling Gondry didn't trust the story itself to keep moviegoers' attention -- ironic, since he shares story credit with Kaufman and artist Pierre Bismuth. Having said that, when the visuals work, they work wonderfully, like when our hero and heroine dash through Grand Central Station while commuters wink out of existence left and right.Refreshingly, the New York locations aren't the usual hip or glamorous places. Joel and Clementine live in Rockville Centre, Long Island, and their apartments look just like homes of college students or artistic types trying to inject Soho style into suburbia. The filmmakers also make splendid use of the stark beauty of Montauk beaches in winter.For Carrey fans seeking slapstick and belly laughs, ...SUNSHINE... may seem to drag on eternally; its humor is more in the rueful TRUMAN SHOW vein, shot through with Kaufman's trademark surrealism. If you want a love story that will make you laugh knowingly and think about the way people approach relationships, ...SUNSHINE... is worth seeing. Hopefully it will convince you that counseling is a better approach to your relationship problems than science-fiction gadgetry!",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"So, you are telling me Romance movies can also be smart?","After the first 15 minutes I thought I was watching a lesser versión of ""Before Sunset"", with sci-fi touches.
I couldn't have been more wrong.
This is a masterpiece on every facet of cinema.
The story is complex, with an original structure and super natural and deep dialogue.
The acting from the protagonists was amazing (hard to believe this was the same actress that made Titanic, and even Jim Carrey disappears on the role, except for two or three moments). Mark Ruffalo and Kristen Dunst weren't that great (in smaller roles) and the rest of the cast was serviceable/good.
The score couldn't possibly be better (well, maybe it could've been, but it was still great).

"An emotional, dream-like movie that never feels excessively soppy with an incredibly subtle performance by Jim Carrey.","When people ask other people what Jim Carrey's best acting performance is, people usually light up and say, ""The Truman Show!"" Although I would say that he gave a good performance in The Truman Show, in my opinion I think that he gives a much better performance in this movie, Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind. Although this opinion definitely isn't everyone's, I think that this is Jim Carrey's best performance because he goes out of his daily routine as an actor that works in comedy and stand-up and usually he acts in his films with the same personality which is undeniably a humorous one. But with Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind, Jim Carrey goes out of his routine and gives us a subtle, grief-causing performance that is entirely the opposite of his usual personality and yet it still feels natural as if it were his usual personality. In this film I saw a lot of serious acting talent shine through him that I had never seen him show before and if you're like me and enjoy seeing actors be in a different, unusual personality that they usually aren't in I think you'll enjoy this too.Another reason why you may enjoy this movie is because of it's dream-like surrealism. There are so many psychological tricks in this film that make the film feel like an incoherent dream such as the disjointed editing, the unnatural situations and the emotionally dreamy soundtrack. Also, you know how when you dream you can be doing something in one room and the next minute be in a completely different building? I thought I was the only one, but here Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind captures this fully in a movie and letting us transform into frankly a hallucinatory drug trip. If you're like me and enjoy the weirdness of dreaming I think you'll enjoy this too.What are you waiting for?

Original but.. BORING,"Kate Winslett is always good. And I love seeing Carrey play ""normally"" for a change. But as with Memento, I find going through the memories boring, could have done without half as much of that. Too bad somehow, the movie could have been so much more compact with some added cutting. I suppose it was meant to be confusing, and it is so at times. For really good acting, I give it a seven, otherwise I would have given a six or a five.. I like many slow-paced movies - like Fargo or Smoke, but with this movie my hand started to move by itself toward the fast forward button of the DVD remote, and that's not good =) I thought long and hard about this, and maybe the worst thing about this movie is, that there simply aren't any deep truths, philosophies or revelations etc. to keep you occupied.. definitely NOT worth the Oscars.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

I found this movie extremely lacking in basically every aspect except the acting. It's campy, and not in a good way. The aesthetic choices can be summarized as ""mid 2000s digital slag"". Nothing about this movie impressed or moved me in any meaningful way. I was simply glad it ended. Like I said, the acting was good, but Jim Carrey was the wrong man for the role.

The Mind-Bending Rom-Com You Never Knew You Needed,"Let's face it; romantic comedies have a formula, a tried-and-tested recipe involving meet-cutes, love triangles, and grand gestures, right? Well, say goodbye to clichés, because Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind throws that recipe book out the window. It's a cinematic voyage through the labyrinthine corridors of love, memory, and the enigmatic human heart. Michel Gondry's masterpiece is like a whimsical snow globe that, once shaken, unleashes a flurry of emotions and musings on the nature of love.The film unravels the bittersweet tale of Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) and Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet), two individuals who, in the aftermath of a failed romance, decide to undergo an experimental procedure to erase each other from their memories. As the procedure unfolds, the narrative takes us on a dreamlike odyssey, not bound by the constraints of time or logic.Eternal Sunshine possesses a unique quirkiness that is both endearing and profound, lying in the exploration of human vulnerability and the complex tapestry of memories. As the memories of Joel and Clementine are systematically erased, the audience is treated to a non-linear journey through their relationship, where past, present, and future blend into a kaleidoscope of emotions.Kate Winslet's Clementine is a fiery masterpiece, vibrant and mercurial, embodying the essence of love's unpredictability. Jim Carrey, famed for his comedic prowess, delivers a poignant and subdued performance as Joel, illustrating the multifaceted nature of love in its melancholic splendor. The supporting cast, including Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood, and Kirsten Dunst, contribute layers of complexity to the narrative. Each character, a technician in the memory-erasing process, is a study in their own emotional complexities and fragilities.Michel Gondry's direction is a masterclass in storytelling, infusing the film with whimsical visuals that blur the lines between dreams and reality. In Gondry's world, memory is a tangible place, both a treasure trove and a minefield. The visual effects, often appearing low-tech yet astonishingly effective, mirror the intricacies of Joel's and Clementine's minds. The fragmented recollections are woven together with delicate subtlety, and Jon Brion's hauntingly melodic score elevates the emotional journey.Eternal Sunshine is not a straightforward romance; it's a poetically surreal exploration of the human soul that will leave you pondering the beauty of the scars that love leaves behind. It dares to ask whether love is worth the inevitable heartache and whether the beauty of a moment is tarnished when that moment is lost. The film tugs at your heartstrings with its portrayal of the beautiful mess that is love of two flawed individuals who are inexplicably drawn to each other, despite the baggage they carry. As we unravel their relationship in reverse order, we realize that love isn't about the destination; it's about the journey. It's about embracing the moments, both beautiful and painful, that make it worthwhile. Even in love's imperfections, there exists an ethereal beauty that transcends space and time. The film's central message, that love persists even in the face of forgetfulness, is as bittersweet as it gets. Even if we could erase the pain, we'd also erase the joy, and sometimes it's better to love and lose than never to have loved at all.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"Emotional roller-coaster, at times very funny and sad, wonderful effects","When a furiously strong love comes to an end how do you cope? Try to forget? What if you could forget the whole relationship? What if you change your mind?This is another one of those movies that start with a SciFi premise but simply aren't SciFi, in this case it's a Romantic Drama. Also yet another Academy Award winning movie (Original Screenplay) with a cast that play out the story magnificently.When Clementine's relationship with Joel ends she decides to have all memory of it removed, a process invented by the Lacuna company. When Joel finds this out he decides that the memories are too painful for him also and elects to have the procedure.Whilst going through the process however, Joel changes his mind (realising he still loves Clementine) and starts fighting the deletions. As his subconscious moves from memory to memory trying to protect what it knows of Clementine the story of their relationship unfolds. Things get more complicated by real worlds events around him though and Lacuna's future also hangs in the balance.Wonderfully written and presented, the only odd note is that any company, like Lacuna, with such a powerful product would be run in such a shoddy fashion. Perhaps it's explained in there somewhere.

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind,"""I wish I stayed too, now I wish I stayed, I wish I'd done a lot of things"".The characterisation in this film is so intricate, particularly Clementine. From her acknowledgment of her flaws, we as the audience are introduced to a completely different perspective to their relationship, we're plunged to reevaluate the image Joel has created of her- much like we have to do in real life. This also places significance of memory as the backbone to one's perspective. Based on this, my favourite memory is by far when Joel and Clementine are entirely under the covers, momentarily hidden away in a compartment of Joel's memory where Clementine, usually so sporadic, is openly vulnerable and Joel can unapologetically love her in his own mind.Their last conversation too, Clementine telling Joel she knows she'll get bored and feel trapped is such an impactful conversation. They both come to realisations, Clementine admitting to and arguably embracing her destructive, nomadic personality and concluding they won't work; Joel on the other hand accepting this, and yet also subconsciously realising he'll always come back to Clementine.In every ""erasing"" the two characters always find and seek one another. Ultimately, they need one another to come to the realisations and changes they do, and so erasing one another for the bliss of erasing the bad, in turn, erases components of themselves they need.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

"Good Performances, Choppy Editing, Points that Don't Make Sense","Having just returned from an advanced screening of this movie, it's hard to find exactly what I want to say about it without giving too much away.Jim Carrey turns in a solid performance, and for the most part one of his most understated and nuanced.  In all, the acting is solid by all concerned. As far as that goes, this is a very good film.On the other hand, I found myself thoroughly confused at various points. There are elements of the story from the beginning that don't make sense at the end.  Again, I don't want to give it all away before people have had a chance to see the movie for themselves, but I will say that the ending is rather contrived and, in the context of the movie, doesn't make particular sense.The plot of the movie is quite good, but the storytelling is choppy and the way it's been edited together gets rather harsh at times.  This probably won't make much sense right now, but I thought that there were points at which the movie was so obviously trying to be obscure that it put me off quite a bit.The cinematography got downright annoying at times.  The whole movie is shot on handheld cameras (I think digital as well), and at times the image bounces around so much that it's hard on the eyes.Perhaps the best way to sum this movie up is simply to say that it had good ideas, but the execution isn't great.  It did get a bit sappy at times, too. Elijah Wood's performance is perhaps the weakest of the film; he comes across as rather whiny and cold.  His character doesn't have a lot of screen time, though, so it's not a major impediment.It's not terrible, but it's not terrific either.  The whole core of the film really comes down to the old platitude that one has to take the good with the bad in relationships and that one shouldn't be willing to give up the good memories of one's life in order to escape from the bad ones.  Perhaps this is part of why the sentimentality is so overblown at times.The film will benefit from the presence of Jim Carrey and might do fairly well at the box office.  That being said, it's no ""Truman Show.""",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"Flawed, but a  gem nevertheless","The theme, the story, the acting, have been covered thoroughly by other reviewers here, and I won't cover these topics yet again. On the whole I agree with the majority that all of these were excellent.The film would have been excellent in all respects were it not for two factors that I haven't seen discussed much, if at all, elsewhere. One of these is artistic and the other a combination of artistic and technical. First, the sequences of Joel's ""internal"" mental scenes as Clementine is being erased from his memory are too long - two or three or even six or seven surreal and poignant fading memories would have been plenty - by the time I'd seen what seemed like a dozen or more the point(s) had been made, I began to check my watch, waiting for the _story_ to move onward, Second, the excessive hand-held camera work is annoying. I realize that this cinematographic style is a current fad, but it was really quite distracting particularly in the first 45 minutes or so. While it never reached the nausea level, the continual camera motion kept me from getting ""into"" the film for quite a while. The overall feel of the film is clearly intended to be surreal, rather than real, so, with due respect to the director's expertise, I would maintain that the realism implied by the hand-held camera actually interfered with the intended artistic impression.I started out expecting a 9 based on reviews; halfway through the film this had dropped to a 5 or so; by the end I was back up to an 8, which would have been 9 except for the two factors I've just mentioned.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Ambiguity from Anonymous Content In Association with This or That,"Focus is an independent production company which dwells on the non-conventional ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is, to say the least, a non-conventional film!! This movie, which is a purveyor of many Molotov Mardi Gras emotions, authenticates an equivocal potpourri of ideas that are indicative of numerous independent production company films!! This movie also bears a striking similarity to Elia Kazan's intensity to itemize belligerent confrontation!! ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is sort of a counter culture version of the film ""The Arrangement"". Many films that are run of the mill mainstream Hollywood movies immediately hack out a succinct and concise mindset of everyone of the major character's feelings. In ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" to say that Joel's (Jim Carey) feelings were introverted, would be a paramount utterance of understatement!! Joel's relationship with Clementine,( a name we associate with a folklore about loving regrets, also, with a particular type of orange) evokes a vivid presentation which signifies an emotional diligence. The illogical transition to their pursuing ideas and trepidations compound an inexplicably and unnecessary intransigence for both of them!! The ephemeral activities in this film perpetuate a cerebral anguish which becomes the heinous culprit to Joel and Clementine's difficulty to adequately dissect their conceptions about one another!! I could see this film 100 times and still not capture every intricate detail to it!! Set in a New York City neighborhood, it depicts a realism about imperfection being ubiquitous in all of the character's lives!! This movie had a foreign flare to it as well!! In fact, I initially thought this film took place in Montreal... After viewing a couple of scenes, I, of course, blew that contention out the window!! My first clue was when I saw the New York License plates on every single one of the cars!! Jim Carey is FABULOUS!! in this movie!! Originally known as the box office star of copious high profit zany comedies, his enormous popularity garnered an auspicious association with the light hearted!! In ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", his role was very serious and complex!! Think about it though, if someone were to handwrite a silly comedy, and then, all of a sudden, he was required to change this screenplay to a serious drama, it would be a case of simply needing to borrow someone's erasure for no more than 18 seconds!! Kate Winslet is superb in this film as well!! I did not even know she was British!! When the acting in a movie is so excellent, it almost appears as though the writers and directors of the film are getting paid only about a buck above minimum wage!! ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is a remarkable movie, and is considered to be one of the best films ever made according to this website!! The step by step thought process to this film puts this movie in a category all by itself!! Marvelous flick!!

"Gets to everybody, on different levels...","Sunshine was one of those cinema films, credited as a story about love i got dragged along by the girlfriend. At the time I enjoyed the sci-fi aspect of it. I found the writing and idea to be interesting on a purely inventive level. A very original concept which I found as more of a good story at the time. I appreciated the acting, particularly the way Carrey portrayed his character. People don't always give him the respect that his abilities deserve, they see him as a funny man, but their are films like this and The Truman Show where he manages to capture an emotion which he might not be so related to.I watched the film again on DVD of late, and things that happened to me related to the film, which cast it in a totally different light. I could suddenly understand the idea of removing somebody from your mind, the physical act of it didn't sound like a clever Sci-Fi idea, but something that should be able to be done. In the same way, I also understood the concept of running from the removal. It related to me because I found that I didn't want to forget things, and wanted to forget others.I think this film has several different effects on people. Those with histories in relationships will feel a lot more connected with the film, it speaks to people who still feel the effects of their own relationships. To others, who cant feel this connection, it becomes much more of a typical film, nothing really to relate to, no compelling characters, no huge action or uncomplicated story lines. The viewer can just see it, but not really care. This leaves them thinking less of such a film.I think the only way people can really appreciate this film is to see themselves in it, pick a person who they are like, and understand how they would react in such a situation. I believe that this film is much better when you see your own mind and memories, and begin to feel the story.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Why am I not surprised? Because it comes from Charlie Kaufman, who also brought us ""Adaptation"" and ""Being John Malkovich"". Kaufman has the power to make the strange familiar and is something of a kingmaker in the world of acting -- ""Adaptation"" may well be Nicolas Cage's best work, and this may well be Jim Carrey's. All those who doubted he could play serious roles had been proved otherwise. Kate Winslet also compliments him well and offers a nice departure for those used to her from ""Titanic"".If one wants, they can get into some great existential questions with this film: are bad memories important? Is it wrong to remove them? Are we destined to meet and love certain people or certain types of people? There's some wonder about the morality of removing another person from your memory and the biggest question of whether or not we need those memories to shape us. This film quotes Nietzsche and Alexander Pope -- but not one of Nietzsche's more well-known quotations: that which doesn't kill us only serves to make us stronger. Isn't that what pain is? A catalyst for growth? The supporting cast is excellent. Mark Ruffalo has a breakout performance (though not quite on par with ""Zodiac"") and Kirsten Dunst is pretty lovable as Mary (though still not as lovable as Maggie Gyllenhaal). Elijah Wood also appears, which is good or bad depending on your love for Elijah Wood, I imagine.You will have to ignore certain continuity questions (if you see someone every day for two years, what becomes of those two years with them removed) but that really isn't the point of the film anyhow. It's about fate and chance (see also ""No Country For Old Men""). And it's amazing, easily deserving the accolades hoisted upon it. If you're inexperienced, make this a top priority in your life.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
A Great Look into a Procedure that May Come Closer than You Think,"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind has a very philosophical and ethical question to ask us: Would you have an operation to forget someone completely? The movie manages to stick to not just the plot point of Joel and Clementine but also, the scientists who work in the business and what they think about what they are doing. Watching this movie reminded me of the dreams that I've had and how you wish they would go away or wish they were real but you can't wake up. Which is what Joel was stuck in. The whole movie is given a quite modern aesthetic which could be a hint at how close this procedure is from actually existing.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind..,"""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", one of the most overrated films of recent years, is mostly a parable about how humans should accept their destiny instead of escaping it. But while the general meaning is fairly simple, the script is complex, using a non-linear narrative (a la ""Lost Highway"" or ""Memento""), confusing past and present, dream and reality, the lives of the main characters etc.The direction further enhances this elaborate scheme: there are cut-ups, special effects, imaginative montage techniques, but also a post-modern overlapping between genres. Thus the film is sometimes a lyrical love-story, at other times a comedy, realist drama, Freudian analysis and so on. Unfortunately, a big part of the movie resorts to Hollywood melodrama (complete with generic sentimental soundtrack music). It feels as if the director is mostly interested in showing off his skills rather than presenting an interesting and organic movie. Vastly inferior to the similar ""L'Appartement"" (1996, Gilles Mimouni).",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
One of the Best Love Stories Around,"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is an inexhaustible serum formulated by lofty doses of trepidation. The film takes a similair high-octane approach within fetching out its countless events to that of one of my all-time favorites, Requiem for a Dream, making just about every conceptual message it has in store function freakishly well. Charlie Kaufman's script is the key module to this movie's heart-rending brain cluster that is surely guaranteed to tumble over and cause any other romantic narrative to look puny in comparison.

TERRIBLE! The most OVER-RATED movie I have ever seen!,"I don't care if this movie is on more than 50 critics top 10 lists. It was, in my eyes, a horrible film. One of the worst films I sat through in a long time. I actually felt I wasted 2 hours of my life I can never get back. I also know 9 other people who rented this mess and hated it just as much. The video clerk called this movie a ""stinker."" I know I am in the minority here. But I stand by what I say. I would never watch this movie again. Jim Carrey cannot do drama. In fact, he is not much of an actor. He's just a modern day Jerry Lewis. When he attempts to express anguish, he puts on his typical rubber face expressions. I know I am gonna get lots of flack for saying this. But I hated hated hated this movie. It was weird in a bad way, totally stupid, and a waste of Kirsten Dunsts talents. For those of you who praise this film, more power to you. I'll never ever watch it again. I thought it made the ""Friday the 13th"" films look like Oscar winners. Seriously. Alful, pointless, and enternally boring. I give it a huge thumbs down and a zero rating.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
This movie is a fine wine; it only gets better with age.,"I belong to the same group as Woody Allen and Nietzsche. I wouldn't want to belong to a club that would have me in it. This attitude pervades my life. It includes clubs, relationships, and movies among other things probably. For example, I hesitated to give this, my most favorite movie in the world four stars. I thought, since it is an enjoyable movie, one I enjoyed, I can't give it four stars. I wanted to give it three and a half. But I just watched it for maybe the twentieth time, and I absolutely had to give it four stars.Four stars does not mean it is perfect. This film is not perfect. I can't describe many movies as perfect. But there are many flawless parts of this movie.Let me start over with the recapitulation. This movie starts with Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) writing abysmally about Valentine's Day on a snowy beach after he skips work for no reason and falling in love with a woman he has just seen. Oddly, she introduces herself to him, Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet), and though she is immediately strange and exotic and Joel is introverted and boring, they hit it off immediately. For the first twenty minutes. And then there's a snapback. You're ripped from the plot and you realize that you haven't seen the opening credits yet, and you watch them as Joel sobs in his car.And the movie starts in on this crazy plot with purposeful amnesia, love, and all sorts of other human things.This is a Charlie Kaufman movie, and if you don't know what that means, then you don't know indie movies (but that's okay. Just make sure you get to know Kaufman). He is a crazy, insane genius screenwriter (see Adaptation, Being John Malkovich, Synecdoche, New York) and his mind is a wonderland. Michel Gondry is a French genius, a director who doesn't seem to direct, but lives within the movie (see The Science of Sleep, Be Kind, Rewind). Both of them are perfect in the film, and it is great that they were the two to make the commentary on the DVD.Kate Winslet gives the performance of her life in this movie. She disappears. Clementine takes over. There is no trace of Kate Winslet, or Rose from Titanic, or Marianne from Sense and Sensibility. She is fantastic. I cannot praise her performance in this movie enough. Jim Carrey also disappears. You forget Ace Ventura and every movie he ever made. This is his best performance ever. The other ""stars"" of the movie in its subplot are Tom Wilkinson, Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood, and Mark Ruffalo. They are all amazing, with perhaps the exception of Mark Ruffalo, who is simply fitting. But even he fit wonderfully. (Side note: This movie features my favorite actor and actress, Tom Wilkinson and Kate Winslet)This movie is affecting. That's it. Affecting. It's modern. It takes place NOW, although it could take place anytime. But it's odd for great movies to take place NOW. So often they are placed in another place or time, but this movie is here and now, in your face, so relevant, and it has the feel that it could never be irrelevant. The effects are sparse and perfect when the come, subtle, and helpful, but not a focus at all, the way they are supposed to be.The music is quite good an fits well. It is quirky and playful in a movie that is often just that.More than anything, this movie is a good friend. After seeing this for the twentieth time or so, I can quote nearly every line. I can laugh. I couldn't laugh at it the first time. Now it is hilarious, a real situational comedy. Yet, it is more touching each time. It's like a fine wine that only gets better with age.I would recommend this movie to anyone. Children, old people. Young people in new relationships, old people who have been married fifty years. Everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Truly beautiful and surreal,"Wow... this had me spellbound. Deep, intimate piece. If one wasn't already convinced that Jim Carrey is an actor, not just a comedian, one would be so after taking this in. Winslet does incredible, as well(and both are playing against type), as does everyone else that I can think of(Dunst also impressed me). You have to pay attention during this, and a second viewing may help, but it's not so abstract and loose that it's difficult to understand. This is the third work of Charlie Kaufman's that I've seen(the other two are Being John Malkovich and Confessions of a Dangerous Mind), and by far my favorite. Anyone who has ever loved can relate to this. I can't promise it'll be pleasant, in fact, it's possible that it won't, but this is absolutely absorbing. This is mature, smart and does not try to distance itself, or its audience, from the subject matter. I haven't seen any other work by Gondry, but he directs this magnificently. Masterful visuals, and somehow apparently with little to no CGI. The editing and camera-work are excellent. Story-telling and characterization are of such high quality that I'm not sure words can do them justice. The ambiguity of the final moments is perfect. All of the special effects are amazing. The movie pulls you in, it is thoroughly engaging throughout. I'm not sure any viewer can avoid being affected by this. You may not recognize every scene as something from your own life, but the feelings, the impressions... they're universal. I don't remember when I've last been this into a big screen experience. Anyone who can watch films that are personal, and emotionally powerful should consider this. There is some strong language and sexual content, as well as drug references and the like. The DVD holds two featurettes, one of which I will review on its own page here on the site, interesting deleted scenes, a fake commercial, a music video, and an informative commentary track with the Michel and writer Charlie Kaufman, all of them also well worth your time. I recommend this to anyone who is or has been in a relationship, and who don't need their cinematic experiences spoon-fed. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"Movie that gets better as it ages, alongside with you","I stumbled upon this film early 2010s when I was still a high school student and remember thinking ""What a beautifully shot film"", without understanding much about the emotional message between the everlasting love story of two heartbroken lovers. This film is one of those films that I was come back to watch every once in a while to remind myself that there is still a relatable drama. Watching it in 2022 certainly has a different vibe to the film as I have aged leading up to the protagonist's age to understand the emotional turmoil which have been portrayed by the characters in the film. The film is certainly beautiful to convey the message of the everlasting of true love, even when the memories are wiped clean. It does this so well from the gloom acting in the start of the film (signifying the ending of their love story) to happiness in the ending (the very first moment of their encounter). Both Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet portrays their beautiful love story of when they first met to the devastation of a relationship. The director has focused on even the littlest things like the beeping sound effect, to when the books are becoming blank in the library scene to illustrate Jim's memories being erased. The soundtrack is very fitting and the one played at the very last memory of Jim and Kate in the beach house is very heartwrecking. I believe this is one of those film that gets better with age because the storyline is very relatable to many people who will be experiencing some sort of true love and heartbreak throughout their life. Hoping to come back to watching this film again and again to remind myself that there was a film that made me both happy and cry.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Memory can change...the heart prevails,"It's hard not to fall in love with a film that begins with a voice-over saying (paraphrasing): ""Valentine's Day was created by card companies to make everybody feel like crap."" Right afterward, I watched Jim Carrey force himself through a half-closed train door, and I said, this is for me.Carrey, in a complete turnabout, plays Joel, a lonely man who falls in love with a lively, quirky nut named Clementine. The romance progresses, fights ensue, and one day, Joel walks into the bookstore where Clementine works, and she's making out with someone else and doesn't seem to even recognize him.Then their friends receive a note saying that Clementine has erased Joel from her memory, and they shouldn't mention him again. Joel heads to the clinic himself to find out what's going on.There he finds programmers who can draw a map of your memories about an individual on the brain and get rid of them. Joel decides to have the procedure.Part of the way through it, he tries desperately to stop it, to find some way to remember Clementine, bringing her into places and memories where she never was.The programmers (Elijah Wood, Thomas Ryan) don't notice anything odd about the procedure because they're busy drinking, dancing in their underwear and doing drugs with Mary (Kirsten Dunst) a secretary at the clinic.When they finally notice a problem, the head man (Howard Wilkinson) is called in. Slowly Clementine disappears from Joel's brain as he desperately tries to hold onto her.A spectacular story with a few twists along the way, and spectacular acting, particularly from Carrey, Winslet and Dunst, make this a real winner.Carrey is a sympathetic, warm character, Winslet is adorable and charming, and Dunst is a complete natural, be she stoned in her underwear, trying to talk sense under the influence, or crying. They are wonderful as is the rest of the cast.""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is about the death of memory but not of emotion and the cry of the heart that goes on - sometimes without knowing why.

I saw this when it first came out but didn't have an IMDb account at the time,"I've never had a movie break me down and make my heart ache the way this one did when I first watched it (in the theater no less). This could be an unfair comparison though since I had a recent break-up right before watching this movie.Jim Carrey played Joel as a real person and did so in such a believable way that I immediately became impressed with his range when I had been lukewarm about his other attempts at drama.I've known couples like Joel and Clementine and at some scenes I've been them. Of my friends who didn't like the movie they were always people with no experience or very little. I think what makes people love this movie is realizing how realistic it is and respecting that.One of the things that makes Eternal Sunshine stand out is its depth. The movie has little hints for you to find and uncover if you watch it multiple times. If you pay close attention you can see that Joel and Clementine have probably erased each other more than once as have other couples. It makes sense that if your memories are gone but who you are as a person is the same that you'd find the same people attractive and have the same desires and of course the same problems and issues. And so one of the main points of the story is a reminder that, ""Those who forget history are doomed to repeat it"". Therefore, the only way to grow as a person and progress is to keep your memories, no matter how much it hurts. It is part of growing and moving on. It is part of progress.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Disappointing and forgettable,"""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is a sloppy mess of a movie which dumps sci-fi, romance, camp comedy, and mediocre drama into a Mulligan stew seasoned with intellectual grunge. The film spends most of its run time flashing to and fro between a romantically involved couple's happy days and a sort of lame white out job of their memories of each other. The upside to this flick is its solid cast and remarkable public and critical approval. The downside is it's an ill focused, pathos drenched mess with peripheral nonsense which detracts from the core theme making the ""buy-in"" difficult. Reminiscent of Kaufman's ""Being John Malkovich"" in its lunacy, this film proves once again that creativity is not necessarily a good thing. For Kaufman fans only.

good but not brilliant,"The fundamental problem with Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind is that, unlike the other films made from Charlie Kaufman's original screenplays - Adaptation, Being John Malkovich - there's really basically only one idea at work here. The acting is excellent (probably the best work that Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet have ever done, and kudos to the great English character actor Tom Wilkinson), the digital effects are great, and the elliptical plot is quite emotionally moving for something so clever, but once you know what's going on (and i'm not going to ruin it by saying what it is) then all you can do is sit back and wait for the Halloweenish funfair ride to finish. The great thing about seeing Being John Malkovich for the first time was the sheer mind-blowing inventiveness of the story, which left you constantly wondering what the hell was going to happen next; and likewise for Adaptation, which was just as original but had even more layers upon layers and circles within circles that Kaufman's laser beam of a brain always managed to refer back to the various disparate threads of the plot(s) without letting the whole thing dissolve into a self-canceling tangled mess. Even though the ideas and the intellect on display in the writing of these films are dazzling in their brilliance they still manage to move your heart as well as your brain, and while Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind will also make you laugh out loud at certain scenes and (possibly) cry in others, it's my opinion that maybe if Spike Jonze - who directed Adaptation and Malkovich - had directed this one as well then he would have pushed Kaufman creatively a bit more, because by halfway through the movie you pretty much know what's going to happen for the rest of it.

Love is a complex concept that can't be explained. This movie shows us that like no other could. This is the opposite of all romantic movies. It's very original and very warn as it is sad as well. Both main actors gave excellent performances and their relationship felt authentic like no other relationship on screen.Jim Carrey is a really good actor when it comes to drama. I personally dislike most of his exaggerated comedies but he did a terrific job here and in The Truman Show for example. I think that he should choose more carefully his roles, because there are some roles where he can show he actually has talent.

I will not see a better movie this year.,"I got into a screening late last night of this movie, and was pure and simple blown away by what I saw. It's unbelieveable.After a brief prologue, it simply throws you into the movie headfirst. It took me about twenty minutes to get my bearings, to realize what was going on, but the execution of the core idea behind the movie (what if we could erase the memory of someone who hurt us?), is probably the most original storytelling method I've seen in a long while. The movie smashes everything you think you know to expect, everything you know about filmmaking, and just takes you for a ride through one man's consciousness, and his love for a woman. Only Kaufman and Gondry know where you're going, and as the movie works backwards through Carrey's memories it also works forwards through the process of his memory being erased. I simply can't describe how complex some of the scenes become, but through a brilliant series of camera tricks, phenomenal writing, and truly amazing acting, we're taken through a story that unfolds both in the real world and in Carrey's mind. I don't want to ruin anything of the plot points, not because there are big revelations or secrets, but because the whole point of the movie is to gain complete understanding of two people who very soon aren't going to even remember that they ever knew one another, and who do not realize just how much they love each other.I will not see a better movie this year.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Carrey excels in an uncharacteristic role and achieves brilliance,"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind came out of no where and blew my mind. A friend recommended the movie to me and i was skeptical at the premise. Jim Carrey plays Joel who tries to erase the memories of his ex-girlfriend Clementine, played by Kate Winslet, because she erased him from her memory. To me the movie sounded like a silly comedy movie but it is in fact just the opposite. The tone of Eternal Sunshine is rather dark and serious most of the time.I was hooked instantly with Jim Carrey's narration. It was brilliant, i instantly empathized with his character. At first you see Joel depression caused by his break up with Clementine. Later in the movie you see several of Joel and Clementines good and bad memories. Along the course Joel realizes his mistake in erasing Clementine and internally struggles with himself and the people performing the process of removing his memories to keep his memories of Clementine.I felt deep empathy for Joel every memory sad, funny, happy or cruel i felt it as Joel did. Jim Carrey is great in this role. His character is just average Joe, a real easy person to relate to. Winslet creates a unique but still believable character in Clementine. She played the role great. Winslet and Carry's chemistry was great.The shots were great but every so often the distorted memories got a little to crazy, it was a little disturbing and kind of over the top but maybe that was what the director intended.Anyone can like this movie.

Unraveling Love and Loss,"""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is a mind-bender that dives into the chaotic terrain of love, loss, and memory. Inspired by the Alexander Pope quote, ""Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind!"", the film explores a world where a scientific procedure allows people to erase unwanted memories. Charlie Kaufman's labyrinthine screenplay takes center stage, weaving a complex narrative around Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet), a couple with a tumultuous past. The film cleverly abandons a linear structure, opting instead to depict their relationship through fragmented memories. This ""Maze Cinema"" approach can be disorienting, but it effectively portrays the confusion and heartbreak that cloud Joel and Clementine as their memories are manipulated.Carrey delivers a nuanced performance, toning down his usual comedic energy to portray a lonely man clinging to fading memories. Winslet matches him perfectly, embodying Clementine's impulsiveness and vulnerability. The supporting cast, including Tom Wilkinson, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood, and Kirsten Dunst, adds another layer of intrigue with their quirky portrayals of the employees at Lacuna Inc., the memory-erasing company.While the film's central concept is undeniably fascinating, it's the emotional core that resonates most deeply. Despite the unconventional narrative, ""Eternal Sunshine"" explores universal themes of love, loss, and the human desire for connection. Director Michel Gondry, known for his music video background, brings Kaufman's vision to life with a unique visual style that perfectly complements the film's surreal and dreamlike qualities.""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is not for everyone. If you prefer straightforward narratives and easily digestible plots, this film's non-linear structure and offbeat humor might leave you frustrated. However, for those seeking a thought-provoking and emotionally resonant experience, this is a cinematic gem. The film lingers long after the credits roll, prompting reflection on the importance of memories, the complexities of love, and the resilience of the human spirit. It's a wild ride through the labyrinth of the mind, but one that ultimately celebrates the beauty and messiness of human connection.6.575/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
I wish I had a spotless mind.,"This is the filmic equivalent of being stuck in a room with someone who thinks they have the most emotionally upsetting life imaginable and is doing everything in their power to persuade you they are truly tortured and pitiable. By the end of both experiences you just want to go home and feel utterly relieved you aren't so arrogant. Or you wish you were able to erase your own memory. (Sorry, a cheap film tie-in metaphor already.)The film itself, like Being John Malkovich and Adaptation suffers from a hole in the centre. Charlie Kauffman seems to think it is clever to take a totally unlikely scenario and then develop it into a ""quirky"" film that is supposed to make little sense. In each instance he fails to grasp that you can't just take a scenario so utterly implausible as to defy any audience to relate or respond to it. Eternal Sunshine is a slightly easier premise to connect with than Being John Malkovich, after all who hasn't wondered what it would be like to erase painful relationships. However Kauffman sems to mistake nonsense for emotional and intellectual depth.Someone told me that you have to watch Eternal Sunshine more than once to 'get it' and I promise that this isn't true. There is nothing you get the second time that you won't have got the first time. It is a fairly straight forward film. The only problem you might have is if you are colour blind and can't work out the time scale of the film from Kate Winslett's hair because you cannot tell that it is changing colour. The director might as well have put subtitles across the bottom of the screen saying ""Two years ago"" ""Present day"" because Gondry's visual 'clues' were about as subtle or 'clue-like' as subtitles.Performance wise, Kate Winslett was her usual self, and Jim Carrey was in Truman show mode. Carrey offers ocassional glimpses of acting talent before they are devoured by his all consuming gurning. Tom Wilkinson and Kirsten Dunst offer more respectable performances, however I felt cheated that their entire sub plot was clearly lying on the editing room floor, it felt rushed and unconvincing. Which is a shame because the rest of the film felt over long and over laboured and perhaps a better balance might have saved my cinema ticket which I spent the whole film folding into a variety of shapes.I made a square (Not too difficult) a triangle. I tried to make a swan but it ended up looking like some sort of half eaten fish. After that I was running out of ideas and so i tore it into equal pieces. Then unequal ones. Bored yet? I was. The second time I saw it was even worse. Fortunately I had just seen 3-4x Jugatsu and so had something to concentrate on. Namely trying to understand a film which actually had some sort of emotional depth, some sort of conflicting plot and some semblance of lead performances.I wish people wouldn't think that any film which doesn't have a discernable Beginning - middle - end structure automatically qualifies as intelligent or engaging. And that just because Jim Carrey isn't smacking himself in the face or making chimp noises he is acting. He isn't. He is just biding his time until he can start hitting himself in the face again.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Very Disappointed,"I was surprised at Kate Winslet's character because she is quite unlikable, and they didn't really seem like a couple at all. I like Jim Carrey in the Truman Show and he's fine here, I like him better in serious roles. But it's a really slow paced movie like others have said. Not horrible but not what I'd call good.I have to compare it to Secret Life of Walter Mitty which I was thinking of while watching this because it also ""makes a statement about life"" and ""has a good soundtrack"" but is better in every way.

I've watched over 700 movies and only few of them have resonated with me the way this one has. It is crazy how a piece of art created on the other side of the planet and a decade ago can be so relatable (another such movie for me is ""Before Sunrise"", btw).

A Beautiful Movie,"For some reason or another I had put off watching Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind until now, and I had no idea what I was missing. I came into the movie with preconceptions that it was a great, if not amazing movie, but I wasn't quite prepared for how moving Eternal Sunshine really was.In my honest opinion this is the best acting I have ever seen out of Jim Carey and even Kate Winslet..the chemistry these two share on the screen is an enjoyment in itself, and they do it with such short and artistically fragmented scenes, and by the middle of the movie I found myself caring about these characters.This is a movie about characters, personalities, love, and loss.

Outstandingly unusual.,"Creative. Brilliant. Dreamy. All that and even more. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is an extraordinary story of love that goes beyond the limits of time and defies all rules of reality. I loved every second of it and I wouldn't mind watching it over and over again.The movie is about Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet), a couple who decide to undergo a memory erasing procedure to forget each other after their relationship goes downhill. Only through this unusual experience do they embark on a journey to discover their true feelings, realizing that forgetting might be the easiest cure for pain but tolerating is definitely the best. The idea is absolutely crazy in an amazing way, and turning it into a moving picture with story, plot, characters and emotional charge must have been a painstaking task. The actual timeline and the dream sequence were craftily interwoven in a way that arises the viewer's curiosity with every passing second, and gradually holds a grip not only of his mind but of his heart as well.Kate Winslet played her character to perfection. She was the sunshine in the movie; her impulsive nature and spontaneous, fun-loving character contributed to the vividness of the story. Jim Carrey gave his lifetime best performance. He was so believable and mature I had to convince myself that this is the same Carrey who plays mainly sappy roles in inane comedies.A million kudoses for Charlie Kaufman's exquisite mind.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"Excellent, though neither Kaufman's nor Carrey's best","I've been a Kaufman fan since he was writing for television, and was blown away by Malkovich, like most everyone was.It's truly shocking this movie is 200 places higher rated than either Malkovich or Adaptation among IMDb users (#35 on the top 250, compared to #208 and #235 respectively). I thought this movie was great, though not as inventive as his prior work. Actually, this movie is probably the most conventional movie Kaufman's written besides ""Confessions"".Also, a shout out to those who think Spike Jones directed this, actually Michel Gondry did. Gondry has given us better crafted movie than Spike Jones has with Kaufman's scripts. This movie's full of fun visual gags. Still, I'd love to see what how Kaufman's scripts panned out if he ever paired up with a director that didn't come from the music video generation.As far as performances go, the best aspect of this movie is Kate Winslet. The character that Kaufman gave her is spectacular, and she is awesome as usual. Carrey's character just mopes a lot. In the end, Carrey's performance in this movie is nowhere near his performance in.... ta-da... Cable Guy. Cable Guy is his best and most underrated work.

"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) - Don't Erase my Memory, Please!","""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is one of the many masterpieces that proves why we all love film in the first place. Directed by French director Michel Gondry, and written by accomplished filmmaker Charlie Kaufman, ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is equal part romantic comedy, psychological thriller, science-fiction, and non-linear narrative. Taking a break from comedy, the film stars Jim Carrey in a more dramatic performance as a man who volunteers to erase every single memory of him and his ex-girlfriend, played by Kate Winslet, whom coincidentally has already done the same thing. The film then takes us on a wonderful and imaginative journey through this one man's mind, as he tries to fight against those who try to steal his memories away, while at the same time, trying to fight for the woman he loves. First-time director Michel Gondry makes his second directorial debut in such a stylish fashion. He perfectly guides the movie with enough clever execution and brilliant uniqueness. Writer Charlie Kaufman has written such a beautiful script that contains witty humor, sharp characters, and true dialouge, which was able to win him a Best Original Screenplay Academy Award. Besides Carrey and Winslet, this remarkable cast includes Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffalo, and Tom Wilkinson, all bringing such memorable performances on screen. But it's the romantic relationship between Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet that carries the movie, and their adventures into trying to keep their memories together from falling apart. Jim Carrey may be more noticeable in more comedic-driven films, but he still provides great dramatic performances, and this is one of those movies that shows how great an actor he is. But, Kate Winslet is the scene-stealer, as the light-hearted, charismatic girlfriend, with a different choice of hair color in nearly every scene. It doesn't matter what role you give to Kate Winslet, because no matter what, she will still be awesome in the role! This movie also provides some of the beautiful uses of imagery that I have seen in a while. In a usual Charlie Kaufman movie, something weird always has to happen. Accompanied with a memorable soundtrack, beautiful effects, and stylish editing, ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is pure filmmaking at it's finest. Although there were some characters that kind of got me annoyed, especially Elijah Wood's character, who seems sort of lost into his given performance. It was just a few moments where the movie loses a bit of it's magic. But, that doesn't hurt the movie's momentum, though! Those flaws are out-shined by how beautiful this movie has been made to look. This is probably one of my favorite movies, and it will definitely be a memorable one, as well.

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"I don't think anyone could possibly sum this movie up in any word but ""perfect"". It's so perfect that every time I watch it, I rate it one star higher. 10 stars is TRULY an understatement. This movie is one of--if not THE-- best movies I have seen. The characters and story mix together perfectly. The story is about a dull, shy man, Joel Barish, meets and falls in love with an eccentric, fantastically unique girl, Clementine Kruczynski. He learns she erased him from her memory and he does the same to her after learning this. That's all I will say, so I won't spoil anything. Now. I love this girl. I haven't loved a character like this ever since Ramona Flowers (I dunno, I have this thing for girls with unnatural hair colors). ANYWAYS. You will love her too. And you'll love Joel too. And You'll feel a deep sorrow for all the other ""unfortunate souls"", except Patrick. You will want to kill that little rat. I. Hate. That. Guy. But never fear, losers never win... The story and some of the movie may or may not make sense to some viewers (I understood it JUST enough the first time but I'll have to say that the second time watching it was BETTER.) And that sorta reminded me of when I watched Inception. You catch more that way. This is an intelligent, down-to-earth, loving, sad, triumphant, and deeply emotional (even if you rebuff your emotions 100%, you WILL get emotional. Because it's THAT good).And another thing, this isn't a mushy-gushy romance (BONUS!! I'm fist pumping) and I recommend watching this on a date, it will appeal both genders.

Mind bending and poignant. Fantastic.,"Have you ever been in a relationship that you wish you could completely erase from your memory? Perhaps you fell out of love, perhaps your significant other was unfaithful, or perhaps it simply wasn't meant to be. This is the situation that Joel Barish is faced with in the superb Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind.Jim Carrey plays Joel, a shy and unassuming bachelor who meets Clementine, a boisterous, fun loving dynamo who gives his mundane existence a considerable shot in the arm. Unfortunately for Joel, Clementine decides she has had enough and has all memory of him erased. Feeling understandably hurt, Joel decides that he also wants the operation and subsequently arranges a memory wipe of his own.The rest of the movie takes place in Joel's head as he realises he does not want to have the operation and proceeds to try and prevent it. It sounds a little confusing and, to some extent, it is. The high concept can take a little while to get your head around, but once you do, you will uncover an absolute gem of a romance.The fact that the movie takes place inside Joel's head gives director Michel Gondry the opportunity to fill the screen with some unforgettable images, such as a rainstorm in a living room and a fully grown Jim Carrey being bathed in the sink. But the true genius of Eternal Sunshine lies in its structure. The first half of the movie is quite gloomy as it focuses on the end of Joel and Clementine's relationship but, as the team begin to wipe earlier memories, we see what made the couple fall in love in the first place and we are treated to some truly heart warming scenes that never threaten to stray into cheesy territory.With Carrey playing against type as the close mouthed Joel, it falls to Kate Winslet to adopt the typical Carrey role, and she grabs the opportunity with both hands. Winslet's energy permeates every scene she is in and it is easy to see why Joel fell in love with her. A stellar supporting cast does good work with a slightly underwhelming sub-plot, but this is very much Joel and Clementine's movie and, by the time the credits roll, you will instantly want to watch it again if only to make sure you understood what just happened.A mind bending romance with a fantastically clever script and some outstanding imagery. Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind is one of the best romantic films you will ever see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"""An Anonymous Content Production""? Not in this world.","""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is one of those movies that signifies its strangeness by having the opening credits come quite a way into the movie (a la ""Alias""). If nothing else, it lives up to the mindset it promises, although I have to admit I don't love this movie as much as others do; director Michel Gondry and writer Charlie Kaufman have certainly delivered a clever and touching tale... but it's a bit too much of the former and a bit short on the latter.The movie's biggest problem is that Jim Carrey (cast against type as an introverted nice guy) and Kate Winslet (as a woman who we know is a free spirit - though a troubled one - because she keeps changing her hair colour) don't really seem like they are or ever were a couple, even allowing for opposites attracting. This doesn't ruin the movie's effect, but it does make it seem a bit remote, especially as their relationship is seen almost entirely from his point of view. Remember, there are two sides to every story, and although we do eventually see her side of it, the real added dimension comes from Kirsten Dunst as the receptionist at the company that performs the mind-wiping that triggers the plot. She seems surplus to requirements at first, but it turns out that she's there to do more than dance on a bed in a T-shirt and panties.This is one of the movie's main strengths (not Kirsten Dunst in a T-shirt and panties*); everything proves to have something else going on under the surface, including the structure of the movie itself. The constant unpredictability and the conviction of Carrey's performance as the man on an adventure inside his own mind makes it more than the exercise in cleverness for cleverness's sake that it could have been - the movie never forgets that it's a romance at heart. Jon Brion's wonderful score (which is almost another character in the movie) is another plus; so is Tom Wilkinson as the doctor in charge, and so are Dunst, Winslet, Mark Ruffalo and even Elijah Wood.But though funny, ingenious and even a little touching, in the end ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is a feelgood movie for people who like to think they're too smart to be caught at feelgood movies; I like it, certainly, but I can't help wondering if this is one of those movies that viewers of a certain kind SAY you should love, rather than something you can take to your hearts of your own accord.

"""Eternal Sunshine"" mixes new technologies with a very old theme, the famous ""heartbreak"", the plot explores the past and the How we look at our memories in a very original way","What if we could simply erase the ones, we love the most from our memory? The idea is frightening, but it can be tempting in moments of greater suffering or longing. This is the premise of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, one of the most acclaimed love films of the 2000s. Mixing new technologies with a very old theme, the famous ""heartbreak"", the plot explores the past and the How we look at our memories.In his new feature film, Charlie Kaufman reprises the duo with director Michel Gondry, with whom he worked on The almost human nature. The French filmmaker, known for the music videos he made with singer Björk, manages to use his colleague's script very well, and in the denser parts of the film, he makes great use of the fusions of scenery, like George Clooney in Confessions. Here, however, they have a meaning beyond mere aesthetics, as we are inside the protagonist's head.Insecure and needy, Joel Barish (Carrey) is your typical Kaufmanian hero: as he makes eye contact with the beautiful Clementine Kruczynski (Winslet) on a beach, he thinks, ""Why do I fall in love with every woman who gives me any attention? "". However, right after we witness the friendly meeting of the two characters, the narrative jumps in time to show us that the stark differences between Joel and Clementine's personalities doomed the relationship - and, to get rid of the painful memories, the girl submits to a 'surgery', newly developed by a certain dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Wilkinson), able to selectively erase memories of his ill-fated marriage to Joel. Upon discovering what his ex-wife did, the subject decides to follow the same procedure, but, during the surgery, he realizes that he wants to keep the memories and does everything to prevent them from being removed from his brain.Surpassing, in inventiveness and intelligence, the sequence in Being John Malkovich in which a chase takes place in the subconscious of the title character, Joel's efforts to keep Clementine's memory alive is the great attraction of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind: firstly, such memories are ""erased"" in reverse chronological order, and thus we see the last moments of the couple's relationship first - and, as the film progresses, we go back in time and discover the charm that initially existed in that marriage. Furthermore, by reliving the most remarkable moments of his life with Clementine, Joel concludes the obvious: we can only evolve thanks to our experiences (good or bad), and losing this reference is too high a price to pay for the comfort of avoiding suffering. For a while. From then on, Kaufman once again proves his talent by showing that he is not limited to creating interesting concepts, he is also a master at exploring them to the fullest, and transforms our ""tour"" through Joel's mind into a journey that borders on the surreal: the boy's memories are joined by his imagination, his reflections on past events and even the knowledge acquired during the surgery, since he is still able to hear (even unconsciously) what dr. Howard are talking.The film calls our attention for its incredible identity in the way it tells the story. The non-linearity is what determines part of the script's strength, after all, a lot of what we're looking at is a big extended memory. And, as the script presents subtle details, they end up having an effect at some point, no matter how small. In this sense, the montage works very well on the way in which it will intercalate these events. Everything is out of order, but is this necessary to work as a surprise for the viewer, such as: for what reasons are both of you doing this? How did they meet? In what period does this take place? The non-sequential way of answering all of this is what makes the film so thought-provoking. The scenes in Joel's head are impressive. The reality distortions, the blurs, the absence of light and the gradually disappearing elements have an immense capacity for immersion. It really feels like dreams disappearing, where only Joel and the audience understand, it's palpable and fantasy at the same time. Thus, when there is a transition and mixture of these memories, in that context it makes sense.Demonstrating that he has evolved as a feature film director since his debut in the role (precisely in ""Almost Human Nature""), Michel Gondry conducts the film with confidence, never allowing the spectator to feel lost - which is admirable, since, in addition to from the sequences that take place in Joel's mind, we are presented with two other plots: one involving Patrick (Wood) and Clementine; and another addressing Mary's (Dunst) interest in Dr. Howard. What's more, unlike silliness like ""Van Helsing"" and ""Haunted Mansion,"" which revolve around visual effects and ignore story, here Gondry uses effects as a function of the script's needs, which is admirable.What is most human in ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is precisely the understanding of something that completely escapes any perverse or insensitive scientism, like what we see on the screen when Clementine and Joel try to erase all memories, indistinctly, of their finished relationship. I like the way science is presented in the film. The feature film peremptorily refuses the lure of presenting a hyper-technological face of science, capable of generating even dazzle and admiration for its futuristic achievements. In contrast, the clinic's team of scientists who promote the ""treatment"" are not presented with any pomp or seriousness. The very device placed on the patients' heads seems poorly made and somewhat silly, belonging to any uninteresting and unbelievable sci-fi children's story.And here is the main and most accurate criticism of Michel Gondry's film, with a strong dystopian flavor, to the idea of a science without limits. What most essentially eludes the film's scientists is the understanding that we are made, above all else, of affections. It is this indelible affectivity that Joel will discover during the pseudo-therapeutic process when he exclaims: ""No, not that memory! Let me keep this one at least."" The necessary question remains: what science do we want for the future? The one that leads us to technical progress without stripping us of our most basic humanity, or the one that erases our memories and, thus, erases ourselves as beings with history? The one that anesthetizes and infantilizes us or the one that allows us to feel the world and thus humanize it? And starting from what the film gives us, through a love story so loved by so many people, we can go further. Is it not the affections, good or bad, that teach us individually and, at the same time, allow humanity itself to improve collectively, even with enormous difficulties and setbacks?The star cast agreed to work for much lower amounts than usual. This type of commitment only happens when there is the possibility of working with renowned directors, different scripts, or roles completely opposite to what is usually offered to them, but which can yield strong performances and serious chances in the awards season. Jim Carrey proves once again that he is a great dramatic actor, as he had already done in ""The Truman Show"" and ""Andy's World"". The actor is restrained and never exhibits any trace of his usual histrionics, transforming Joel into a melancholic and real figure. Kate Winslet and her colorful hair are not at all reminiscent of her role in ""Titanic"". And among the secondary characters, all have equal importance and performance. For fans of Kirsten Dunst, the scene where she appears in panties and a tank top jumping on the bed is worth highlighting. The cast is completed by Tom Wilkinson (Girl with a Pearl Earring), Mark Ruffalo (In The Cut) and Elijah Wood (Frodo from ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy).Perhaps the film deserved an ending that was a little more in-depth, which somehow touched more on these successive questions that it implicitly raises. Instead, the final scene shows the reconciliation of the protagonists with a rather cliché dialogue. But the slightly disappointing conclusion is not able to change a fact - the inventiveness of the script, the agile and vibrant direction of Gondry and the excellent performance of the main actors make Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind an original film, well directed and capable of think of several layers.For those who like to put labels on movies, ""Eternal Sunshine"" is a dramatic comedy with hints of science fiction, but mainly, it's a love story. That's the only way to define this script that mixes different influences and makes you laugh (intelligently), get emotional (without easy tears) and think (a lot). Just when you think you understand where all this is going, there is a twist and the story changes direction and even style. This time, in addition to messing with what is real or not, Charlie Kaufman also plays with the timeline of his short story. Are we at the beginning of a line or in the middle of a cycle? Is what happened really in the past? All this is detail. It's just a device he uses to make the audience think.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Impossibly Crappy- Few Redeeming Qualities,"I struggled for a long time to like this movie. I just felt horrible; everyone was enjoying the ""best film of the last ten years"" and I just felt like I was watching cinematic vomit. I felt out of the loop, but, I suppose that's just going to have to be alright, because I refuse to like this piece of bile.First off, the plot revolves around a pretty lame plot device, namely a memory erasing company. Some people really do forget other human beings, even those they've been romantically involved with, so why rely on this lame device? Charlie Kaufman's funny dialogue and interesting plots have gone out the window, making way for some incredibly bad lines, like, ""Do you think I'm ugly?"" I just hate listening to the characters talk; they are some of the most repulsive, unlikeable characters committed to the screen. Kate Winslet's character in particular I wanted to smack. I mean, how is it possible I can stand a four hour movie starring a rapacious gangster (Once Upon a Time in America) and can't not walk out on this under-two hour claptrap starring decent humans? I wouldn't want to spend ten minutes with these bastards, let alone 100 minutes.Kirsten Dunst starts dancing in her underwear. Whoop-de-doo. Mark Ruffalo makes a mistake. Elijah Wood looks like a chihuahua. Jim Carrey looks ill. Kate Winslet spaces out and annoys the hell out of me. No actor in the movie has a breakout performance, not even Jim Carrey, who's just as annoying as he is in his comedic films. Even the score by the otherwise talented Jon Brion sucks!

"Someone please, don't erase my memory!","The best excuse to see the film is the tour de force acting by Jim Carrey. He is paid millions to appear in other films that are supposed to be funny movies, but in reality, Mr. Carrey is at top of his craft when he plays against type, as is the case in this film.That Mr. Carrey is surrounded by some of the best actors working in films today, helps to make this  movie a favorite for a lot of IMDB contributors, judging by the hundreds of comments submitted to this page. Kate Winslet, Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst, Tom Wilkinson, are very good and very effective in playing the people in the story.As far as the writing of Charlie Kaufman goes, he is never boring. To every new project Mr. Kaufman brings his own fresh ideas on how to present them on screen. He is very lucky to have found directors that are sensitive to his material and do the job well. To have Michael Gondry bring it all together, it's just happiness.The only point I would argue with Mr. Kaufman is the suppression of those painful memories at the center of the story. It is utopian at best. Would anyone be better off by having a bad love affair, or even a death of a loved one, erased from one's mind permanently? I think not.

Possibly the greatest romance I've ever seen.,"Charlie Kaufman is a very talented screenwriter. Being John Malkovich introduced me to his unique mindset and Adaptation blew me away with its creativity but this film is his best.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind follows Joel, a man who decides to take a medical procedure in order to have his partner Clementine erased from his memory after he finds out she did the same.There have been some great romance films like the Before trilogy and my favourite being Her, but this film just might overtake that film to be the best romantic film ever. Never have I seen a romance as creative and thought-provoking as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Out of all the Kaufman films I've seen this is the deepest. This film raises really important questions regarding love and relationships. Is it worth it to forget previous relationships entirely just because of the bad moments? Would you want to forget all the happy memories just because things got a bit ugly later on? It's these questions and so many more philosophical ideas that Kaufman wants us to think about and it's told in such an endearing fashion.Like Spike Jonze, Michel Gondry is an extremely talented director. To be able to make this film come to life isn't easy and Gondry managed to capture the heartfelt and emotional weight of Kaufman's script beautifully. The way this film is told is very interesting. The film's narrative goes back and forth a lot and has multiple surreal moments which is what makes this romance unlike any other. The characters are extremely well realised and the performances to go along with it are excellent.Eternal Sunshine shows a side of Jim Carrey which we've never been exposed to. We've all known him for his over-the-top and comedic personality but he's never done a role as serious and restrained as Joel Barish. Carrey is absolutely superb here and makes his character as relatable, realistic and human as possible. He should have got a Best Actor nomination at least. This is his best film along with The Truman Show. Kate Winslet has never been better. Her chemistry with Carrey is believable to its core and she deserves her Best Actress nomination. The supporting cast with the likes of Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood and Tom Wilkinson were also terrific in their roles.Much like Her, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind will have a special place in my heart. This film examines love and relationships in a beautiful and impassioned manner. Charlie Kaufman, without a doubt, deserved to win the Oscar for Best Screenplay with Michel Gondry and Pierre Bismuth.

A True Masterpiece!,"'Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind' is the best of the year 2004. An amazing, outstanding film.. I loved the movie from start to end.

"I need your lovin', like the sunshine...","""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" (cool title taken from Alexander Pope's poem ""Eloisa to Abelard"") is one of the most original, hilarious and oddly moving films about love and all its phases. Thanks to Charlie Kaufman's flawless, much deserving Oscar-winning script (co-written by Michel Gondry and Pierre Bismuth), and Gondry's spectacular visual talent, ESOTSM became a one of a kind masterpiece. Take Paul Thomas Anderson's gorgeous ""Punch-Drunk Love"", which features the overwhelming sensation of falling in love among chaos and depression, and go deeper, when the perfect couple don't feel so into each other anymore and their ugly side is evident, and you can have an idea of what expect from the V-Day card created by the same mind who gave us ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Adaptation."".Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) discovers that his beloved Clementine Kruczysnki (Kate Winslet) underwent a bizarre procedure to erase him from her mind, and decides to do the same. But only after the physicians start to erase his memories, Joel realizes he loves Clem so much that he wants to remember both the good and bad times they had together - so our hero has to run with Clem from the doctors (inside his mind!) and struggle to stop them before everything's gone. Sounds crazy? It is. It's also extremely funny and poignant. Who never wanted to forget the one who broke our heart? What if you could really do it? Now, the hardest thing to know is whether it's worth it or not. A discreet Carrey and a garrulous Winslet are fantastic as the leads, and the supporting cast (Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst, Tom Wilkinson, Elijah Wood, David Cross and Jane Adams) is equally brilliant.""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is compelling for those who have just had their first heartbreak, AND for those who consider themselves experts in matters of the heart as well. It seems that (at least to me), when it comes to love and relationships, the more we seem to understand them, the less we really know about them. After seeing this movie, I realized I shouldn't worry that much... everybody's gotta learn sometime. 10/10.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Probably the Best Romantic Film!,"On a Valentine Day, Joel Barish feels the impulse of going to Montauk instead of working. After spending the cold day on the beach, he meets Clementine Kruczynski on the train station and they have a crush on each other. Joel and Clementine do not know that they were mates in the past. Joel has just erased Clementine from his memories when he found that Clementine did exactly the same, when their relationship ended. However, along his erasing process, Joel becomes astonished when he finds that he still loves Clementine and he does not want to lose her, fighting for keeping the memories of their moments together instead.This is a movie that makes you think and could break your heart at the same time. It's your different kind of romantic comedy and it's a great addition to Charlie Kaufman's writing. The great work of CGI and camera work draws in the viewers because they are so amazing! The acting by Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are really fantastic. I never have anything to say about great films like this. It has an emotional core and one of the best films ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
A memorable journey,"The story of this movie is both very beautiful and very sad. As a movie, it's good, but not amazing. Sometimes, it could get a little boring. Anyway, it was unusual to watch Jim Carrey as a more serious and natural person, but I think he was spot on in this one. This movie is definitely recommending!",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Surreal relationship drama that moves both heart and imagination,"Films that intentionally blur the lines between the real and the imagined, that completely defy our most basic sense of narrative structure can often be off-putting and regarded as strange. Some people, no matter how outside-the-box their thinking, will always see ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" this way. The title alone is a red flag for conservative movie-goers. But the truth is that this film is not abstract merely for the sake of style, but it is abstract filmmaking with a clear purpose. Writer Charlie Kaufman and director Michel Gondry make that purpose accessible the entire film and the result is a unique and special film about the connection between memory and relationship.""Eternal Sunshine"" is about the relationship between Joel (Carrey) and Clementine (Winslet), both of whom have decided to undergo a procedure that would completely erase the other from his/her memory. The majority of plot follows Joel as he seeks out the services of Lacuna, a practice run by a doctor (Wilkinson) and his staff (Ruffalo, Dunst and Wood). As they erase his memory overnight, the film plunges into a progression from most recent to earliest of all of Joel's memories involving Clementine. Things are complicated when a mostly unconscious Joel decides, while in his own memories, that he has changed his mind.As Joel goes through his memories, things disappear, his environment magically shifts from one to the next. Some of this is digital effects, but much of it is nifty camera-work. It's hard to understand exactly what's going on, but since the action takes place in Joel's mind, what happens is a mix of Joel's actual memory and his mind's interaction with it. It's a brilliant and surreal trip through someone's mind that exposes more and more about this relationship as it goes, also asking questions along the way about whether erasing someone is ultimately an effective way of dealing with loss.It's a pleasure seeing Carrey take on dramatic role successfully. He seems to be able to channel his goofy energy into the neurotic and self-conscious Joel. Winslet proves her own versatility in taking on Clem, who is a free-spirited fireball, not her traditional dramatic performance, but she really demands your attention. Wilkinson and Dunst also prove to be excellent dramatic side-fodder to illustrate another perspective into the memory erasing concept.Excellent, realistic character portrayal combined with surreal visual drama create a concept of love that while abstract, manages to identify with us because there's a wild, imaginative side of love that only exists in our individual minds. Through the entire film, Gondry makes sure we see the very high and very low points of a relationship and it creates a feeling that Joel and Clementine are meant for each other despite obvious proof that they are somewhat incompatible. This helps further push the film's themes.While ""Eternal Sunshine"" can get confusing and test one's limits at times, a concentrated viewing will show how honest and truthful this film is to not only human relationships, but to the human psyche.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Most Hollywood films tell us we have everything we need within ourselves. This movie indicates that we need each other, even ... when togetherness disrupts happiness. I like the idea of this film.

"""Please let me keep this memory, just this one.""","It's approximately 4:30AM as I am writing this. I've just watched Charlie Kaufman's (as well as Michel Gondry's, of course) most absolute masterpiece once again, and I'm literally trembling with emotion. It saddens me that because of my lacking vocabulary there is no way I'd be able to express the state of mind that I'm currently in, but oh man, I have to try.For some people it's Casablanca with Humphrey Bogart's irresistible charm and Ingrid Bergman's divine beauty, for some it's Chocolat with the ever so handsome hippie-like Johnny Depp, but for me the greatest love story ever caught on film and the one film that I will be watching over and over again for as long as I shall live is Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. With scenes filled with such emotion and such beauty, like the rain sequence with Joel's childhood coming to play, it triggers something so profound in me, that it's simply impossible to describe in words.I have recently gone through a rough patch with my girlfriend, and through my difficulties I find it even more satisfying to watch the main characters' story evolve (or devolve, actually) with such plausible dialogue and with such honesty in details.The heart and soul of this film really are the actors, mainly Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet. They share such enviable chemistry and just seem so perfect for each other, even in moments of argument. Opposites attract, and with Carrey as the insecure and mellow Joel Barish and Winslet as the lively, slightly bipolar Clementine Kruczynski, they make the perfect on-screen couple. Carrey and Winslet are also supported by some great performances by Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood and Tom Wilkinson.The film of course wouldn't be anything if it weren't for Michel Gondry and his unique visual style that gives the film the kind of hand-made look it graves. With little computer-effects, most of the work is done by hand, thus keeping the film even more in the ground as opposed to plunging into CGI-scifi. The color themes and the contrasts that Gondry uses are all coherent and brilliantly selected, and cinematographer Ellen Kuras is doing an amazing job with her raw visual style that fits seamlessly into Gondry's vision. The soundtrack is another thing that deserves endless praise, Beck's bittersweet ""Everybody's Got To Learn Sometime"" is just one of the high points.But it's the story of these two lovers, struggling through their difficulties only to once again find the joy they once shared, that makes this film the masterpieces that it is. It is only by a collaboration of remarkably talented individuals, that something like this can be achieved.""Love conquers all"" might be a worn-out phrase, but after seeing this film it's a little easier to believe that there might be some truth behind it after all.It is now 5AM, and I am already yearning back into the film's world, back into the lives of Joel Barish and Clementine Kruczynski. I am in love all over again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

It's a one of a kind. But most won't like it.,"I loved this movie because it wasn't a remake, and it's original with a unique story line. Hollywood actually can do something new and take a risk. The problem is, the general public didn't like this movie because Jim Carey is funny in it. No He's brilliant.With all the social issues, especially with society being forced to stay away from each other the last two years, and all the personality disorders caused by living our lives through social media, video game personas, and the lack of actual real people in our lives, this movie show these effects on the two main characters. Neither know how to deal with reality.

"""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is a remarkably beautiful, yet equally bizarre exploration of love","""How happy is the blameless vestal's lot! The world forgetting, by the world forgot. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd."" - Alexander PopeMichel Gondry's Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a brilliantly heartfelt and complicated tale that delves, rather flawlessly, into the labyrinth of human emotions and the pain often involved in trying to make a relationship work. Charlie Kaufman, the main writer behind Eternal Sunshine, often allows his ingenuity and talent to infuse the film with perfectly subtle touches of emotion and humanity. His understanding of relationships and the variety of complexities involved is often wondrous to behold.One day, Joel Barrish (Jim Carrey), after falling in love with Clementine (Kate Winslet), finds out that she, due to her recent unhappiness with the relationship, had Joel erased from her memory through a procedure carried out by the Lacuna company. Eventually, Joel, himself, wants the same operation, in order that he can forget Clementine as well. Through this procedure, the film delves into Joel's thoughts and past, chaotically revealing his memories as he eventually attempts to outrun the erasing of them, after realizing how much the lovely moments with Clementine rather largely outweighed the upsetting ones.The cast, from Kirsten Dunst to Jim Carrey, is superb in the portrayal of their characters. In one of his more dynamic roles, Jim Carrey presents Joel Barrish as a complex and three-dimensional character, and seems wholly convincing and sympathetic throughout. Clementine is played absolutely brilliantly by Kate Winslet. Her on-screen chemistry with Carrey is thoroughly entrancing and poignant. The entirety of the supporting cast deliver a subliminally nuanced and engrossing blend of emotions as well.The apparent surrealism deftly blends with the realism in a way that allows the viewer a more complete view of the tale. This subtle relationship between the director, the writer, and the screen is enhanced and brought to life with the assistance of the exceptional cinematography and the seamless transitions and edits.The feelings and expressions throughout the film cast a picture so hauntingly realistic, it's difficult not to see some aspect of a past relationship unfolding on-screen. The engaging and creative ways Gondry and Kaufman explore Joel's memories and dreams is humorous, chaotic, touching, and heartbreaking all at once.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind is a consistently moving and thought-provoking film that remains my favorite film of all time. Simply perfect.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

A Beginning That Never Seems To End Followed By An Ending That Never Seems To Begin,"After almost 20 mind-numbingly incomprehensible minutes that seemed so much longer, it comes as a shock to realize that what one is suddenly seeing floating across the screen is (after 20 minutes, remember) the ""opening"" credits of the movie. This can mean only one thing - and it isn't good news: sweet Jesus, there's still an entire movie to come.I confess that I'm not entirely enamoured of Jim Carrey. I've seen him as a weak part of a good movie (Bruce Almighty) and as the strong part of a weak movie (The Grinch Who Stole Christmas). Either way, he doesn't turn my crank. I don't think I'd ever watch a movie just because the star was Jim Carrey. To be honest, in ""Eternal Sunshine ..."" I'm not sure if he's strong or weak, but it really doesn't matter because the story is absurd, disjointed and not really all that interesting. It had potential. The whole ""erasing negative memories"" had a vaguely Orwellian tone to it that intrigued me (which is why I rented it) but in the end it failed badly. When I find myself hoping (even yearning) for a movie to come to an end, I know it's been a disaster.The most intriguing thing about this movie is the following statement right off the DVD jacket it came in: [""Eternal Sunshine ... is] a memorable film that the Wall Street Journal calls 'a romantic comedy unlike any other."" I can't argue with that - it is ""memorable"" (no matter how hard I'll try to, I don't think I'll ever be able to forget it) and it is ""a romantic comedy unlike any other.""

Eternally My Favorite Film,"I don't know how to describe ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind."" Cliché, I know, but there doesn't seem to be words to describe just how exquisite a film I think it is. I feel like I shouldn't even comment on it because I can't do it justice. There don't seem to be enough adjectives, in any language, to describe how amazing a movie it truly is. But, I guess I have to begin somewhere. Eternal Sunshine is an indescribably marvelous film (isn't that an oxymoron? No, I think I'm probably the moron here,lol). It's a love story unlike any other I've seen before. It isn't filled with the typical Hollywood melodrama that so many so-called ""love stories"" possess where the perfect girl and the perfect guy love each other and want to be together, but they don't know it at first, and somehow, despite their perfection, they can't admit their true feelings until the end when they live happily ever after. Cue the doves flying into the sunset. Eternal Sunshine is nothing like that. It isn't the love story of two otherwise perfect people living in this ethereal and ideal world where the problems are so easily solved. It's a love story between real characters with real faults and flaws, quirks and idiosyncracies. Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet) are human. He's shy, timid, and introverted, she's outgoing, vivacious, but yet somehow broken and sad, unable to maintain a sense of normalcy and familiarity. Clementine becomes bored quite easily, and Joel is threatened when Clementine cannot be exactly what he wants her to be. He gets annoyed at her for the very same reasons he fell in love with her, and their relationship suffers as a result of their incapacity to be what the other needs, and to keep their romance fresh. Clementine opts to undergo a new procedure to have her memories of Joel wiped clean, and he has to come to terms with that and decide if he really wants to erase her from her memories. I don't want to spoil the movie for those of you who haven't seen it, so I'll wrap it up here. You'll fall in love with them both. So, watch it because it's a great story, it doesn't have a linear plot but you will be mesmerized by the acting and the vivid visuals and the overall beautiful cinematography of the film.

Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman once again baffles the mind and logic of cinema with another patented loopy love story set on end this time with a sad sack (Carrey) who discovers his ex-girlfriend (Winslet) has had a procedure done to literally erase all memory of his existence which prompts him into a spontaneous spiteful choice to do likewise with unexpected circumstances to crop up, namely love is a powerful thing to try to forget. Filmmaker Michel Gondry (who adapted Kaufman's equally goofy 'Human Nature') manages to technically get the feel for a second rate sci-fi appeal to the film with some unique camera trickery but there is scarcely any believable chemistry between the two principals (maybe that's the point? If so then it works)  not to dismiss their excellent turns here; it just felt like something was missing to make it an instant classic.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"Let Me Count The Ways In Which This Movie Deserves A ""10""","I've watched several hundred movies in the past three years and haven't felt the need to write many reviews at IMDb.com, but for some reason I feel the need to defend this movie. Why that is I am uncertain, particularly since less than 10 percent of the ratings for this movie have been below a ""7"". But those who hate it...man do they ever seem to hate it.First of all, there are several reviewers who merely decided to say this movie was ""crap"", with no thought or reasoning as to why that is. They are irrelevant until they are willing to defend their opinion. Of those who pointed out specific deficiencies, nearly all of them were--in my opinion--incorrect. The editing? That's the style of this movie. If it isn't your cup of tea that's fine, but to act as though it was unprofessional of the editor is ridiculous. The acting? You must be joking. It's a wonderful cast, and in my opinion they are in top form. And you have never seen Kate Winslet and seldom seen Jim Carrey doing anything like this. Not original? Again, you must be joking. For god's sake, it has Charlie Kaufman's name on it and that's about all you need to know. Below average for Kaufman? I think that it's every bit as good a script as ""Being John Malkovich"" or ""Adaptation""--but I feel that this is a better movie than either of those. Not funny? There are a few laughs, but I'm unsure why this movie was ever classified a ""comedy"" in the first place. However, I don't think a movie is *required* to be funny, just good. Hard to follow? I knew little about the premise before watching the movie and had no trouble following it; that wasn't the case with several other movies I could name. If you listen before the opening credits when it's made clear that what is taking place happened on ""Valentine's Day 2004"", it helps immensely (although unless I am remembering something incorrectly, that would rather strangely constitute playing hooky from an office job on Saturday).What this movie qualifies as is a particularly original romance. And the healthy dose of skepticism and reality toward romance that are thrown in the mix (particularly at the end) doesn't detract from that at all. That's quite an accomplishment to me. It's worthy of one of the few ""10"" ratings I'll ever give on IMDb.com. And of the hundred or so movies I've seen from the 21st Century, I can't think of a better one. If it isn't up for Best Picture, AMPAS will have made yet another major blunder.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
The greatest hallmark-ish film ever,"For me there is always some great comfort in the grainy technically terrible looking films from the early and mid 2000's. Maybe it's the nostalgia, or maybe it's the joy of seeing now beloved actors working in their prime. But with this comfort comes the paired bracing for a bad film that needs the seasoning of nostalgia to be palatable. And for the beginning of Eternal Sunshine, this looked to be the case. The frantic and chopped up cinematography with a sickly sweet love story looked like the appetizer for some 2000's romcom mediocrity. Imagine surprise then when this turned into an Inception-before-inception trip packaged in a romantic drama.The acting from the two leads, Jim Carry and Kate Winslet are absolutely top notch. Believable, frantic, frustratingly real with their own stubbornness and idiosyncrasies. Simply great. And let me give credit as well for the thematics of the entire film. It is happy and hopeful yet tinged with a desperation in the passage of time and of decisions regretted. Moreover, the technical side of the film has aged surprisingly very well. The CGI special effects are used tastefully and sparingly and is possibly going to age even better than its 2010's pseudo analog in Inception. The scenes that probably never looked good were the ones that played with size and perspective; it was a fun try but ultimately not all that successful. Kaufman and Gondry make the non-linear storytelling a breeze to ride for the audience and should be applauded for their edits to the original schizophrenia of the original script. I also did not realize Mark Ruffalo was in this film until he took off his glasses which gave me a great laugh.There is not all that much to complain about with the film. I suppose there is some level of deus ex machina in the ending but with suspended belief, we can accept some of it. I think that perhaps one of the solutions that the main characters try seems more plausible, but I digress.I really wonder coming out of the film whether the writers knew they had a gem on their hands as opposed to a decent fun holiday(ish?) film. It certainly is only a few decisions from turning from Oscar-bait into a Hallmark film. Fortunately for us, we got the good ending.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
my love,"A little sad, very touching and incredibly charming film. I find the parallels between these films more than apt, as both films are very similar both in their overall story development and in their portrayal of the power of love between a man and a woman on screen, they choose the same target as the Object. Influences are the heart of the viewer.I was pleasantly surprised by his playing with Jim Carrey, whom I had never taken seriously before. Kate Winslet very organically fit into the image of her heroine - the complete opposite of the hero of Jim Carrey, a reckless and emotionally unrestrained girl who, depending on the mood of everyday life, dyes her hair on her head. When two polar people find each other, love arises between them, and then neither the contradictions of characters, nor the new advanced scientific method of erasing memories from memory, which will eventually prove completely untenable, can interfere with their feelings. .
Visually, the picture is perceived very easily, and I think it will appeal to even those who are not particularly fond of films about love.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Anything is better than not loving at all,"How happy is the blameless vestal's lot!The world forgetting, by the world forgot.Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind!Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resigned...That was 18th Century English poet Alexander Pope. This stanza is quoted by one of the characters of the film who makes the adorable mistake of calling him ""Pope Alexander"". It is quite the beautiful stanza, good enough to impress people, as that was what said character was trying to do. But besides that, the quote also makes a great point. It claims that happiness can only be found in nothingness because someone who demands nothing, needs nothing. Therefore, that someone has everything.But writer Charlie Kaufman alongside director/writer Michel Gondry challenge this philosophy by adhering to the ideology that man's happiness is, in fact, not found in having everything, but rather in their ability to want. Even modern philosophers like Jacques Lacan believed this. But I will not get into it. I will leave that to Kaufman, one of the greatest writers of this Century, to elaborate. He is a writer interested--like myself--in the place where the common and the esoteric clash. His characters are everyday working class people and he puts them through philosophical conundrums and thought experiments. It's one thing to put the question: ""What would you do if?""... It's another to live it.The main character is Joel Barish (Jim Carrey). But even while portrayed by the shapeless, flamboyant actor, Joel is anything but. He is a somber, bored out of his life downer. He then meets an exact opposite--the outgoing, colorful (in more ways than one) and ""impulsive""--as she calls herself--Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet). You know the saying that opposites attract and the movie sticks by it, but Clementine is a handful and while she does her best to unwind Joel, she only succeeds up to one point. Even in the most playful scenes he can only relax so much. They make a great couple. Until they don't anymore.They eventually break up, and while the details for why are never disclosed, it's safe to say they both suffered greatly after. But there is a solution--an experimental medical procedure to erase the memory of your significant other and to cull the suffering. Joel, while baffled by the fact that something like this even exists, gets on with it. Here is an example of why this is a great movie. In any other film, the place where Joel goes to get his procedure would have been presented with all the sci-fi panache--perhaps it would've been a secret underground laboratory filled with bizarre research and visual conglomerates but in here it looks like any other doctor's office. The employees are also pretty casual about it. Mary (Kirsten Dunst) the secretary, Stan (Mark Ruffalo) and Patrick (Elijah Wood) the guys who do the procedure and Dr. Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) take their job pretty casually--FDA approved and all, I suppose.Here's where one might argue: how come something like this is treated with such normality? It makes no sense in the real contemporary world the movie takes place. But no movie takes place in the real world. A new world is created every single time a script is written. Any movie takes place in a real world which simply warps reality in the areas in which the movie takes place. In sci-fi epics, an entire galaxy might me warped; here is only a town. So, can there exist such a medical procedure simply because Charlie Kaufman says so? Of course! Call it a new iteration. In here, Stan and Patrick go to Joel's house, they put a funny looking metal hat on his head while he sleeps, connect it to a computer and literally delete blocks of his memory containing Clementine. Nothing they haven't done before. Hell, they can even put the thing on auto-pilot. At one point, Mary arrives--she is romantically involved with Stan--and starts looking through Joel's fridge while he's asleep. Not soon enough both she and Stan get high and Stan begins to argue why The Clash was the only band that mattered. I love this stuff. This is not only for comedic effect, but also to keep things as unpretentious as possible, and let the philosophical implications of such a procedure speak for themselves rather than being pushed on through cheap dramatization.But while I thought that this might be why I adore this movie so much, while it certainly contributes to it, is not the biggest selling point. Nor is it the ending which states that no matter how lost they become, two souls who are made for each other will always get back together. No, it's the realization that it wasn't the bad memories that made Joel suffer, but the good ones; memories, constantly reminding himself of the great moments he spent together with Clementine and the impossibility of making new ones. During the removal process, Gondry and Kaufman treat us to surreal but not overly saturated scenes inside Joel's head as things, including Clementine, literally vanish around him. It is at that point when he doesn't want to go through with the procedure anymore. For him, it was better that he loved and suffered, rather than to not have loved at all.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

ESOTSM was a frustrating experience for me. This is full of beautifully acted scenes which are well directed and feel meaningful. Jim Carry has never been better and probably should have been nominated for an Oscar. Kate Winslet is completely superb. Those moments are strong and enjoyable and decently directed. That's what I want to see. I don't want to see what follows, which is a load of bizarre, surreal science fiction nonsense which is just confusing but that's what I get. I can enjoy beautifully acted scenes of drama or I can watch some nonsensical inside your head rubbish which hyper-actively zips from scene to scene like Twitchy the squirrel from Hoodwinked. I cannot do both at the same time.Easily one of the most overrated films of the 2000s, ESOTSM is an interesting film instead of a particularly good one. It's well acted, though Kirsten Dunst who is well regarded for some reason is pretty weak. The direction is OK and there is some very clever writing. Sadly, it's just a great big mess. As a result of the films insistence on surreal stupidity, it loses its message and its emotional impact. As Jim Carry races through his mind trying to avoid allowing his memories to be erased, 2 other characters are trying to find him on a computer. That is like me trying to keep up with the message of this movie. To be fair, it has some promising early scenes and there are various truths about love and heartache which feel genuine and important. Thankfully, the film doesn't veer into sentimental stupidity and isn't anyway near as unbearable as many other romantic dramas from the 2000s. There is definitely sunshine here, but it certainly isn't eternal. Everyone else seems to love this movie, so it seems I am alone in my opinion. It's well acted and written at times and I may give it another go. If I can even be bothered, which is doubtful.5/10",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
How happy is the blameless vestal's lot!,"Amazing film that has changed and shaped my life. Highly recommended. The impact of Winslet and Carry's performances is completely unforgettable. If people have been through any sort of rift in a relationship they will completely understand the film. Though I am sure there are people who don't and with that in mind cannot fully comprehend the movie. Kaufman is brilliant. The scenes shot in New York (especially Grand Central) are amazing, and accurate. Montauk in the winter is completely isolated. Everything was done correctly in this film which is a relief. As well the film has a great soundtrack with very diverse music. I love this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
When weird things feel natural,"The greatest thing about this movie is that there are really weird science fiction kind of staff going on but the movie doesn't feel like a science fiction movie or even a weird movie , it all feels natural. Reason for this are :1)Honesty : the actual love story is one of the most honest ones , it has its ups and downs like real life ,there are some serious things they don't like about each other , they will never live happily ever after , yet you feel like they might always love each other and its heart warming.2)Acting :very natural , staying away from overacting , Jim Carrey actually surprised me , he should have an Oscar nomination but ironically you need to overact for that.3)Lightning and camera : i read that Michel Gondry didn't want to use any lightning at all but they used some in the end , the camera also reminds you that it's there , it's shaking a little , these even sometimes make you feel like you are watching a documentary.While they tried to market it as a romantic comedy , i think this is an anti-romantic comedy , a very sad and deep movie. with the things falling apart in most of the time in the movie i felt like my heart was falling apart. and with lines like ; "" Clementine: This is it, Joel. It's going to be gone soon. Joel: I know. Clementine: What do we do? Joel: Enjoy it.

Polarizing,"I suppose the 2000s was the decade of polarizing movies. The Royal Tenenbaums, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, About Schmidt, Requiem for a Dream and this movie. Either these movies are loved or hated. Rarely are the opinions luckwarm. I was one that loved this because it was a uniquely different romantic comedy. A genre I do not enjoy. I was also not a fan of Charlie Kaufman's earlier story, Being John Malkovic. That failed for me in alot of major ways compared to this movie though it takes the same different approach. Felt the ending was flat in that.This is basically a romantic comedy with splashes of drama and sci fi thrown into the mix. Not too much of those elements get mixed in to change it from what it is. I suppose people have to relate to the characters desires early on to understand the plot enough in order to enjoy the movie. Ive known people who are perfectly happy trying to drag a friendship out of doomed relationship even if what they drag out is something like those creatures in Cronenberg's The Brood. I prefer to break clean and permanently and prefer to date someone who relates to that. Its less complicated to move on.Story does get a little corny at times and perhaps thats where my dislike for romantic comedies kicks in. As I said, not my cup of tea but this is unique enough to be entertaining despite that.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

"Are we happy, or do we only think we are?","Charlie Kaufman writes movies with uniquely bizarre premises and utterly human themes. In Being John Malkovich, he deals with identity, aspirations, and the hard reality of existence. Adaptation is about the creative struggle and the need to adapt and evolve with the circumstances. In Synecdoche, New York he presents us with a stylized look at our perception of life and other people. In Eternal Sunshine he searches through the meaning of love and memory. All of these descriptions are trite, insufficient, and probably inaccurate. They are, however, what I recall learning from and seeing in the films.I just re-viewed Eternal Sunshine. I think it is his best script, and one of the best scripts of the 00′s. In all his films, Kaufman is able to create a bizarre world filled with eccentric characters that are surprisingly like each of us. I have not had to deal with the rise and fall of a relationship like Joel and Clementine do in the movie. I have had to deal with the peaks and valleys of ones. I can most certainly understand the place memory holds in our value system.I recently saw a lecture on the meaning of happiness. The speaker noted that there are two main types of happiness: that which comes from experiencing and that which comes from remembering. This movie very effectively illustrates that there is a disconnect between the two. The lecturer noted that people who moved from Ohio to California would say that they are happier. They aren't. They remember the hard winters and are comparing their present experience to their memories. We tend to filter our memories to extremes, either very good or very bad. We tend to not place emphasis on the middle.One of the many problems with Joel and Clementine in the movie is that they place more emphasis on present experience rather than memory. In the end, Joel comes to realize the importance of memory, and its supremacy to the present. Even though he knows his relationship with Clementine will probably fail, he is will to move ahead, if only for the pleasant memories of pleasant times.The themes of this movie are similar to the themes of Dark City, another very good movie. The two might make an interesting double-feature, even though the forms of the movies are very different.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

this film is not as good as it's first impression's make it seem,"I usually only review movies that just came out but I just saw this film last night and it struck me in an odd way so I decided to review it. One of my judges of a good movie that you find yourself thinking about the film several days after seeing it, I saw this film like 8 hours ago and I'm convinced I won't get it out of my head for the rest of the week. In fact this movie had such a weird profound effect on me I took a walk after seeing it just to get it clear in my head, and you know what consolation I came to while walking, this film is not as good as it's first impression's make it seem.Oh don't get me wrong Eternal Sunrise is a good film, by many standards, but it pulls of the cleaver trick of being so weird that you automatically assume it's amazingly good. Vanilla Sky pulled the same trick, but I saw it for the piece of crap it was. This film is better than Vanilla Sky, but not better than say 12 Monkeys.After my mind swam through the weirdness I came to some realizations about this film. One is that it is a Romance; I know Wikipedia says it's a Science Fiction Neo-Surrealist, but it's a Romance. And my main judge for a good romance is, do you fall in love with the girl as much as the main character does? And for this film the answer to this is a resounding no. I know all guys are into different ""Types"" of girls but there are some qualities in women that most men like and incorporating those into one ""ultimate girl package"" is in many ways the job of Romances (innless you're a girl reading this then it's the ""ultimate guy package""). One of the reasons why I liked Yes Man so much was because Zooey Deschanel's character pulled this off so well, hell I still have a crush on her after seeing that movie. But you have to be delicate about this, if you try too hard to create ""Mega Girlfriend"" then the audience realizes what you're up to and the allusion is broken. This happened in There's Something About Mary, I really couldn't stand that film because Mary was so unrealistically appealing that I felt like meting Gandalf the Gray was more likely than meting her.Anyway the Point I am getting at here is that Kate Winslet's character has the right idea, as far as being universally appealing, but takes it too far. Thought there are many different kinds of ""Mega Girls"" one of the most popular forms is the ""Lively Spontaneous Girl"" and this is clearly what the movie is shooting for with Kate Winslet. But instead of being lively and spontaneous in a cute fun way, she overdoes it and comes off more like one of those weird smelly girls who works at Spencer's Gifts. OK I'll admit maybe the guy writing this film was going for that, but I doubt it. In fact most of the characters in this film aren't very likable, and beyond that they're almost impossible to identify with. Jim Carey is supposed to be shy and aloof, but to me he comes off more as needy and cowardly. The only real character I liked was one of the films apparent Antagonists, who I would give more info about if it didn't mean risking spoilers.But despite this flaw Eternal Sunrise is a movie worth seeing if only for the experience of it. Though the characters suck the actors playing them do a good job, unlike a lot of weird films it does a pretty good job of explaining itself to the audience, and if you can manage to understand the ending (which is hard) it's an extremely satisfying one. It's a good weird film just with some nasty looking smudges one it that I wanted to point out.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Wow!,"What a story. Emotions in utter tumult after watching this. (What to do next? Well, I guess I'll finish the review. But why? What's the point?) It has a sci-fi premise that would ordinarily put me off but the whirling story never veers off its hub of exploring love. And anyway, the SF treatment is administered by Tom Wilkinson, who never disappoints. Speaking of actors, the ever brilliant Kate Winslet is at the top of her game here. It's so easy to go over the top when you're playing the crazy one and just take us into zany land and leave reality behind, but the story demands that she keeps it more real and she exercises such exquisite control. I wonder how Jim Carrey would have played that role! Don't get me wrong, he's fantastic too here as the more down-to-earth one - probably his best performance that I've seen and a clever bit of casting. Wait, I've got an odd feeling in my gut.

"A smart, funny and ingenious film that goes beyond your wildest imagination in a subtle and powerful way... Must watch","""How happy is the blameless vestal's lot! The world forgetting, by the world forgot. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd."" - Alexander PopeJoel and Clementine, once a happy couple, break-up. Joel can't take Clementine out of his head so he decides to patch up. He then learns an unbelievable truth that she had a clinic named Lacuna ""erase"" all of her memories related to Joel. Joel too out of anger decides to take on the procedure of erasing Clementine-memories from his head.Okay, I know what some may think. This is totally weird, right? But with Michel Gondry and Charlie Kaufman, the screenwriters, weird stories always become entertaining that has undeniably smart elements. Eternal Sunshine remains their best work to date. It's an unforgettable psychological journey in a person's brain, his dreams, his desires captured with such contrast and vivid beauty that you will be left asking for more. At first, we feel quite envious of the technology that literally removes ""pain"" from our minds. The direction and screenplay capture this magnificently by taking us in Joel's head and actually showing us in their way how it happens. But soon this desire dies out with a deep emotion of dissatisfaction. Because Joel watches these memories fade away, he gets a second chance to relive them. He then understands that memories, however painful, are vital. I really wanted this erasing thing to exist in real life at first but then the film's extremely strong presentation made me change my mind. This impressive part makes the whole non-linear experience unexpected, thought-provoking and excites us to a higher level of curiosity.Once Eternal Sunshine grips us through it's smart allegory, it keeps getting better and better. What I loved most was the unexpected conclusion that forces us to wonder about the fate of the characters. What I loved more is that the film also never forgets the supporting cast, especially the ""erasers"" who work at Lacuna. During the erasing scene, which is the highlight of the entire film, the film kind of switches back and forth from Joel's memories to the real world. They show us the interaction of the Lacuna gang (Elijah Wood, Kirstin Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Tom Wilkinson). As we surge through Joel's emotions, theirs too is not overlooked. The screenplay smartly shows us how we human beings feel emotions, how we look at the person who's memory we are erasing and the person who's having it erased. In Short, Eternal Sunshine has a weird but differently smart screenplay that works which also won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay in 2005. The Direction has a wonderful ""flow"" in it. The Cinematography has a beautiful colorful saturation and the score, wow, it just syncs with the flow. The film has impressive visual effects too that adds to the stunning imagery of Joel's memories.Now, the acting. First of all, I have never seen Jim Carrey act a serious character before. Joel is boring, dull, seeks solitude. I still wonder how he did that. This proves that Jim Carrey is more of a versatile actor rather than a comedian. Kate Winslet portrays the energetic, over-talkative Clementine, a complete opposite of Joel. She was nominated for the Oscar for this role and it's quite worth it. The most difficult part is bringing two completely opposites together to love each other which is pulled off perfectly by the two artists. Then comes the Lacuna gang. Wow, another surprise here. Their acting was realistic, if simply put.In conclusion, Eternal Sunshine is a spotless masterpiece. It's that piece of cinema that tries to approach film-making from a whole new perspective and the result is memorable. The film convinced me of the moral fact that even if you put someone out of your memory, you can't put them out of your heart.

Sublime,"With his first two successful screenplays, Charlie Kaufman established himself as one of the most creative and idiosyncratic screenwriters in the business. But with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind he builds on this reputation further, showing a soft side that had previously been barely hidden behind his oft-charming middle-aged neurosis. It helps that this script is just as groundbreaking as that of Being John Malkovich or Adaptation.Kauffman's stand-in this time around is Joel Barish, a sweet loser played with his best sad puppy-dog face by Jim Carrey. It is difficult to tell you anything about Joel's romantic situation as it stands at the beginning of the movie, because doing so could partially reveal the truly ingenious plot structure. Suffice it to say that Barish is unlucky and unconfident with women and Kauffman beautifully plays with how we view Joel's situation.The basic premise is that Joel finds out that his longtime girlfriend, Clementine, played vibrantly by Kate Winslet, has had him erased from her memory using a new procedure developed by Dr. Howard Mierzcwak, with Tom Wilkinson playing the doctor to perfection. Joel, who is so grief-ridden by this turn of events, impulsively decides to have Clementine erased from his own mind. Mierczwak gets the treatment going immediately.The procedure consists of Joel being knocked out, strapped to his bed, and having a strange device attached to his head, while technicians delete the unpleasant memories overnight. Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood are the technicians, who along with Kirsten Dunst as Ruffalo's girlfriend raid Joel's liquor cabinet and start to have a good time. Ruffalo is a good-hearted loser, but Wood is up to something more deplorable, something that we begin to learn about gradually over the course of the erasing.Much of the movie takes place in Joel's own head, as he run through his distant memories of Clementine, who he gradually begins to realize he still loves. These scenes are executed with a perfect sense of surrealism by the talented music video director Michel Gondry, who establishes himself here as a true visionary. Unlike Spike Jonze he brings in mostly hand-held cameras which make the in-your-face surrealism of these scenes even more potent.But the movie's truest strength lies in the purity of the love story between Joel and Clementine. It is a realistic yet wholly uncynical portrait of a real couple. However quirky Clementine may be (and believe me, quirky she is), the couple has real problems, and their love is a viable force.To add to this, we get to see sides of Carrey and Winslet that have not yet been exposed until now. Carrey fully opens himself up emotionally. In every glance you see the self-doubt, the sadness, and the true love for Clementine, even when they first meet. Winslet feels more alive here than ever before, she has made what could have been a gimmick a person who feels intrinsically real, she inhabits the character entirely, making it her own and daring us not to like her despite her flaws.But it all comes back to Kauffman, who shows that he not only can blow your mind with his creativity, plot structure and surrealism, but he opens us up to his human side here and it is enough to break your heart and make you jump for joy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Love this movie. Very motivated,"I had shown Eternal sunshine for 10 times. Now, I get a chance to make a review here. What I like the film most? the chemistry between Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet. Unbelievable, that Jim Carrey can act like that. Not stupid but boring man. Usually I seen Jim Carrey movie like comedy such as Ace Ventura, dumb and dumber. But he is kind of different he. He really merge to Joel Barish character. Boring man but make us pity and love him at once. Kate Winslet, did a good act too here. I love the way Kate Winslet express the Clementine character. She made Clementine lovable, cheer full but also insecure. very human.

"The most moving, unblinking and surprising exploration of a relationship","Although packaged in fictional science and a pretzel logic plot, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is actually one of the deepest and most honest explorations of the risk, passion, irrationality and fragility of human relationships. Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet) are both mismatched and perfect for each other. We feel the true attraction of Joel and Clementine, while also seeing how they trip each other up. These contrary elements can be found in most real-world relationships, but are seldom portrayed with such truth and reality as in this movie. Usually in movies the tension between the attraction of partners and the flaws that repel them is treated as a stock motivation for the characters. In Eternal Sunshine, these features are deeply explored by the characters and revealed to us in ways that more conventional movies cannot approach.This raw truth in the movie is created in equal parts by the performances of Carrey and Winslet and by the unusual technological challenge to their relationship and the looping and reversing narrative that results. Every moment that Joel and Clementine are together the electricity flows between them--both positive and negative. This movie is a high water mark for screen chemistry between actors, and all of the chemistry fills in the full and passionate relationship of the characters. Forget about the twisting plot and the memory-erasing technology; the relationship, chemistry and performances of Carrey and Winslet alone would make this a great movie.Nevertheless, the fictional technology at the core of Eternal sunshine allowed Joel and Clementine to make choices that we in the real world cannot; and the consequences for Joel and Clementine only serve to intensify and deepen the revelation of their characters and relationship to themselves and to the movie audience. It is the kind of technology that could have been a gimmick or a distraction, but instead was used by Charlie Kaufman (screenplay) and Michael Gondry (director) to explore what makes a relationship tick. Yes, the world of this movie is completely strange and the narrative structure is fragmented and looping. But the relationship between Joel and Clementine always remains central and every odd situation and every twist back illuminates the characters. The ""trickiness"" of the screenplay is never used just to be clever or throw the audience off.The strange and fictional science of Eternal Sunshine takes Joel, Clementine and us to places we have never gone in movies or in real life, but every aspect of Joel and Clementine as persons in a relationship are completely real and fully realized.

(Nicholas Cage must have turned the part down.) The false timeline (the beginning of the film is really the end of the film)is a poor story devise.  The inconsistencies show up quickly, but aren't explained until the end of the movie.Finally, although the science is very sketchy, the memory-erasing technology is the ultimate form of deus ex machina.

"An ""Eternally""  Smart Film","""Eternal Sunshine"" is one of the rare films that actually overcomes its flaws completely and makes itself into a great film without dishing everything out to the audience. There's no real format to the film. It jumps from place to place, often confusing the viewer for a moment, but creating a unique and rewarding experience.The acting in the film is great across the board. Jim Carrey gives a very good, but not quite Oscar-caliber turn as Joel, a quiet writer whose dull nature destroys any true fun in his relationships. Kate Winslet plays Clementine, an impulsive and energetic woman whose hair color is constantly changing as her relationship with Joel does. Winslet is really the shining star in the film. She is beautiful, vibrant, and full of life, bringing an edge to the film. It's truly a shame she wasn't put in the Supporting Actress section of the Oscars, where she could have had a win. Elijah Wood is annoying as usual, but he's playing an annoying character so it's passable. Tom Wilkinson is very good as the doctor behind the whole experiment that is the basis of the film, and Kirsten Dunst is surprisingly fantastic in a small role as the doctor's secretary. The plot itself is fantastic, truly delving into the mind and memories of Joel. Carrey is a little over the top at times, but he still moves through the film well with help from the leading lady. This is an extraordinary, Oscar-nomination worthy film, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a smart film that is also funny and dramatic at times.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
This movie gains your attention and keeps it for the entire runtime,"I am slightly late to the party with this movie since it is from 2004, but I must say that this movie is absolutely perfect. Top to bottom I could not see a flaw with this movie, at multiple points in the film I kept asking myself: How does someone come up with this idea and execute it to perfection?!The entire cast managed to tell 5+ stories at the same time in only 1 hours and 45 minutes. Today, most franchises use a whole trilogy to tell a story that has 10% of the weight that this movie does.It does such an amazing job to get you intrigued, then confuse you and lastly make everything so obvious and complete. When I watch movies, the ending has to be amazing for me to give a 10/10. Ending are in my opinion just as important as the whole story and this ending left me without a single piece of criticism. I'd love to review the story and how deep everything is but I tend to lean away from spoiler reviews.If you were like me and have been putting off watching this movie for no reason, drop whatever you're doing and go watch it right away.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Reel Review: Life on the Big Screen,"The things we don't want to remember aren't the things we need to forget.The world is a different place for the heartbroken. This line is notoriously said by Taylor Swift, one who's arguably had more heartbreaks (and songs about them) than anyone else on the planet. Anyone who's had a broken heart will tell you how they tried to forget the person they loved. I did it. I deleted the selfies we took together. I gave their sweatshirts back. I threw away the necklaces they gave me. I got rid of the physical objects that reminded me of that person thinking that if I threw away the parts of the relationship I could see I would somehow forget all of these things that I couldn't see. These feelings of love, companionship, joy, peace, comfort that were deep inside of me.Joel Barrish (Jim Carrey) is living in this new world. Joel has been left heartbroken by his girlfriend Clementine (Kate Winslet). Joel decides that he just can't take it anymore. The tears. The hurt. The memories. All of it. So he does what we all do. He tries to forget. He tries to forget their fights and arguments and everything that went wrong with their relationship. Fortunately for Joel, there's an organization that can help him do just that- forget that Clementine ever existed. It's a simple procedure. You go to sleep and BOOM! You wake up forgetting what you didn't want to remember, and you don't even remember that you forgot! A whole new and fresh life is ahead of you, free of tears, hurt, and memories. Well, mostly.As Joel undergoes the procedure, he realizes that Clementine isn't someone he wants to forget. He quickly sees that along with all the rough patches in their relationship, there were moments of paradise.Realizing he made a mistake, Joel quickly tries to reverse the procedure. The audience follows along as Joel gets to enter and relive his memories as they are being erased. The film's compelling plot is executed beautifully by the film's performances, screenwriting and directing.Both characters are all too relatable and portrayed beautifully by the movie's astounding cast. Jim Carrey impressively portrays a shy, creative, heart-broken Joel and dazzles the audience with his range, a far more serious role than he usually plays. Kate Winslet portrays a free spirited, impulsive Clementine with a truly awe inspiring performance. Kirsten Dunst appears in the film portraying a complicated character Mary (who works for the memory-erasing organization) with ease. All these actors give (in my opinion) their best performances to date.The dialogue is so beautifully complex that it gives the Bible competition, truly stunning work by screenwriter Charlie Kaufman. So many lines sit in your mind long after the film is over. If I recited every line that made me think, your eyes would never leave this review.The timeline is beautifully unique with it's non-chronological format, an individual stylistic choice by director Michael Gondry. The very beginning of the movie is an event that happens almost last chronologically. It makes the movie exciting to watch, but it's also not too difficult to understand.What I love most about the film is that it shatters the conventional romantic comedy stereotype. This story is not all sunshine and unicorns. You see both the good and bad of the relationship. The film truly embodies what it's like to be in love, and what it's like to be heart-broken, and that makes it far from a typical love story.Love is a weird thing that gets ahold of us. When we fall in love, we never want to fall out of it, but when we do, we try desperately to forget it ever existed in the first place. But ultimately, we remember it anyway. The point of this film is that the things we don't want to remember aren't the things we need to forget. My breakup left me heartbroken, but it also left me with some of the most important lessons of my life. I learned that pain doesn't last forever. I learned that sometimes life doesn't stop sucking. I learned that if he's talking to 30 other girls on Snapchat, you're probably not his only girlfriend. Joel wanted to forget Clementine, but he needed to remember her.So many of us try to forget things that we could benefit greatly by remembering. The truth is, we spend a lot of time focusing on the bad parts of failed relationships. We remember how we fought over our future plans, how we became jealous of the guys that they were ""just friends"" with, how they left us at a hockey game on our first date. (Office reference anyone? Too obscure? My bad.) The truth is, there were good things too, and these good things are worth remembering. First kisses, dates to the very best restaurants, baking cookies, making snow angels, discovering favorite movies. These are things you're going to want to remember someday. The things that hurt now teach us lessons in hindsight. They can also make for some pretty great stories someday.Reel Rater Rating:

Is this some sort of a joke?,How is this movie rated 8.3? Is this some sort of a sick joke or something? I guess we really do live in the post-truth society where facts don't matter anymore. While we are at it we might as well start giving Oscar awards to Youtube videos.There is no possible universe where this movie is worth 8.3 or even a 7 or 6. This is one of the most overrated movies I've ever watched. I had to force myself to finish it and even fastforwarded most of it.There is no cohesion in the plot and no lesson to be learned. No point and no character development. If you watch it as a comedy it's not funny either. There are no redeeming qualities about this movie other than Jim Carrey's acting.,7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"Imaginative, unique love story","Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) is one of the best films I've ever seen. The plot revolves around Clementine (Kate Winslet) and Joel (Jim Carrey). They play a couple who's relationship has crumbled.Clementine ends up going to a doctor who specializes in this procedure that erases memories you would like to forget, and she erases all memory of Joel. After Joel finds out that she has done this, he also decides to have the procedure done. During the procedure, he starts to change his mind and doesn't want to let go of certain memories of her.This film features incredible performances by every single cast member. Kate Winslet in particular gives a remarkable performance, very deserving of that Academy Award nomination. And Jim Carrey is also great here, this is probably my favorite film of his filmography. If anyone thinks Carrey is only capable of doing comedy, then I'd suggest they watch this one, because he nails it. Kirsten Dunst gives a skilled supporting performance, as does Ruffalo, Wilkinson, and Wood.The writing is so well done and balanced. The dialogue between Clementine and Joel is very revealing and written in a beautiful way. When you cast great artists such as the two leads and give them writing like this, it's just bound to be a hit.I for sure suggest this wonderful film! 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

"""Spotless"" is one large stain.","Jim Carrey once again attempts to be taken serious as an actor along with Kate Winslet playing a Madonna manque in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Shapeless but with lots of tricks, writer Charles Kaufman's banal dialogue has to be rescued on cue by either a surreal happening or reversing course in jarring fashion. A romantic, science fiction hybrid, it fails miserably on both levels.Two misfits meet in Montauk one cold morning. Sad sack Joel (Carrey) and mercurial Clementine (Kate Winslet) somehow click and a romance begins. When besotted Joel visits her with gifts at the store she does not even recognize him. It turns out she's had a procedure to erase Joel from memory. Joel pained by the experience decides he wants to go through the same procedure under the guidance of a trio of irresponsible assistants.(Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood). In the interim the story confusingly switches from reality to Joel's haywire procedure allowing the director Michael Gondry to work on a variety of levels.Simpering and slovenly Carrey once again fails to register dramatically, his hang down demeanor and sheepish poor lugubrious me turn one extended self pity party of dealing with past, present and supernatural. Winslet is whimsically trying while Dunst, Ruffalo and Wood dimwit stooges spout insipid dialogue and act like 10 year olds.There's a handful of eye popping visuals but cinematographer Ellen Kuras lensing is pedestrian in moments, especially around lighting. Given the freedom of padding human emotion with sci-fi both writer and director make the most of these liberties but in doing so fail to tell a coherent, grounded story with this overall shallow and disheveled slight of hand film.",3.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

"So Kaufman is Amazing, We can all Agree on that Right?","This film somehow manages to mix the most boring, realistic, everyday stuff with just pure fantasy in a way almost indescribable. When the film finished I wasn't sure if I wanted to sit down and write an essay on the failings of my life or sprint out the front door on a mission to find true love. Often times I watch a film for the director or the stars, for Charlie Kaufman I go solely based off of the fact he's the writer. Kaufman could write a film filled starring only crippled seals, directed by a goat and still the weirdest thing would be his story. He manages to take these crazy concepts though and somehow takes them into some of the most emotional, heartfelt places a film can go. You see yourself in his screenplays in a way that sometimes makes you uncomfortable but is more honest and holds more truth than any other writer has managed. Charlie Kaufman is a god when it comes to writing.Technically this film shines as well. The score is brilliant, it matches the atmosphere of the film perfectly, the cinematography too is excellent. It's a bit different but manages to do things in a way that fits the film's tone. The cast were all fantastic. Jim Carrey is giving the performance of a lifetime, he's often remembered for his comedy but with films like Man on the Moon and The Truman Show he is clearly a brilliant dramatic actor too. Kate Winslet was fantastic, she manages to contrast Carrey and holds her own opposite him. These two stand out but the whole cast is excellent. Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffalo and Kirsten Dunst are great. David Cross, an actor I have a massive soft spot for is also here and while he doesn't get much screen time he shines when he is on screen. Michel Gondry's direction was solid but it's difficult to tell how much was him and how much was Kaufman.This film has cemented itself as one of my favourites. Easily Kaufman's best, although Being John Malkovich is another favourite, this film manages to speak to me in a way no other can. It both scares me for my future while also bringing me hope.

A fantastically melancholic exploration of love,"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind has such a melancholic beauty to it. It simultaneously breaks your heart and puts it back together, all while interweaving this with lovely comedy.It follows Jim Carrey as Joel, a man recently heartbroken following his breakup with Kate Winslet's Clementine. When he discovers a groundbreaking procedure that will allow him to extinguish all memories of her, he jumps at the chance and must then deal with the consequences of his decision. It's a wonderfully inventive concept which is such a great springboard for an exploration of relationships, love, loss, heartbreak, and grief. Despite the sci-fi nature of the central conceit, it still feels like a really grounded film. It is rooted in emotion and doesn't get bogged down in exposition or tired tropes.The performances from the two leads are top notch. Carrey is in slightly different form, playing a more muted and reflective role as opposed to his usual bombastic loud performances. Instead Winslet takes on this more free spirited and boisterous role to great effect. The chemistry between them is so pure and engaging and real and exciting. Two great performances that eke every ounce of emotion and humour from the script. As if this isn't enough, there are top supporting performances from the likes of Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst, and Elijah Wood, who all shine.Having now finally watched this film it is easy to see why it is held in such high regard.

Tale about  new Orpheus  search,"A fight against fear, love and shadows. Story of a special desire and ordinary traps. Grey images and gestures in a cold world, after a small miracle.It is the best character of Jim Carrey.

The past is the same of every person, as temptation to create another place, time and gestures like pieces of memory. It is a subtle poem about sacrifice and error. Story of an old myth with another words, with same nuances. Story about games, looks and labyrinths, about desire and sense of existence, about lies and trust. About the selfishness and about repentance. About new day and its warmth.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

I can definitely see why some people would not like it especially since some might have wanted a Jim Carrey movie. There was one hick however, now that I look back on it, there was a slap on side story about another love story that honestly was not up to part and i would have liked it not to tarnish this masterpiece. Though, I just skipped over it and almost forgot about watching that part since I was so occupied trying to make sense of this brilliant ""mindfuck"" as they say.

My brief review of the film,"An interesting but far too complex film, which although full of many good ideas, does not execute them well. The subject matter would best befit a short science fiction story, and indeed the content of the film is so slim that it quite noticeably outstays its welcome. Like most short stories, the film would have best been told from a first person point of view only. The film threads in the story of the operators, just not just the operated too, however. This causes the film to become distracted from the more interesting part of the tale, and as a result, it is at times quite bland. It is not that the viewer does not understand  there is just no reason to care. All that said and done, the film certainly has interesting elements, and it will keep one watching for at least three quarters of its duration. It is not really a poor film; it is above average, but I feel it could have been done a lot better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

There have been many cinematic attempts to create a surreal environment for the viewer. They usually come off like those awful LSD ""trippy"" movies from the 1970's. This one got it right. It was clear when Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) was experiencing the progressive memory loss and how surreal that was to him. There is a LOT of interesting things going on in the background of many of the scenes in this movie. It is done without upstaging the events in the foreground, too.

The cinematic qualities of the movie are exceptional. What confused me the most was that I didn't like it much.It took me until the next day to realize why the movie left me cold. I didn't like any of the characters. The Jim Carrey character is depressed, lonely and rather pitiful. The Kate Winslet character was a loony.

"Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders","How many times, have we as humans wished to forget someone.

Maybe not a person, but a shameful situation, that time you made a fool on stage or when you just couldn't contain a gas any longer. Now imagine that by a medical treatment you would be able to forget, just like that. That is what happens to Joel's (Jim Carey) girlfriend Clementine (Kate Winslet).When Joel finds out she has decided to forget him, he decides to undertake the same process in order to erase Clementine out of his mind.Joel goes home and goes to sleep, the therapists then come in to apply the treatment. Joel will experience each of his memories involving Clementine in a reverse chronological order, from his last memory until the day he met her. Here we are transported into Joel's mind and at this point is were the expression ""Don't know what you have until its gone"" is applied. Joel finds out he does love CLementine and has now to try to stop a delete process which is no longer under his control.Both of the main performances are genius. Carey proves he can act just as well in a more serious movie. Kate Winslet character is just amazing, I instantly fell in love with her.

"Beautiful Movie, Great Performances!","An all time favourite of mine. While not incredibly gripping from the beginning, once it picks up it really pulls you in. The dream sequences and internal struggle of Joel were very interesting and real, despite being so surreal.Performances of all actors was superb, especially that of Jim Carrey who may surprise you with his ability to play more reserved, shy characters opposed to loud and impulsive ones.One problem I have with this film is the open ending, which is hit or miss.

A thought-provoking exploration of fate and morality,"This is without a doubt one of the most eccentric and weird films ever released - there is nothing quite like it. Without spoiling anything, the premise of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is fascinating and totally unique, exploring themes of fate and morality with an unforgettable tale of the mind.The visual representations of memory are beautifully presented and are in perfect harmony with the story, many of these scenes are engraved into my head because they are just so powerful. There are so many unconventional choices that this movie makes and it pays off so well every single time - several fantastic transitions and pieces of symbolism come to mind. It's well cast, with everybody really giving it their all; our two main characters played by Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are thoroughly entertaining and very well written. The tone is well balanced, managing to maintain the serious themes whilst intertwining elements of comedy and light-hearted romance. Perhaps an overlooked addition, the musical score is wonderfully unique and adds so much to the experience. Additionally, Charlie Kaufman's script is brilliant, layered with subtlety and things that you pick up on if you give it a second watch. It's a beautiful, surreal jumble of a film packed with emotion, drama, and romance, and deserves all the love and praise it gets.You really feel the emotion, and it's thanks to everyone involved in this bizarre production who gave it their all and created something that I would call a masterpiece. There is so much I want to say about this movie, but what I'm really trying to get across here is that you should definitely give this one a watch. 10/10.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"As soon as you get the plot, the movie has very little else to offer","While I enjoyed this movie very much at first, in the end it was a bit disappointing. Like in a detective novel, the plot is hugely important in this film. And while the acting and camera-work are really outstanding IMHO, the plot just isn't up to par; when 2/3's of the movie was over the plot was completely clear to me and the final 1/3 of the movie played out exactly as I figured it would.

But when the sci-fi memory erasing kicks in and they attempt to erase each other from their respective memories is when this movie gets interesting. It is a colorful, wild ride. Not my favorite movie, but it was entertaining. I suppose it was inevitable that Kirsten Dunst's character turns into the woman scorned who returns everyone's memory tapes, but that whole part of the film was a little sleazy. I think all of the performers did amazing characterizations. It was truly unique and gets points just for that. If you are not fond of the weird and the deep, rent Laws of Attraction.

An intelligent movie with wisdom on romance,"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a rare movie with an intelligent script that studies the pain of romantic relationships and breakups. It's quite philosophical and requires thinking. The editing and storytelling styles are unusual which could be challenging to some viewers.In order to understand some of the philosophical ideas behind the script, one needs to be familiar with existentialist philosophy and the ideas of German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche who pioneered existentialist philosophy. Nietzsche believed that pain is essential to human experience. People should not numb their pain. Instead people should use their pain to cultivate their character. He likened the pain to the roots of a plant; the deeper they go, stronger the plant will be. In short, pain builds character.The other concept of Nietszche that stood out to me in the screenplay is the eternal recurrence of events. Nietzsche suggested that events in the universe could be repeating themselves in endless cycle which he called ""eternal recurrence"". Charlie Kaufman probably named the title of the screenplay after this concept. We all know that he knows about Nietzsche as he is quoted a couple of times in the movie (the lines from ""Beyond Good and Evil).The other existentialist concept is the world is what you make of it. It is how you see it and it matters more how you see it than it being an independent reality. If someone erases you from their memory, that doesn't take anything away from the goodness of memories themselves. If they mean so much to you and still a part of you then that's all it matters. Well enough with the philosophy...This is the story of romantic couple, Clementine (Kate Winslet) and Joel (Jim Carrey), who go through a breakup. Joel finds out that Clementine had a procedure done to erase all memories of him and their relationship. He decides to go through the same procedure and remove her from his memory. However, during the procedure he comes to a realization. This realization is the wisdom of the movie. It offers a great message inspired by the aforementioned philosophical ideas.I think Eternal Sunshine is a great movie and a rare cinematic art. If you love literature, philosophy and intelligent film-making, the chances are you will like Eternal Sunshine.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
fantastic flick,"There's just so much to say but so little at the same time.. the same way the movie is about so much yet so little. It is not your average romantic movie, nor your classic sci-fi movie. This is different. Different in the best way possible.

For me this is one of those life-reflecting movies that I'll cherish for the rest of my life, but won't wish to rewatch it ever again. Brilliant work from both director Gondry and writer Kaufman. A movie I'd recommend you to watch alone!:)",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"A great Science fiction film, but also one of the most realistic love stories I've seen!","'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' is a film full of unique ideas, characters, situations, and philosophy. It is one of the most alive films I've ever seen. It's a film so full of life and love and graceful quality. It is a film that is as ripe and as fresh as any of the best romantic comedies. It is, at times, incredibly funny. At other times, it's just simply heartbreaking. It doesn't matter if you've been in love or not, because you will get something personal out of this movie.The film basically is about the human desire to want to erase unpleasant memories. In the case of this film, it is Joel Barish(Jim Carrey) who wants to annihilate the horrible memories of his ex-girlfriend, Clemintine(Kate Winslet). The film takes this premise to it's highest potential by placing the viewer in the mind of Joel as his memories are being wiped out. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet play their parts as perfectly as any on-screen couple has. While most of their scenes together are harrowing and unpleasant, they are full of truth and clarity. Jim Carrey has that subtle pacing of how to react to things in a nondiscriminatory way while Kate Winslet comes across as more authentic and blunt as she can be without going over-the-top. They both do fantastic.The bulk of the film takes place in Joel's mind, as a matter-of-fact, and while this premise may sound like it is stretching credibility it still manages to achieve that rare feeling of nostalgia, chance, and hopefulness that we all have in our lives. The idea of losing these sorts of memories is a terrifying idea, but Michel Gondry, the director of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, knows this and has strategically added a serious flaw in the film, not to make the film weaker, but to make the film funnier. Enter Patrick, Mary, and Stan, three people whose job it is to do the mind erasing. Throughout the course of the film, the character of Joel repeatedly regrets going through with the procedure and tries to escape the brainwashing. This causes these three people who are working on him to encounter technical problems with their equipment and even causes Joel to enter into a waking life state in which he is wide awake but his brain is completely asleep while his mind is being fried.The problem with this is that it is only natural for someone to regret this sort of procedure while it's happening, so these three people should be used to doing this. Michel Gondry knows this and he knows that the audience knows this because he adds in a level of self-parody on top of all the mayhem. This is such a risky think for a director to try and pull off. Add to that the fact that the film is in non-chronological order, the character choice of Clementine getting her brain erased first, and a borderline manic subplot involving a secret love affair between two of the doctors and a love affair with of the doctors and Clementine and you have yourself a very complicated sounding film.If you haven't seen the film yet, what I am telling you will go right over your head. Trust me when I say that this film is a lot easier to swallow than I'm making it sound. All of these elements are developed and played out very carefully and delicately, but not to the point where any of it becomes second nature. This is a real work of art. It is Michel Gondry's masterpiece, no question. The screenplay by Charlie Kaufman, as usual, is beautiful in it's simplicity. Michel Gondry really brought it to life though, and that is something of a miracle. Michel Gondry has the mind of a child. He's so full of life and love and his mind is so open to infinite possibilities. He has taken all of that, and, with the writing of Charlie Kaufman, crafted this beautiful and touching masterpiece of film-making, and I can't thank them enough for making it.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

"""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"": A Mind-Bending Masterpiece","""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"": A Mind-Bending MasterpieceMichel Gondry's ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is a breathtaking work of art that seamlessly blends elements of science fiction and romance to create a film that is as heartwarming as it is mind-bending. Starring Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet, the film tells the story of a couple who, after a painful breakup, undergo a procedure to erase each other from their memories. As the procedure unfolds, the couple's memories become jumbled, creating a surreal and dreamlike journey that is both emotionally powerful and visually stunning.At the heart of ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is a complex exploration of the nature of memory, love, and loss. Gondry deftly weaves together multiple timelines and perspectives to create a rich tapestry of emotions and ideas that are both thought-provoking and deeply moving. Carrey and Winslet deliver performances that are nuanced, vulnerable, and deeply human, infusing their characters with a raw and authentic emotional depth that is rare in Hollywood films.But what really sets ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" apart is its visual style. Gondry's direction is nothing short of masterful, using a combination of practical effects and visual trickery to create a world that is both hyper-real and dreamlike. The film's vivid colors, inventive camera angles, and surreal imagery are nothing short of breathtaking, creating a visual language that perfectly complements the film's emotional core.In the end, ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is a film that defies easy categorization. It is a sci-fi romance, a meditation on memory and identity, and a visual tour-de-force all rolled into one. But above all else, it is a film that is deeply human and profoundly moving, reminding us of the power of love, even in the face of loss and pain.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

I may just not be tuned on the wave of the film makers as well - so it could be my personal exception - or did you have the same feeling? Nevermind.

Elegance in Storytelling,"Netflix, I love thee. Most notably, for giving me the opportunity for re-watching an old (depends on perspective) classic. I had the privilege to watch this transcendent flick during my childhood. My naïve brain could not comprehend the intricate complexities of relationships upon first viewing. But, after a young adulthood of getting to know myself compared to the relative darkness of conscientiousness, I now see this movie for what it is worth. In my own way, at the very least.My first two ""serious"" relationships give me a canvas upon which to give this movie a 'more serious review.' First, a young mind will not give this movie true thought. Only a mind grievanced with pain has the fortitude to wholly comprehend this film, which both highlights true pain and visual gratuity in such stunning detail as to make the 'human experience' something able to be transcribed by cinema.Whether I have the mind to comprehend this film is subjective. But, suffice it to say, I can understand the emotional depth this movie attempts to portray. We are all weak. In my limited scope as critic and as human, I have come with this realization. So sorry, for the hyperbole. But, the depth of this masterpiece is not fully appreciated until such a truth is realized. Humanity is recognition of weakness. And, this film recognizes this sentience in the mode of human relationships. We are all weak. We are all 'fucked up' and just trying to find whatever it is that holds the fabric of our own reality together.None of us can determine the truth for everyone else. Albeit in method of lifestyle or pure, scientific observation (as is the summation that can be derived by the two main character's lifestyles). Yet, this movie does nothing more than to portray characters that give human perspectives on an age-old enigma. 'Is life about finding someone else that gives meaning to our own?' Who can possibly know? But, this film entertains this question with such precision as to allow escapism from one's own romantic ambiguities, and transpose these problems into the lives of two fictional characters with one specific problem --- memory loss.This problem, despite the depth of human emotion conveyed in the rest of the film, serves to drive the plot on its own accord. Memory is a collection of our past livelihood. All the experiences that have been arranged in such a way, serve to be a foundation of ourselves as a present entity. What this movie proposes is a radical change in perspective. What if the very building blocks of ourselves as a person have been rearranged? What if a scientific objective became manifest and allowed memory deletion? Can you, troubled human, have the willfulness to erase an albeit important part of your life in order to mitigate pain? If so, what consequence does this pose? Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind proposes such a question in a visually stunning way as to captivate both heart and mind for an entrancing ninety minutes. In the end, it will make you ask, ""Is pain worth the memory?""And, the answer may surprise you.I am absolutely baffled by the genius that lies in the fabric of this cinema masterpiece. A 'must-see' before you die.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Is a book with a missing page still the same book?,"I never believed that I'd appreciate Jim Carrey in anything as much as I had appreciated his role within 'The Truman Show'. I was wrong.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a story which follows Joel Parrish and Clementine Kruczynski, who after a sour end to their relationship both, separately, decide to have their memories erased. The two protagonists re-live their relationship within a nonlinear narrative that allows the viewer to see their relationship from different perspectives. The film is full of poignant moments and powerful performances from the cast, particularly from Carrey and Winslet, who have a palpable chemistry on screen. The film's distinct narrative structure and thought-provoking themes make it a must-see for any fan of intelligent and emotionally resonant cinema. This is truly a unique film, and it's difficult to say what films are remotely similar to it. That being said, some people might compare it to other films that deal with themes of memory and relationships, such as The Notebook. Additionally, others may compare it to other films that are known for their unconventional narrative structures; my personal comparison would be Nolan's 'Memento'.Large parts of this film have an unrefined, unpolished quality to it that makes it feel authentic and unvarnished. I again liken this to Memento, mainly in terms of camera work, but also because of the impression that the viewer is right there in the middle of the story, truly seeing this narrative for what it is. It is raw, an unconventional yet engaging way to tell this story. It is this sense of realism that allows for such levels of experimentation to be not only thought provoking but recognisably emotional.What I have taken away from this viewing is that we all have memories, possibly not of failed relationships but memories that at one time or another we have felt an undying desire to bury. As time has gone on we have learnt to appreciate these memories and often these become cherished, thus never requiring any true need for the loss of them. Despite this Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind allows us to explore the concept of what if; what if we had opted to forever lose these memories, those feelings of hurt and devastation. Subject to this, we can recognise that not only do these memories hold incredible amounts of value, but they are fundamental, in respect of who we are, and who we are to be.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Wonderful - yet could been much more...,"I decided to finally bite the bullet and watch this film after many a recommendation from friends and colleagues. As I looked further I saw many familiar faces and institutions - Charlie Kaufman; screenplay writer for Adaptation (a nine out of ten for me), scriptwriter/composer of Being John Malkovich. Focus Films who were involved with a number of films I highly regard namely '21 Grams'.Charlie Kaufman presents, a film which promises to out do any of my expectations. It promises to take me by the hand and make me feel that anything is possible; reverse my psyche to a childlike state, and take me to a world of lost memories, undying love - a world where imagination overrules all. Let us dive in and see what all the fuss is about.I must say, approximately twenty four hours after pressing play, I keep having Freudian slips; my mind keeps re-living moments of the film, throwing them into my conscious for me to ponder, decipher. It is hard to pinpoint the magic of this film, as many aspects of it are somewhat flawed, yet it remains so, so beautiful. It leaves a feeling of contempt aimed at our ultimate creator; creating a being with so much feeling, and emotion, thrown into a nonsensical world and left to try to make sense of everything thrown there way. This is a quote which shall stay with me for some time:""Adults are a mess of sadness and phobias,"" Clementine.I feel that this film could greatly have benefited from being a short. It is a concept film, that should have been pondered more, been cut with more precision, and sucker punched the audience with it's a beauty. Instead we have a feature length film that whilst it retains its beautiful qualities, they only come in pieces, and not as a whole unit. This may be intentional, as the fragmented mind of our protagonist unearths, maybe this disjointed editing, and prolonged length is symbolic – I feel still, this film could have been so much more. Some of the set pieces are simply beautiful; the screenplay is, well, simply Kaufman – genius. The acting is SUBLIME. Kate Winslet simply blows the mind – not that I expected a bad performance. Her portrayal of a girl that will never fully commit herself, someone you can never truly know is inch perfect. You genuinely feel you never actually understand her character or what she wants, almost to the point of despair. Many a times in my life have I met people similar to this, and it is an identical melancholy feeling inside – it makes you question if you ever truly know a person, makes you feel useless.I fear I may be spoiling too much, too soon.

Everything is done right except for the female lead,"This is a movie which I really want to like, and a movie which I'm sure I would have liked if it wasn't for one small flaw: The character that Kate Winslett plays is just, through and through, a horrible person and I couldn't care less when Jim Carrey's character decides to remove her from his memory. That is, the whole movie seems to build upon the internal conflict that the main character feels once the memories of his former girl friend starts to vanish. However, it's like watching a movie where someone's trying to get rid of her love for Hitler. I feel zero conflict.For the record, I've seen this movie five times. I really want to like it, but I can't. If they just would have made the female lead likable, I would have given it a solid nine or ten.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
What's the big deal,I saw this movie yesterday 18-09-22 after much procrastination. I Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are good but the premise of the movie is as goofy as most of Jim's movies. Love is good but the storyline has to stop jumping up and down like a type writer keyboard out of synch!! The movie starts off pretty well but then somewhere on the way it just wanders off. A one time watch is what I would call it and that too only if you have nothing else going for you. No complaints on the acting and the cast is terrific however it gets off to a good start and then just rambles along and finally you realise that it is over and done with.,6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

What a mess!,"As i have said before on more than one occasion ,I'm not a big Jim Carey fan. When i have mentioned this in the past there is always one person who says "" but have you seen Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind""? Well i hadn't up until now and what i am going to say about it is bound to upset a few people.Joel is stunned to discover that his girlfriend Clementine has had her memories of their tumultuous relationship erased. Out of desperation, he contacts the inventor of the process, Dr. Howard Mierzwiak , to have Clementine removed from his memory. But as Joel's memories progressively disappear, he begins to rediscover their earlier passion. From deep within the recesses of his brain, Joel attempts to escape the procedure. As Dr. Mierzwiak and his crew chase him through the maze of his memories, it's clear that Joel just can't get her out of his head.Firstly there is nothing wrong with Jim Carey in this film . In fact it's refreshing to see him not pulling stupid faces. I enjoyed the acting of Kate Winslett too but the film itself left me cold.Looking at IMDb.com nearly everyone gives this top marks and it's listed as the the 59th best movie of all time. I don't get it? Is there something profound in this film that i missed? The idea is a good one but the execution is not. I found the timeline extremely confusing and the conclusion unsatisfactory. Perhaps my expectations were to high? I was expecting something special but i ended up getting a film that was trying to be far to clever for it's own good.It reminded me a little of Being John Malkovich. That too was pretentious nonsense and yet everyone praised it . Not Me. It's like the Emperors new clothes story . Once one person jumps up and say "" I love it"" everyone jumps on the band wagon.If i had the telephone number of the memory eraser's i would call them to erase my memory of this movie.To sum up i found Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind a self indulgent mess and if that upsets people i make no apologies for my honesty.4 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Good idea lacking necessary depth,"Eternal Sunshine is neither the masterpiece that many people will have you believe nor is it awful as the backlashers claim. Once again Charlie Kaufman takes the kernel of a great idea and overloads it with his own obsessive personality. The idea of a couple fighting to retain beautiful memories of their past together while undergoing a memory erasure is ingenious. Kaufman definitely hits some poignant notes along the way (he's great at communicating the mundane pleasures and comforts of relationships), but Joel and Clementine's characters seem like mere sketches rather than fully developed people that the audience can care about. Joel in particular is maddening because he's the same schlubby protagonist that is in all of Kaufman's scripts: it's Charlie himself. The man is simply incapable of creating characters outside the bounds of his own personality. Also, the movie isn't as enjoyable as it should be. Though I wanted to see how it ended (even though I predicted the plot twist about 30 minutes into the movie), Kaufman denies the audience the pleasures of human connection with the characters in favor of convoluted, intricately distanced storytelling. The characters come across as rats in an experiment or pawns in a chess game or any other omniscient metaphor you can think of. And the subplot between the workers of Lunaca fits but in an unimaginative, convenient way. I must say that all of the performances were excellent (except Elijah Wood, but he didn't have much of a character anyway), particularly Winslet and Mark Ruffalo. Director Michel Gondry and his team of technicians give the movie an appropriately jittery, jagged rhythm and look. It feels like the work of a writer on anti-depressants and Valium filtered through the mind of a director on a 3-day caffeine binge. That's not necessarily a bad thing because without the energy and gimmickry that Gondry brings to the film, the emptiness of the conception would be all the more glaring. Don't believe the hype but don't discount the film altogether either. It seems that many people are discovering something profound in it. Self-doubt and emotional shallowness might be the new status quo.",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Absolutely LOVED it! A captivating story that just keeps your heart racing,"I am a picky person when it comes to movies, and my friend gave me this movie out of the blue, so you can imagine how ""iffy"" i was to watch it. But I am so glad I did. It was a bit confusing at first, but it does ravel itself out in the end. The acting was flat out amazing, I love Jim Carey and to see him play such a dramatic role and do it so well was so refreshing. I honestly felt the emotion the characters did, I was so into the movie even after it ended. And i love how it keeps you going, it never gets boring and just has you to the end of your seat.

Perfection,"I cannot stand the idea of someone disliking this film, it should be an iconic example of brilliant filmmaking. Michael Gondry (director) and Charlie Kaufman (screenplay) have weaved a remarkable romantic scientific fiction film following a couple who erases each other's memories from their minds. I feel like this is one of the most original movies to have been made in a very long time – every element crafted in it has been perfected.You have never seen Jim Carrey shine as much in any other role like he does in this; he plays Joel Barrish, the soft-spoken and emotionally withdrawn man in which the story takes place mainly from his point of view, his mind. Kate Winslet is as beautiful as ever, playing the woman with never ending shades of unnatural hair color – she's impulsive, adventurous, and vibrant, whereas Joel is more of an introverted recluse; yet they're in love, and remain in love, despite the choices they both make throughout the story.The writing is incredibly clever. Realistic dialogue and a thought provoking storyline – leaves room to question yourself, even. Even if pain follows the good, would you erase all the good just to be rid of the pain? The story is beautiful and the characters could have books written about them, for them. You learn so much about them in such vague shots and a short amount of time, and maybe you don't quite understand why (as Joel and Clementine are quite the odd couple.) you want them to be together so badly, but you just do because they balance each other out in that unexplainable, magical way.The cinematography and lighting provide an insanely surreal feel to the movie; essentially, you are losing yourself in the mind of Joel. It's one of those films where you have to pay attention to understand the little details that make the bigger picture – which can be confusing if you've never been properly introduced to Eternal Sunshine. I have seen it about eighteen times and each time I notice things that I never caught before, and it makes my experience even more enjoyable.It is extremely difficult to pick out flaws from Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. It's a rare film that definitely isn't like any other. Everything ties up perfectly; it's a bit of a bitter ending but there's still a sweet, thin coat of hope and happiness to give you the reminder that it's okay to breathe again, that Joel and Clementine will be okay.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Erase this movie from your memory,"Eternal Sunshine is a movie worth forgetting.  I looked at my watch 10 times, wanting the movie to end.  I stayed to the bitter end, but there were 40 lucky people who left the movie early.

He goes to the doctor to have the same procedure of erasing her memories from his mind.  We get to see each memory of their relationship as they are erased from his mind.  The only good thing I got out of the movie is that it makes you think about how important our memories are to us.  However, I wouldn't mind erasing this movie from my memory.

Very overrated movie that should have been better,"Unfortunately, this movie is receiving way too much credit and praise than it deserves.Yes, it is a good movie. But at times, the plot seems to sway from centrality and thus lose its viewer's interest. This movie could definitely have been better plot wise. Without benefit, it seems to rely too much on vagueness and predicable scenes to explain parts of the movie.I believe that Winslet did a very good job in her role, and so much that when I first started watching the movie, I had no idea that it was her until 30 minutes into the movie! However, Carey pulled through with a run-of-the-mill performance.A good movie it is, but not deserving of all the praise and accolades.

clever but shallow and pretentious film-school exercise,"Ten minutes into ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND, it was clear that screenwriter Charlie Kaufman has a limited bag of tricks. What was clever in BEING JOHN MALKOVICH the first time I saw it became pretentious during the second viewing and insufferable during the third viewing. ADAPTATION was a similarly too-clever pretentious exercise in modernist style with no substance. ETERNAL SUNSHINE mines the same vein, but this time around the results are about as substantial as cotton candy and as permanent as a fireworks display. Except for the cutesy plot device--which was refreshing decades ago when handled by the likes of a Godard or a Philip K. Dick or a Harold Pinter--the film is like a second-string Woody Allen project fed into a blender (or rewritten by Donald Barthelme). The ""insights"" about relationships in this film are, as one critic aptly described it, about as profound as those in a Hugh Grant movie. And as ""experimental"" as Kaufman may think he is being, the plot is as predictable as that of any b-movie, once one figures out the premise of the story (which the slowest audience member will do in about 20 minutes). And what's the point of the murky faux-cinema-verite visual style in many scenes? The three points out of ten I awarded this film are primarily for the actors, Jim Carrey in particular. When will the Hollywood establishment and the critics finally learn that Kaufman is a one-trick-pony? The emperor is not wearing any clothes here. As someone who has championed and supported TRUE avant-garde filmmaking for decades, I see this as a cheap Hollywood pastiche of the avant garde. Those who found John Sayles' LONE STAR to be ""multi-layered"" instead of cliche-ridden will find much to praise and discuss in ETERNAL SUNSHINE. While Kaufman is not as bad as P.T. Anderson (at least Mr. Kaufman manages to honor traditional story structures while re-fashioning them, and at least he can create REAL if shallow characters, something Anderson hasn't learned to do), my evening would have been better spent watching a straight-to-video action film or some obsscure 1950s Allied Artists post-noir crime film.

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"When I first saw Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, I wasn't expecting to love it, let alone like it. What a surprise when I saw it! I think this film is wonderful in every aspect, truly beautiful, and packs a full emotional punch. In fact, if you don't mind me saying so, it is one of my favourite films of the 2000s.I especially loved how Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was shot. The whole film looks beautiful, not only with the cinematography, which is indeed spellbinding, but also in the scenery, which was nothing short of amazing. Another impressive asset was the soundtrack/score. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind doesn't have the best soundtrack/score I have ever heard in my life, but the score makes the film all the more moving, while the soundtrack is well selected and appropriate.I was also very taken with the story. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind has one beautifully constructed story I can tell you, with an almost poignant message about it. It is strange and bizarre, yes, but neither of those are bad, quite the contrary. Then there is the script, which is both poignant and funny, not to mention very deep. The pacing very rarely feels boring, if at all, and the direction is adept.I have very little to complain about Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind's performances either. As good as the supporting performances are, especially from the always splendid Tom Wilkinson, I have to give the real kudos to the leads. Jim Carrey has done some good performances in some good films; The Mask, Liar Liar, The Cable Guy, and Bruce Almighty showcase his comedy talents wonderfully, but this and The Truman Show show he is perfectly good at drama too. He is very understated here, but it works as he still manages to be likable all the same. The real star though is Kate Winslet. A beautiful and captivating actress, Winslet is absolutely perfect in her role.Overall, wonderful film. Bizarre yes, but very tender and poignant, helped by the exceptional performances and cinematography. 10/10 Bethany Cox.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

I was not equipped (yet) for it. I did not have the patience, the wisdom, the experience. It takes at least one true love and a heart break to fully embrace what the movie has to give.In the end we fully live when we fully love. Erasing memories of love equals to erasing pieces of life.

The Most Vivid Exploitation of Cinema in the Sevice of Great Storytelling,"What's the best part of this astonishingly mesmerizing film? I'd say it's the thorough mastery of the cinematic form. It's every element is blended into a towering achievement of modern movie making, whose seamless integration of story, technique, effects, and performances is truly genius. Charlie Kaufman was already one of my all time favorite screen writers, his Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, and Human Nature had already so completely entertained me. But Michael Gondry's direction of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (ESOTSM) has set a new lofty standard for all future celluloid captured creativity.Depicting that elusive, mercury slick quality of our thoughts, dreams and memories has long been a major challenge for all film makers. Many have relied somewhat successfully on a deft control of pace, where subtle shifts in timing and rhythm are all that's needed to prompt us to an altered reality. Gondry does this as perfectly as anyone else. Others have been much more blatant and broad, employing such conventions as blurred, hazy images recorded through Vaseline smeared lenses, or even depositing their characters into suddenly severely disproportionate sets, absurdly large or tiny props introduced as a short hand gimmick. Gondry avails himself of these conventional techniques, but only to masterfully exploit them for their comedic impact. And too many other less capable hacks have not even bothered to differentiate the two states, merely having the dreamer wake suddenly, violently, to reveal that the previous experience was all just mental chimera. A cheap, lousy stunt. Yes, Gondry even stoops to this cornball level, and does it so very fluidly, seemingly as a gesture of genuine respect to all the cinematic tactics that have so powerfully informed and shaped our own self illusions and delusions. But Michael Gondry has also fully grasped the value of computer aided graphics in merging both the exterior and interior worlds. The dreamed, imagined, remembered locales and environs are all as ""real"" as any anything else in this film till they suddenly begin to fray, crack and crumble. Rooms and houses are seen to disassemble themselves methodically, randomly, or explosively with utterly natural grace. Like a drunken, drugged fantasy, the whole of the universe unzips and inverts; gravity now repulses and cause precedes effect. It's so deeply disorienting. These meticulously rendered, dizzying episodes are precisely the experience that's needed to convey the frantic, paranoid terror of losing one's memories. It feels as though all computer graphic effects were developed exclusively, expressly for this one exact movie.The script is brilliantly self deprecating, as if continually surprised to find itself actually passing for science fiction. It's an admirable conceit that Charlie has everyone so ambivalent about the fantastical mind erasing procedure till well after things are under way. There's nothing more dizzying than to have everyone not realize just how dizzy you are. It's these subtle, unique expressions of wondrous doubt and confusion that really demand so much of the cast. Jim Carey's subdued, focused performance is often exhilarating, and always exactly on key. His moments as a tiny, not-so tiny, tot version of himself are sublimely hilarious. Kate Winslet, as clever as she is gorgeous, hits so many amazing notes with absolutely pitch perfect skill. And the support crew are all entirely wonderful, with Tom Wilkinson effortlessly animating the beleaguered but arrogant doctor, and Mark Ruffalo so comfortable as a slacker nerd with hip habits. Kirsten Dunst is adorable as his playmate coworker, and Elijah Wood makes post-teen angst feel as sharp and dirty as a rusty nail.This delicate balance of hilarity and poignancy sounds like a fine recipe for old time movie romance, and ESOTSM would have been only that if everything wasn't so expertly orchestrated towards a more sophisticated purpose. Yes, it's true we are cheering for the reunion of our tragically separated hero and heroine, that's the obvious bit. But what elevates and distinguishes this tale is it's insistence on making valid claims to virtue and nobility, much more so than any simple love story ever could. Kaufman and Gondry certainly recognize the value and power that shared affection plays in our daily existence, but they have tied this emotion to an even larger, deeper experience. They have hitched it to our sense of consciousness. What truly interests Charlie is our ability - our necessity - to consider and reflect on just who we are, on who we want to be, and on how we strive be that person. He is hoping to introduce us again to our own sense of destiny. He is a master technician at constructing elaborate devices to capture our imaginations and direct them towards more obscure, rare regions of the psyche. This treacherously seductive machine, this supremely elegant film has carried me to a genuinely higher place. I actually feel enlightened and enlarged and more human for having seen it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Does Love Find A Way?,"Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind (2004) -A quirky concept filmed in a quirky way with quirky direction and performances by the actors, who are also, let's face it, a little bit quirky!It is actually nice though to see Jim tackling something different. I loved 'The Truman Show' (1998) and he was perfect for 'Ace Ventura' (1994) and 'The Mask' (1994), but after a while that character, that is a bit samey, gets quite tiring, so this performance was a refreshing change. He is probably the stand out for me, although Elijah Wood looks adorable, the little pocket rocket that he is.The jumping chronology that's all over the place is quite confusing to start with and what starts off as something quite funny, turns into something a bit creepy. It's very clever, but then it gets even freakier. And then really freaky!I can see why it's on Empire's Top 100 Films List, because it is something different, but I don't think that it is executed as well as it could have been to really get the message across.I think it might have worked better for me if it had been simplified. Maybe it could have been a film short and focussed purely on how the process worked instead?It would have been better if it was just him going to get his memory erased and then showed the process of him looking back over the painful memories and maybe with her rushing to get him to stop at the end, but just too late.I personally feel that it would have better shown the ""Careful What You Wish For"" and other morals that the story was trying to make.The stuff with the Gruffalo (Mark Ruffalo) and the Hobbit (Elijah) was unnecessary. Anything that was happening outside of his memories all felt a bit like filler to make it a cinema length production.If not that, it probably should have ended with her getting her toothbrush for the second time to bring it all round full circle.There is something about this film that is stuck in my head and that I enjoyed about it, but I think it might take another viewing for it to become clearer as to what that is.575.88/1000.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"Far-fetched, yet rooted in reality.","Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet play Joel and Clementine, a couple who, when their relationship goes south, undergo a procedure to erase each other from their memories. It's strange, smart, sad, funny, and just overall brilliant.This film left an indelible impression on me the first time I saw it many years ago. It was unlike anything I'd ever seen before, and I was utterly smitten. The material and the way it was translated on screen was appealing in its novelty and eccentricity. Though operating on a far-fetched premise, the film depicts a very real picture of how relationships are - sweet at the beginning, sour over time, and with at least one bitter casualty by the time it ends. What it ultimately asks though, is if it's worth it, taking in all the bad with the good. If the prospect of love is worth the potential disaster it'll leave in its wake. The film doesn't answer it for us, but I'd say the ending wraps up the whole thing in the best way possible.It may be ten years old as of this writing, but Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind remains to be as fresh, wonderful and unique as ever.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
I liked it...,"This film is a complete mind bender! I had not seen anything about it really apart from the poster. I Didn't see the trailer or read the synopsis before watching the movie. I just decided to see it because it had Jim Carrey & Kate Winslet in it.I had been told it was not a comedy so knew not to expect Jim Carrey's over the top comedy acting that we all expect from his work. But when I started watching this I felt sorry for him... he plays a depressed man really well. He had problems and seemed so lonely. So at this point I thought I was watching a movie about a guy with personal problems meeting a woman and their lives together trying to cope with his depression... I was wrong!Imagine my surprise when all of a sudden memories are being erased from their minds thanks to a company that can help you lose all the bad painful memories in your life.I won't give too much away just in case you want to see it, but trust me when I say that this movie is all over the place. One minute you are with Jim and he is sad because his relationship is not going well and loses his partner (Winslet) and he goes to get his memory erased to get rid of the pain, the next minute you are seeing him happy with Kate during happier times, but during these times things around them are fading and blanking out.There is another side of the story which involves the staff at the company that erases the memories. This fits well in the movie and ties nicely up at the end of the film.Jim Carrey plays the part really well and I now see him as a good actor as well as someone as you can just laugh at when he is over the top . He has proved he can calm things down and play a serious role. I feel Kate Winslet did a good job too, but didn't shine as much as Jim did on screen.The supporting cast also has some famous names in there too including Kirsten Dunst and Elijah Wood who play employees of the company.Final mark I personally give this movie is: 6 out of 10.But whatever you do, do not watch this film unless you can sit down and watch it from beginning to end.

Worth a Watch,"Jim Carrey and an 8.3/10 IMDb rating are enough to watch a movie, plus the plot sounded intriguing.A guy goes to a company to have the memories of his ex-girlfriend erased.

The key is that ALL memories of that significant other are erased.I thought the movie was ""nice."" It wasn't anything I'd go gaga over or repeatedly watch. There was some romance, or what was considered romance for a gregarious, spontaneous girl (Kate Winslett) and a subdued almost mopey guy (Jim Carrey). There was plenty of relationship drama and a splash of sci-fi. It was decent entertainment",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

A wonderfully sincere love story,"What makes this movie for me is the sincere positive emotions it carries. It is a movie with heart, sincerity.Yet, it is a rather melancholic film. The tone sits between deep sadness and triumphant wholesomeness.It is about loneliness and people trying desperately to find their better half. It starts a typical romantic movie, the boy-meets-girl type. But, there is something a little off. And, as the story progresses you come to realize that the film has multiple layers on top of each other, and in a very Kaufmanesque fashion it becomes a story within a story within a story.In a very clever way, the film tells the story of Joel and Clementine in reverse. And the whole movie is the unwrapping of it. That is why the beginning feels random and weird, without being neccessarily off-putting. The whole movie has a slight weirdness that is gives a dreamlike quality to the story. It elevates a rather mundane romance to a more whimsical tale of invariable love. No matter what, they always end up together.At the core, the movie tells the Joel and Clementine's romance but practically it spends a lot of time on a fictional memory-removal service's office. I enjoyed very much how it presents this whimsical memory technology in a very matter of fact way. There is a quiet routine to it: getting your memories erased is a service you pay for. It is procedure. It is like going to the dentist. Its filled with technicians and support staff that are morons.And to be fair, the movie almost goes so far into the banality of this practice it almost becomes sinister. The whole sequence with Mark Ruffalo in Joel's apartment verges on uncomfortable and creepy. But, the movie escapes the unease by doing yet again a nested story, where it plunges the story in another story: the romance between Dr. Mierzwiak and Kristen Dunst.It completely caught me off guard. And again, it results in a love-story told from the end. But, it wraps the plot in a nice bow. The film presents two main love-stories, one that has failed and one that has endured, both in spite of the memory removal. The contrast is also visual: where the first love story is told extensively in various colorful flashbacks, the Dunst love-story is told in the office; it is cold, it is static. Ultimately, the juxtaposition of the two stories, creates a deeper meaning.The movie is very good on all accounts, the directing, the acting, the visuals. But, it really gets these elements working together to tell the story. Only while writing this, did I realize how intricate the story is. Yet, the film makes it clear and simple. The movie is eloquent yet it is very ethereal, it feels like a dream. At times, it threatens to turn into a nightmare, but at the end it reveals itself to be a nice, comfy, sweet dream.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Made me drop some of my previous good ratings...,"Pretty late to the party, this movie has been on my watchlist for a good amount of time now.

Love it,"For a movie that was made in 2004, I'm very impressed by the cinematography. It's not easy to narrate such a story and plot using limited equipements, moving from one time to another, but it was beautifully presented and you could easily understand when and how things happened.It is very enjoyable and every scene is important, you cannot miss one. And I love the plot twist, how it began from the ending, and how different you see them now even if you already watched the scene before.What I loved the most is the concept and idea behind it. It can be interpreted in different ways but what I felt just really hit me.Love is beautiful. It is painfully beautiful. You fall in love with someone, but the process of falling in love is what makes it special. You discover yourself, what you like, what you hate. You change, maybe for the worse but it doesn't matter, because you're living the best time of your life, experiencing love again. You might go through hell or not know what you're doing in a relationship, but love is the only beautiful thing in relationships, because everyone is f up and lost.I loved the ending, when they both knew and were sure of how their relationship ended, however they still wanted to be together and do it all over again, they still wanted to fall for each other, they still wanted pain for the sake of love, because it's worth it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

hey doc.! help me forget !!!,"Of all Kaufman's screenplays that delve into the interior landscapes of its characters, Eternal Sunshine is the most fully formed and moving story of the bunch, a rumination on the possibilities and consequences inherent in making the process of removing unwanted memories from your consciousness as easy as going for a checkup. Kaufman here plays on our desire to forget the bad things that happen to us and what happens when we are given the power to forget those things permanently, and the conclusion he arrives at is that it ultimately creates as many - if not more - problems than it solves. At the very least, it can result in making the same mistakes again (""Those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it""); at the worst, it eliminates the possibility of our ever reconciling and coming to terms with our life experiences, the way we relate to the people who help to shape our lives and whose lives we shape through ours.Evren BuyrukThe film explores these ideas in a novel and engaging way: by taking the audience inside the mind of Joel Barish (Jim Carrey), a man who, after breaking up with his girlfriend Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslett), discovers later that she has had her memory of him wiped clean from her mind. He finds out how she had this procedure done and, despondent not only about the breakup but even more so about her having completely erased him from her mind, searches out the doctor who performed the procedure and signs up to have the same procedure done to him, so that he may also have no memory of her. He is rendered unconscious for the procedure but his subconscious is still active. Once the procedure is initiated and he becomes aware that his memories of the woman he loved - and still loves - are vanishing from his brain, he starts having second thoughts and wants the procedure stopped. His challenge then becomes to figure out how to protect as much of his memory of her as he can, and to find a way stop the procedure despite the fact that he is in an unconscious state.The manner in which he comes to realize and confront his dilemma is played out entirely within his interior landscape, a realm which (as anyone who remembers their dreams upon waking from sleep can attest) is a very surreal extension of our day-to-day experiences. Michel Gondry's visual style and direction works exceptionally well here in conveying the slippery, chaotic unpredictability of the worlds we construct from our memories and experiences; the clever interplay between this interior world and the goings-on of the outside world helps keep the viewer off-balance just enough to illuminate the fuzzy line of demarcation separating the two worlds and the peculiar manner in which they play off one another.Jim Carrey and Kate Winslett do an exceptional job of bringing this abstract story concept to life with characters that are endearing, poignant, believable and utterly human. The supporting players are equally impressive: Tom Wilkinson as the mind-eraser doctor, Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood as the technicians, Kiersten Dunst as the receptionist all have relationships to the main protagonists and to one another that come to light as the story unfolds and help to propel the plot; as friends of Joel and Clementine, David Cross and Jane Adams are hilarious as a couple who seem to be stuck in the same rut that compelled the protagonists to break up and have each other erased from their respective minds. Kaufman juggles all these relationships masterfully and in such a way as to ensure none of them are superfluous to the ideas he is trying to get across in this story.While there are elements of the plot that seem to place this movie in the realm of science fiction, the focus of the movie stays on the interior states, emotions and relationships between the characters. As such, the film is more of a romantic comedy than anything - albeit unlike any other romantic comedy you're ever likely to see. I saw a late showing of this movie with my girlfriend the day it was released at a local multiplex and there were only 20 or so people in the theater, yet at the film's conclusion everyone broke out in a spontaneous round of applause. This gives an idea of how compelling this movie can be. If you give this film a chance to creep under your skin, you will likely find yourself reflexively thinking about your feelings toward the important people in your life, as well how you relate to those feelings, as well as your memories and how you relate to them.

A remarkable screenplay with a crappy storytelling,"The screenplay is undoubtedly smart and imaginative, with a quite interesting and fun premise on memory erasure. However, the movie is not executed well, particularly in the storytelling. The nonlinear storytelling is just unnecessary, making the movie chaotic and confusing. Also, most of the time is put in the memory erasing process of Joel (Jim Carrey), and this unbalanced narration further exacerbates the film.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"Original, but predictable.","Usually we're used to think of Jim Carrey as a comedy actor but in this film he shows that he's capable of dramatic roles, as he had done in ""Truman Show"". In this film, he tries to forget a failed romance with the irreverent Clementine (Kate Winslet) through a procedure that is, in practice, a brainwashing. But he regrets that with the process ongoing and tries to find a way to keep his memories. The film seems quite original and, in fact, the script has merit for trying to create a romantic comedy on a premise so different from the normal, but a large part of the plot is highly predictable. Another problem was the dialogues. In a film so light and so romance-oriented why insist on profanity or heavy slang? Some special effects look good, in particular the fading things and the passages from one memory to another at random, allowing us to have a wider knowledge of Joel's past. The soundtrack is quite kitsch and match the taste of both main characters but displeases the ears of the audience. Carrey was perfect in the main character, maintaining a good chemistry with Winslet, who also didn't disappoint. The rest of the cast (where we can see Elijah Wood, Kirsten Dunst or Tom Wilkinson) do their job satisfactorily, but leaving room for the main actors to shine.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, directed by Michel Gondry.An artwork that will make you think about your memories and whether it's worth getting rid of them to start a new life.The film Eternal Sunshine of the Pure Mind shows the love relationship of two people Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine(Kate Winslet). There comes a time for every couple when everything goes downhill and the problem is difficult to solve. The main character chooses the easy way to simply erase the memories of her beloved. The plot describes all the torments of Joel whether he will be able to return everything as it was , we have to find out.It would seem that we know Jim Carrey only by his roles in comedies, but here he appears before us in the role of a sad hero who does not understand what he did wrong. The film uses high-tech technology, which is atypical for such films. The plot twists are simply at the highest level and break all the cliches and patterns that we know. The cast is just perfectly matched. The actors play their roles 100% and it seems that they really feel the same as their characters. It also helps to convey the emotional state and the weather with its help, you plunge headlong into the film. But still there is one disadvantage - the complexity of the plot after the first viewing, there are many questions that the viewer can get answers to on the forums or when watching the movie again.In general, the film contains everything that an ideal drama should have. Friendship, hatred, contempt, fitting and well-being. I recommend watching this movie in order to fully immerse yourself in a story that goes on for only an hour and a half, does not convey such a palette and spectrum of emotions that it seems that you have experienced all the problems together with the main characters.

A Beautiful Journey through erased memories!,"When I watched Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind for the first time, I didn't know what to expect. But it turned out to be a movie that touched me deeply. It's not just a story;, it's an emotional journey that makes you think about love, memories and who we are. For me, this is one of the most special movies of the 2000s.The movie's main idea is both simple and powerful. It asks, ""What if you could erase painful memories?"" But as the story unfolds, you realize that even sad memories are important because they make us who we are. This thought stays with you and makes the movie unforgettable.The visuals are amazing. The way memories are shown fading, breaking, and shifting is creative and beautiful. It was quite interesting watching the process. The music also adds so much feeling to every scene, making the emotional moments even stronger.The acting is perfect. Jim Carrey is very natural as Joel, showing his quiet, emotional side. Kate Winslet as Clementine is full of energy and brings her character to life in a way that feels so real.

Memories.............Like the 16 Corners of My Mind.,"One of the strangest cinematic experiences I have ever had. ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" deals with mind erasing, manipulation and the belief that love can indeed conquer all in the end---or can it? Co-writer Charlie Kaufman's (who has already puzzled me with ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Adaptation."") thoughts obviously go into hyper-overdrive here from the word go. Lonely man Jim Carrey meets the eccentric and multi-hair-colored Kate Winslet and a romance blossoms, but nothing is quite as it seems. Winslet has apparently gone to a clinic where her memories of Carrey have been erased forever. Thus she acts like she does not know him anymore. Carrey decides to get even by having the same procedure done to erase Winslet from his mind. He goes to see a specialist (Tom Wilkinson) and is soon going through the procedure at the home of one of Wilkinson's employees (Mark Ruffalo). Also with Ruffalo is co-worker Elijah Wood (who has developed feelings for Winslet) and hospital secretary Kirsten Dunst. Dunst has secrets aplenty herself as she is secretly dating Ruffalo and has an unclear relationship with Wilkinson. These are really side-stories though as Carrey goes on a harrowing journey while unconscious during the procedure to salvage what he believes he and Winslet once had. Shades of ""Vertigo"" here as we see one of those love stories that is really too complicated and confusing for celluloid. The journey into the human mind and the emotions associated with true love are aspects that come through in very unorthodox and down-right confusing fashions. To be honest I do not understand everything about this film, but it still struck nerves deep in me. I felt numb by the whole production as the drama goes to the outer limits and the comedy feels forced and somewhat out of place. Innovative and creative, but landmark and impressive? Not completely sold on those last two. 4 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"Shine, but don't get lost in your memories","Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet didn't seem to me like a duet in a joint film. However, the ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" has shown that this is quite acceptable. And if Winslet is perfectly perceived as a dramatic actress, then Kerry is more difficult. It's not easy for him to get rid of the role of a comedy genius. But the actor takes an interesting height for himself and seems to be coping. Not like the movie itself, though.I watched the picture quite a long time ago. And recently I decided to revise it to revive my memories. It was amazing to rediscover the now well-known star cast, where in addition to Kerry and Winslet, Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood, Tom Wilkinson and David Cross are present. But the main thing is still the plot, the staging, the overall impression. And here my feelings differ.The picture begins in such a way that the viewer does not understand much at first. That's the idea. When viewing it, you should go through the path of the main characters together with the heroes, see the inside of their destinies and understand what happened and how everything came to what we have in the final. The staging is somewhat ragged and sometimes leads to a dead end. Sometimes it seems that for a complete understanding, you need to repeatedly view the picture. But, as for me, this is a fat minus of the project.Acting is good. I understand why Jim Carrey was chosen for the main role. Hardly anyone else would have looked so organically in the role of an awkward and very diverse hero, which the actor showed. And even though I said that for Jim, roles in dramas are rather an exception, it was this exception that worked well in this picture. Kerry is good, impulsive, memorable. Another moment with Winslet. Her heroine sometimes scares with her quirks. A sweet and sometimes mysterious girl can sometimes really lose her temper and even seem dangerous. The actress is good in this role. However, frankly speaking, the stories of the characters are not particularly catchy. You'd rather figure out what's wrong with this couple than empathize with her.Other actors are not bad either. Each character they play has their own story. The further the plot develops, the more you realize that everything in this picture is interconnected. But if sometimes such twists of history look great, then in this picture they are clearly piled on top of each other and weigh down the production. When I see another twist, it already seems that everything is extremely tailored to the needs of the film, and the screenwriters did not worry much, having created such a tangle of intricacies of fate. And in this regard, it's even surprising to me that the picture won the Oscar for best screenplay. On the other hand, the other nominees of that year could not really boast of something better, in my opinion.What I really liked is how the story conveys the inner world of the main character, what happens in his head. A lot of interesting solutions and sometimes absurd pictures may well be in the head of any person. And here the film seemed to me quite realistic, especially if you remember what dreams people sometimes have. I'm sure many people will agree with me that often after waking up you wonder what it was I dreamed about? Although at the moment of sleep, what was happening seemed quite normal.""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is not a bad picture. But for me, this story has remained a passing one. There is no zest in it for me personally. Heroes and stories do not cling, an excessive abundance of plots and their intertwinings are often confused, and the final impressions remain at the level of an average film for one evening.6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Great ending to a thought-provoking movie,"The ending was great. It shows that no relationship will go perfectly all the way. At one point or another, it will turn sour, you will be bored, you will feel like you don't know her at all. Why is she like this, this is not the person I knew. Truth is, no one is perfect. There is no such thing as a 'spotless mind'. A quote goes like this 'it's not about finding a perfect person, but loving an imperfect person perfectly'. As the relationship goes, you will find a lot of things that you may not like from her. But before you give up and just throw it all away, reminisce the memories you have. You have to feel it, what made you crazy over her? What made you love her so much in the first place?

Loved this!,"Like Spike Jonze, Michel Gondry is an extremely talented director. To be able to make this film come to life isn't easy and Gondry managed to capture the heartfelt and emotional weight of Kaufman's script beautifully. The way this film is told is very interesting.

We've all known him for his over-the-top and comedic personality but he's never done a role as serious and restrained as Joel Barish. Carrey is absolutely superb here and makes his character as relatable, realistic and human as possible. He should have got a Best Actor nomination at least. This is his best film along with The Truman Show. Kate Winslet has never been better. Her chemistry with Carrey is believable to its core and she deserves her Best Actress nomination.

Jim Carrey's best,"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a difficult movie to describe. Probably because it's unlike any movie I've seen before. It's almost like a romantic version of Inception (but without all the suicide). The movie takes place inside Jim Carrey's characters mind and takes the audience through a series of non-chronological flashbacks to fully explain the complicated relationship between Jim Carrey's Joel and Kate Winslet's Clementine. The plot, without spoiling it, is like something out of a science fiction movie but instead set in modern time and with very realistic, grounded characters - one of the many reasons why this works so well. The characters are entertaining, but at the same time delicate and real. Jim Carrey gives a great performance (one of the best I've seen from him), but it is Kate Winslet who really takes the cake. Her acting in this movie is fantastic - probably the best I've seen from her. The supporting cast consists of Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood, Tom Wilkinson and Kirsten Dunst; each of which fit into the story very well (they all appear in present time, and not in the Jim Carrey's mind or the flashbacks), and each plays their own important part to the story, subtly adding something unique in their own right.In some ways this isn't the type of movie I often watch. It is described as a drama, romance, comedy and fantasy by IMDb, and succeeds as all but one of those. As a romance, it is effective - greatly relying on the undeniable chemistry between Carrey and Winslet; it is poignant but touching. As a drama, it works from start to finish, even when a lot of the drama is focusing the secondary characters, and not Carrey or Winslet (one very effective reveal with Kirsten Dunst's character you'll never see coming). As a fantasy, in it's own weird way, it also works: the plot, again without spoiling anything, involves going into peoples minds and attempting to delete memories (see the similarities with Inception now?), and has the dazzling originality that many modern movies lack. But it is only as a comedy that it slightly falls down. I giggled a grand total of twice throughout the movie, because ultimately the rest of the comedy fell flat. Writer Charlie Kaufman clearly put a lot of work into the characters and story (and did an excellent job there), but evidently put little work into the uninspired humour that accompanies the movie. It probably would have worked better if all the comedy was simply wiped from the script.But putting that aside there is nothing more to criticise. The third act and especially the climax is mesmerising and perhaps even genius; the plot is clever and more than anything original; the cast is spot-on and the acting is great. This is undoubtedly an extremely weird movie, but whether or you like it or not, it is certainly unforgettable; and if you like it, you'll probably love it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Ain't Love Grand?,"Valentine's Day. A day for love. A day for lovers. Or a day when the love of your life decides to wipe you and your relationship from her memory. Literally. And this is where we find the despondent Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) at the opening of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. But he doesn't know that yet. Neither do we. And the film takes him and the viewer on a dizzying journey to figure it all out as he struggles to remember what he forgot to remember to forget. Sounds confusing? It is. (But no more confusing than waking up one day and the person you once loved and felt certain loved you back decides to end the relationship without explanation.) The object of Joel's affection is the beautiful, impulsive and occasionally soul-searching Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet), who seems to change her mind as often as her hair color. But if you think that following her particular hair color will make it easier to understand at which point of time the characters find themselves in the film, it won't. If you're looking for a straight-forward boy-meets-girl-boy-loses-girl-boy-gets-girl-back romantic motion picture, this baby's not for you. The film does appear to be just another quirky romantic comedy for the first 20 minutes before the opening credits finally appear, but then suddenly goes into a tailspin as Joel grapples
with his own deteriorating sanity, reliving the trauma of love and loss in no particular order. Written by one of the most original voices in Hollywood today, Charlie Kaufman (Being John Malkovich, Adaptation) brings another twisted, yet somehow vividly honest, film to the screen. Expertly directed by Michel Gondry, who is best known for music videos and commercials, the film manipulates lighting and sound to succinctly create the nightmare and desperation of the characters. The performances are wonderful, surely Carrey's best work, and the supporting cast with young A-List stars such as Kirsten Dunst (Spiderman) and Elijah Wood (Lord of the Rings) round out the emotional core of the film's sub-plots. It is a film to be experienced with the heart and not the mind. And if it's any consolation: there is a happy ending. Sort of.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

I think it turned too much melancholic, repetitive, and too centred in this night of the ""erasing memory"" process The ""surrealism"" of this movie can only be connected to the mentioned process itself or to some weird settings that appear in some scenes of the film, since I don't think it's a ""traditional surreal"" story. And the plot is not so non-linear either. It's pretty understandable indeed.As positive features I will refer the cinematography (there are really good settings in this film, and the idea of the things start to disappearing around him while his memory was being erased was also pretty nice) and the acting, which is not bad either. Kate Winslet and Kirsten Dunst were very hot in this film!The soundtrack I didn't appreciate too. I think it's too poor and sometimes it's just too weird, on a bad wayGenerally I think it could have been better, so I will score it 5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Hits harder once you've lived a little...,"I can write an essay discussing and debating the premise, cast and direction, but I won't.I first watched this movie in my teens, I didn't get it. I thought it was boring and overrated. I've recently turned 30 and been in an 8 year relationship with all of the charm and turmoil depicted in Joel and Clementine's. I loved it, it hit home and whilst it is filled with melancholy; it's also strangely heartwarming and comforting.It's essentially a love story in reverse and the performances from all lead and supporting actors are impeccable. Carey was wonderful and demonstrated again how talented he is. Only those who struggle to separate him from comedy will dispute that. Winslet was also fantastic and did justice to demonstrating some of the battles living with BPD can present.In short, it's a charming movie whatever your life experience, but it becomes a masterpiece once you've lived enough to relate.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
I was not expecting that,"The performances in this film are exceptional. Jim Carrey delivers a remarkable departure from his usual comedic roles, showcasing his dramatic range and vulnerability as Joel. Kate Winslet brings depth and complexity to the character of Clementine, portraying her as both impulsive and deeply wounded.The visual style of the film is also noteworthy. Michel Gondry's imaginative direction, combined with stunning cinematography, creates a dreamlike atmosphere that perfectly complements the film's themes of love and loss. The use of practical effects and creative set designs adds a whimsical touch to the storytelling.Overall, ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is a beautifully crafted film that challenges our perceptions of love and memory. It explores the idea that even the most painful experiences can shape us and that erasing them may not be the solution. This movie is a must-watch for those who appreciate thought-provoking storytelling, exceptional performances, and a touch of surrealism.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Jim Carrey's Finest Performance of his Career!,"When one comes out of first viewing Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, it is almost hard to know what to truly think of it. The film takes you on such a bizarre, mind-bending adventure that the first impression is not the one in which really matters. Like many other films from this director, Michel Gondry, it is a film that tends to get better with age.The film's premise is one of the most original I think ever used within a film. The thought that someone could erase specific memories from your mind is at times something any human wishes they could have done. Who wouldn't want to forget a traumatic experience or bad relationship? Still what this film does is make you think about life, love, and memories in a way in which no other film in history has ever made you think.The film was superbly directed by Michel Gondry, who also co-wrote this Oscar winning screenplay with ace screenwriter Charlie Kauffman. I truly believe that this is both filmmakers best works, but the film truly shines thanks to its cast, in particular Jim Carrey, who seems to be playing the only straight man in a comedic story. It is bar none his best dramatic performance to date, and any fan of his work should check this film out.Overall Eternal Sunshine is a totally unique experience that even after a few viewings I still don't know what to truly think of it, but time will tell where this film truly stands.I give Eternal Sunshine a 10 out of 10!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
worst c.kaufman film,"While a HUGE fan of Adaptation (one of my top 10ers) and Being John Malkovich (another great)....ESOSM is a dud.The whole movie is spent on showing off cinemotagrophy and camera tricks, through the internal minds of these characters...and not until the end does it strike my interest. It ONLY strikes my interest at the end because it actually comes back to the story.How long can one watch fast-paced, dizzy, dream-sequences of two people that barely get along, only to have one of them disappear and then re-appear in another place, then starting all over again in another setting?Someone earlier compared this to Mulholland. Please don't do that.This movie sucked...and this is coming from one fussy guy.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Some thoughts occurring after watching the movie....,"Maybe I have a different perception, maybe I was in the wrong mood for this movie, but I agree with the predecessors only in one point: Kate Winsley and Jim Carrey did an awesome job. I like movies like ""Twelve Monkeys"", ""Memento"". But watching this movie I get the impression that the bizarre elements are more likely an attempt to wrap an ever told love story in a 21th century coat. Further more there are a lot of illogic and not fitting side plots. Smoking joints and having something like sex in the bed with the patient suits right in movies like ""Donnie Darko"" and those from the Coen brothers but not in this movie. It seems that in the year 2004 even a classic love story cannot be told without elements of ""Total recall"", ""The Forgotten"", ""Vanilla Sky"". For my own very personal view, this movie is artificial not art.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Garbage!,"Did all of you watch a different movie than my wife and I watched?!  This movie was garbage.  Here's why:1.  The camera constantly shook, making it difficult to watch without getting sick to my stomach.  It reminded me of the Blair Witch Project - which at least was interesting aside from the camera shaking.2.  All of the characters were unlikable.  I couldn't care less about any of them.3.  There was no plot or purpose.  Okay, I understood the premise of erasing memories and Joel's desire to hold onto the memories after committing to have them erased.  But why all of the pointless, disjointed scenes?  One after another. Pointless, meaningless snippets of their lives together. Who cares?  Over and over and over until I felt like screaming, `Enough already! Get on with it!'  There was no mystery or anticipation of something about to happen.4.  Weird new subplots were constantly added that only confused this confusing mess even further.About 3/4 of the way through the movie, I turned to my wife and said, `What do you think?'  Her response was, `This is the worst movie I've ever watched.'  We walked out of the theatre glad to be out of there.  I couldn't care less about missing the ending because, in our view, there was no story. This was only the second movie I've ever walked out on.The whole thing seemed like a bad drug trip.

"Visceral, emotional and well written.","If there was one word I would use to describe Michel Gondry's Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, it would be visceral. The entire film is loaded with rich and honest detail, in its setting and in its characters and in its emotion. You can look at the characters in their environment and see many things you can relate to, and Gondry succeeded with this intention, because love is something that we can all relate to and it helps make this story more personal.The concept is ambitious, despite it being centered around something we are all familiar with; heartbreak. What if you had your heart broken and you wished that all of those memories would just go away? So you don't have to deal with the unbearable emotional pain that comes with it? Well in this film, such a business exists. Joel (Jim Carrey) signs up to get his memories of Clementine (Kate Winslet) erased because he's far too damaged from the turmoil.The film's narrative is told through a unique structure, which should be no surprise when you find that the brilliant Charlie Kaufman wrote the screenplay. The movie exists in the present while Joel is enduring his procedure, and in the memories inside his head, which include events that already happened and a lucid Joel who is aware of what is happening inside these memories and tries to run from it with Clementine. These sequences in particular are brilliant because they really capture a dream-like aura to them that are quite appropriate. It's like when you're trying to tell someone something but it's just not getting through to them. Then there's the frustration and the desperation that comes with trying to change something that feels out of your grasp.The bad memories are the ones to go first, the ones we don't hesitate to forget. The arguments and the fighting and the crying, the memories that we don't want to remember when they're associated with such good. It's only when the good memories start being effected that Joel tries desperately to hold onto those. He doesn't want to forget, he just wants to relive them and he wants to stay there forever. So he and Clementine hide in memories where they can't be found to hold onto the love they used to have. Yes, its as touching as it sounds. Kaufman made a smart choice in his screenplay in not completely setting the movie inside Joel's mind. Instead, actors such as Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood and Tom Wilkinson, who are the people carrying out the procedure on Joel, are going through their own experiences involving love and heartbreak. This is important because it represents how this kind of love is something that we all go through. It wouldn't make sense for just the main character and his love to be going through it, then it wouldn't seem so real. When you have such skilled actors playing these parts, it does not derail from the story or the excitement in any way, it strengthens it.But the stars of the show here are Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet, who share a magnetic chemistry. Carrey is shy and vulnerable and introverted, his soft-spoken narration is reflective of his personality. With Clementine, Joel's personality opens up and with her he feels the way he's never felt before. And the emotional journey he goes through as he tries to save his love with her is played quite well by Carrey. Its a wonderful dramatic turn from him that's different from his unique style of comedy he's known for. Kate Winslet is a tour de force, completely disappearing into her character's skin. She gives her charm and enough quirks to make her unique and alive but also very human. All of the actors in this film make it work.All of these things mentioned, along with the outstanding camera work and visuals and locations, even the use of its soundtrack all help craft what is one of the most memorable films to emerge from the 2000s. Its very well crafted and smart and encourages the viewer to think and feel. And what more can those of us who appreciate movies ask for?",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
An experience like no other,"I had the pleasure of watching eternal sunshine of the spotless mind and it made me wish Jim Carrey did more roles like this, because it is quite fantastic.This time around Charlie Kaufman makes to think about memories and dreams.

Of course this leads to some very dramatic moments where it works, it will affect everyone differently which is something special.The camera work and the dream sequences are fantastic, the script by Kaufman is my favorite of his and the performances are hilarious and rather human.Overall, this is a shining gem of 2004 and cannot recommend it enough.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

"A good, but fairly predictable movie","A unique problem arises when a movie tries to separate itself from your average, run-of-the-mill film: When too many other movies make the same attempt, it becomes anything but unique. Such seems to be the problem for ""Eternal Sunshine"". The storyline seems almost formulaicly fractured, in a way that what should be a confusing and misleading transition become as easy to detect as a simple scene change. Plot twists seem to be forced in at exactly the moments you would expect them, effectively draining them of all weight.This aside, the story is often very compelling. It is all too easy to relate to the frustration of the main characters, even though the circumstances are pure science fiction. All said, this is a very enjoyable movie that suffers a little from structural elements and poor plot twists.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind takes the romantic genre and injects a quirky sci-fi concept right into the heart.,"Over the years this has developed massive acclaim and a cult following, with many stating it's one of the best romance stories available. Whilst I do not slot into that following, I can appreciate the admiration that viewers give this. Joel falls in love with Clementine, they are complete opposites but are attracted to each other's qualities. Her impulsive nature does not always sit well with Joel, and suddenly the two have each other erased from their minds through a specialist company that deals with this procedure. Halfway through the process, Joel changes his mind and must attempt to savour his last memories of her. Concept aside, what separates this from other similar films is the editing and overall creative environment. One minute they are in a library, only to transition outside on a frozen lake. Inside a cosy lounge? Don't worry, rain will start to pour down. It reflects how the mind works. The scattered nature of the narrative, consistently switching from scene to scene, resembles our brains and how memories are mapped. There is no linear path to memories, when you think of something nostalgically you then suddenly think of something else. You may find this jarring and slightly confusing, but it works. It's an intriguing concept that is thoroughly explored both in technique and the moral implications. We even have subplots regarding the team who are leading the memory erasing process. I do find this detracts from the focus on Joel and Clementine which is the more important element to the film. Having said that, Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet have ample amount of screen time. Both playing roles that they do not typically perform, yet the chemistry felt real. At no point was I thinking ""this feels like typical Hollywood fabricated romance"". The indie feel of the film allows the filmmakers to explore themes of memories and the mind without tarnishing the central romance. A creative and intriguing drama.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"Hatchet Job Remake of  Luis Bunuel's ""That Obscure Object of Desire""","Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is clearly inspired by the Surrealist style of Luis Bunuel, and in particular his film ""That Obscure Object of Desire."" Unfortunately none of the wit and imagination of a Bunuel film is displayed here. Given the weak screenplay and uninspired direction it is no surprise that the actors put in such lackluster performances. The usually manic Jim Carrey looks like he phoned in his performance, and the End Credits appear as if the production team couldn't come up with anything better. David Lynch and the Coen Brothers needn't worry about competition from Charlie Kaufman in this genre.

Brilllliant,"This must be what they mean by when they say Modern Cinema. Movies like this and Inception, Memento, The Matrix, Requiem for a Dream(artistically).... are the movies young people should be watching not Transformers. I saw the movie last night and i just can't stop thinking about it for a moment. It also reminded me of a quote that Christopher Nolan said he based his movie Inception on: death and Nature Illuminate, Elevate. Love ventures under, the rest all never. yes, this movie is about dreams, but the difference is in that, unlike other movies that identify with the above quote, love doesn't necessarily venture under for this one.I read many reviews saying that this movie is very hard to follow especially with its non-chronological way of story telling. Nonetheless, the narrative, for me, wasn't hard to understand and i also thought the order of the story telling actually compliments the movie.The directing was top notch, some might even say perfect. I also loved the editing which helped the film not to lag. As for the acting, i was mesmerized with Kate Winslet but I thought Jim Carrey was even better. It is maybe because seeing him in such a serious role is too weird. It is hard to believe that it is same guy from Ace Ventura or Dumb and Dumber. However, as much as i think this is an almost perfect film, the script somehow trumps them all- it deserved the Oscar.As much as i believe i have understood the hole movie, i still believe it has some deeper meaning and a higher understanding of things, which is why i believe i am gonna see it several times in the years to come.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Oh god... this movie is too strong..,"ESOTSM is one of good movies made by Charlie Kaufman. I should say Kaufman is one of my favorites. The storyline idea and originality which he made was rare.One thing i admire from Kaufman is that he never feels complacent. Time to time he shows non trepidation works and its hard to find something insipid. His works is immutable and ameliorate drama genre. Maybe some people see him as a dogmatic because he likes to play in his own sole world, but it was benevolent to create non prosaic drama. Kaufman rule the apex level of drama perseverely. If you seek for elites, this director is in peer.ESOTSM is one of most beautifully made drama. Early, Kaufman using scenes to establishing characters life and milieu. Wake up shots, train shots, and beach shots, it gives a very potent impact to the portrayal of Carrey. It relegates storyline into more charming. In the mid duration, this is the problem of misconception of love begin. This is one of story shape that only exist a few in the history. In the late duration, its all about regression and retribution. Kaufman using deep intimacy fantasy shots to grow affection to two leads (Carrey and Winslet). Sink scene, bed scene, and the last sinking house scene were core examples.Character development is a benevolent aspect to Kaufman. He likes to play with characters, digging their minds, giving mental illness, lacking of happiness, feeling deep sorrow, such things like that. He likes to do these with his own inheritance style, and his inheritance is about giving bond and affection to his lead characters. So in the end, he can choose whatever ending he wants to his leads but still inhibit strong dramatic story.

A very different tale about true love,"This film is currently the 92th highest rated movie on IMDB and there are to this day 1,696 reviews on this site, so it's not like my review will matter that much. Still, I re-watched this movie after a few months and I thought it was time for me for tossing my views about this movie in the reviews section.One day Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) instead of going to work picks another train to Montauk, a shoreline zone on Long Island and he walks on the beach. On the way home he meets Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet) and they began a friendship. Suddenly she decides that she doesn't want to go on and she goes to a clinic run by Dr. Howard Mierzwiak where memories can be deleted. Joel soon realizes this and he does everything for erasing Clementine from his memory. However, time passes and this doesn't happen because down deep he really loves her. This is basically the plot for ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND.So what I liked about the film? Michel Gondry's direction was very innovative with his use of handycam shots. Needless to say that the actors' performances are good. Jim Carrey unleashes his most serious side and he handles the part well. Kate Winslet is also very convincing (and she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress) and Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst and Elijah Wood give nice support throughout the movie.

Brilliant and Timeless Modern Classic,"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) is a masterpiece of modern cinema that explores the complexities of love, memory, and the human condition.

Oscar Rob,"I have to say I'm severely disappointed that Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind was so over looked. I see it has a few nominations, but not nearly as many as it should. I have seen most of the nominated movies, and while I did enjoy a few in particular (and some I just don't see what all the fuss is about), I have to say that Eternal sunshine surpassed many other films this year. Even if you weren't a huge fan of it, it's hard to deny the immense creativity and imagination that went into the creation of this film. But it didn't come of cheesy, it was beautiful and so well executed. I have never seen anything so visually close to what my dreams and memories look like in my head. How could not get a nod for art direction? As for Kate Winslet's nomination, it doesn't come to much as a surprise to me. She is a very talented actress and this role was no exception. But what about Mr. Carrey? In my humble opinion, I truly think this is one of the best performances he has ever given, and I've seen pretty much all his movies. I admit, I am a fan, but that doesn't hinder the fact that his usual antics were gone and replaced with another side of him we haven't seen, even in other more drama oriented movies such as the Truman Show. And I'm not just saying and actor who changes up their roles a bit should be nominated. However, his performance was so true and pure and real. I know that guy. I know Joel, we all do. We have seen him sitting lonely in some public place. We have seen that guy who has insecurities so heavy they slow him down when he walks. He was so real, even in a movie that can arguably be considered a fantasy or sci-fi piece. And that's another thing about this movie: while there is no category for this, this movie refreshed the often boring genre of a love story. It was an almost bizarre idea with a love story at the core. And despite the fantasy aspects of it, it was a more real love story than some others I have seen. I don't usually post about these matters because I feel that it doesn't change anything and all it does is cause internet arguments, but I felt the need to say something about this, as one movie lover, to others.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Brilliant,"Sometimes breaking up is so painful that you wish you could just sear the memories of the other person out of your mind, to be done with them forever, irrevocably. Tenderness has turned to bitterness, almost as if they were another person entirely, when of course, you've been finding out more about one another, things have happened, and change is inevitable. To remove the memories of them entirely, as if you had never met them in the first place, might take away the pain, but it would also remove the things that make life worth living, the moments of genuine connection, the unbelievable rush of falling in love. Instead, if only you could hold on to the sweet memories forever, or to talk to the person at those critical moments in time but now with the benefit of perspective, and be more forgiving.This is such a powerful film, touching as it does on the emotions of the heart. The technology imagined by Charlie Kaufman is such a cool concept, and the way it's filmed by Michel Gondry is pitch perfect to the swirl of memories that make up what we think about, what we remember, about our life and the people in it. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are also perfect in this, and Mark Ruffalo and Kirsten Dunst give fine performances in their supporting roles (I also really liked how Dunst's character played out). The immature behavior of those performing the procedure is a fantastic contrast to how advanced the technology is, and isn't this often the way? All of these characters are deeply flawed, but there is such sweetness in the love story that it just hits me in the gut every time. The film is a magical blend of romance and science-fiction, artistically rendered, and simply brilliant.The verse from Alexander Pope from which the title derives, and its backstory, the secret love and marriage of Héloïse d'Argenteuil to Peter Abélard, her teacher, fits the film beautifully too:How happy is the blameless vestal's lot!The world forgetting, by the world forgot.Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind!Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

"Ingenious, bold and eccentric, guaranteed to hit your emotional core","The teaming of whimsical director Michel Gondry and mind-bending writer Charlie Kaufman was bound to end with the creation of a film that refused to stick to normal cinematic boundaries, but still compelled the viewer. However, Eternal Sunshine went beyond levels of wacky beauty and intellectualism that even the most optimistic viewer would've hoped for.Starring Jim Carrey as Joel Barish, who wants to remove his impulsive ex-girlfriend Clementine (Kate Winslet) from his memory after she did the same to him, it focuses mainly on the importance of memory to humanity, and how beneficial it is to keep even the worst memories. The film is composed mainly of a journey through the psyche of Joel Barish, as he watches as the team of erasers, Lacuna Inc, destroy all his memories However, the main reason for watching is the beautiful, quirky and tumultuous relationship between Carey and Winslet. The chemistry between the two is unmistakable, with Carey leaving his ordinary comedy role to play a timid neurotic who is too nervous to appreciate the joys of life, and Winslet playing up her role as the extrovert girlfriend that awakens Joel's senses.The two main characters play on every emotion that the audience can bear; doing the utmost to ensure that there is no minute of film in which our humanity is not being played like a violin. Each insult they hurl during their relationship hits us hard, each tender moment is felt as deeply. Gondry and Kaufman set up scenes of eccentric beauty throughout, from Carey and Winslet lying on their backs on a frozen lake, to a comically sweet ""baby Joel"" scene. And throughout this, our beliefs on what memory is, and what it does, is poked and prodded, examined whilst we watch and wonder ourselves what our own memory would be like.Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst and Elijah Wood provide fine support as Lacuna staff with their own intriguing secrets. Wood excels especially, a side plot involving his character falling for Clementine and using Joel's identity to try to win her heart is a fine separation from the main plot, whilst still adding more layers to Clementine as a character.The universe that is created here, where people can be free to run around their own minds, experiencing their lives all over again, is one that simply should not be compressed into under two hours. The audience wants more when the film finishes, more of the elegantly idiosyncratic touches that are deftly moulded into the memory scenes for one, but also more of Joel and Clementine, what is next for them in their relationship. For without their engaging love story at the centre of proceedings, this film will be no more than a series of fanciful but emotionless tricks. With Carey and Winslet pitch-perfectly playing this ambiguous relationship, emotion is one thing that this film certainly isn't lacking.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
How other people shape us,"The film tells the story of Joel and Clementine, a couple who undergo a revolutionary procedure to erase each other from their memories after a painful breakup. But it turns out that it's not so easy to remain yourself after losing someone who shaped your soul.The comedy actor Jim Carrey delivers a surprisingly nuanced performance as Joel, diving deep into the complexities of heartbreak and vulnerability. His chemistry with Winslet, filled with both tenderness and turmoil, is the heart of the film, making their journey through fragmented memories both poignant and profoundly relatable.A classic for its thought-provoking narrative and emotional depth, this film lingers in the mind long after viewing, reminding us that our experiences, both joyful and sorrowful, shape who we are. It is a must-watch for anyone who has ever loved and lost. Or just for those who love good movies!",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Vintage Charlie Kaufman,"I absolutely adored this film-the performances, the concept, the brilliant script, and the wonderful direction. The chemistry of Winslet and Carrey was palpable. I became a fan of Charlie Kaufman's after seeing ""Adaptation,"" and am completely sold on him. His creativity knows no bounds. The movie is not told in linear time, which makes it interesting, although a bit confusing if you don't freeze the tape or pause the DVD if you have to leave the room for a bit. The film made me think a lot about memories, and their powers, and it touched me very deeply. Kudos as well to Mark Ruffalo and Kirsten Dunst for their performances.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
I can't jump on either side. I just think it's a nice movie.,"It's a nice movie. That's all i can say it was for me.I see two kinds of reviewers here. One side sees this movie as a masterpiece, the other side expected a masterpiece and got underwhelmed. I seem to stand somewhere in between...The performance of the actors is astonishing. Winslet is great, but that's no surprise. Carey on the other hand was blowing me away with his subtle approach... i did not see that coming from a guy that was ""the mask"".It is sure a beautiful movie, but i think a part of the attraction to it is that it is not a typical Hollywood movie. It is free from any romantic clichés that usually get served to us when two famous actors play the ""fall in love""-thing. The movie unfolds mixing a Hollywood-unknown realism with a Hollywood-unknown surrealism. It's like having a joint: if you expect to be blown away, then nothing will happen. But if you relax and let it get to you, then you might enjoy it.Still: The movie obviously hasn't had the same effect that it had on most other people. It reminded me a little to my first relationship (with a different ending). But maybe that's what it's supposed to be. A sorta teenage-style ""first love"" story told with mid-30ies people. It feels like a nostalgic picture of my idea of love when i was about 16, but stuffed with people of my age, so i can easier relate. To me that just doesn't feel honest. I did not think i'd ever say that, but i feel pretty grown up after watching this.Pretty much everybody in one way or the other doesn't want to grow up. If love is the thing where you don't want to mature in (or just how it was when you weren't), then take a look at this one. I couldn't get the hang of the naivety of the protagonists.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Perfectly amazing!,"First of all, I'd say that you should have been in love and lost it to understand this movie perfectly and feel it for real.This movie is not a cheap romance. This is deep. It's about real love. About the love that finds itself even without you noticing it or knowing about it. About love that knows no anger or ending. About love that even after the last goodbye, says 'I love you'.Also the acting is perfect. You can really feel the love, and pain, and everything in their eyes. Not to mention that the whole cast is just amazing.This movie is pure love.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
The Surreal Life. (Spoilers),"'Eternal Sunshine' is another brain-bending riddle from screenwriter Charlie Kaufman. I didn't like 'Being John Malkovich' or 'Adaptation,' but I thought 'Eternal Sunshine' was really a good movie. Long, but good.This is a movie with an interesting concept: how do people deal with bad situations? Here, a company offers permanent repression of memory.The story focuses on Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet), two people who awkwardly meet and fall in love (I suppose). But, their lack of communication skills prevents any sort of meaningful relationship. Over time, they grow weary of other.This are the most interesting, surrealistic scenes and once that force to you realize that everything you're seeing about Joel was a memory or something erased from his memory (pay close attention when you watch it again to the beginning scenes prior to Joel's going to the clinic).During the latter part of the memory wipe, Joel starts to concentrate on all the good times that he and Clementine had, realizing that he is still in love with her. And the latter part of the memory wipe is Joel trying to manipulate his memories to hide them from the fast sweep of the memory wipe process. Essentially, he tries to manipulate his memories and save Clementine in another part of his brain. It is like Atreyu being chased by the Nothing and salvaging what he can of Fantasia. Joel is salvaging what he can of Clementine and in the end, memory wipe doesn't seem like the best solution afterall (although, Joel probably would've gone for a technique that just wiped out the bad and kept the good).But the interesting part is the finale. Because, these people continue to have their memory wiped again and again (making it one wealthy enterprise, no less). Although, what I don't understand is why would those people keep doing exactly the same thing that led up to meeting that other person (or doing whatever it was the they had erased). Would Joel jump on the train to Montauk (something that seemed out of the ordinary at the time, anyway) every day after he got his memory wiped? So, even as an old man getting his memory erased for the umpteenth time, would he be compelled to go on the train to Montauk and start all over again? It seems pretty stupid.Though this movie is somewhat long, given that you're forced to follow Joel through every single damned memory of Clementine, the repetition is somewhat alleviated by this surrealistic journey until the whole thing becomes so totally bizarre and the situation for Joel so desperate. In the end, the movie suggests that it is more painful to try to ignore everything (and very counterproductive), instead of just trying to face those problems. It seems like Joel and Clementine, two eccentrics, seem really happy together when things are going well. If they just would've honestly confronted their problems, they wouldn't need the memory, and they'd have probably been a couple that was well off for as long as they could be (not to say that happy endings last forever).Kaufman's surrealistic style strikes gold here, as does a pretty fantastic cast. Especially, Jim Carrey proves he doesn't have to overact to do well. Although, I must say Elijah Wood does take yet another weird part as Patrick, the lab assistant, who tries to steal Joel's identity in order to woo Clementine. But, the whole movie is really Carrey and Winslet.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
This movie is terrible and WAY overrated...,"This comment is to save those people who haven't seen it yet, from its false advertising... I have NO IDEA why this movie is rated #33 on IMDb! That just shows how weird people are. Maybe I wasn't all that interested in the characters and their interaction or development, but rather it was awkward, confusing, and such a waste. I didn't like the characters AT ALL, and there wasn't really any good chemistry between them. They were miserable together, and they ended it, and then they chose to give it another shot, even if it will be miserable again! Now, I give them the credit for going along for the ride - but relationships aren't supposed to be like that. There are actually good relationships out there, but this superficial world seeking for pleasure in temporal and destroying substances is indicative and portrayed in this movie. It's interesting that they needed alcohol to make things romantic, always. It shows a lot about their character, and the character of those people who loved the movie! I just couldn't wait for the movie to END! This movie is really terrible. It made me dizzy and confused. I had NO GOOD feelings come out of it, and felt I had wasted 2 hours of my life. It isn't entertaining, uplifting, or edifying AT ALL. Really, Don't Waste Your Time With This Movie.",2.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Beyond film and reality,"Love stories are old. They are probably the most common type of stories you can come across in movies and literature. To make an original love story is hard and That's why I love Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.The concept is brilliant: erase memories of two lovers and then let them find their way back to each other.The execution is terrific, blending memories with reality and constantly cutting between past and present. Magically we are confused yet comfortably numb in our confusion. We fully trust the narrator to guide us to to the end.I love the way their love isn't idealized-he isn't the perfect man and she isn't the most attractive woman (in her clothes) but this adds to it and makes them more relatable.8/10 - artistically perfect.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Sweet Romance Fiction of Modern Era,"What's teenage movie about? Yes, it's always about love, break-up, love again, and friendship. Seems boring, but love itself is endless. Let me give the border for ""love"" in this review. It's not about love that I usually write in my other review. Just love from man and woman for her/his couple. As simple as that, the way modern teenage know it too well. Contemporary love we can call it, and contemporary movies we often watched it about this kind of love. So, what's so special about Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004)? It is the unusual but still romantic idea about love. A science-fiction indeed, not about alien, computer, future, but simply about the way to move one from a man or woman. Ordinary teenage problem, and how this era help teenage to do it. Of course, it has been one decade since it was first released. And technology looks so different even just past 10 years. So, let us just focus on 2004, only cell-phone, and so few of social media. I think the more modern humans are, the harder they will move on, especially for young generation. It's interesting-subject for new-born era of the new-born century.First, let's dig about the very content of this movie. A stressful young man indeed who want to move on. Simple, humble, but there is something more. The fictional way to get it, that's the brilliant idea. I don't want to spoil about how or why, I just want to highlight the point of this teenage problem. Teens always want to be practical, instant, fast, by ignoring the way, and just focus on the results. They don't care how it would happen and the consequences, they just keep blaming, crying, and sad. Yes, it's a part of adolescence though. People gets wiser with it. And the point is the whole young- generation meets high-technology, although it's only fiction, but it's a picture of reality. Again, they don't really know the effect, they even don't really know what they really want. I mean it could be crucial for the next upcoming age, especially for our young-generation. The technology is done carefully, but the usage is not appropriate. I mean it could be no ethics at all in the next information era, when young people can do whatever they want instantly. But, that's the disastrous effect one. That's my thought, a mini-message of this movie, I recommend you to watch it to know what I really mean of those impacts.Go to the story, I adore, what a lovely story. Yes, with some feature of smooth visual-effects, I just can get the whole movie seamlessly. It's not complicated, added with twist, and full of sweet scene. However, what I really love is the touch of surrealism. A movie about dream must be surreal in my opinion. Let's accumulate all those stories of contemporary love, with the science-fiction- seasoning, great acting and cinematography, in the table of surrealism, and what a luscious piece do you really get. I give it nine out of ten, because of its genius and understandable, and it points toward the youth. Very educative, great motion picture of affection.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
What a journey,"Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind was just a real joy to watch. The film literally kept me on edge the entire time.

Ever have a really bad breakup, and you wish you had never known the other person? Well, in this movie, it's possible with a revolutionary memory erasing system.To avoid spoilers, I won't go much further, but basically the characters decide, while in the middle of the memory erasing procedure, that he still has feelings for her.Jim Carrey, Kate Winslet, and Kirsten Dunts make up an A-list cast, for an A+ movie.

Kate Winslet is at her loosest, Mark Ruffalo is fun in an early role and Kirstin Dunst shows all sorts of promise along with Tom Wilkinson and Elijah Wood. This is a dream cast in a film about a couple in love having their memories erased, regretting it and trying to stop it. The direction by Michael Gondry is extremely inventive, the Oscar winning writing oh so original and the production design is wonderful. Is this a great film?

My White Whale,"Going through the ups and downs of relationships throughout my life, I found comfort in film during my romantic lows. La La Land, Scott Pilgrim, and The Great Gatsby were some of my go-to cinematic vices to relate to other relationship turmoil. Living on my watchlist throughout it all, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind evaded me for years. Assuming it would fit perfectly with my other 'comfort films', I was eager to check this off my list.Finding out his ex-girlfriend Clementine (Kate Winslet) has undergone a procedure to erase him from her memory, Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) struggles with the realization that things are over. Deciding to undergo the procedure himself, Joel visits Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) to sign up. While experiencing the erasure of his ex-girlfriend, Joel relives the highs, the lows, and everything in between as he begins regretting his decision. Attempting to cling to her memory, Joel might just get exactly what he had wished for.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind crafts a heartbreakingly realistic journey for Joel & Clementine. While sprinkling in some fantastical elements, the story keeps itself firmly grounded, metaphorically addressing common post-breakup mental struggles. Carrey lands the dramatic role and proves he can be more than a jester, under the correct guidance. The chemistry he and Winslet share truly feels believable and makes it all the more heartbreaking as the events unfold.Though Joel & Clementine created a beautifully tragic love story, it felt as though the subplots surrounding them consistently derailed the focus. While I understand the direction the writers wanted, Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst, and Elijah Wood felt completely unnecessary and repetitively pulled me out of the drama. Though I seem to be in the minority, I was rather annoyed when the encapsulating romance screeched to a halt in favor of a less intriguing subplot.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind paints a lovely tale of romance gone wrong and weaves realistic emotions throughout to connect to audiences. Though it feels nearly perfect at times, it, unfortunately, loses its focus and lacks excitement when our lovers are absent. While the film was thoroughly enjoyable, I almost wish I had left it on my watchlist to forever be a perfect unseen gem.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Eternal sunshine of the spotless movie review,"I've always found this movie fascinating for a number of reasons, but it's only been recently that I've discovered just what it is that draws me into this crazy story. I think what sold me on this film is the way it straddles and selects themes from many different genres. Overall it seems mostly to be a romantic comedy of sorts, though even this could probably be debated. But while mostly centering on romance with a comedic touch the movie seems to carry a strong message, which it conveys with events that seem to resemble psychological thrillers and maybe even sci-fi at a stretch.Because it uses so many elements of so many genres it is an interesting movie to look at from an analytical standpoint. It brings together many motifs to tell a compelling story that draws upon an entire range of emotions, making it very engaging to watch.

Can memory be erased? Unconscious and escapism thinking,"The film, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, gives the audience a brand-new view of the blended style in representing memories through film-making. Although it seems that the film is made out of order, actually it follows a structure, that is the stream of consciousness. The non-linear representation, the irregularity of narrative, and the subversion of the normal impression of space and time are all vivid embodiment of human's dreams and memories. According to Freud's psychoanalysis theory, ""Dreams are the royal road to the unconscious"". He argues that dreams are wish-fulfillments, and those wishes are the result of repressed or frustrated desires( to him, mainly sexual desires). Dreams can be the deep, profound memories in people's life which they purposely hide behind or intendedly forget with the help of certain medicines. However the question is, can memory be effectively erased, or does it be turned into unconscious? In the movie, when Patrick exposes his feelings to Clementine with the words he steals from Joel, it's very strange that Clementine reacts to it in an uneasy way, it seems that she senses something wrong, that sense can be explained as coming from the unconscious. The major themes in the film are, of course, about love and memory. There is still the big theme in American culture, escapism or flightism. People tend to escape from the reality whenever they confront with difficulties and frustrations. In the movie, we see the characters, Clementine, Joel and Mary, escape from the unfruitful love experiences by erasing all their memories related through medical treatments. Escape does no help in solving problems, but is simply self-deception. When the unhappy memory comes back and presents itself in front of you, it becomes more unbearable and crueler. Mary resigns her position. Out of revenge or responsibility, we can not ascertain, she mails all the clients' records, forcing them to face their obsessing memories. It is interesting that the ending is designed in an open way. The two lovers seem to be ready to reunite, but have they learned any lesson from their previous experiences? Are they going to escape again if they have any problems? There are uncertainty and indeterminacy left behind.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"brilliant, breath-taking, highly original","'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' is a brilliant and highly original film, often provoking a lot of thought and revealing its plot gradually. It is, in my opinion, one of the best films of 2004.It's hard to really summarize the plot without spoiling it because the film releases it gradually, but this is the best I can do without spoiling it. The film is about a couple who had been in a relationship and who had undergone psychological treatments to rid them of the painful memories so that they can start their separate life again. Little did they know that they are being brought back together by fate, and they soon realize what they had. The film also features a couple minor subplots, but you'll have to watch the film to see what they are.I don't know how I'd classify this film. It's not quite a romance, and it's not quite science-fiction. But, it is probably the type of film any of us who have been in a painful relationship can relate to.Artistic and well done in nearly every aspect, this film deserved more recognition than it received. (I only fault it slightly in that I was able to predict the plot quite early on - although others I saw the film with did not, and that it did go a little overboard with the ending and seemed to lose direction when the whole story before that was done beautifully.) However, I think it is an excellent film, despite the few (very few) faults. I highly recommend this film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Third Time is a Charm,"I started to watch Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and after first 15 minutes I realized I could not turn it off and drive to work (which I was supposed to do). I did what Jim Kerry's character Joel did  I called my boss and left her a message that I would be late. I stayed home and I watched the film. I cried, I laughed, I sighed, I felt  I lived through it. There are not so many films that we don't just watch but live through  for me, ESotSM was that. Finally, the Charlie Kaufman's film that I absolutely love. ""Being John Malkovich"" amused me; ""Adaptation"" irritated me  too much of Charlie in there for my taste even if he looked like Nic Cage. Eternal Sunshine is Kaufman's masterpiece about relationships, memories, reality, and about intolerance, impatience, inability to listen to the others, to understand them. How easy it is to insult the one you love the most. How difficult it is to forgive yourself for that. How often we rely on the modern technology to fix our inner problems. How seldom we realize that painful and happy memories go together. You can not get rid of ones and keep the others. It may not be the best romance film ever but it is damn close. It is a tender and poignant Valentine Card that Kaufman sent to all of us  to remind us that the love exists, that relationships can survive, and even if they die, we have the memories of them, and nobody or nothing can take our memories from us. Is it just a coincidence that Kaufman references for the second time to the tragic and great love of Eloisa and Abelard in his works?I applaud to Michel Gondry for his brilliant directing; to the supporting cast, including Tom Wilkinson, Mark Ruffalo, and Kirsten Dunst. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet played their best roles ever and I hope to see Carrey more often in the dramatic performances. But in the beginning of everything there was a word  without Kaufman's screenplay the film would not have happened. Thank you, Charlie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Kaufman's mind is a world of its own!,"You can add Charlie Kaufman to the list of names (Hitler, Michael Jackson, Dr. Seuss) of people whom I never want to know what is going on in their own little minds.  As a writer of such films as Being John Malkovich, Adaptation and Human Nature, the slant to which this man sees the world is somewhat out of my comprehension.Not that that's a bad thing.   David Cronenberg continues to create films that amaze me with his vivid worlds of sex, violence and the creatures that lurk in the dark, but I rarely turn down an opportunity to sit through one of his fascinating films.Now, Charlie Kaufman releases his next foray into his mind-bending filmography with the poorly titled Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. The film, stars Jim Carrey as Joel, a mild mannered polite recluse that meats Clementine (Kate Winslet), a free spirited outgoing alcoholic.  The two spark up a relationship that lasts the better part of a year before falling apart over a harsh conversation one cold New York day.Wanting to rid herself of the memory of Joel, Clementine seeks the help of Dr. Howard Mierzwaik (Tom Wilkinson) who operates a business that can remove selected memories in a non-surgical operation that is on-line with a night of heavy drinking'.  The movie then follows Joel as he fights the procedure and tries to retain the happier times within the relationship.The story as summarized in a single paragraph seems simple enough, but with the Kaufman slant thrown in, it is anything but.  We watch as Joel plays cat and mouse with the doctors working on his unconscious body and watch as Joel's dreams and memories begin to disappear before him.  Imagine your most vivid memory then conceive of it being stripped from you element by element. The house you were in disappears. The people you knew vaporize. Fences or other structures dissolve as if never erected.  You run, but it follows you relentlessly erasing everything one step behind you.  You try and hide in a suppressed memory, but the procedure is a success and soon these experiences will be nothing more than a file in a doctor's office.Exhausting.Now, throw in a few sub-plots to further mess with your mind.  There is the doctors' assistant, Patrick (Elijah Wood) who falls in love with Clementine and uses Joel's memories to woo her into a romance.  There is also the love story between Dr. Mierzwaik, his wife, his secretary (Kristin Dunst) and assistant (Mark Ruffalo) that is too complicated and quirky to reveal here. Each of these play out during the 108 minute running time and are as non-conventional ideas as any of Kaufman's work.So, verdict time.  I am beginning to think that Charlie Kaufman might be the Martin Scorsese of our day.  See back in the 80's and 90's, Scorsese was able to get the best out of his actors and actresses and was able to provide an Oscar winning role to Paul Newman and a nomination to Sharon Stone. Anyone who can pull off this feat deserves credit.  Well, Kaufman should be no less regarded.  Catherine Keener pulled out a nomination for Being John Malkovich and Nicholas Cage was robbed of an Oscar for his duel role in Adaptation.  We can now add Jim Carrey to the list of actors that have proven their best following the written words of Mr. K.  By acting low key, without having us think he is being restrained, Carrey finally shows us the range he tried in other dramatic fare such as Man on the Moon and The Majestic.  The supporting cast, especially Dunst as the toke-smoking assistant are equally impressive.Oh yeah, the verdict.  Spotless Mind is not for all tastes, but in keeping an open frame, it might just end up on some critics best of' lists at years end.  Who wouldn't want to have a memory erased?  The loss of a pet, your most humiliating moment.  Kaufman exploits that notion and eventually shows us that each experience is there for a purpose, and good or bad, they make you what you are today.   This film challenged me into thinking of what I would dispose of within my own noggin and then further brought me to thinking as to whether I would regret the procedure.    I left the theatre without an answer, and aren't those the best kind of films of all? B+www.gregrants.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Confusion Reigns in This Goofy Flick,"I have just dragged back from a friend's home after suffering thru this ""Eternal Monsoon of the Addlepated Cerebellum."" I feel goofy from watching it. You don't so much watch it as suffer through it. Perhaps this is the vogue nowadays to have jerky sequences signifying nothing much at all but a morass of frenetic activity pass as avant-garde film-making, but it's lost on me. I read a review by a famous Chicago reviewer who claims there's emotional involvement of the viewer with the main characters. Well, not with my friend and me. We were put off by these two sad cases - Jim Carrey a subdued and lonely, rather conservative man, and Kate Winslet as a hoyden given to obscuring her beauteous charms under flagrantly dyed hair ranging in shades of Day Glo orange to Mood Indigo Blue. What a waste of this fine actress. The only good thing I saw was the welcome tamping down of Carrey's normal ebullience to a rather more approachable and assimilable sort of male creature, albeit shot through with insecurities and given to impulses only made understandable by watching the flick through. But who wants or needs to see what happens to either of these (again let me use the adjective)GOOFY characters? Not we! I chose this film on the basis of the awards it has both been nominated for and has garnered, the crown jewel being Winslet's nomination for the Academy Award! Who nominated her for this schlock? I rather think she should put a bag over her head! Try to hide this one from her resume! What is to be happy about in a role so chaotic and obscure? I know nothing about this flighty, maddening woman, having watched this film! Who would want to hitch their wagon to Winslet in this movie? A lunatic! I would like Lacuna Corp. to erase the memory of having seen this film from my brain, even with the threat of the Lacuna employees bouncing on either side of me on my bed of tortured electrodes while they clean house and do a clean sweep of my cranium! These tormented employees seem to be full of frantic actions as well as the crazed ""heroine."" Kirsten Dunst proves she has not an ounce of fat as she hops about prior to copulation with wild-haired Mark Ruffalo and then, unsated, begins an immediate seduction of her boss, the grand suave Doctor of this mad Lacuna outfit. What a GOOFY group these people make and what a dingbat dunce-cap of a movie they inhabit! I am loony from watching it and I am going to bed now and try to sleep it off. I hope I don't have flashbacks! Oh, welcome Senility! I want no short-term memory of this wild, manic, episodic Endurance Contest to darken my dreams!",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"You can erase someone from your mind, but not from your heart.","I heard a lot people talk about this movie. Many of my friends recommended it to me. But for different reasons I couldn't find any opportunity to watch it or  may be I just didn't want to spend my time on it. But some weeks ago I heard again the name of this movie and I told to myself I had to watch it. So, I finally did it. And now I feel so disappointed with myself I didn't watch it years ago when I was told to see it for the first time! I am really impressed by this film.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is an exceptional romantic drama. I am saying exceptional because for me it looks more like a romantic psychological thriller because the main idea of this movie is centered, let's say, on the psychology of two main characters Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) and Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet). Or I even would say, the movie shows the fight between the rational aspect of human nature and the emotional one. Watching the Joel and Clementine's story you understand that not always the rational is right. You can ignore your mind, but you can't ignore your heart and what it is telling you and your heart usually tells right things. Well, the plot of the movie is very simple: two different personalities Joel and Clementine meet each other, they fall in love, then they become a nice couple, they have great time together, but then this beautiful story comes to its end. And instead of talking and trying to find a way to amend their relations, they decide to erase all the memories related to each other. Clementine was the first to take such decision. So, she went to Lacuna, Inc., company dedicating to helping people to erase specific memories and let them start new happier life. When Joel knew about this, he decided to do the same, as a revenge, and went to the same doctor Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson). And here is where the story starts. The whole movie represents the process of erasure of Joel's memories. So, when you watch the movie, it feels like you are inside of his mind observing his love story with Clementine. But suddenly he realizes he wants to conserve these memories, he doesn't want to lose her because she is the love of his life and starts to stop the erasure. All his attempts fail when Dr. Howard interferes and finishes this process. Along with this story appears another one. It results Mary, receptionist had an affair with Dr. Howard and her memories about it were also erased. When she knew that, she quit her job and stole all the records on doctor's patients and sent those materials to all of them. This is the moment when Joel and Clementine, after listening to their records, understood why they felt so familiar to each other and decide to try to start from the beginning.You see, the story is pretty simple. But the way it's operated, the way how different stories and different realities cross each other is incredible. Sometimes you even lose the touch with the reality because you think all this is Joel's memories and imagination. Thanks to such s great script and director's work, the movie is watched in one breath, you feel tension and you are totally absorbed by the story. Also, I would like to note the brilliant performance of Jim Carrey. I always thought he could perform only comic roles. But here he shows his abilities to play serious roles too. Honestly, I was shocked by his excellent performance. I believed him from the very beginning of the film till its end.So, now it's my turn to recommend this movie! If you want to live the story with its main characters, if you want to convince yourself one more time that you can't lie to your heart, so this movie is right for you. You will definitely enjoy it, or at least you will see another not typical Jim Carrey and original movie story.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Deserves the Razzie for the stupidest movie,"After watching good movies with the ""memory"" stuff such as Paycheck and Butterfly effect, I thought, this movie would be a good way to pass a weekend evening - but boy, it royally spoiled my weekend.THe movie has no storyline to tell - it is just a collage of absurd events pasted together - making no sense. The photography is even worse, as if done by an amature video-photographer. I do not understands the directors fascination with close-ups and profiles and poor lighting. It adds to the viewers woes, who is already tortured by a non-existent storyline.No wonder, the movie is doing poorly at box-office. I saw people walking out of the movie in between.

If you  director - I'm talking to you, thinking that you can get to success point only if you have Jim's Carrey face in you movie. It's wrong idea.!This movie is O.K., even no matter that it's really cheap movie. And few more points that you should pay attention too: age mach of your characters - like (Kate Winslet she play's young and naive girl around 20 years old, but she is not young ), and Jim Carrey looks too established in comedy type movies for Toyota Corolla, also film quality: grayish cheap picture it's not helps here. And that scene at the beginning, in the train is too long and becomes finally very boring. DVD cover for this movie, is one of the most terrible design I ever seen in my life.

"Eternal Sunshine, though very peculiar and outlandish, is the most realistic slice of brilliance ever brought to the screen.","Charlie Kauffman has once again dumbfounded me with his ability to capture the strange but true things about this world and the humans that live on it.The Eternal Sunshine is without a doubt his best work yet (yes, even better than Being John Malchovich and Adaptation.) while using Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet in a mind boggling drama that actually puts you inside someone else's dreams. This, by far, was Jim Carrey's best acting job yet and should definitely be up for Best Actor for his stunning performance. But though this film was superb in every way, it isn't for everyone.

Partial recall,"Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman wrote the wonderfully surreal 'Being John Malkovich', and he's at it again in 'The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind', a similarly bizarre tale. To classify (wholly unfairly) it as genre, it's a romantic sci-fi (and how many of those do you see?), set in a world where disillusioned lovers can have their memories of each other erased. There's plenty of natural material in this concept, but unfortunately, Kaufman and director Michel Gondry are arguably guilty of trying a little too hard: the middle section of the movie takes place inside the characters' brains, for no real purpose in terms of plot: the film fills this logical vacuum with some evocative cinematography, but its impact is lessened because the film-makers have first licensed themselves to show anything they want. What they do get right, in combination with the leads, Jim Carrey and Kate Winslett, is to show real (positive and negative) chemistry between the protagonists; if anything, at times they appear almost too adorable, but at least there's a spark. And although daft, the film is wholly watchable and actually not bad at manipulating the viewer's emotions; but perhaps Kaufman didn't need to make his script jump through quite so many hoops.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

"A Wonderful, Wonderful Movie!","Charlie Kaufman has written brilliant and fantastic movies; I come on BEING JOHN MALCOVICH, APADTATION, CONFESSIONS OF A DANGEROUS MIND, and even the flawed yet great HUMAN NATURE. Now this has to be his best film he ever wrote or will write again. Director Micheal Gondry, who tackled on HUMAN NATURE, redeems himself with this work of art. Who would ever think being so spotless will be so amazing.Joel(Jim Carry) has just been through a horrible break-up with the love of his life Clementine(Kate Winslet). He is even more upset to find out that she had her memory erased of him. So out of anger he decides to do it too. Under the process, he finds out by the inventor, Dr. Howard Mierzwiak(Tom Wilkinson), that he will still be awake and active; just in his brain. Also under the procedure, he finds out that even though him and Clementine are no longer together, he still loves her. So he tries to hide her in memories she shouldn't be in.This movie centers on how strong love is no matter how many fights or break-ups we endure. It weird, but seems like something that'll really happen. Jim Carrey, my idol as a toddler, has an unique way of being funny and serious in a calm way; a way we are not use to seeing him in and is brilliant for showing us he's emotions to this role. Kate, on the other hand seems to have a role we would see Jim in, but makes it her on and totally steals the show on the comedy side. Elijah Wood is a perfect example of being a evil weasel, showing a great potential in being a great villain, cough...SIN CITY...cough. I always wanted to see Kirsten Dunst high now I do and loved her for it. Mark Ruffalo has fun with his part and dragged me along with him. Tom Wilkinson has showed me that being so serious can be so funny at times. All in all everybody did great, I mean everyone.

Can he escape with his memory intact and possibly save the relationship? Tom Wilkinson plays the doctor and Kirsten Dunst the secretary.""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" (2004) is a drama/sci-fi/romance hybrid that's so confusing during its first half that it fails to captivate (and is even annoying) but, if you persevere, everything starts making sense by the midpoint, ushering in an entertaining and insightful second half. The movie's depth naturally makes it improve on repeat viewings wherein it's more understandable as you put the pieces together.Viewers who complain that a certain person is too dramatic, selfish and high maintenance to put up with for more than a month didn't get the closing moral, which is both true and profound: Couples can (and should) realize the flaws of their mate, which they genuinely don't like, but it's ""Okay."" That's true love.There are also unexpected peripheral gems on unethical behavior in a supposedly professional environment, secret relationships, discarding unwanted skeletons, and more. Lastly, curvy, vivacious Winslet shines and it's nice to see Carrey in a serious role.The film runs 1 hour, 48 minutes, and was shot in the New York City area (Yonkers, Montauk, Mount Vernon, Manhattan and Brooklyn).GRADE: A-",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Brilliant film and Carrey's best work...,"It's not often a movie comes a long that is so good it makes you completely forget that the entire premise of the film is utterly impossible. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is one of those movies. Jim Carrey stars as Joel Barish, a fumbling, socially incompetent man who learns that his girlfriend Clementine (Kate Winslet) has had him erased from her memory.In an attempt to even the score and to settle his own demons, Joel undergoes the same procedure to erase memories of Clementine from his head. Director Michel Gondry takes us backward through Joel's mind as each individual memory is erased. What follows is an extraordinary lesson about love, loss and the value of our memories.In Eternal Sunshine, Carrey gives the most inspired performance of his career. While he has turned in standout performances in Man on the Moon and The Truman Show, Eternal Sunshine shows his full range as a dramatic actor. Kate Winslet sheds her familiar British accent and fully transforms herself in playing the complex role of Clementine, a needy alcoholic who always seems to get bored with her men.The movie's non-linear style is a clever way to tell the story. It's not always evident where the characters are in time. Subtle details, such as the color of Clementine's hair in a particular scene, are used to identify the point in time to the viewer.The casting in Eternal Sunshine served as one of its strongest suits. Carrey and Winslet are joined by youngsters Kirsten Dunst and Elijah Wood as assistants for Lacuna Incorporated, the company erasing Joel's memory. All four characters have their own sense of immaturity, but the balance between the subtle immaturity of Carrey and Winslet's characters and the blatant, expressive immaturity of Dunst and Wood's characters adds another layer of context to a very deep, emotional film.On February 27, Charlie Kaufman was honored with an Oscar for best original screenplay for Eternal Sunshine. After seeing him lose for several phenomenal films like Being John Malkovich and Adaptation, it was nice to see a brave and original writer finally get his due.

Cutting,"A lovely story which must of been a hard feat to get it on film. If we could open up more to these type of movies it would help us evolve and understand ourselves.Like trying a new infusion it tastes odd to our senses, to be bombarded with various dimensions at once.

Insanely original and intelligent movie,"Insanely original and intelligent movie.A man, Joel (played by Jim Carrey), discovers that his ex- girlfriend, Clementine (played by Kate Winslet), recently had all memories of him erased from her memory. He decides to do the same. However, halfway through the procedure, he has second thoughts. What follows is a cat-and-mouse game as he tries to hide memories of her within his brain, to prevent the erasers getting to them.Directed by Michel Gondry and co-written by Gondry and Charlie Kaufman (Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind), this movie has to be one of the most intelligent ever made. Not only clever, but the plot is watertight. Many writers and directors try to be too clever and simply end up with a hole-ridden script as a result. Not so in this case.There's also a great emotional aspect and profundity to this movie.

Good sci-fi romance but flawed,"It has been a few years since I've added a user comment, but after seeing this film and reading some of the reactions before mine, I can't keep quiet. As of now, the Db has 783 comments in all for ETOSM, and from the 30 or 40 I've read, it would seem this film is destined to be the next all time classic: think Godfather, Citizen Kane, Casablanca, whatever. There are a few commentators who lean otherwise, and generally they seem to simply hate the film. I can't agree with either side, though.On the one hand, I liked the film on several levels. Underneath everything, it was an above-average average-Joe sentimental romance that keeps one hooked to the end. Overlying everything, it had technical appeal that almost erases any flaws. And throughout, Jim Carrey's acting nudges the film up another level, not just because Carrey is intriguingly out of character but because he actually makes a stereotypically boring nerd character more believable.On the other hand, there are flaws. I'm not impressed with the newest science fiction premises, the loop around plot or the various altered realities of the script, not because they're confusing but because in the end they are not much more than an emperor's proverbial new clothes. Ultimately they do not hide the writing flaws of an overly contrived wrap-it up conclusion, they do not excuse the weak and shallowly scripted subplots and they do not make the film more than a sentimental sci-fi romance. To the extent that love is profound and prevailing, this film gives us something to chew on, but not much more than, say, An Affair to Remember.In between the good and the bad, there is nothing really ugly about this film, although Elijah Wood's character, part of one of those weak and shallows, comes close. Kate Winslet's performance is respectable, although beyond the blue hair her character is not developed as much as it might have been. And the direction, with all the technical coattails is good, even if I'm not ready to burn the director's name to memory.I'll watch this film again on a rented DVD but I don't want to run out and buy it.

The Jim Carrey character is a sweet guy; not an ounce of malice there-- but his fatal flaw lies in his fear of accepting all that Clementine is (he only wanted to be with one dimension of her being).

Elijah Wood's character was eerie...kinda stalkerish...I love the editing; the amazing cuts from scene to scene.

Did the filmmakers set out to induce headache and nausea? The story, the lighting, the camera-work, the editing--they really made me seasick. And it's hard to care about characters who don't like themselves enough to engage in basic grooming. What in the world was romantic about this story of abuse, alcoholism, relationship addiction, and depravity? There was no compassion for the obvious sickness of the characters. Uck, uck, uck.

Take a good look and check out the multiple meanings,"To be accurate I have seen this movie in entirety twice, but parts of it over and over.... many of these scenes have been noted as favorites etc...including the doll scene ""intimacy revealed""...the Meet me in Mantauk scene..""profound understanding"" (if you concede that Clementine must have experienced a similar 'calling' in her erasure experience...I found this sentence profoundly revealing.Also the Alexander Pope quotation stated by Mary, not realizing that she is what she is speaking the ""Vestle / Vessel"" untainted by the real world but living in ignorance. The vessel is revealed to be the self-judger.I watched this with a friend of mine who was experiencing post bad-break up trauma. It is shocking to realize that the person that you hate, can also be the person most responsible for a lasting change in perspective.The erasure for me was like experiencing a death. The doctor stated that once the original memory is erased the additional memories will fade after. Maybe this is the meaning of the final ride home with Joel's friends, when he says ""She was just some girl"". I cried because this is not merely an extermination of memories but an extermination of self. The ultimate cutting off your nose to spite your face.Of course I can understand why some found it difficult. It requires some revisiting but the effort is worthwhile if you are interested. I still found myself unclear in particular when J. appears to visit C. at work stocking shelves. He speaks as if they are real but they clearly are not since he talks of a second go at the relationship. I am assuming that the start of the scene is immediately after the initial meeting at the beach house (when Joel ran away).Sometimes, of course, to understand you must experience and if there are any of you who knew someone was bad for you but you still went back again because of some intangible attraction you will know what I mean.I more than loved this movie, I left this movie thinking differently about my life. I thought to myself if I had to guess where someone I loved was right at this moment would I be able to be correct with any certainty? Okay I am a romantic at heart so you will want to temper this endorsement with some reality. If you don't get it then you haven't been swept away by unknown forces.Cheers",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Amazing!,"I love this film! I'm not usually into romance films, but this film is so unique. It's quirky and by no means generic. The story is not put together in chronological order, so some people don't get its brilliance. I personally LOVE the way the film is done, and Kate Winslet's character and performance is great.(Clementine is so wonderfully eccentric!). Jim Carrey delivers an equally great performance(Joel is sensitive and introverted, not traits you often attribute to Jim Carrey, but he plays it SO well!). It deals with themes like the pain of love, consequences of actions and even the boundaries of science (in regards to memory erasure). This film is thought provoking but not soppy. Watch this film! it's amazing!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
As close to perfect as subjective art can come.,"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind is a beautifully complex and subtle film, insightful in its message and imaginative in its execution of that message. There is honestly nothing that I would bring against this movie to disparage it, and, thus, my review of it is not filled with sarcastic bits of wit or amusing, mocking exaggerations--no, truthfully, I can offer only my compliments to it, and the people who made it possible. An amazingly innovative director, Michel Gondry's creativity is the perfect guiding force behind the movement of the story. As for the casting, I think it was done practically without a single error. I have always been a huge fan of both Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet, and these are proved to be two of their most unique, well-acted roles. The supporting cast are equally matched to their characters, and, reiterating, I have no complaint whatsoever about the acting (even though I'm not usually much of a Kirsten Dunst fan). The cinematography was also notable due to the work of Ellen Kuras, who made each scene inside Joel's subconscious whimsical, bizarre, and even nostalgic. But, in the end, I think, as with most great movies, the credit goes first and foremost to screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, whose genius allowed him to create a story that was not only well-constructed, multifaceted, and enlightening, but also warm, touching, and true-to-life. Eternal Sunshine is a film suited for those who truly adore movies--not adolescent fans of explosions, graphics, and Hollywood romance--for it does not race along at light speed, but, instead, progresses slowly, taking the necessary time to create an incredible portrait of love, memories, and dreams.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"""Enjoy it...""","I had seen this movie before, at the age of 13, the year it was released. I was young, immature and hadn't experienced love besides family love. Never kissed a girl and had it mean something, never said those three words, and thus, my experience of this movie was not something memorable.It left me angry, confused, and feeling cheated of my time. Because I couldn't relate.Fast forward to now, 3 years later and I am an entirely different person. Recently coming off my first ever meaningful relationship, I rented this movie again, because I had been saying I wish I could forget it all. Let me just say this: this movie changed my life.An ingenious plot: a man attempts to have his memory erased of a bad break-up and all things associated with it, with heart, something most Charlie Kauffman movies lack. Teamed with Michel Gondry, it's result is brilliant, captivating, and a truly real representation of an honest relationship. This is, by no means, a fairy tale romantic comedy. This isn't Notebook style kisses in the rain. This isn't flowers and a box of chocolates, and most importantly, this isn't a Hollywood romance.Thinking back on my relationship, I remember all these things that this movie shows us. For me, it wasn't the over-the-top moments that were so special. It was crosswords on the couch, walking her dog in the snowy night scape and falling asleep while watching a movie that are the most special moments I could ever remember.This movie changed me, this movie made me feel more enlightened and grateful, and dispelled all my hate and anger. This movie, if you can relate, will be the greatest representation of the human sense of love that you will ever see. If you haven't loved yet, you will not understand.But if you have, this movie will leave you bewildered, transfixed, and enlightened. It's sheer normalness makes it that much more special.And in being special, this movie is made great. Enjoy it...",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Kaufman does it again,"When people think of a film, there is always an immediate assumption that the director is the key force that should be rewarded, or the actors. It is a shame that people forget about the script writers, because Charlie Kaufmans pedigree has resulted in some of the most original and satisfying films that have ever been made, and done so in less then a decade. This is one of them.Imaging a future were a person can have their memories of something they don't like erased, it follows the path of a man who hopes to forget his ex girlfriend. As he slowly goes through the process, he finds himself trying to hang on to them. This is an incredibly deep film which has many dark themes involved, but it is also incredibly moving.The visuals are certainly well used, and the acting is of the highest quality from all involved, though the leads are outstanding. If there anything to say to deter people, it is that is a very sad film for the most part, but it is hard to deny that it is still a work of art that represents Kaufman at the peak of his powers.

"A sparkling intellectual feast, embraced in a warm bear hug.","One of the best films of the 00's has a set-up story that might ring alarmingly non-original: Carrey agrees to have his mind and memory medically entered to forget the painful break-up from the love of his life Winslet... But the way scriptwriter Kaufman outlines it, is ingenious and nothing short of fantastic in this complete delight of a movie that just gets better and better as it goes along, wrapped in swirling, dazzling visuals by director Gondry! Carrey has thrown off his cute clown mask for good (I wasn't totally convinced after ""The Truman show"") and is fully matched by the rest of its spirited cast ('Frodo' in a crew-cut... right on!).A sparkling intellectual feast that races and challenges, keeps its audience guessing and puzzled, yet never outruns or outsmarts you, while embracing you in a warm bear hug. A unique, smart, funny yet deeply moving tribute to love and devotion and by now a genuine, modern classic.

"curious, perceptive, memorable","Charlie Kaufman has another hit on his hands here, with a sprawling and unusual screenplay about two characters who 'erase' each other from their minds, only to find what they were searching for in the first place.Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are not my favourite film actors by any means but they both turn in performances which fit within the weird fabric of this story.  Carrey plays Joel, a misfit who doesn't entirely fit with the world; Winslet plays Clementine, with unusual hair and ideas.  They fit clumsily together.The process of erasing any memory of someone completely from the brain raises a number of interest questions: would anyone want *any* memory to be completely wiped?  Can the technique be used for purposes of abuse?  What does the brain really retain as 'a memory'?  The nature and depth of relationships with others is also examined within the chaos of images which move backwards and forwards, into vague and defined memory, and between reality and fantasy.The film is cleverly put together, both funny and perceptive, and I'm glad to say, very good.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"Inventive story, good surrealism, realistic love, but the film itself is not touching, entertaining or fascinating as it was supposed to be","This film which has a beautiful name was adored by the youth and loved by the critics. People said how smart and brilliant the story was, how beautiful the romance was and how nice the couple were. I found the characters realistic, I liked the guy and liked that nice girl with colorful hair style like her philosophy about life and I like the whole idea behind them. However, I just didn't find their story touching, heartbreaking or miraculous, so I was not that impressed. Are the technical aspects of the film such as editing etc. fascinating? Well, I don't think it is, but the film is pretty inventive and good surrealism overall, however, the film itself is little cold and there is a barrier between the characters and the audience. I couldn't feel the film. I cannot say style over substance problem, but something else was missing in the film. The supporting characters were not interesting, rather tedious. I will be honest, I don't know why, but I enjoyed The Science of Sleep more and thought it was a better film than ""Spotless Mind"". It delivers for me, but for this film, I appreciate the film for its inventive story, cinematography and cool love story with realism and the chemistry between Carrey and Winslett were perfect indeed, but I don't think it is a great story or an unforgettable experience. I believe that the story was supposed to be touching, but it suffers from style over substance issue. On the contrary, I find the main theme of the film significant, but I couldn't feel the film as I was not impressed by the whole picture.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Excellent,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I don't know much about Kaufman or Gondry...but ever since I have watched this movie, I am a blind fan of them. Wow !What should I say to describe the story? Its not exactly romantic. There is an important sci-fi story in it, though that is only a backdrop. When you see the movie, you really do not bother about the technological explanations for the plot. The story is about love. Love, in the most practically illogical way it can be ! I did not know that Jim Carrey could perform such a serious and grave role with such brilliance. He changed my 8-years-old mindset for him. Kate Winslet is, as ever, beautiful and expressive.The story goes somewhat like this: Joel ( Carrey ) is in real sufferings when he comes to know that his lady love Clementine (Winslet) has erased him out of his memory to forget their sour and painful love life. Unable to bear the pain, that to the person, without whom he can not live, does not even recognize him, he goes for the same memory evaporation method. But is a decision made of impulsive agony would be right ? When he is operated by the technicians, his subconscious mind becomes the active one and tries to hide her memories . The eerie and imaginary desperation of a man trying to hold on to the last bits of memory is what makes the whole story. Some subplots do come in, which even works as spices to the original story. And, of course there is the conclusion. Can we really sacrifice the good parts of being in love to forget the pains and sufferings ?Guys, whoever has not seen it, please watch it. You will like it the way I did, maybe even more.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Absolutely worthless garbage!,"I finally watched 'Eternal Sunshine...' this weekend. What a piece of absolute, unadulterated CRAP!!! From beginning to end. I mean I have seen a lot of bad movies recently, but this has to rank as THE ABSOLUTE WORST!!! And this won the Oscar for best screenplay? God! The people in Hollyweed must all have their head up their collective rectums! Now, I hate Jim Carrey, but he was absolutely horrid in this, as was Kate Winslet. Did the director actually expect anyone to feel anything for these 2-dimensional stereotypes? And the director must have gone to 'hand-held' camera 101 to learn his craft. Talk about annoying! I want my 25 cents back!!! At least most of the other garbage I've watched recently was mildly entertaining, but this wasn't even that! Did anyone actually believe they were saying something significant about the human condition here?

"""By morning, you'll be gone...""","Charlie Kaufman has done two movies now that take personality bending to a new level. In Adaptation, he wrote himself and his imaginary twin brother into a story about white orchids, and here in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Kaufman plays ""what if"" with two people who are really in love but only remember the bad times and decide to have each other erased from their memories. This is a movie the viewer needs to see more than once, probably more than twice, to comfortably experience the film. Kaufman and director Michel Gondry plays with the time line of the film, and on first viewing, it's sometimes difficult to separate what is happening now and what has already happened. Seeing the film a second time will help the viewer understand the story, but the emotional feelings remain the same. The great revelation of film is that two people have a relationship for a reason, and unfortunately, we only remember the bad times, and forget the good times. For the characters in Eternal Sunshine, this revelation comes way too late for them, and there is a sense of desperation as they try to hang on to the memories they have. Jim Carrey plays Joel Barish who is a quiet, laid back guy who meets Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet), a wild child who's spontaneity scares, yet intrigues, Joel. Carrey once again shows that he's not just a comedic actor, but rather a serious all-around actor. He immerses himself into the character Joel, making us forget this is the same guy who was the Cable Guy. Winslet received an Oscar nomination for her job as Clematine, and it's deserved. She relays Joel's desperation in the last third of the movie, heightening the emotional roller coaster this movie takes us on. After one fight too many, each seeks out Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) who is able to remove the memories of anyone from a person's brain. Joel's procedure is lead by Stan (Mark Ruffalo) and Patrick (Elijah Wood), but turns out to be difficult case. This leads to a subplot involving Dr. Howard and his secretary Mary (Kirsten Dunst) that ultimately leads to a crushing final act to the film. It's a powerful and appropriate finale, where the characters understand where they stand, and their decision makes total sense. Kaufman and Gondry won an Oscar for this original screenplay, featuring a story that is science fiction, and like most great works of science fiction, is not really about the science, but rather the results of technology. Eternal Sunshine is a movie where there is much more than what appears on the screen; each viewer can put themselves into the film, identify with the situations they recall, and perhaps leading the viewer to remember those good times that we each take for granted.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Nothing short of perfect...,"Have you ever wondered what it feels like to forget everything? It seems like it would be weird, not remember what you know. Like a favorite movie that you bought and watched over and over again. What if all that was gone when you woke up? What if someone has you erased from their mind completely without you being aware? In Michel Gondry's Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Jim Carey plays Joel Barish, an average Joe trying to survive. When Joel finds out that his girlfriend Clementine (Kate Winslet) has had him and all the times they spent together erased completely from her mind by a doctor who specializes in the field, Joel gets very upset and has the exact same thing done to her. Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) and his three employees, Mary, Stan, and Patrick (Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, and Elijah Wood) go to work on Joel's memories. Howard is the man in charge, Mary is the secretary, Stan is Howard's assistant, and Patrick is sort of Stan's assistant and gets himself into quite the pickle when he decides to date Clementine using Joel's memories as a guide to her. Now the process of erasing Clementine begins.Once inside Joel's memories we discover how this whole mind erasing duel started. Joel went to see Clementine at work and she didn't recognize him whatsoever, but she certainly was familiar with the boy at the store, whom she kisses, and remains anonymous. The thing with memories is it is hard to see things from a different point of view. The mood is the same, the emotions are the same, and the situation is the same. When Joel realizes that he doesn't want to forget her, he tries to hide her in different memories. Anything from childhood to random embarrassing memories. Stan and Mary don't know what to do...except smoke pot and fool around in Joel's apartment. When they lose Joel in Joel's mind, meaning that Joel has hidden Clementine in a different memory and his subconscious is doing the hiding, they call Howard over to take a look. What follows is a cat and mouse game in Joel's head all the while realizes what a great person Clementine is and how he wishes he con't forget her.Michel Gondry's vision is one that boggles the mind. This is one of the most original ideas made into a film in a long, long time. Along with the help of writer Charlie Kaufman (Adaptation, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind), this story of how love can exist between two people on opposite ends of the spectrum harmoniously. Carey is great as the subtle yet obnoxious Joel and gives the character a great boost of comedy. Winslet received an Oscar-nomination for Best Actress for her portrayal of Clementine, the exuberant, spunky woman of Joel's dreams. She makes him feel excited and adventurous and just plain good. Her performance is stellar.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is an instant classic. It's a league all on it's own. It has comedy, drama, romance, and a science fiction background. Gondry delivers the goods with this movie and I anticipate his future releases. Eternal Sunshine is a must own movie that any collector would be sad to miss out on. You can watch it 30 times and still find something new to appreciate every time. It will blow your mind...",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
This movie should have been nominated for all Oscars!!!!!,"Forget about ""Collateral"" when you are talking about the best movie of 2004. Everybody who thinks ""Collateral"" should have won the Oscars for best movie and best performance, really doesn't know what he's saying... ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is by far the best movie I've seen that year. That doesn't mean that Collateral isn't a good movie, because it is and yes I liked it, but it never was as great as this one.It's some kind of love story, but it's completely refreshing and hasn't used any of the standard clichés you'll see so often in romantic Hollywood movies. It's sober, it's emotional, it's happy and sad together, it's captivating, ... , it's just indescribable! I liked ""Being John Malkovich"", but ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is even a lot better. There are some similarities between the two: both movies show us the thoughts of someone else, like if we are experiencing them ourselves. But ""Being John Malkovich"", is completely crazy, while ""ESOFSM"" offers a more realistic view on the subject.Jim Carrey's character is just an ordinary guy, so hurt by the one he loves that he tries whatever is possible to erase her from his mind. His girlfriend has already had her mind erased by a company and now doesn't know anything about him anymore. He decides to do the same, but as he goes on with the procedure he realizes that, even though his relationship with her wasn't always great, he just doesn't want to erase her from his mind. The fact that we all know the feelings he is going through is probably the main reason why we all like this movie so much. Also the message that when you erase your mind, history is likely to repeat itself, really ads an extra touch to the movie.If you ask me this movie should have won all Oscars, but I'm not a member of the jury of course. The acting was great, Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey were absolutely astonishing. The concept was refreshing and original. The movie had really everything to offer that I want: a laugh and a tear, a good message and a great feeling afterward, even though the ending was perhaps a little bit too slow. Too often I see bad movies, but once in a while you'll find a gem between all the ugly rocks. This is 2004's gem. I give it a 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

One of the best films ever made about love and relationships,"I won't give away any spoilers. All I will say is that I never got around to seeing this film in the theatres, and I wondered why this film was voted ""Best Film"" by IMDb users. Now I know. This film fully deserved to win Best Original Screenplay, and it's a crying shame it did not get more nominations, particularly for Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet (her best work since ""Titanic"") As much as I loved ""Titanic""---and I still believe that film deserved to win Best Picture---this film is grounded in a reality that cuts deeper to the bone. It's one thing to recreate the sinking of an ocean liner in exquisite detail, but it's another to recreate the joys, sorrows, and pain that love brings out.

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind by B.D.Kuchera,"I'm not a critic, I'm just a guy who loves great cinema.""Eternal Sunshine"" as I'll call it in order for you to actually remember the title, is somewhat of a mix of dream-state, and flat out getto-fantasy. It's a very dark film that has some beautiful truths in it about love, memories, and reality itself.Jim Carrey was of course the perfect choice for this film, and he's actually able to pull off a striking performance. I had only wished that he had been nominated for Best Actor, which he certainly deserved to be nominated for. It seems that the Academy can't seem to let Jim get beyond his Jerry Lewis phase into fine acting. Look at ""Man on the Moon"" sometime and see that both films left Jim excluded from his rightful place as a terrific actor.But ultimately, Jim is stretched by brilliant Michel Gondry directing, and a story that only Charlie Kaufman could have pulled off. This strange marriage between Carrey, Gondry, and Kaufman made for one of the most bizarre mixes since ""Brazil"". Across the board, this film is strange, but it makes complete sense as long as you stick with it. And although some of the sequences are downright scary, moody, and insane, the truth of a man searching for love and himself turns the film (for those who wait) into one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen.I don't know much about anyone that worked on this film, other than to say that I know Mr. Carrey's work, as well as Gondry having worked on music videos for Bjork. That said, I went into the film planning to see something with that Carry touch, and walked out seeing much more than I expected. It was clear to me that Gondry had his hands full with Carrey, but also that all of the people involved seemed to know that this was a film that would push the limits of what an audience could take. For myself however, I feel that I was designed to be pushed, and felt comport from a collection of artists that didn't seem to ""give a damn"". Way to go for all of them! In the end, it's clear that people went with their gut, and that Gondry's hand was so strong on this wild picture, that no one would ever have guessed it was even possible. This film is the one and only film I have seen to date where I literally sat in certain sequences and said to myself, ""How did they do that?"" That's saying a lot for someone that reads effects magazines and has made several films himself.I have to say that if you haven't seen the film, get it, sit back, don't see it when you're tired (for God's sake), and get ready for a mind-screw not unlike that of Chris Nolan's ""Memento"".

I think this will top my list.,"This was one of my most anticipated movies this year and before entering the screening, I was crossing both fingers for it to be really good. Well, to say the least, it was really, *really* good. From the direction, to the acting, to the script, there wasn't anything that I could find that I really didn't like. Gondry is quite the creative director. The film felt really trippy, which, I think, added to the surreal experience of what it's like to be in someone's minds and having their memories erased. There is a particular scene in a bookstore with Joel and Clementine which is just so heartbreaking and the effects work excellently there. Kaufman's script is stronger than his previous ones. Take the creativeness of Being John Malkovich and the gravitas of Adaptation and double it and you've got Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind.The performances are top-notch. Jim Carrey, who was alright in his dramatic roles before, truly shines her. I'm expecting an Academy nod for him. He brings a subtlety to the role that makes Joel sympathetic enough for the audience to realize the horror of what he is going through. Kate Winslet, who has always been one of the best actresses working today, blew me out of the water. Clementine comes off as a dislikable character at first but the way Kate plays her makes her very human and real and we don't doubt once as to exactly why Joel loves her the way he does. Out of the excellent supporting performances of Dunst, Wood, Wilkinson and Ruffalo, Elijah Wood stands out as the deceitful Patrick, played by Wood with an edge of remorse. I ended up sympathizing with this character even though I should really hate him. He really shows that he can play characters that are un-Frodo like and I was impressed with his range.All in all, I don't really know how this will be received commercially, but it deserves to dominate the box office. I don't know if I'll see a better film this year.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Can't believe I didn't watch this before...!!,"Highly recommended. The brilliance of the movie lies in the way the emotions of the two main protagonists are dealt with. Jim Carey as 'Joel' is his role of a lifetime and 'Clementine' played by Kate Winslet complements him perfectly. As the memories are being erased, the way 'Joel' realizes how much he loves 'Clem' is apparent with the fear of losing her that can be seen in his eyes and by his actions. 'Clem's' character has been played brilliantly by Kate Winslet whose acting skills have always been out of this world. How she pulls of those vivid hairstyles and tops are a mystery in itself. The locations have been selected with great care and go hand in hand with all the scenes that are being shot. This movie has all the flavors of emotions' present in it. Its a unique experience in itself. This movie is not only meant for the people who understand love or have been in love, its meant for anybody who loves 'good cinema'.

I really like the way this mind thinks!,"Michel Gondry is incredible with images, with special effects that look unreal but yet outstandingly well-fusion with the look of the film, this incredible journey through the mind of Joel Barish is really worth the price and the time spend.As it always, just when you think there is no new light in the horizon of movie storytelling here comes a new script by Charlie Kaufman, smart, inventive and completely crazy!There is so much to enjoy of this film, starting with the incredible idea of someone who is willing to erase some of his memories in a company call Lacuna Inc., then there is the love story (so new and fresh like no other since Punch Drunk Love)and finally the visual contest between the mind of Joel and the company guys that are trying to erase all his memories of Clementine.So sad and yet so lovable, this story has many awesome dialogue lines that theorize about the live in couple, the inner problems of individualism, the ethics of the man manipulating the nature and the minds in order to make it profitable and others that I can recall right now.I was so happy to go see this movie with all the hopes to be intelectually challenge and just get what I wanted, this is a work done by people with the creativity and the will to do some meaning, a product that gives a good earned credit to its audience from the begining, if you haven´t see it WHAT ARE YOU WAITING?

Incredible and quite intellectual.,"This movie without any doubt deserves to be on the top 250 list. Although I had to watch the movie about 4 times to fully understand it, I was surprised beyond all reason to discover that in fact this movie isn't random after all. Once you understand everything, you'll realize that EVERYTHING fits together like a puzzle. One piece can't stand alone without another. I especially loved the casting. This is an unusual but fitting part for Jim Carrey, since it is not a flat-out comedy like most of his other films.

Great Idea! Great Movie!,"This is by far my favorite movie. It may be a little confusing the first time you see it, but if you're able to see it again, you'll start to understand it's true value. It's not another dull romance film, and it definitely isn't a waste of time. It is about a man named Joel (carrey) who just broke up with his girlfriend, Clementine(Winston), and then tries to make it up to her, but realizes that she has erased him from her mind. This is where it gets a little confusing...So now Joel decides to get the operation done on him to erase Clementine. During the surgery he has passed out and in his subconscious he wants to end it. now Joel and his memories of Clementine are trying to run away from the mind-washers.

Good,"It's not a good idea to say that I'm not bored at times, but with the different theme and fiction, it's not right to say that I was a good movie. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet played well in the role of side characters,",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"Carrey and Winslet Make an Interesting, Enigmatic Duo","Charlie Kaufman co-wrote the screenplay for ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" with director Michel Gondry.  Probably Kaufman, continuing his recovery from the largely senseless ""Adaptation,"" was the prime writer. So a series of sometimes faintly explicable or borderline incoherent scenes somewhat camouflages an occasionally fascinating tale.  And that's what this film is.Joel (Jim Carrey) is a writer-illustrator with an unbroken record of failed relationships.  He's shy and lonely, open to falling in like if not in love with any attractive female who telegraphs an interest in him.Calling in sick on Valentine's Day, he goes out to Montauk Point (the easternmost part of New York's Long Island, a playground for the rich) and runs into Clementine (Kate Winslet), a bubbling, blithe spirit, a young woman who works in a Barnes & Noble bookstore and frequently changes her hair color from one attention grabbing shade to another (her idea of a perfect color name is ""Agent Orange"").A relationship starts and goes into high gear when, after almost a quarter of an hour, the opening credits roll.  That's a hint that an unconventional unfolding of plot is in store.Through scenes that too often confuse without enlightening, Clementine and Joel's relationship goes back and forth in time.  Mostly back as it's revealed that each separately engaged the services of Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (a laid back role well-played by Tom Wilkinson) to have their memories of past relationships erased through what must be a proprietary and non-insurance covered process.  Doc Howard's sci-fi practice enjoys the eager beaver services of receptionist Mary (Kirsten Dunst).What follows is contemplation of the role of memory and the opportunity for regeneration of relationships against psychical resistance (to say nothing of overcoming the effects of Mierzwiak's non-FDA approved therapy. ""Lacuna"" is the name of his enterprise.  Erasure leads to a missing part-but without any awareness of what has been deleted by computer machinations of a mapped brain there can be no sense of incompleteness.  There's a message here. Perhaps others can find and detail it.What fails is the too cute, confusing and slapdash alternation of time and place.  What succeeds is a surprisingly deep and laid back performance by Carrey, his second film in which his character's memory loss is central to the story.  Winslet, wacko hair colors and all, is engaging and warm, a woman who really wants the security and permanency of a close relationship but who has been hurt too often.Dunst displays a broad range of emotions from the freely and stoned sensual to the pained introspective.  A nice supporting role for this very talented actress.  Elijah Wood as Patrick, one of the doctor's nocturnal memory erasers, is flat-perhaps he hadn't decompressed sufficiently from his long foray into the wilds of New Zealand.The beach scenes at Montauk are nicely shot-the rolling Atlantic waves in the dead of winter are beautiful.  But there's a choppy quality to much of the cinematography that adds to the film's already scrambled elements.It's a mixed bag.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Why the movie doesn't work ...,"These comments are mainly directed to those who have seen the movie. If you haven't seen it, by all means do. My tag line is a little misleading, because in some ways the movie does work. By co-incidence I've recently viewed both this movie and ""The Matrix"" for the first time. Both movies use the technique of 'mediated reality', where the main characters lie prone for much of the movie while they are 'fed' a version of reality: a virtual reality in the case of The Matrix, or a dream sequence in the case of this movie. The problem with the use of this technique is that the reality space of the movie risks becoming non-contiguous with that of the viewer - viewers may not be able to relate to what they are seeing. The technique does allow the director a great deal of latitude in the turns the movie will take, and one tends to feel off-balance because everything is so unpredictable. In the case of The Matrix, I became annoyed with the way in which 'Neo's superpowers were simply escalated to get him out of any given situation. (Good eye-candy though). While 'Sunshine' is a much more intellectually interesting movie than The Matrix, I'm still left a little cold. Does this movie relate to anything in my life, or offer any relevant insight into our experience in general? Relevance to our experiecne is not precluded by the use of 'mediated reality' as a technique. The Truman Show, for example, is very relevant to our post-modern experience. But this movie doesn't say much to me, beyond trying to be very clever. Perhaps whatever message is there, needed to be made more explicit. (Or perhaps I'm too old or too thick, take your pick). The final section of the movie, where the leads resume their love affair, offered possibilities, but ended too soon.Finally, I found the characters themselves to be fairly tawdry and somewhat sleazy, which distanced the movie even further - in my view.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

"""I'm not an impulsive person...I just woke up in a funk this morning.""","Director Michel Gondry, whose specialty in music videos is a seamless visual blending of reality and surreality, was the perfect filmmaker for this thoughtful, provoking drama which juggles the past and present. Jim Carrey is excellent as a single man looking for love...and perhaps finding it with eccentric clerk Kate Winslet; unfortunately, a double-header secret from both their pasts may come back to haunt them. Gondry, who also worked on the original story with Pierre Bismuth and screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, is masterful with a flashy scenario (both figuratively and literally), and he works surprisingly well with his eclectic group of actors. However, the characters in Kaufman's script aren't especially likable (particularly Winslet's argumentative love-interest) and the film is acutely chilly, with everybody bundled up and shivering. As the plot thickens, it also becomes convoluted (and, purposely one assumes, splintered). Despite these missteps, Gondry steers viewers nimbly through the mechanisms of the narrative, and there several engaging and arresting sequences. Similar in tone and spirit to ""Being John Malkovich"", which Kaufman also wrote, and blazing with deft, daring originality. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

A truly inspiring movie,"This movie is wonderful in so many ways it cannot be explained. The acting, the story and the way it has been told are so original and refreshing that it makes you want to learn the entire movie by heart. The two main characters of the movie represent, for me, the excellent archetypes of the modern day man and women. A man that is cold and closed in his world, unable to communicate with other people and isolated in his gray life of getting to work, working and going back home and an impulsive and sensitive women that is always looking for ways to live her life to the fullest extend, fall in love to each other. The problems that happen later start happening simply because of this differences and the relationship suddenly ends when Clementine impulsively decides to erase Joel from her memory. What Joel then does is the begging of the movie. He is unable to cope with the fact that someone he loves has completely erased him from his life and decides to do the same. But during the procedure of erasing he suddenly realizes that those memories are to important to him, that he really wants to continue loving Clementine and that he needs to start fighting for the love he haves.

A beautiful awakening,"Translated to ""The Awakening Of The Mind"" in my country, Sunshine is an homage to the beauty of love, but also its ugly side. Combined with a scientific feel, the movie delivers a funny and witty love story that makes some rather important questions that are mainly associated with moral and ethical dilemmas. The plot revolves around a man that chooses to have his former partner erased from his mind, after finding out that she did the same procedure. The leads are played wonderfully by Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet, who show off their acting skill by playing characters not usually associated with their type of roles. The direction and co-screenplay by Michel Gondry is a visual and quirky feast for the eyes and will suck you in right from the start. The supporting performances are also very pleasant, as they deliver what we ask of them. A very beautiful film and a true awakening from the complications of life, Eternal Sunshine nails the mark.Rating 8/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
everybody's gotta learn sometime,"I first watched this movie in October 2004.

One of the first thoughts i had when my relationship ended, was wishing i could erase every memory of her from my mind to stop the pain. Few films today are successful at touching the viewer emotionally, and if anything, this one does TOO good of a job. So i commend the cast and crew of this film for their excellent work. Jim Carrey, Kate Winslet, Michel Gondry, Charlie Kaufman, Jon Brion, Ellen Kuras, and the amazing editing job by Valdis Oskarsdottir.I recently watched this along with Kaufmans's Being John Malkovich as a double header.

Be prepared to go blank sometimes. You may need to rewind some scenes because of self-criticism. Those who are prejudiced against Jim Carrey, will experience a great shock while watching this gifted gentleman. And Kate Winslet is mesmerizing with her performance.

Heartbreaks, disappointments, regrets, all gone over the course of a night?

After the relationship between Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet) comes to a messy end, she decides to have it all deleted from her mind at a clinic that specializes in that sort of thing. Upon finding out that he's essentially been erased, Joel opts to have the same procedure done. As he's lying comatose, trapped in his own disappearing memories of the woman that, for a time, he loved, he starts to wonder if he has made the right decision. Maybe some memories of Clementine are worth holding on to.I like this movie. It's smart, it's thoughtful, it's inventive, it's harsh, and it's touching. The cinematography is beautiful, and all the little transitions and visual flourishes that happen as Joel loses his memories are pretty cool. Winslet is as great as always, Carrey pulls off an excellent, understated (for him) performance, and a bevy of solid supporting actors are present in the side-stories that compliment the primary tale of Joel and Clementine.My personal favorite thing about the movie was seeing a relationship in reverse, from ending to beginning. You see the cracks shrink and smooth over, but the seeds were there from the very start. Is it worth it to try again, armed with the both the knowledge of what to avoid, and the knowledge that history may inevitably repeat itself? I don't know.

Maybe the best film of 2004: an original comedy that is also profound,"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, the latest from screen writing superstar Charlie Kaufman, may be one of the best films you'll see all year.Jim Carrey shrugs off his mannerisms to play Joel Barish, an introvert who falls in love with the flamboyant Clementine (a well-cast Kate Winslet). When the relationship ends a year later, and she has him erased from her memory at the Lacuna Clinic, he retaliates by undergoing the same procedure. While unconscious, Joel works backwards through key moments in their relationship  trying to change the past, and the future. Meanwhile, the Clinic's employees  perky receptionist Mary (Kirsten Dunst), technician Stan (Mark Ruffalo), the self-serving Patrick (Elijah Wood), and Dr Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson)  face the ethical challenges of the work they do.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind can be enjoyed on many levels. It's an engaging comedy drama romance with A List actors, capably directed by Michael Gondry (director of Kaufman's Adaptation). The cast work well in ensemble and the characters, even those bereft of memories, manage to mature. Like Kaufman's sublime Being John Malkovitch, the film successfully weaves fantastical elements into the commonplace. Yet it's structurally and philosophically that the film enthralls. Eternal Sunshine uses a non-linear narrative to simulate the complexity of someone's mind, and demonstrate how memory constructs identity. ****1/2/***** stars.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
But now I really do have spots in my mind,"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)I'm sure watching this a few times will have the effect of erasing any confusion you might have. I am sure. But...well, I can't recall if I ever saw this film. Yet, yet... There's Jim Carrey in my mind playing a straight role. Sorta straight. Actually Kate Winslet has most of the good comedic lines. I can't tell whether she was once a girl friend of mine or if I watched her in a movie. She says she's high maintenance and she has to have a different color for her hair every week. Yeah, I remember her. My god she was nice. Quirky, but nice.And then she erased all memory of me. I saw her in this book store and she pretended she didn't know me. Didn't know me! Wow, after all we had been through. I mean she's an emotional roller coaster. And that really dissed me off so I had my memory of her erased. And then we began to see each other in strange places, on the beach--but that was right. I met her on the beach. But then I was a child and she was there under the kitchen table, and my mom washed me in the sink and I felt so secure and Clementine oh my darling you are lost and gone forward, dreadful sorry Clementine was so, so sweet and so so pretty and just a nut case.And then there's Kirsten Dunst, she of the incredibly agreeable figure, dancing over my body as I lay electronically stoned. Mary, her name is. She and the doc had this fling. He would get her to somehow seduce him and then erase the memory and then get her to do it again. Really bummed his wife out.Oh, but Clem and I are here as on a darkling plain where ignorant armies clash by night and I think something's missing, the ground or the sky or some wall or maybe something is fused together that shouldn't be fused together, like this old house on the beach that Clem broke into, I mean she has balls, and I was just a fraidy cat, and wait, wait, I am gaining control. She and I together are chasing down the missing parts of our memories erased by the evil Lacuna Inc. people. All these memory movies going through my head--Memento (2000) especially, by Christopher Nolan. There's something going on here with these memory movies. I think Oliver Sacks has something to do with it. Are we just our memories, and who would we be without our memories? Would life be worth living? If we just lived in the here and the now would we be animals? Anyway, this is a love story, the love story of my life. But is it possible to selectively erase memories? I mean creating lacunar infarcts on purpose? Is that legal? It is safe? Lacunar infarcts come from strokes that leave little blank spaces in your brain so that you're missing something like the memory of your first kiss or the time you saw Wayne's World..Okay, this is science fiction like Vanilla Sky (2001) with Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz. The dialogue is really sharp with all sorts of witticism written mostly by screenwriter Charlie Kaufman who also wrote the script for Being John Malkovich (1999). Need I say more? I mean clever with a capital K. By the way, idle thought: Clementine's last name is Kruczynski. Isn't that the Unibomber's last name, good old Ted? No, that was Kaczynski. Okay, never mind. Anyway, here's a clever line: ""Are we like couples you see in restaurants? Are we the dining dead?"" I think I said that, or wish I had. Or, ""Drink up young man. It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant."" She said that, and I guess she oughta know, heaven help us, from first hand experience.Look, if I ever, but ever, get a chance to fall in love with Kate Winslet, please, please, do NOT erase the memory. Thank you.Bottom line: bizarro and entertaining, witty and cute, with a nice cast. And Jim Carrey as a straight up kinda guy is a terrific actor, and Kate, well I'll tell you a secret, gentlemen. You can see a full frontal sans clothes shot of her in the movie Jude (1996). Yes.

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind: 9/10,"Now this is truly amazing. Writer Charlie Kaufman wrote a comedy that I didn't find overrated. Although I really liked Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, his one straight drama, Being John Malkovich had no place to go and Adaptation. had something missing to it. But Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a genius creation. Not only is it his funniest movie, but it's also the most coherent and most enjoyable movie.Joel (Jim Carrey) is a rather milquetoast man who meets up with free spirit Clementine (Kate Winslet), and they become romantically involved. However, they endure a messy breakup and Clementine goes to a business called Lacuna, Inc., where she has all of her memories of Joel erased. Not wanting to be left out, Joel also goes to have his memory erased. However, soon after it begins, Joel realizes that he wants to keep the memory of Clementine, so he tries to reverse the process.Director Michel Gondry (who worked previously with Kaufman on Human Nature) found a way to not only have the movie make sense, but to have some striking visuals (barely any, if any, that were done by computer fx) thrown in, also. For the most part, we see what is going on in Joel's mind as Clementine is being erased, so it's always interesting to see what will happen. The story, although a certain subplot seemed unnecessary, flowed together nicely, and, although told out of sequence, made perfect sense. That made no sense, but you'll understand it if you see the movie.I wouldn't say Carrey put his most subtle work here (that honor goes to The Truman Show), but he did do a good job, and, as I have heard, is a VERY early Oscar contender for next year. That I doubt, but it will be interesting to watch. Winslet (who has faded from her Titanic stardom) is also quite good. However, the supporting cast, including Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst, and Tom Wilkinson, leave something to be desired. They don't seem to really want to be in this movie as much as the others do.Overall, Eternal Sunshine is a surprising film. It's surprisingly funny, surprisingly entertaining, surprisingly dramatic, and, most of all, surprisingly easy to follow.My rating: 9/10Rated R for language and some drug and sexual content.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
One piece of art,"Eternal Sunhine of the spotless mind is one of my favorite movies, It's some of the few movies were actually everything was excellent. One of the (If not THE) best direction work I've ever seen, a lot of symbolisms and well put scenes, the complexity of the work makes the movie a little bit bizarre but that just makes you appreciate more the quality of work we see. I was completely surprise by Jim Carey's acting, I actually didn't knew he can act, but this movie states he can not only act but excel in this field, maybe if he would have dedicated to this kind of movies he would be in the same place as Johnny Depp or even Eduard Norton. Kate Whinslet always great!! the secondary characters (Elijah Wood, Kristen Dunst...) were also very good. The photography is awesome. The Script was a really incredible piece of writing, if I was too say the 2 best things of these movie, the script and the direction will definitively be my decisions. this one is one of the few Incredibly good movies that we can see now, A TRULY PIECE OF ART. 10 out of 10!!!!!!!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"I first saw the movie about a month ago, and was not really that intrigued, until I was left alone at home on a glum Saturday. I remembered the movie, and thought I should have a go, as it seemed to get rave reviews from friends and family. I was not disappointed. I was transported into a world of such intense emotion and completely forgot about my surroundings and circumstances. I was really swept away by the superb performances by Jim Carrey and Kate Winslot. The story is so outrageous, yet in this movie, so believable! The supporting characters are fantastic, and the movie as a whole, from start to finish keeps you're mind enraptured, and transports you into Joel and Clementines world, and the beginning and ending, and yet another beginning of their love. The underlying message to the story, which could mean so many things to so many people is clearly shown in the plots and sub plots of the movie.

good stuff,"Charlie Kaufmann is a brilliant writer but I personally don't feel that either ""Adaptation"" or ""Being John Malkovich"" has anything like the heart of ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"". I think the reason is both Goudy's innovative visual direction, the script, and most importantly, Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet, who are both brilliant, Winslet in particular, who I feel ought to earn an Oscar nomination for this film. It's too bad no one went to see it. It may not in fact be entirely possible to watch this film and not fall in love with Winslet's impulsive and passionate Clemetine. Like all of Kaufmann's stuff, there are moments of high school English class-ishness in some of his dialogue and plot, particularly as Carrey and Winslet are running away from the ""erasers"" in the mid point of this film, which I found to be the dragging point. But Carrey and Winslet carry the film so beautifully it's easy to forgive any shortcomings.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

Jim Carrey was robbed of Oscar Nod! Fabulous Movie!,"This movie was simply fabulous. There's no other word for it. I loved Jim Carrey in the Truman Show, thought he was robbed in that case as well. But this movie was just so beautiful, and moving, and thought-provoking. What would you do if you could erase someone from your memory? From all aspects of your life? Would you do it? Should you do it? Jim Carrey played the seemingly straight man to Kate Winslet's zaney Clementine. And yet, they were such a great compliment to each other. In a way, you begin to see that perhaps she dyes her hair such wild colors to cover up her insecurities. And Jim Carrey is a quiet soul, with a lot of energy behind it that Clementine brings out.I don't want to spoil anything, but the ending is rather a surprise, and you don't end up where you thought you would. The entire movie is shot beautifully, and just thinking about the creativity behind it, gives me chills. It's such an awesome concept, and if you loved this, you'll really love Adaptation, by the same makers.The supporting cast is great as well, with the exception of Elijah Wood who seemed very misplaced and lost in the film. But watch this, and see what a great actor Jim Carrey can be when he's not in knee-slapper comedies. I love him in those as well, but it's a sham that the critical acclaim seems to always pass him by.One of my favorites!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
One of the most inventive movies I've seen,"For three quarters of this movie, I kept asking myself ""How can the director sustain (and even build upon) this level of intensity and inventiveness?"" The relationship intrigue unfolds like Ten Little Indians, except with what you think are just two characters. This movie will win the best original screenplay Oscar or we should never watch the Academy Awards ever again. I should add that Jim Carrey gives us another Truman Show performance, showing again that his real talent lies in more serious acting. Kate Winslet also makes a believable, nuanced foil in this twisted tete-a-tete. So, what happens in the last 1/4 of the movie? Well, there's a rather silly subplot that makes fun of the state of American workers (and of relationships in general) that takes away from the emotional momentum. The ending isn't entirely satisfying either...perhaps others who have watched have a better ending suggestion. Nevertheless, this movie's superb acting, dialog, and directing deserve special mention -- for 3/4 of its length, it is pure, unadulterated genius; and for the last 1/4, merely very fine.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
The Greatest Romantic Movie Ever...,"I, personally, hate romantic comedies because I find that most of them are so frivolous that they don't warrant my attention.

Complete with memorable performances from Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet, and an incredible supporting cast, this movie is one of the greatest I have ever seen.I can see how some people think it's stupid however. The movie did not follow a normal linear time progression (it essentially starts and the end and goes backwards) and I could see how some people would find that confusing. I will admit, the first time I watched this movie I had no idea what was going on until the end. Then, with a full understanding of what was going on, I watched the movie a second time.

Great Idea for a Much Shorter Film,"Having been written by Charlie Kaufman, ""Eternal Sunshine"" has a fascinating premise and unravels in a way that plays with the flow of time. Jim Carey shows that his excellent work in ""The Truman Show"" was no fluke; he is completely believable as a shy introvert (!). Kate Winslet, as usual, is also very good.As the first part of the movie unfolded, I was completely drawn in and fascinated with the story and characters. However, the middle just seemed to go on and on, adding little to the plot nor my understanding of the characters' relationship. Thankfully, the last 15 minutes moved the plot in new and interesting ways.Compared with Kaufman's ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Adaptation"" (both of which I'd rate with 10s), ""Eternal Sunshine"" lacked the skillful story-telling to keep me involved throughout. However, its inventive plot and skillful performances saves it from being a disappointment. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

"A clever, touching look at ending relationships. It's just not funny.","Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind looks not only at relationships themselves but at how important people in our lives affect everything that revolves around us.Jim Carrey plays a man who's girlfriend (Kate Winslett) has had him erased from her memory by Lacuna, Inc. (headed by Tom Wilikinson). In retribution, Carrey's character pays to have his memory erased of all knowledge of her.The film is played out through out-of-sequence scenes and bizarre imagery. This is a trend of many independent films (the recent 21 Grams is an example). I am not a large fan of bizarre filmmaking (I usually find it too pretentious), but here it is used pretty effectively to show the erasure of the lead character's memories of the ex-girlfriend.The big problem in this Jim Carrey movie: it's really not very funny, and his character isn't incredibly likeable. The journey the character goes through is indeed fascinating, but the character himself is humorless and bland. They should have injected him with a soul, then we could have cared more.There are some great moments with the Lacuna staff (the highly unethical trio of Mark Ruffalo [outstanding in this film], Kirsten Dunst and Elijah Wood). There are some quirky moments with the free-spirit only adequately played by Kate Winslett. And I do like the ending, both the poetic justice of the plot summation, and the question ""how do you recover a relationship when both parties know what you really think about each other.""

I found it rather difficult to believe that this team of so called Brain technicians, were operating out of some filthy sloppy apartment, wherein Jim Carrey is laid out on a bed, where people are jumping all over, and running about the room.The story became so involved, with crazy sub plots, it became so convoluted, neither my husband or I knew ,what the heck was going on.Unless you are a die hard Jim Carrey fan, I wouldn't recommend this movie.

A great movie,"I didn't see this movie for years because I thought it would be something like 50 First Dates (which I found dull). Far from it. Like Being John Malkovich - I think - Eternal Sunshine... revolves around the existential notion of the self-creating individual. What comes to mind is the story ""Metamorphosis"" by Kafka, where a man finds himself transformed into a cockroach one day and finds how his life or he himself turns out to be totally inadequate. The story plays upon the ""what if.."" - things would be so great if I were somebody else, what if I were John Malkovich, or if a part of me I don't like could be erased, like in Eternal Sunshine... Existentialism holds that it's ridiculous to think you could be somebody else, as there would be no you anymore. The self-responsible, self-creating individual cannot take shortcuts without failure, as we can see in the case of Joel, who chooses to delete all of his memories of a past girlfriend, only to find that he really needs them. Most of this movie takes place in his mind. Like ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Adaptation,"" ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" feels like a European movie shot in Hollywood. It's just a great movie, with extremely good, natural performances (Kate Winslet rightfully received her Oscar nomination for this role). Just go and check the Awards and Nominations list. This is romantic, and a comedy, and food for thought at the same time. You'll find yourself coming back.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
An experience for the spirit and the soul,"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind's mystifying and sometimes downright confusing premise, due to the fact that it transcends reality and largely exists in the mind of a man, who is actively pursuing his unconscious to preserve dreams and memories, is levied by how incredibly honest its emotions and romantic notions can get at times. Even in its darkest, saddest moments, this is a thoroughly beautiful film, emotionally potent all around, exacting every emotion your system can handle almost with complete impunity to your senses. It's an uncommon film that, even when it's perplexing, still makes you grateful you're not watching a basic, linear romance drama.The film opens with Joel Barrish (Jim Carrey), a disconnected and unhappy soul, who impulsively ditches work one day and meets Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet) on a train. Clementine is the exact opposite of Joel, free-spirited and frequently spacey, unfazed by a great deal of contrivances many get hung up on in their lives. We see their relationship span the course of two years before it ends in a fairly ugly fight, with Joel utterly baffled that one day, when he goes to meet and make up with Clementine, she has no recollection of who he is. Clementine had hired the services employed by a company called Lacuna, Inc., a corporation that specialized in erasing the memories of someone or something by completely white-washing the brain and making the subject forget any and everything related to said person or event.When Joel discovers this, he is loaded with questions that bear confidential answers; Clementine doesn't remember him and that's killing him, for he has no idea as to what her motivations or present feelings were. He has no other ideas besides to effectively wipe his own memory, reaching out to neurologist Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) to take advantage of his services. The memory-erasing crew consists of Stan (Mark Ruffalo), Patrick (Elijah Wood), and Mary (Kirsten Dunst), all of whom are taking care of Joel during his operation and bearing their own individual secrets attached to the project that come to light during the operation. It isn't until halfway through the operation, as Joel is having more-or-less an out of body experience, seeing Clementine disappear from his memories as he relives every moment he ever spent with her, that he realizes he doesn't want to go through with the operation. Within every memory, Joel tries as hard as he can to preserve Clementine's presence, even if that means taking him to some unknown part of his unconscious or into a memory where she was never personally present.Writer Charlie Kaufman creates a story so grounded in fantasy, yet simultaneously so devoted to showing it in a realistic manner, that the balancing act the film manages to pull off is quite remarkable to say the least. If minds could be erased and people, events, or traumatic experiences could be wiped away from our collective conscious and unconscious, then the methods would likely look a lot like how they're portrayed in Eternal Sunshine. Consider the visual scheme employed by cinematographer Ellen Kuras, a frequent collaborator of not only director Michael Gondry but Spike Lee, which emphasizes dreamlike beauty and subtle color schemes. Look at the way Clementine's hair changes color with her mood; when she's frightened and vulnerable, her hair is blue, and when she is content and so happy she could die, her hair is a light, relaxing shade of lime green. On top of that, the visual scheme employed in the sequences involving the past memories both Joel and Clementine experienced are almost soothing in the way they are captured and lit, evoking a rare sense of romanticized innocence.Eternal Sunshine's biggest issue, however, is its organization, which never allows us to get too comfortable or too immersed into any particular situation. I would've loved an entire film set inside the mind of Joel as it's being wiped free of anything related to Clementine, but Kaufman's distractions, in the form of the memory-erasers and their stories, provide for an annoying disruption to the intimacy and emotional resonance that takes so long to build from Joel and Clementine. By the time the film has that and has us totally wrapped up in these characters, it jumps back and forth between those actively erasing Joel's memory and the mind being erased, burdening an already difficult film to follow with more excess.Nonetheless, there's a beauty in the natural flow of emotions, and the simultaneous romance and sadness elements Kaufman employs here. It's difficult to make one feel touched and consumed by the love of a film's characters, yet sad and glum about the inevitable results of their actions and the happenings on screen, but Kaufman remarkably does it. The emotional roller-coaster Eternal Sunshine takes you on, never allowing you to cling to one emotion for too long, is remarkable from a screen writing standpoint, and a true work of beauty that needs to be cherished. Throw in strong central performances, particularly from Carrey, who handles the role of melancholy and lovestruck well, intertwining them with a sense of rare symmetry, and you have a pleasantly complex film that caters to the spirit and the soul.Starring: Jim Carrey, Kate Winslet, Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood, Tom Wilkinson, and David Cross.

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"When the shy ""Joel"" (Jim Carrey) encounters the blue-haired ""Clementine"" (Kate Winslet) he immediately falls for her and embarks on a life-changing romance. Thing is, I think she finds him just a bit too dull and so makes arrangements to have him erased from her memory! Whilst he is going through her stuff he discovers a card that declares she's had him wiped. Despondent, he goes to see the same doctor (Tom Wilkinson) and opts for the same procedure. He has to garner together all their memorabilia so they can map his brain then ""Stan"" (Mark Ruffalo) and his sidekick ""Patrick"" (Elijah Wood) can come in while he's asleep and do some cerebral zapping. Thing is, though, it seems that this couple have put in a few safeguards in the form of hidden memories and that leads to both of them having a series of entertaining escapades as they try to stay one step ahead of the eradication process whilst also trying to remember or decide whether they like each other or want to be together at all! It's this cat and mouse process that makes both realise what life might be like without the other! There's a twist, too, though. The drippy ""Patrick"" has also taken a bit of a shine to her and so has been using the memories of 'Joel"" to muddy the waters of her affections. Meantime, there is the doctor's secretary ""Mary"" (Kirsten Dunst) whom we also realise has skin in this rather complex game of truth or dare (to tell the truth)... I was never really a fan of Carrey but he's on good form here, gelling well with Winslet in this quirky story of loneliness and reticence that allows each of the characters to have their moment in the sun. This is a creatively constructed drama that mixes chronologies and timelines to keep us guessing as to what's real, what's imaginary and what's just wishful thinking as we see their relationship play out through multiple, rapidly evaporating, scenarios. Carrey's portrayal juggles well the frustrated with the entangled and it does all make you wonder if it might ever be better to be able to compartmentalise our thoughts and reminiscences and then conveniently hit delete - either arbitrarily or together.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
A Great Waste of My Time,"Don't you all get angry at me but I have to admit that this movie was an absolute failure.

better to have loved and lost...,"Too often relationships end poorly, and all the good times are forever tainted by the feelings of bitterness that come with a break up. As time goes by, people commonly become less forgiving of another's flaws, less charmed by their quirks, and less attracted to them physically. But even if something is dragged out until not a single spark flies, most of the time, it's all worth it. This movie is about remembering what is so wonderful about being in love, sometimes against all logic, sometimes against better judgment.. and that despite all the pain that comes with losing someone you care deeply for, in the end whatever time you did have together was better than never having experienced those feelings in the first place. Anyone suffering a great loss can feel tempted by the idea of removing all thoughts of the person from their memory, as a way to move on and get a fresh start.

Eternal Sunshine Superb Love Story,"This is such a brilliant and beautiful film. Michel Gondry takes Charlie Kaufman's excellent script (I've read it) to the next level  using a unique visual and stylistic approach to carry out the story. The performances are spot-on, and the chemistry between Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey (who plays a very different role than he usually does) crackles. At its heart, Eternal Sunshine is a very insightful love story that pulls at the heartstrings; there is a certain lyricism and sensitivity to the story that is hard to find in movies these days  and it is that sensitivity that makes the film so alluring. When most other love stories are a matter of life and death, this one is a matter of memory, which relates to the question the film asks: how far will we go to forget the relationships that, upon coming to an end, have hurt us the most? It also happens to be very funny.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
If you consider yourself a dater this film will blow your mind,"I'm not going to get too in depth into this.. probably the best break up or Couples film to watch. Even if you're single and never dated you can learn almost all about the relationships between a man and a woman the good, the bad, and the ugly in this film.. Watch it now before you watch King Kong even. Ace Ventura ( Jim Carey) Rocks and so does Mary Jane (kristen Dunst?) from spider man. The names aren't important what is important is that the show is decent budget, but down to earth, gritty yet abstract and all the time exceptionally real. It is in my top ten movies of all time and also is a safe film for the children although they will probably not grasp the theme, therefore not get the movie and just be oblivious, I recommend this film for everyone, however if I had to force an age group I'd say 15-30 years of age.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

A brilliant movie...,"I have to say that this movie is probably the best in this century. It just keeps twisting your mind all through the 108 minutes. I can't even find words that can do justice to the movie. Michel Gondry knows exactly where he is going, he makes no mistakes, it just keeps getting better and better, the longer you get into the movie. To sum it up to those who haven't yet watched it, see it as soon as possible, and let your mind get blown away. If Jim Carrey doesn't receives any awards for his performance, is the world even more twisted then the movie.I will end by quoting Jim Carrey,: ""Why do i always falls in love with others, when they show me the least of attention.""

Wake up!!,"It truly is a shame that moviegoers these days are ignorant, misinformed, and searching for something that isn't there. Charlie Kaufman is no genius. He is a mainstream, large-budget writer/director who creates films that appear independent and artsy and original... but by nature, they are just the opposite, and he makes a lot of money. His movies, and I'm not sure if Adaptation or ESOTSM is worse, are disjointed and pretentious. His dialogue begs for reality, and he creates movies with the hopes of forcing the viewer to feel something. News flash Kaufman, you can't force people to feel something. And the people you do force, they don't have minds or opinions or the experience to know different. It makes me sick that those who see this film will believe they now understand the art and culture of the indie film... THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM. Please, can we inform and educate our public of true movies, movies that don't have huge budgets, star A-list actors who are dying for a mainstream film disguised as a indie phenomenon, and pretend to be something they are not. It is insulting and embarassing, and those who enjoyed this film because it was ""beautiful"" and ""meaningful"" and ""unlike anything else"" and ""artsy"" should dig a hole and bury themselves in it.

Weird but OK,"I thought this movie was the story of a man trying to make a woman who lost her memory fall in love with him again, but it was much different. I don't even remember why I downloaded it. We watched it last night with my girlfriend. Well, now that I watched it with my girlfriend, it is the best movie in the world. Frankly, I don't know how to look at it objectively, but I will do my best. Everything is different with him. I couldn't understand the movie, so I kept stopping it and asking him, and he explained everything to me.This is not a story of forgetting. Memory erasure story. I don't want to talk too much about it because the whole point of the movie is this memory erasing part and I think they thought very well. Moreover, the scientific explanation did not seem that illogical to me. Brother, no matter what they do in a media, if they claim to be realistic, they must link it to something close to reality and it will be appreciated. That's why I appreciate this movie. Apart from that, we watch the love of two young people again and again. I just realized I don't even remember the ending. I feel very leila. Leyla is used in Turkish for a person who is confused by their love. I mean, I didn't understand much, but it was a good story. I don't remember the ending, but I hope they didn't end up together again. If so, I'll be sad. No matter where the issue comes from, I think people should not say such things to the person they love. This memory erasing story is a bit confusing, and the movie was written a little strangely in terms of script, overall it was a bit interesting, I don't know if I liked it or not, but I know it was very good.Congratulations to the actors, they fit their characters perfectly. I also like to play the character exaggeratedly in the cinema because it increases the reality. I think this couple fits perfectly. Other than that, I can't say much more about the acting.I remember that the overall visual theme of the movie was good. The music is generally good, the songs used were definitely chosen more successfully than the music. Does it film people or not me?It's probably the most unbalanced and short review I've written on the site so far, but I couldn't really focus on the movie. Also, I couldn't write my full opinions because I might have written about them in a previous love movie. I have a very happy relationship. I love my girlfriend very much. I have committed my life to it, and I will not give it up easily, succumbing to American individualism. I don't believe in fate, but it is my destiny and I will do anything for it no matter what. This new model of love seems ridiculous to me, I need full commitment. It was also in the book called The Name of the Wind, I seem to remember it, but I don't think a person should be able to call the person he loves something like a whore, and even if he did, he shouldn't be able to call the person he loves anymore. When you do such ridiculous and simple things, a person's selfishness comes out and naturally, I don't even feel like commenting on the love flow. If they live so wrongly, no one can save them anyway. For example, there are such relationships in the Fleabag series, but the way those characters experience them and the way they are presented on the screen are different. They put it on the screen as more wrong examples. For that reason, I don't want to write a long love story here because I haven't seen any content worth it. Maybe one day I'll talk about it at length in another love movie. Wall - E, for example, was much better, go watch it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

What a performance from both great actors! The hidden visuals effects are a special treat for the audience. Some scene will move you to tears. I believe this movie has a message that everybody (will) understand. In a technical view of this movie, the lighting is unbelievable. The street lamps and car meter lights work to add a realistic feel to the film. The soundtrack to the movie is equally stunning.

groundhog day deja vu?,"My wife asked this early in the movie. She's not a Jim Carrey fan, or a fan of nonlinear movies, so she left early on to do something else. At the beginning of the film, there were four of us watching it: My son and his wife, my wife and I. By the end of the movie, it was just my son and me.I was trained initially as a biopsychologist, so the basic premise of this movie really appealed to me. Is it possible to erase a person's memories of some person or events? If so, how would it be done? By the way, the name of the memory-erasing outfit in the movie is Lacuna, Inc., or something of the sort. Lacuna is a hole, like a hole in your hearing, or a hole in your memory.I thought the acting was great in the movie, particularly Carrey and Winslett, both actors I like to watch.All in all, I found the movie haunting and wouldn't mind watching it again, something I rarely do with movies.

"A movie with a wonderful screenplay, great direction, and terrific acting","This is probably one of the best films that I have seen this year.I must first congratulate Charlie Kaufman for his wonderful screenplay. Much like his previous work, Kaufman's screenplay is both original and thought-provoking. Although the story is generally not as complex as Adaptation, it does convey a more emotional message to its audience. The movie depicts the true nature of love and relationships in the reality. It does a tremendously better job than many romantic comedies and dramas in conveying this material, which is rather funny since the movie is more of a science fiction movie.Michael Gondry's direction is great in conveying the insanity portrayed in Kaufman's screenplay. Every shot is wonderful.The acting is spectacular. Jim Carrey's talent shines in this movie. Although he displays some of his trademark comedic personality in the film, he also does a fantastic job in conveying the serious and self-loathing personality of his character. A good example of this is when the beginning credits roll and his character, Joel, is crying in his car. The pain in his character is very evident. Kate Winslet also does a great job in playing the impulsive and emotionally unbalanced Clementine. She does a wonderful job at portraying the negative aspects of her character in Joel's bad memories, as well as the positive aspects of her character in Joel's good memories. The supporting cast is also great.The soundtrack is amazing. The song that first plays in the beginning credits invokes a very powerful feeling of despair. And yet, as the same song plays again in the end credits, it produces a feeling that somehow opposes the feeling of despair. Throughout the movie, the musics helps to instill both laughter and insanity in the audience.All in all, I gave this movie a nine. The movie affected me rather deeply. I watched the movie about six times when it playing in the theaters, and I will definitely buy the DVD.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Disappointing hollowness,"I had high expectations as I prepared to see this film, driven by two factors.  First, I was very impressed with the originality of Kaufman's Being John Malkovich.  Second, I have thoroughly enjoyed Kate Winslet's excellent performances in several previous films, most notably Heavenly Creatures.  Perhaps it was the shattering of these high, but realistic, expectations that made watching this film so disappointing.This was the first time in a couple of years that I considered walking out of the theatre (twice).  After an hour, enough of a plot framework had developed that it was no longer necessary to invest significant effort in following the story.  Furthermore, a couple of comparatively interesting subplots developed: although they are variations on the main plot, they involve more appealing characters.The acting was acceptable but unremarkable; Winslet and Carrey are both capable of better.  The cinematography and editing were garish, and seemed to be designed to distract the audience from the hollow characters.There are a few funny and emotive scenes towards the end.  However, their impact quickly faded, and I was left with nothing to think about as I left (except, where did my 13 bucks just go?).  If you like original, artistic, and intelligent films, it is possible that this will appeal to you, but be warned: it is not BJM.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"Love, Memory, and Meaning: The Enchantment of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind","Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a deeply original and profoundly moving exploration of love, loss, and the intricate tapestry of memory. Directed with breathtaking creativity by Michel Gondry, the film blends whimsical visuals with raw emotional depth, crafting an experience that feels both intimate and universal.Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet deliver career-defining performances, portraying two deeply flawed yet profoundly relatable characters. Their chemistry brings authenticity to a narrative that dances between the surreal and the heartbreakingly real. Charlie Kaufman's screenplay is a masterwork, weaving complex themes into a story that is as thought-provoking as it is emotionally resonant.The film's magic lies in its ability to remind us that our memories, even the painful ones, shape who we are.

The supporting actors all do very well, even when they're given little to do. The script by Kaufman is second to none. He pens a classic and beautiful love story in the most original and interesting way. No wonder he got the Oscar. Michel Gondry's direction is weird, to say the least, but it is imaginative and inventive.I think the message of this film is that no matter how many faults your partner may have, you can't help but love them for who they are.

A Most Disappointing and Shallow Screenplay!,"""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is one of the more overrated films of the past year. At best, one may say that the concept and screenplay are ""clever."" But the idea of remapping memory and the unethical human erasers removing the painful experiences was a shallow one. It is unfortunate that two fine performances by Jim Carrey and Kate Wislet were wasted in this film. The best scene was their initial meeting where we actually saw a believable and interesting relationship unfold. In the combination of Winslet's quirky character and the mild-mannered Carrey, I was reminded of a much superior film and screenplay in ""The Sterile Cuckoo."" With the outstanding dialogue and unforgettable performance of Liza Minnelli, the film actually shed light on human relationships and the emotional pain of breakups. By contrast, ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" was no more than a glorified gimmick. The film's title comes from the English poet Alexander Pope. But a better tagline for this film would be Shakespeare's image of ""weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable.""",4.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Spotless.,"The premise of ""Eternal Sunshine"" is simple enough, if strange: a relationship has gone sour, and there is a procedure available that each person can use to erase all their memories of the other.I was fortunate enough to attend a screening last night at which both director Michel Gondry and writer Charlie Kaufman were present. Everything the marketing for ""Eternal Sunshine..."" led me to believe was absolutely wrong, but the reality was a thousand times better.Anyone who has followed Kaufman's work (notably ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Adaptation"") will recognize his touch at once.  ""Eternal Sunshine,"" however, has a striking difference from the other films.  Though often dark, it is, at heart, optimistic and foremost: it is a love story.There are many things this movie isn't.  It is not a ""gimmick film.""  It is not a ""Jim Carrey movie.""  (In fact, this has to be the best Carrey performance I've ever seen, and probably the best he's done.)  It is not really a drama, neither is it really a comedy.

All great Art comes from the Human Quest for Love. Who doesn't find love difficult? Faith, trust, hope intertwined... all elemental concerns of the Heart... There are many ways to fail and succeed in the quest for these eternal verities, but modernity provides us new ways to frustrate ourselves in pursuit of them... and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind shows us that despite the overwhelming power of our culture that can both save and harm us, connect and separate us...Humanity can, with a leap of faith, maybe, save themselves...",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
one more of a genre that i don't enjoy,"The technical process (erasing all or parts of human memory) does not appeal to me. Trying to create a plot, drama, conflict using this is quite risky. Most of human situations happens in a linear time line. Any warps (back & forth, erasure movements in the story) will risk enjoyment and appreciation of this natural and standard processing of reflection. Frankly, achieving artistry on a technical platform has always been unattractive to me, let alone a memory one. A deus ex machina will be the maximum technique I can tolerate.The portrayal of romance by Jim Carrey and Kate Winslett are very good. By the time viewers like me 'catch on,' there is only so little time left for the 'emotional gravity' that has been sorted to take effect.

Unlikely romance and dull sub plots meet beautiful visual design,"Eternal Sunshine is an example of a brilliant idea for a short film drawn out into a full length feature it cannot handle. The premise of a man erasing his memories of a failed romance only to realise within his memory the love he still feels is certainly an original and inspired one, but it deserved better treatment.Fantastically conceived visually, with characters' faces disappearing and objects simply erasing themselves, the film suffers from Carrey being simply too whiny and unlikable a lead in this (compared to his considerably more lovable and justifiably upset Truman in the Truman Show). His relationship with Winslet's Clementine is simply unbelievable. I has been said that opposites attract but these two are simply too opposite. There romance seems to boil down to little more than an intense sexual attraction, and little more, although Carrey gets across in his voice that he is in love, the script seems to argue otherwise.The film is dragged about by some excruciatingly dull subplots starring talented but misused actors (Wood, Dunst), which seem only in place to make the ending come about as it does (Wood's role for example is extremely unsettling and manipulative, but neither he nor the script pull it off).The music is as times terrific and at others dull and confusing in its use.But Carrey and the fantastic art direction manage to make this a very entertaining film, that alas wears thin with repeated viewing.Certainly worth a peek for those interested in modern pseudo-philosophical cinema.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"

One of my favorite movies!,"Originally when viewing the trailer for Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind, I thought it looked like an okay movie. It looked like something I wouldn't enjoy, and to be completely honest, I thought a little less of it knowing that Jim Carrey was to be playing such a serious role. Now, almost a year later, I sat down in front of my television and nearly hit myself for not watching it sooner.ESOTSM was one of the most amazing movies I have seen in awhile. It had an original story line, unlike most of the movies you see these days. From the moment it started, I couldn't take my eyes off of the screen. Every single part of this movie, including the parts that made me want to cry, were done beautifully. There are memorable moments where the words just stick with you long after the movie is done, and scenes where you feel as though you are living through Joel or Clemetine's pain.Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey did such justice to their characters, saying each line as if it wasn't scripted at all. If not said already, I think this was their best movies yet, for all the cast and crew alike. I cannot stress enough how completely wrong I was about Jim Carrey's work in this movie, he really blew me away!If you don't enjoy this movie for it's amazing story line, or the amazing job done by the cast, you will definitely notice the poetry of each word said. One scene in which Kirsten Dunst's character Mary is reciting lines from Alexander Pope's poem ""Eloisa to Abelard"" had me hooked.

This movie will haunt you with flashbacks long after you've seen it, making you watch it again and again. Jim Carrey didn't win the Oscar, as I've expected to, but I think its better this way, the prize for Best Actor, would have been too little for his enormous talent. He showed everyone that he is not just a comedy actor with silly moves, but that he can play drama very well, making the character look very natural, and this makes him a perfect actor, an exceptional one I must say. I was also very impressed with Kate Winslet's playing. She was absolutely lovable and charismatic making the character's messy way of living very impressive. With this role and the one in ""Finding Neverland"" she has established herself as one of the most talented and respectful actresses of our times. Also, great music by Jon Brion and Beck, it stuck to my mind for weeks. Michel Gondry and Charlie Kaufman have made a masterpiece hard to equal by anyone, even by themselves I guess.

The premise is that Joel Barrish (Jim Carrey), a rather average man in his late 30's, discovers that his impulsive, younger girlfriend, Clementine (Kate Winslet), has had her memory cleansed of any trace of him just before Valentine's Day. Upon his discovery, Joel decides to have the procedure done to himself so that he may be free of Clementine, but while he's reliving these memories as they're being deleted, he realizes that he doesn't want it anymore. The supporting cast is comprised of the team from Lacuna, Inc. By the way, this is the first movie where Kirsten Dunst has actually seemed to act and act well. Charlie Kaufman's bizarre, yet ultimately touching script will leave you recounting all of your past loves, while Michel Gondry's inventive techniques will leave you in awe.My favorite movie ever.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
A funhouse of low emotional tinkering,"This movie did something very original. Unfortunately for me it did not strike the emotional chord necessary in a love story. I wanted to feel more for the characters than what I actually did. I thought the scenes of Ruffalo and Dunst getting stoned while Carrey's mind erasure was taking place was out of character for the film. It just seemed so opposite to the point the film was trying to make. But the scenes where Carrey has second thoughts about his love for Winslet and then tries to resist his mind erasure and we see the visuals in his head play out was something special. A good film but not a great one. At the time of this review it stands at #32 all time on the IMDb's top 250 films list. Come on, guys. Better than love stories with great sub plots like 'On the Waterfront', 'The Apartment' and 'City Lights'? I think not!",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
simply one word to describe the movie would be: beautiful.,"i totally disagree that it is the worst movie. this is a movie that stands right in between the boundaries of artistic and mainstream movie. those who aren't able to actually grasp the beauty of it should not slam it. those who are looking for a story line, forget it. this movie is about emotions, and it explores emotions far more than the feelings one can experience in life due to its injections of sci-fic flavor. it is like letting a person who only knows french to read Chinese. of course it is difficult to appreciate unless the person is slowly exposed to more artistic forms of movie. i applaud Jim Carey's efforts to venture into a new form of movie with interjections of comedy, i recommend everyone to look at the quotes in the IMDb. it is very meaningful and i feel this movie is definitely a marvelous production, especially the scriptwriter.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
This movie was a boring artsy fartsy chick flick,"It is hard for me to relate my opinions of this film to you because it sucked so much that I tried to erase it from my mind (quite unlike the goal of the lead character who was struggling to retain his memories). I think the acting was fine and that Jim Carey is a great actor, but, unfortunately, the movie was just so boring. Also, I do not think there is anything novel about the idea of erasing one's memories of a person to try to make your life easier for you after a breakup, or trying to recapture these memories once you realize you love them (the action flick total recall, and I'm sure, a bunch of other flicks have such concepts). This movie is just a sappy love story that is way too psychedelic for my tastes. The weirdness of it all and the constant frenzy to retain memories and the weird special effects actually gets annoying after awhile and detracts away from the central theme of love in the film because it is too mind distorting. In short, this film is good for sappy artsy fartsy people who enjoy commenting about how unique something is, when really; it's not that original and actually gives you a psychedelic headache.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Beautiful acting in a funny and emotional story,"Strong drama revolving about two brothers coming to know each other after the death of their father.The Academy Award winning performance of Dustin Hoffman (Actor in a leading role) plays so well against what is easily Tom Cruise's finest moment to date that this move sucks you in and tears you apart as the humour and the emotion flow during this journey for two brothers, one of whom had no idea of the existence of the other, who is autistic. The treatment of the condition seems to be dealt with well and with care.Things to look out for: card counting, tooth pick counting, Raymond driving a sports car.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"Metaphors, Gorgeous Cinematography and Brilliant Acting/ Writing Sore.","With ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", it was made rather abundant that I would adore every seemingly insignificant cervese of this film, as even the title turned out to be a clever metaphor.One of the most complex, engaging, peculiarly structured, heart-warming, morbid and most wonderfully directed films I have ever watched. Jim Carrey was phenomenal as ""the broken soul"" character and the same applies to Kate Winslet, however, her character slightly differed. Every scene is littered with double- entendre and metaphors, Gondry mastered the correlation between the absurd and the relatable. At certain moments, it is in the same vain as ""The Truman Show"" but not as an impersonation more of inspiration. If you are like me and like unique and ambushes movies, then ""Eternal Sunshine"" is a must watch! The pacing is fantastic as well. Please watch, I guarantee you will walk away with a new- fangled philosophy for love and life.10/10
Jim Carrey, is a mediocre actor at best, but I will tell you something in this and ""The Truman Show""... Oscar Worthy!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Surprisingly well-crafted Psychedelic Romcom,"I had heard Eternal Sunshine mentioned on a few different occasions and just from those snippets I was not convinced that it would be possible to make a decent film with such a premise. Looks like I was wrong! This work is extremely well crafted, suspenseful, engaging, and pensive. Plus it displays cinematic excellence in terms of images, use of light and sound, and pacing.Most of the film takes place in the subconscious of one of the characters, but it is displayed so as to seem more like sci-fi than it is. Very well done. Bravo!",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"The most original, imaginative and scintillating film I've ever seen","First of all, reviews of the film are quite deceiving, and stand as blatant misrepresentations of its genre. On the cover of my copy it says ""A smart, sexy and seriously funny comedy!"" This is simply not true. To label Eternal Sunshine as a ""funny comedy"" is to completely misunderstand the underlying message of Charlie Kaufman and Michel Gondry's masterpiece. While certain aspects of the film are indeed funny, the genre of ""comedy"" is the furthest thing from an accurate label. Finding a place to begin describing my reaction to Eternal Sunshine is a very tough thing to do, but I'll try to provide the reader with an honest attempt at a coherent rant about my love for this film. The intent of this post is not to provide a frame by frame summary. Instead, I want to give you my reactions to it. A summary simply does not do it justice. Eternal Sunshine is thought provoking and expressive. It's something you have to experience for yourself:As the title of my post states, Michel Gondry, Charlie Kaufman and Pierre Bismuth have created the most original and scintillating film I have ever seen. Nothing in this film fails to deliver, especially in terms of creativity, plot association, narrative structure, acting, direction and writing. As he has proved previously, Charlie Kaufman (Being John Malkovich, Adaptation) possesses the ability to produce expressive and emotional screen writing. Joel and Clementine (Carrey, Winslet) are exceptionally real characters with real problems, and Kaufman brings these problems to light through his remarkably ""real"" script. The film touches your imaginative subconscious directly to the bone. The films' beauty is mystifying, and it generates a truly remarkable feeling of personal, creative sincerity. Michel Gondry has captured some of the most beautiful images I have ever seen on camera (the big bed on the snow covered beach is a great example). It is my feeling that Eternal Sunshine would not have had the same impression on me if Michel had not directed it. His creative instinct is the best the film industry has to offer (see The Science of Sleep), and no one other than Michel could have captured the story with such creativity- a creativity the project was intended to provide from as far back as the drawing board. His directional methods are practical yet unique. 90% of what you see in Eternal Sunshine is done in front of the camera. The characters move in and out of rooms to create a discontinuity that is very effective as it pertains to the plot (If you are reading this after viewing the film, you know what I'm referring to). The scene where Joel is hiding under his mothers table is done in front of the camera as well. No CGI and no green screen. The set is altered to give the illusion that Joel as an adult is proportionate to his height as a child.Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet give stellar performances. They both execute Kaufman's script exceptionally well. Tom Wilkinson and Mark Ruffalo never fail to deliver, and both give great supporting performances. However, Kirsten Dunst lacks talent in my opinion. Her scene with Wilkinson in Joels' apartment is a bit too much. Eternal Sunshine is more of an artistic representation of film than it is film in the traditional sense, and that is why I find it so beautiful. If you're an imaginative person, and love finding unique, creative expression through film, then you are certain to love this one. But, what makes it even more exceptional is the fact that it is NOT strictly an artistic representation. In a traditional sense, the narrative is deep. It twists and turns while constantly providing uncertainty to narrative tension.As I've said before, Eternal Sunshine taps into the imaginative and creative subconscious like nothing I've ever seen. Its portrayal of love and love lost is executed beautifully through Michel Gondry's direction and Charlie Kaufman's screen writing. The film is a vivid portrayal of human nature, and why we love who we love. The films' ability to weave artistic imagination with substantive narrative action is truly remarkable. As a true film lover, I stand firm in my opinion that Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind is the best film I have ever seen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Never will there be another film that understands us any better,"Though it goes without saying if you've seen his earlier work, Charlie Kaufman is amazing. He is and will always be known as one of the most original story and screenplay writers of our time. In Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind, he attempts to show us an understanding of a person's mind when it comes to such an emotional attachment as being in love with someone. Based around a small limerick by Alexander Pope which states: ""How happy is the blameless vestal's lot! The world forgetting, by the world forgot. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd"", Kaufman exemplifies this through the eyes of Joel Barish, played brilliantly by Jim Carrey. In the story, Joel Barish has a hard time coming to terms with the fact that the woman he loves (Clementine Kruczynski played by Kate Winslet in a stunning role as well) has taken part in a new scientific way of erasing bad memories. When he goes to the doctor who performed the procedure, he also wishes to have his memories of her erased from his mind. Though, while the procedure takes place, Joel finds himself having second thoughts. What ensues is an utterly odd but at the same time breathtaking film. It once again asks the question why we can't forget the ones we love, no matter what happens. Also starring Tom Wilkinson, Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, and Elijah Wood.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"Outstanding, you have to see this!","I can't describe this movie. I can't this describe the plot but i have to say this is one big masterpiece.I think the writer has one of the biggest brains in the world. And Charlie Kaufman (writer) won an Academy Award. That is not a coincidence.I must say I'm surprised to see Jim Carrey in a drama movie and he fits. Kate Winslet is awesome like always but i think she should has win an award.Long story short, this is a unique, sweet love story. This is in IMDb's Top 250. Rent and watch it.

Major missed opportunity...,"I have seen comments on IMDb saying that this film had a low score to start with, but what I don't understand is the high score it now has.If you are expecting a comedy then you will notice there is nothing to laugh about. Drama? I didn't see much. Sci-Fi? All been done before, but better. Romance? Mmmmm none worth remembering.Personally, I think some of the film is well done and I did watch it to the end. The idea of it all is better in theory than in the practise of watching it. It left me empty and the only feeling I had was to register on IMDb to post a comment on it (my first ever!). I was expecting a lot from this film and all I got was sense I had just watched a collection of memories, sometimes randomly put together, none of which we're really that interesting.I would rate it 5/10 and say it was a major missed opportunity. I'm not the greatest Jim Carrey fan but he was one of saving graces of this film.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
One winding too much,"The acting is brilliant. Jim Carrey is probably making the best job of his life and so is perhaps also Kate Winslet (and she has never ever been bad).Although this going down into people's minds is not to be believed and worse, it doesn't entertain. The script is a little too clever and sincerely nor the cast, nor even the author might be totally sure of what it's all about in every detail.Anyway, the ""common"" people here are interesting, living their rather normal life. This is an interesting failure, saved by intelligent dialogue and once again, very intelligent acting.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
This Film was truly awful !!!!,"In my 33 years on this planet I have never been so bored and confused that this trash was ever released. The ONLY saving grace that made me put up with the excruciating pain endured watching this absolute rubbish was Kate Winslet who's talent was not even enough to drag this out of the movie gutter. I would rather watch paint dry than go through that again. And seeing that it is in the top 250 made me want to cry. I don't know anybody personally who has enjoyed this film and hope never to. Jim Carrey who I do like, did himself no favours with this wooden performance and I dread to think what the scriptwriters will come up with next. I'm going back to the Godfather and Central Station to remind me why I love the movies.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Outstanding...,"""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is a Drama - Romance movie in which we follow Joel and Clementine, two people who undergo a procedure to erase each other from their memories after a painful breakup. As their memories are wiped away, they rediscover the depth of their relationship and the significance of their shared moments.I found this movie very interesting and its idea simply simply outstanding since it challenges the conventional storytelling with a unique way while it explores love, memory, and identity. A brilliant movie with a complex plot that can be confusing at times, requiring the audience to engage deeply, with the interpretations of both Jim Carrey who played as Joel Barish and Kate Winslet who played as Clementine Kruczynski helping a lot. The way vulnerability and authenticity were presented by both of them made the movie so unique. The visual style of the movie is captivating, with the direction of Michel Gondry bringing a dreamlike quality to the narrative. Lastly, I have to say that ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is a beautiful and emotionally movie that explores the fragile nature of love and memory, and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it because I am sure that you will enjoy, learn and remember it forever.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
Don't read critics.  Watch the film.,"I LOVED this movie, and I don't say that about many movies.  It's a movie for anyone that's ever been in love and even for those that have become hardened by love's disappointing nature.  Not ""Hollywood's version"" of love, but really felt a genuine connection with someone...the doubting, the questioning, the passion and emotion...then had it all dashed by a devastating break up.  I left the theater remembering my own relationships and how dark and unique they have all been.  The secrecy and stifled screams of the heart.  Carrey is brilliant and doesn't pull any of his usual physical comedy stunts or famous 'one-liners', his image is matured in this film and Winslet is as deep and beautiful as always.  Credit goes where credit is due...Kaufman is a genius.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
"Breathtaking, Made My Heart Heavy and Full of Joy and .... an unexplained word","this by far, is one of the most emotional, breathtaking, heart throbbing movies i have ever seen. I didn't cry once in the whole movie but the whole time i was watching it, i felt i was gonna cry so hard but the tears never came out. This movie hit me hard, harder than any other movies have. Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey had such an adorable, sad, loving, and wonderful chemistry. At the end, i was about to break. what i loved most about the movie was its creativeness, not trying to ruin the one of the greatest scenes of movies but, oh my gosh it was just such good directing, and dialogue, and EVERYTHING. The little things you notice but not too well are fantastic. And the way the story is told is amazing and very clever. oh and did i mention this movie was bursting with emotion? some words were hard to hear so i suggest watching this movie with subtitles, because once you get everything they say, you'll understand the movie a lot more. Its not the movies fault because some of the dialogue has to be low to make it be felt out. Overall, this is one of my favorite movies and i have seen a lot. almost all of IMDb top 15. This movie deserves to be up there.I seriously recommend this movie. Go watch it now",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi"
