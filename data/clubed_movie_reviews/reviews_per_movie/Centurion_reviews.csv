Hidden Gem,"I recently picked this movie up cheap after watching the Spartacus TV show. I guess i am going through a Roman phase! This movie although not what i was expecting was actually very good.If you are expecting large scale battles then look elsewhere as ultimately this becomes a chase movie as a small band of surviving Romans are being chased across Scotland by the savage Pict led by Olga Kurylenko.Kurylenko is fantastic in this, frightening without saying a word. Fassbender is ok, seeming to grow into the role as the movie progresses. He is supported by a band of mainly British actors including David Morrissey. Dominic West steals every scene he is in, in an all too brief appearance.I was pleasantly surprised with this movie and it just goes to show you don't have to have a huge budget or mammoth running time to create a good movie.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Playing cat and mouse with the Picts,"A group of Roman soldiers who survived an ambush are chased relentlessly by a hunting party of Picts. As with every other movie by Neil Marshall (The Descent, Doomsday) this big screen epic attempts to mix the grittiness of European filmmaking with the entertainment values of Hollywood movie-making. And as is becoming signature with this director, Centurion pursues his tradition to feature very strong and memorable female characters.While it is Centurion Quintus Dias (Michael Fassbender) who is the protagonist as the somewhat reluctant leader of our heroes, the most memorable character on screen is Etain, a Brigantian tracker played by Olga Kurylenko. Etain's tribe was massacred by the Romans and she took refuge with the Picts. Her backstory is a powerful device that explains all the hatred she has for Romans and the length she will go to exact revenge. Neil Marshall makes great use of actress Kurylenko and she literally eats the screen in almost every scene she is in, despite her character being mute. Etain reaches iconic status as far as I'm concerned, much like Karl Vreski (Die Hard).The actual plot, despite its historical context, is less Gladiator and more Apocalypto. Several battles are extremely gritty, entering gory territory as blood flows. There are a lot of CGI sequences mixed with traditional effects but they do not detract from the experience too much. Quintus' bunch of survivors are portrayed by a group of effective actors but the movie's short length prevents much characterization. Where Marshall is more effective is in the portrayal of the Picts. In very few words, several characters stand out throughout the movie.Everything is fairly entertaining but the movie never quite reaches classic epic status due to its short length and several incongruities. For instance, I still don't understand why two healthy and armed soldiers would run away from wolves, nor why wolves would pursue them (that simply flies in the face of anything we know about the behavior of wolves). Etain is also ordered to severe the heads of the men she is chasing but conveniently omits certain characters so that they survive their injuries, which makes no sense and is transparent bad writing. Likewise, when the Romans have a chance to steal or kill the Picts' horses, they simply ignore this opportunity. These plot holes add up pretty fast and detract from our experience, turning what could have been a classic into just a great pop corn flick.But an entertaining pop corn flick it is, despite its faults! I wish Marshall would be slightly less ambitious, as it seems he is at his best working on smaller scale movies but he still has a knack to shoot fun films and create engaging characters. Special kudos for not glorifying the Roman empire and especially, for not portraying the Picts as clear-cut villains. Although the structure of the film firmly puts the Picts in the ""baddies"" slot, there are several hints and a lot of subtext that, on the contrary, showcases the Roman empire as bloodthirsty invaders, plotting backstabbers and savages themselves.Every amateur of sword epic will want to see this one at least once, possibly several times.",6.0,Anonymous,History
One of the best in its genre,"This movie was relatively unheard of when a friend of mine gave a copy of it. I was skeptical since it was not from Hollywood, no big stars etc. However, it proved I was wrong. This is not a masterpiece indeed; but it was able to get me a thrilling ride from beginning to end. To make it short, I would say this is a combination of ""BEHIND ENEMY LINES"" scenario at the pace and editing of ""BOURNE ULTIMATUM"" set at the backdrop of ""KING ARTHUR"". It's true that script does not focus much on character development but it does not cause any trouble in enjoying this action-adventure. As one reviewer has mentioned, I agree that portrayal of a female warrior by Olga Kurylenko is much more realistic and successful than the similar role played by Keira knightly in ""King Arthur"". It is really sad that movies like this are not given adequate publicity since this is much better than most big budget Hollywood movies that are being hyped inappropriately.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Features  thrilling fighting scenes ,  violent  battles and  impressive production design","Ultraviolent historical/epic/action yarn with breathtaking battles including lots of blood and gore . This is a nice as well as exciting production with a big budget , great sets and thundering battles during the Roman Empire . The picture deals with historical facts about confrontation between Romans and Picts . AD 117. The Roman Empire stretches from Egypt to Spain, and East as far as the Black Sea. But in northern Britain, the relentless onslaught of conquest has ground to a halt in face of the guerrilla tactics of an elusive enemy: the savage and terrifying Picts (they were generally thought to not have worn any clothes). A Roman army commanded by General Titus Flavius Virilus (Dominic West) is besieged and deadly attacked . After that , splinter group of Roman soldiers led by Centurion Quintus Dias (Michael Fassbender) fight for their lives behind enemy lines after their legion is decimated in a devastating guerrilla attack . As they attempt to destroy their leader Gorlacon (Ulrich Thomsen) and face a desperate struggle to keep his small platoon alive .Bloody version based on historical events with overwhelming battles and great production values starred by Michael Fassbender as the fictional Centurion , leader of a motley crew of tough , battle-hardened warriors/underdogs who try to defend themselves against a patrol of bloody Picts led by a brutal warrior woman . The movie has great action sequences well staged with stylish and vitality , thrills , a little bit of romance and is pretty entertaining . Although is a little revisionist about characters , history and time when is developed the action in a dirty , gritty Roman Empire during its period in Britain . Several action scenes are outstanding with spectacular battle images and thrilling fights . Unfortunately, on small house screens much of the splendor will be lost . As the movie makes a big deal out of the supposedly deathly rivalry between Romans and the Picts . German archaeologists have found evidence of the 9th Legion on the banks of the Rhine River and carbon-dated them long after these events took place, suggesting that rather than being wiped out, the reason that there is no evidence of the 9th Legion being in Scotland after these battles is that they moved to Germany . The working title for the film was ""Ninth Legion"" , the story goes that the Ninth Legion marched to Scotland from York with 3000 men and were never seen of again. Historians dispute what actually happened to them. Some believe that they were disbanded, while others believe that they were massacred .Stunning battles scenes illuminate the full-blown feats with a plethora of engaging action set pieces on the combats in which the heads and limbs are slice off here and there . Casting is frankly excellent such as Liam Cunningham , Dominic Cooper , David Morrissey , Ulrich Thomsen , Imogen Poots and Paul Freeman and Governor Julius Agricola . Special mention to treacherous , despised role played by Olga Kurylenko as sadistic , revenger Etain . There are great action sequences including the gory battle in woods and the final confrontation at the climax of the film . Impeccable and evocative cinematography by Sam McCurdy . Filmmaker and his director of photography Sam McCurdy spent about two years discussing the look of the film before making it , one thing they were adamant about was that it should be shot on location and nowhere near a green screen. Magnificent and stirring musical score by Ilan Eshkeri . The motion picture was compellingly directed by Neil Marshall (Doomsday , Descent , Dog soldiers). Neil Marshall shot the film in such hard conditions that some cast members suffered health problems . One of Neil Marshall's influences was Walter Hill's The warriors (1979) , this is why Hill is thanked in the end credits . Rating : Good, it's a nice historical extravaganza well set in ancient Rome , done in great scale and praised for its action sequences.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Fight or Die.,"A small group of Roman soldiers are left alive after an attack on their legion. They must survive the elements and an expert tracker coming after them. Behind enemy lines and fighting for the lives.With Centurion, Neil Marshall has his biggest budget to date. The film is ambitious in style and tone. Marshall, who get a cult following after two excellent small horror films (Dog Soldiers and Descent) has gone on to bigger, but not really better things. Doomsday was a nice throwback to genre films (even though it didn't really know which one it wanted to be) and now Centurion, which has Marshall tipping his hat to Gladiator and Spartacus.I consider myself a Marshall fan, which is why I even bothered to give this film a viewing. If his name weren't attached, I wouldn't have bothered. Marshall is apart of the Splat-Pack. The horror coined group for filmmakers like Rob Zombie and Eli Roth. It's no question as to why Marshall is apart of this group, every film of his has some body part ending up some place. It's funny to me that this film might be his most gruesome one yet and it isn't even horror.The film's most gruesome moments are during the big attack on the romans. Arrows are shot into heads, arms, legs and necks are taken out like a hot knife through butter. I had a few moments where I was actually shocked at the carnage on the screen. One of the more gruesome period pieces. During the attack, the Picts (Scottish) take prisoner the General (Dominic West). The small group of survivors, including Michael Fassbender decide to try and get him back. They fail, but they did succeed in killing the lead Pict's son. He sends a group of people to go after them, thus we have a cat and mouse chase throughout the film.It's suspenseful in places and aggravating in others. The lead tracker, is suppose to have excellent skills, where she is always on their tail, no matter what. Yet the filmmakers seem to forget this sometimes. She can sense them across the river in one scene, but not underneath her feet in another. These inconsistencies are bothersome. Yet it happens. The characters themselves aren't too memorable either. I couldn't really tell the survivors apart from one another and neither stood out of the crowd. These shortcomings in the script are what bring Centurion down. The most interesting character is killed off too early too.Yet, Marshall still manages to deliver an entertaining film. It's not near the level of awesome that is Dog Soldiers, or even The Descent, but it does deliver what you would expect from this genre. There are moments where the film loses its sense of direction (such as a lover subplot) and there are even moments of predictability, but as a whole, the film delivers.",7.0,Anonymous,History
It could be a good movie but it's rather disappointing,"I never thought about it before, and actually this movie helped me to understand something. When you go to see a movie you want to have some satisfaction, and mostly you get it when you sympathize with the hero, you get emotionally involved in their problems and you worry about them.Here, you have two sides and I personally can not empathize with any of them.The Picts, while they have a right to protect their land and families, are shown in quite cruel way and Olga Kirylenko's character is far from being attractive.On the other side the Centurion and his soldiers are nothing but invaders killing and enslaving the locals just for the sake of glory of the Roman Empire. All in all, it's fair for them to be killed by the people they are oppressing and I can't really worry about the Centurion trying to survive because I feel more like he deserves to die for what he's done. If you are a professional soldier and came to a foreign land to ravage it... well, you get what you get.This movie looks like a historical documentary, which shows you some facts and reasons/motives of both sides to do what they do or have to.It's done fairly well, but for me it defeats the main purpose of movie - it's not entertaining. There is no point of attraction in it, there is no one to feel for, and I expect quite the opposite when I'm paying for the ticket.",6.0,Anonymous,History
blood and guts,"In 117 A.D., the Romans in Britania is stretched to the limit by the Picts in the north. After 20 years of stalemate, the Romans aim to finish the resistance. Centurion Quintus Dias (Michael Fassbender) is half naked running in the snow. The movie moves back two weeks to see Dias and his garrison outpost under attack. He is captured and taken to the Pict leader Gorlacon. General Titus Flavius Virilus (Dominic West) in York is ordered to destroy the Picts with his men. He is given mute Pict scout Etain (Olga Kurylenko) to guide him.This is a straight forward bloody violent sword and sandal war movie. The actors are solid led by West and Fassbender. It doesn't have many big story elements. The action is brutal and chaotic. The mood is dark and brood. I also love tracking in the wilderness. I like the cat-and-mouse game of the escape.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Roman tale based loosely on a factual event,"This is a well made small budget movie which gives us a fun and adventurous story with some dramatic scenery and a surprisingly strong cast.Loosely based on the true story of the Roman missing 9th legion (try reading the following book for a very interesting account of what we know and what is speculated; 'Roman Britain's Missing Legion: What Really Happened to IX Hispana?' by Simon Elliott).The movie gives a breathless feel with a movie length chase across the Scottish highlands. We are treated to some beautiful aerial shots and as it is set in winter, the movie feels damp and muddy, possible helped by the tones and colours used in the film stock. This dull earthy tones mixed with great costume design gives a gritty and realistic feel eschewing any imagined gloss and glamour of legionary life. The action scenes are small scale but well shot and pretty gory (plenty of heads rolling).I was pleasantly surprised by this film since my expectations were low as I had never heard of the title until recently. It is not CGI heavy or on the scale of Gladiator, lets say, but creates a very nice story within the small world it portrays.A nice surprise

Are you not entertained?,"Centurion is directed by Neil Marshall who also wrote the screenplay. It stars Dominic West, Michael Fassbender, Olga Kurylenko, Liam Cunningham, Noel Clarke, Riz Ahmed & Imogen Poots.Britain, 117 AD and the Romans are struggling to contain the Picts in Caledonia. The Roman Governor sends in their best army, the Ninth Legion. But they are victims of a trap and are forced to flee on foot across the mountainous terrain with the vengeful Picts in hot pursuit. Can they stay alive and make it to the border?One thing you know you are going to get with a Neil Marshall film is blood and guts. Be it squadies facing off against werewolves, pot-holing babes grappling with hungry Gollum types, or a secret unit sent in to quarantined Scotland to fend off cannibal punk rockers; Marshall likes to pile on the grue. With his latest, Centurion, he continues in this vein. Sadly that's about all there is as the talented director appears to be getting a little carried away with himself and forgetting to put some substance into his characters. What promises to be a telling historical epic anti-war movie ends up being one long chase movie. Only pausing for breath for intermittent blood letting and the now obligatory love interest sub-plot. Oh it's fun, very much so, and the visuals coupled with the excellently constructed fight sequences don't waste a penny spent. But as a whole it just doesn't work, it's more a collection of set pieces linked together by visceral pleasures under the guise of being a take on a folklore story.However, there is no denying the commitment to the genre from Marshall. Centurion is often thrilling and brutal into the bargain, so as long as you don't require any semblance of depth then it will surely entertain you. While he has assembled a very admirable cast of British & Irish thesps and put them thru a very tough shoot up in the Scottish hills. The craft is there, from director and stars, just no decent script to flesh it out. Oh and do we really need Roman soldiers saying the F word to show us how hard they are? Coming after Doomsday flopped (personally I think it's a whole bunch of fun), Marshall is at the crossroads of his career. Once the indie darling of Britain he's been courted by Hollywood and needs to make big decisions. You can only homage so much in your favoured genres (here he nods to Gladiator, The Warriors and even Zulu) before it gets to be boring. So is it time to let someone else write now? Also if he must stay mainstream then he has to get the budget to do the job properly; witness the digital blood used for the first fight sequences, laughably bad and able to take you right out of the film.At times ridiculous and over the top, Centurion only works well as a pure action flick. Which of course will find an audience. But director and cast are better than this, as an effective story is bogged down by lack of narrative heart that in turn is most likely hidden by arterial blood. Lots of it. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,History
Gory Historical Adventure,"Neil Marshall seems an odd choice for this type of movie . An established horror director isn't the first person you'd think of when choosing a director to make a historical adventure featuring ancient Rome in their battle to tame the Picts . That said he knows Scotland very well since his previous films DOG SOLDIERS and DOOMSDAY were both set there even if they were filmed in Luxumberg and South Africa respectively . At least the Scotland here resembles the gloomy bleak landscape seen in WinterFrom the outset Marshall shows his genre roots by making CENTURION as violent as possible . I saw this on the same day as I saw the last RAMBO movie and there's not a world of difference between the two movies where violence is concerned , people are decapitated and disemboweled and rivers run red with blood . If there's a problem it's as in his other films Marshall shows a slight problem with pacing . When characters sit down and talk you find yourself hoping for a bit more character interaction but this rug is pulled from under the audiences feet and we're back to a bloody set-piece regardless if it's needed or not . I had hoped for a little bit more conversation and a little bit less action please . If someone makes a bio-pic on Elvis then Neil Marshall will not be that director. That said films such as THE NAKED PREY and APOCALYPTO don't have much in the way of conversation eitherI'll say one thing in favour of the director and that is he's able to make a film where the British Isles have been invaded and the modern day British audience are still able to empathise with the invaders to an extent . Neither side is painted in black and white and the Romans are helped by the fact that they're played by a likable cast . One possibly might suggest that there's a subtext on Afghanistan going on here somewhere . By this I mean an all conquering super power finding itself unable to decisively beat an indigenous population . In fact the infamous line about Afghanistan being "" The grave yard of empires "" is almost spoken in relation to the PictsAnd that's perhaps the underlying fundamental problem with CENTURION . It's a film that could be somewhat more cerebral and character driven but has sacrificed this in order to be a violent historical action adventure that doesn't let up . It's a good film but perhaps should have been an even better one regardless of the budget",6.0,Anonymous,History
Etain Is One BadA$$ BeYotch.,"There really needs to be more movies like this. I love the genre. I love the history. The stories from these times can always be amazing.Dominic West is always great in roles in which he gets killed. This one is no different. The moral of this one is that a WELL BUILT WALL will keep out invaders, at least for a while. But you also need the personnel to monitor that wall, and appropriate technology to aid you.Other morals include never trust a slave owner. Never underestimate a mute barbarian Pict female. Don't ride headlong at your own troops while wearing the uniform of the enemy. And Politicians will always lie and even murder, to protect their own behinds. Sad but true in any time.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Carves out its own gory slice of guilty pleasure pie,"Neil Marshall's bloody medieval chase flick could very easily be dubbed ""King Arthur: the prequel."" The 2004 Clive Owen-feautring King Arthur origin tale essentially picks up where this film ends with the building of Hadrian's Wall, the ancient Roman fortification that stretched across what is now Northern England. Both films follow a small band of Roman centurion soldiers battling against the native warriors. Though similar in setting and tone, Centurion carves out its own gory slice of guilty pleasure.Despite what is still a giddy action romp, Centurion continues to highlight Neil Marshall's slide from his one-two punch horror debut with Dog Soldiers and The Descent. His very latest effort was the deliciously over-the-top apocalyptic throwback Doomsday, but I still hold hope that he can break free of this B-movie mold and recapture the spark that made him somewhat of an icon amongst horror fans. What continues to shine through in Marshall's films is his prowess. The man knows how to shoot an action sequence and mounts the proceedings against stunning cinematography. He seems to understand that just because your movie employs schlocky subject matter doesn't mean it has to look cheap.Centurion is not your typical Gladiator-style epic offering, but is more or less a chase film in the vein of a traditional slasher film with an unrelenting force stalking its frantic prey. The threat exists in the form of The Picts, a Scottish tribe bent on repelling their Roman invaders. After a Pict attack on a remote Roman outpost, Quintus Dias (Michael Fassbender) finds himself in captivity as the lone survivor. Escaping, he meets up with the Ninth Legion lead by the brash but beloved General Virilus (Dominic West). The Legion is immediately deployed into action and it is déjà vu for Dias as the legion is devastated in a guerrilla attack set up by the mute double agent Etain (Olga Kurylenko). It is then up to a small band of survivors including the general and Dias to make it back to the Roman lines.Apart from the glossy production values, the biggest assets in Centurion are the performances by West and Fassbender. They ground the film amongst the gushing blood and dangling limbs, simultaneously propelling themselves further as ever-rising stars. Kurylenko has somewhat of a thankless role as the fierce warrior-woman but she makes the most of her lineless screen time. What I find odd about films set in this time and place, is the Roman's are always portrayed as the heroes when in fact they are the ones invading the Celtic homeland. It would be refreshing to see a similar style film from the point of view of the native inhabitants.Centurion has a lot going for it in terms of pure fun, but is certainly lacking in substance and an even tone. Marshall has also opted to shoehorn in a love story involving Dias and an exiled Pict which stands as a stark contrast to the gritty mayhem that perforates most of the narrative. Qualms aside, you could do worse than this straightforward but manic ancient action flick and looking at the movie year at large, Centurion looks better at every crimson-soaked visit.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Surprisingly good tale,"I'm a fan of the culture and history of early Britain, so my opinion may be tainted a bit, but I really enjoyed this flick. It had a surprisingly good story and was not just a blood and guts war fest. It appears that the movie may be based on Rosemary Sutcliff's Book 'The Eagle of the Ninth', in which the Ninth Legion is wiped out in Scotland in AD 117. In any case, there is controversy and mystery as to what really happened to the 9th, and that makes a setting for a good tale. There is just enough history to make the story plausible, for example the creation of Hadrian's wall is depicted.Neither side is portrayed as the ""good guys"" or the ""bad guys"", and to me, that brought a sense of realism with it. This is a bloody film, with heads rolling and a plethora of fighting, so don't bring the kiddies. I watched it On Demand, but I might go see it again in the theater.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Mostly believable, gritty Romans vs. Barbarians movie","If you're into the kind of movie where mud smeared people fight with swords, spears and other ancient weaponry, ride horses across beautiful scenery while wearing animal skins, you should enjoy this movie, I definitely did.I gave it 7 out of ten for being a well made gritty movie with a plot line that made sense and believable fight scenes, all the while managing not to be over the top. All of which I found surprising for this genre and so may have earned it a slightly higher rating.That said, at times the fight scenes failed to convince and I felt they could have been a more raw and visceral. There was a mêlée scene which reminded me of the opening of Gladiator, without copying it out right.I also had a few plot points where I thought: ""why would they ..."", or ""why didn't they ..."", but for the most part the plot made sense and I found the characters motivations and actions believable.The beautiful scenery should also be mentioned and the movie did a great job of placing the action in the scenery instead of just showing it to us.Nit-picking: I didn't think much of the title sequence with it's floating 3d text, other than using an old looking font - I didn't get the connection. Also some things didn't sit well with what I know about the period, but after I got over myself I enjoyed it.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"A grubby, gory delight.","When the final credits were rolling my regular cinema-going counterpart observed ""that was one of the most outwardly violent films I've seen since Kill Bill"". That's not far from the truth. Limbs are hacked clean off, stomachs are regularly impaled and the claret fluid sprays endlessly. Though the major difference is where Tarantino's homage to the old chop-socky movies from Eastern cinema is cartoonish in its bloody visuals, Centurion is anything but tongue-in-cheek; here the blood, sweat and tears seep into the muddy vistas and bucolic rivers of Great Britain to intensify the atmosphere.Director Neil Marshall (The Descent) has crafted a gritty movie that at its core is a simple 'cat and mouse' tale – and a highly entertaining one at that – but becomes much more thanks to the efficacious work from all the cast and crew. Marshall himself executes a few impressive sequences, the most outstanding being the initial ambush on the Ninth Legion, showing once again he knows how to stretch a small budget with minimalistic techniques and a passionate approach. Director of photography Sam McCurdy provides a suitably grimy and grainy look that, although at times is too dim, sets the ideal tone for the film. Perhaps Marshall should have monitored the editing closer though, Chris Gill's frenetic cutting very nearly ruins a couple of the fight scenes.Major Hollywood star in the waiting Michael Fassbender (played the German-impersonating British Lieutentant in Inglourious Basterds) is undoubtedly the standout among the acting contingent. As the titular soldier, Fassbender makes for a charismatic leading man that convinces in both the physical and dramatic elements of the role. I eagerly wait to see what he does as the young Magneto in the upcoming X-Men prequel. Elsewhere The Wire alumni Dominic West is rough around the edges as the gruff General Virilus, Olga Kurylenko is positively bad-ass as the mute, monomaniacal warrior hell-bent on revenge and BBC favourite David Morrisey adds clout in his supporting role of Bothos.A grubby, gory delight.4 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)",8.0,Anonymous,History

"Enjoyable, violent action flick, if trapped by convention","If you want a bloody, violent action-thriller, you can find a bloody, violent action-thriller. After a certain point the details hardly matter, and are only flavor for that visceral core - even as it's those details that seek to hook viewers. In this case those details paint 'Centurion' as filmmaker Neil Marshall's cinematic interpretation of how ancient Rome's Ninth Legion vanished from the historical record. To that end, the filming locations in Scotland are gorgeous, and we're treated to splendid, attentive costume design, hair and makeup work, and set design to bring 2nd century Britain to life. Moreover, with the emphasis on vicious combat, we get looks at carefully realized weapons, equipment, and otherwise props, solid blood and gore, hard-hitting fight choreography and stunts, and swell visual effects. It all looks pretty good to me! I'm not saying it's perfect, but 'Centurion' wants to thrill and entertain, and it very suitably thrills and entertains.That previous word, ""interpretation,"" is important, because there's debate as to whether or not the Ninth Legion even actually met its end in Britain, and further liberties are taken with history. Still, bearing in mind the intent of the picture, may it also spark a viewer's interest in this fascinating, brutal era, and explore it more deeply on their own. And with that said, I think Marshall's own screenplay is all that it needs to be. As an action-thriller the dialogue and characters are just flavoring, but they're fine. Even as it's mostly just a vehicle for the violence, and bears some familiar strains, the narrative is duly engaging and exciting: a tale of a hard-fought effort for survival in an unfamiliar land against an opponent who is far more prepared. It rather goes without saying, but it's worth pointing out that the protagonists of the movie, the Romans, are in truth the villains of the scenario, given the Empire's invasion Pict lands, lending another angle to the storytelling here.And that brings us to the scene writing, the real bread and butter of 'Centurion.' There's sufficient variety between each passing moment to present a number of facets - some of them very recognizable and even predictable - and the feature presents a clear image of the foulness even within the ranks of the ""heroic"" Romans. Even in those instances in which the substantial bloodshed is briefly set aside, the orchestration of each scene does a fantastic job of building a pervasive sense of tension, suspense, and unease. This is aided by Ilan Eshkeri's stirring, dynamic score, and by Sam McCurdy's crisp, vivid cinematography from which a degree of color is deliberately washed out. Marshall has certainly proven himself as a director of action-oriented films, and demonstrates his craft once more here. And though their performances are guided more by the demands of the narrative and its scenes rather than their roles, the assembled cast turns in excellent displays of acting to fit the needs herein. Among others, Michael Fassbender bears steady range and poise as a leading man, though he's outshone by the intensity in Olga Kurylenko's portrayal of ferocious Pictish warrior Etain. Frequent Marshall collaborator Liam Cunningham reliably commands strong presence as grizzled veteran soldier ""Brick,"" while the quiet tenderness Imogen Poots illustrates in her lesser time on screen as Arianne is a welcome respite from the rivers of crimson. The cast aren't necessarily given much, but they make the most of it.At length, this is the type of picture that emphatically holds no surprises. For the fact of how well the action sequences are executed, and the strength of the film-making and storytelling in and of itself, I'd love to hold this in slightly higher regard. On the other hand, there are more than a few elements of the plot that are outright conventional, and however well it's all put together, the differences between 'Centurion' and any of its brethren are quite few. Don't take that to mean that this isn't enjoyable, because it most certainly is, provided that all you want is, well, a bloody, violent action-thriller. And, even with the story on hand, it's not like the picture pretends to be anything it's not. So before watching, just ask yourself what it is you want from a film: a fully earnest historical assessment of Rome's Ninth Legion this is not, but if it's an invigorating action flick you desire, then step right up.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Historical fiction doesn't get more exciting than this,"Centurion is a great film, and I suspect it's going to be totally underrated by the cinema-going public. I saw it at my local Odeon last night, the only cinema in town showing it, and I strongly suspect it won't be on next week. This is an example of a really good British film from a director with a strong pedigree not getting the kind of publicity and public interest that is frequently given to the most heinous rubbish that Hollywood can produce. Granted, many people don't share my director-centric view of forthcoming features; I'm prepared to risk getting my fingers burned occasionally in avidly chasing any films made by a select bunch of my favourite directors, but my approach is usually rewarded with excellence, like Centurion. In structure it is a very simple story, beautifully shot and honestly told. The bloody battles are very realistic - you get a good feel for what it might actually have been like to fight hand-to-hand in ancient times, frantic and deadly. The characters are simply drawn, and develop through their actions rather than words (quite literally in the case of Olga Kurylenko's ""Etain""). There is good and bad on both sides of the conflict, which is true to every war in human history. Ultimately, it offers a quite believable scenario to explain the mysterious historical disappearance of the 9th Legion in Hibernia.",10.0,Anonymous,History
HK Neo Reviews: Centurion,"A brutal ancient actioner...The film pans out exactly as the trailer, offers nothing new, done to death story, but somehow, this brutal portrayal of the Romans battling for survival against the tribes of forestry is exciting enough for the entire duration. Save for a letdown in the formula romantic subplot, the film serves the audience well, with an efficient actioner that offers nothing special, nothing new and nothing memorable.Michael Fassbender leads a cast of non-Hollywood heavy weights. Fassbender makes a charismatic hero to follow, while offering nothing ingenious in terms of acting; he is suitably capable as a leader of the magnificent seven. The highlight and eye candy comes in the form of former Bond girl, Olga Kurylenko, who displays some meaty acting chops by being outright nasty. Perhaps aided by being a mute, Olga is great and if she shed a few more of those cloths on her, it will be even greater. Shame it didn't happen, but she is certainly one very hot heroine.All in all, Centurion delivers action, action, blood, blood, violence, violence and absolute brutality. For that it entertained me from start to finish. Yes, I am a casual ancient historian, but if you discount the factor of any historical accuracy and embrace the film as a fiction or even a fantasy. Centurion can be a joy ride and not unlike the Zth time of going on the same roller-coaster, Centurion offers the thrill and entertainment, if not for long after the duration. A decent film for what it is worth...(Neo 2010)I rate it 6.5/10www.thehkneo.com",6.0,Anonymous,History

Very watchable but underwhelming,"Like Neil Marshall's other movies, this is solid but ultimately feels a bit stretched. Cool, gory battle scenes - at times the editing makes it feel like they are trying to fit as many on screen deaths as possible within the smallest amount of screen time. I just never really got that engaged with the characters. Overall, this is a timekiller which is competent, uncompromising and mostly visually interesting, but overall, nothing remarkable or really innovative. I thought The Descent was much more effective.

Blood and Mayhem,"Those who are fans of HBO's ""Rome,"" or Starz's ""Spartacus"" will be pleased with ""Centurion."" It doesn't have the narrative of ""Rome,"" nor the trashy-goodness of ""Spartacus,"" but what it takes from both of them is violence. And boy does it have a lot of it.The story follows a group of roman soldiers trapped behind enemy lines. Outnumbered, they must trek through enemy territory to rescue their general, Virilus (Dominic West), who was captured following an ambush. This group is lead by Quintus Dias (Michael Fassbender), who previously survived a raid on his fort by the Pictish, before escaping and being rescued by General Virilus and his 9th Legion. General Virilus, a man's man, was summoned by Julius Agricola (Paul Freeman), a Roman Governor. He was then given the task to go on the offensive, and wipe out the Picts, for no reason other than to help Julius return to Rome. It seems like this is the motive of EVERY Roman politician outside of Rome. Accompanying his legion is the female tracker, Etain (Olga Kurylenko), a Pict herself who now helps the Romans (think Wes Studi in ""The Last of the Mohicans""). She may look pretty, but when she screams, you see how dirty her teeth are, and think to yourself ""I wouldn't want to kiss that.""The plot is very solid, but nothing special and the cast do their best with the material. Voice-Over narration by Michael Fassbender's character, Quintus, is heard throughout the movie. It's not overly done, and serves it's purpose by giving us insight to Quintus. He's the typical roman soldier, honorable, yet filled with national pride. You have no problems rooting for him. Etain, has no tongue, so we don't have to hear Olga Kurlenko speak. All she has to do is make intimidating faces that look more cute than menacing. The rest of the cast is solid, and there's even a black guy in the legion! Guess what happens to him. Every roman solider speaks with an English accent, while the Picts sound Scottish. This isn't ""Mel Gibson's Centurion,"" so I have no problems with this. After all, this is an English speaking film. My only gripe is that not enough attention is paid to the characters before they start dying off.Director Neil Marshall (The Descent) really knows how to give his films a sense of dread and unease. Like ""The Descent,"" the protagonists of ""Centurion"" are chased, and have to survive in an environment they know nothing about. This film is also gory as hell. Heads are not only decapitated, but are diagonally cut in half. Swords go through bodies like they're 99% liquid, and limbs are easily detachable. Hell, even being pushed into a tree while running will result in a blood splatter. One thing this film does not lack is ways to kill people. The kills are very much the highlight of this film, and the blood here is not as cartoonish as the blood in ""Spartacus."" Primarily shot in the forests of Hampshire, England, ""Centurion"" is very pleasant to look at; the cast is surrounded by tall trees, and snowy mountains. This accentuates the battle sequences and makes them more enjoyable.""Centurion"" contains everything you expect in a film about Romans: blood, betrayal, even a hint of politics – but sorry, no sex. However it has a very by-the-books story, and it's characters lack emotion. Aside from Quintus, it's hard to feel for any character, but the movie doesn't care about that. It's a gritty period action flick, and if you like violent deaths, you won't care either.",7.0,Anonymous,History

"A ""Splat Pack"" take on Roman history!","'CENTURION': Three Stars (Out of Five)Neil Marshall (writer and director of 'DOOMSDAY', 'THE DESCENT' and 'DOG SOLDIERS') writes and directs this historical adventure film about Roman soldiers under attack behind enemy lines in Northern Britain. Marshall is a horror and gore master and a member of the ""Splat Pack"", an unofficial grouping of named modern horror filmmakers. This film is more of an adventure / war film but it still has a surprising amount of gratuitous violence. The film, like Marshall's others, was filmed in the UK and features actors like Michael Fassbender, Dominic West, David Morrissey and Olga Kurylenko (the most recent 'Bond' girl).The film revolves around Roman soldier Quintus Dias (Fassbender) who is the lone survivor of a Pictish attack on a Roman frontier fort. He's taken captive by the Picts and later escapes. He then is enlisted in the Ninth Legion and returns for vengeance on the Picts alongside General Virilus (West). The legion is ambushed, Virilus is taken prisoner and the remaining, living group, of Roman soldiers is left to fend for their own behind enemy lines. The Picts are led by the vengeful Etain (Kurylenko) who led the legion into the ambush and double crossed them.The film is mildly entertaining but for me it just doesn't live up to Marshall's other films. I really liked 'DOOMSDAY' and I enjoyed 'THE DESCENT' and 'DOG SOLDIERS'. The action scenes were cool but a little too violent, in a way that didn't seem necessary (although I'm one of the last people to complain about film violence). The main thing I felt was lacking in the film is that the characters aren't very interesting or likable (maybe partially due to lackluster performances). I also felt kind of strange being forced into rooting for the Roman soldiers when they really were the bad guys of the film; the narrative was all wrong. Overall the movie is a slightly above average adventure film.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPqFKAK3fro",6.0,Anonymous,History

Picts chase Romans through glorious Highland mountain scenery,"Centurion is, together with Apocalypse, one of the best historical chase movies out there.The story gives a general glimpse of the +300-years of failed Roman struggles on the Scottish frontiers and, in particular, the story of the loss and aftermath of the 9th Roman Legion.From Vespasian and Hadrian to Pius, Commodus and Severus, colossal military forces were sent North into Scotland but none ever succeeding in taking the entire country. Worse, in the course of Roman history, only 3 eagle standards were lost and one of these losses occurred in 2nd Century AD under the reign of Emperor Hadrian in Scotland, when the elite 9th Legion (Hispana), was wiped out without a trace in central Scotland. The complete loss of such a large elite military unit (5,000 men) had consequences which reverberate to the present day. As a result of the defeat, Emperor Hadrian campaigned in ancient Scotland with enormous troop numbers, only to realise that there was only one viable option - to build a fortified wall to defend against the Northern invaders. The ultimate legacy of the Ninth was the creation of a permanent border, Hadrian's Wall, the historical origin of the line that separates the independent kingdoms of England and Scotland can be traced to the story of the loss of the 9th Legion.Overall the acting and plot are much better than your average action movie.

Follows Gladiator in its fierce spirit with flaws,"The latest entry into the modern peplum (blood and sandals) film this film uses a bit of the Gladiator formula. The good news is that it doesn't overkill on CGI like 300. I'm still shocked how high 300 ratings are...really it's quite average but it appears to develop a cult following. Like some people consider McDonald's great food. Anyhow, like Gladiator, it deals with Roman legionnaires who fight for Rome although perhaps they'd rather retire and have a normal life with a family. Michael Fassbender and archrival Olga Kurylenko leads a strong, relatively unknown cast of legionnaires versus Picts.The plot deals with the massacre of the Ninth Legion and how it tries to rescue its general but instead is hounded by Picts bent on revenge. The film is Gladiator meets Deliverance as the legionnaires and their Picts enemies hunt each other to death. The acting and cinematography is very good.The films weakness is sometimes the action where the blood looks too bright like tomato juice. Aside from that, the action was fairly good and I think actually better than the over- CIGed 300. Neil Marshall was probably also rushed to finish this film on a limited budget. And the opening scenes which start off like an opera singer choking on a high note. It's a bit jarred at the start but as it gathers moss, it flies smoothly to the point. The final showdown isn't a big fight since the sides have been decimated but it leads to the end where futility in fighting for Rome is realized. Which is why I compare it to Gladiator. Its message is the simple life is more desirable than glory. Russell Crowe as Maximus loves his family and wanted to go home. Quintus Dias finds whats more important to him than glory.It looked like the distributors/producers couldn't market this film and panicked thinking it won't sell tickets at the theater.

Had it then threw it away,"In general I have been pretty impressed by Neil Marshall's movies. They play to what I see as his strengths as a director, small ensemble group of character actors battling with extreme circumstances (often violent), fast and furious action, satisfying conclusion. As I assess this movie there was every chance that he was going to do this again in a Roman vs Pict battle for survival story. Small band of soldiers, stuck behind 'enemy lines' racing to get back to safety. At first I wasn't sure that the contemporary language and accents was going to work for me - I've no idea what Roman vernacular might have been but 21st Century Brit-speak takes a bit of a leap of faith. However as the action picked up and the plot unfolded I started to get into the fast pace of the whole thing and was really enjoying the 'rush for the line pursued by uber tracker bitch with a sense for her prey' storyline. Then what happens! Suddenly out of nowhere we have love interest - 'vogueish' not 'pict-ish'and the previous set up goes out of the window. Said super hunter inexplicably can't find Romans when they are virtually sitting in her lap. The pace completely slackens off and the edginess that was build up before is gone. What was Marshall thinking of? Of course I blame the production company or distributors or some such ninnies who I assume said to good ol' Neil, ""Bigger production, bigger budget than you're used to....must have a love story to get a decent return on our investment."" That, or, NM just out of his comfort genre. Who knows but a lost opportunity this time round.",5.0,Anonymous,History
"Romans, blood, and vengeance.","""Now she hunts Romans. Now we are the prey.""Centurion isn't a historical epic, it's a historical action flick. You won't get the grandeur and scope of a movie like Gladiator, but if you're looking for some violence and would like to substitute swords and arrows for shotguns and Uzis, then you could do a lot worse.Michael Fassbender and Olga Kurylenko star on opposite sides of this movie. Fassbender is a Roman centurion in Britain who has been among the only survivors of two attacks by the warring Picts on his fellow soldiers. Kurylenko is a mute Pictish woman working with the Romans, who turns out to be more than she seems. Both of the stars prove credible in their action scenes, which are the main showpieces of the movie.The battles are what you'd expect from (director) Neil Marshall - visceral, brutal, and with copious amounts of blood. They occur frequently, and they never fail to have a high body count. If you're at all familiar with the story/legend of the Ninth Legion (which Centurion was adapted from), then you know not to expect many of the main characters to survive. You also probably know that there really aren't any true ""good guys"". The Romans are fighting to control the territory they've conquered, and the Picts are fighting for revenge and freedom. Both sides do some terrible things, but the Romans are presented as our main characters here, and therefore, our protagonists.This is a much more simple and conventional movie than Marshall's other work like The Descent and Doomsday, and it's probably his most mainstream flick, as well. But, there's nothing wrong with a straight-forward action movie if it's entertaining. I probably won't rush to own Centurion or see it again, but it was certainly worth seeing once. Fans of Imogen Poots will definitely want to check this out, as she has a nice (if somewhat brief) role.",6.0,Anonymous,History

The other thing that might irritate you are special effects: ridiculous blood splashes in the battles like in some Tarantino movie. However, I found this movie still fun. Camera, costumes and acting are superb. The rhythm of the film is good so the director has overcome the problem of having a dry historical theme movie. What I also liked about the movie is that it shows historical balance as it was: Rome is not the light as in Gladiator but the brutal power that faces another brutal power.

Violent but mesmerizing tale of Roman Britain,"Quintus Dias - Michael Fassbender - is a Roman commander at an English fort on the northern border of territory conquered by Rome. In truth, they have tried to subdue the Picts who live directly north. But, its proved futile. The Picts are fearless fighters who dont engage in combat Roman style. As Dias admits, they attack and kill at unexpected times and places then retreat to hideaways. One day, they do attack the fort and kill everyone but Quintus. He escapes by startling the Picts in speaking their language. He is taken prisoner and tortured but escapes. He runs shirtless in the snow and miraculously meets a Roman party. They head to the nearest fort commanded by General Virulus - Dominic West. After hearing his story, they consult with the old leader of all Roman Britain, Agricola. This leader still wants glory and accolades for himself and Rome. Therefore, a legion of 3000 Roman soldiers will go and "" subdue the Picts "" once and for all. Helping them will be a Pict warrior and tracker lady Etain who has changed her allegiance to Rome. Off they go. Yet, has arrogance lead Rome to a dangerous reckoning? This violent but terrific film is not for the faint of heart. The swords, axes, spears and arrows are seldom put down so be prepared. Nevertheless, this historical depiction of what may have happened to the 9th Roman legion in Britain is a tale well told. It is enthralling fare. Fassbender and West do great work as do all of the other actors. Scenery, costumes and cinematography will dazzle the eyes and send one scurrying to find out more on Roman Britain and the Picts, who eventually disappear from history. If you can handle bloody combat, Centurion is a film to pursue as soon as you can.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Basically uninteresting...,"I had watched The Eagle before watching Centurion, so I'm biased as I enjoyed the Eagle and would buy it on DVD.
Centurion did not impress me. I'm not a historian so I won't go into too much detail. One goof mentioned was the riders using stirrups. These were not invented in Roman times so not used. It is difficult to criticise reconstructions of the Picts as we know virtually nothing about them. Its good they had the Picts speak Scots Gaelic as some level of ancient tribal can be imagined from this. Its a shame they couldn't have the Romans speaking Latin, but there we go.One major error was that they had Arianna 'exiled for witchcraft'. In those days before the Roman Empire became Christian, and even for some time after, all the peoples of Europe were tribal shamanic, and witchcraft would have been normal. Even the Romans had their own forms of this, in their deities, temples and rituals. So she would not have been exiled for witchcraft. this was not yet a Christian Empire and the Picts were certainly not Christians.He had the Romans bantering like British soldiers. Romans were not British. They may have been Italic, or Hispanic or Germanic, but British as in the modern British soldier, did not exist then. So his representation of Roman soldiery would have been better based on how Spanish, or Italian or French or Greek soldiers interact. Cultural differences are important, esp. 2000 yrs ago. The Eagle made such interactions more 'neutral' so that culture did not enter into it so much.OK, it wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but it could have been a lot better, more engrossing. I found none of the cast esp/ likeable or sympathetic. I guess some succeed and other don't. I might have given it 4 stars but the historical inaccuracies were a bit too glaring, and I just didn't enjoy it. IMHO, The Eagle is a much better story, much more enjoyably told.",3.0,Anonymous,History
"Breathtaking settings, bloody but hankered","Talented and left of the middle director Neil Marshall returns with a 117 A.D story of a group of Roman soldiers who must fight for their lives as they are hunted down by the Picts the savage, elusive and remorseless inhabitants of Northern Britain.In the vein of Beowulf & Grendel (2005) 13th Warrior (1999) and of course Gladiator (2000), Centurion oddly missed a long running large screen release. It has an excellent diverse cast ensemble, including Olga Kurylenko, Imogene Poots, David Morrissey and the great Liam Cunningham. With excellent make-up design, costumes and fantastic breathtaking settings, it's only hankered by some strained dialogue which lacks the conviction of that in the Black Death (2010).Centurion is modest constructed period piece, there's Etain (Kurylenko) and Michael Fassbender's excellent performance as Quintus, violence, blood and decapitations. Supporting actors are the backbone with the likes of Axelle Carolyn and Dave Legeno to name a few but they are not given enough to do or say. You can forgive at times Ilan Eshkeri great, yet, at times intrusive theatrical score, as Marshall delivers some great set ups, action, the wolf hunt and ambush to name a few and Centurion grips you and creates tension like his unsurpassed earlier work.There's lots of atmosphere created by the location shoot and visually Marshall delivers.

I will say that she did a decent job with a non speaking part, and as gritty as this movie is, she is definitely a great piece of eye candy.Overall it was a gritty movie, the costumes were pretty good the locations were great, and the story was decent. I hear the budget was pretty low for this movie, if so they did a pretty darn good job with what they had.It isn't going to be the best movie you ever see, but it does succeed a bit more than others such as the deplorable Channing Tatum movie, The Eagle.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Why I stopped watching,"I am glad they tried to make a movie like this. I want there to be movies about Dark Ages Britain, and historical movies in general. But here is why I stopped watching: 1) The ridiculous inclusion of a female warrior. I am so sick of unrealistic portrayals of them. This girl looks like she weighs 110 pounds. She puts on nice eyeshadow makeup. And she whips Domenic West's ass. She has this commanding warrior badass presence that, let's be realistic, no woman would be able to have had in 117 AD, and which lots of buff dudes probably didn't have then either. I am tired of gritty, but not gritty enough. DO you want to be gritty? Show how this female warrior is beat up by a guy. That is what really would happen. Better yet, show how she uses other abilities than strength, such as cunning, trickery, and her wits, to survive. That is what real women had to do back then, in a addition maybe to a bit of opportunistic backstabbing if necessary. Well, Because they tended not to wield weapons for a reason. That reason being, they are just not as strong! N.b. I am a woman myself, but I think all this warrior girl crap is just too much cliché now. Let's make it realistic! Make the girl big and strapping at least!! 2) The makeup. I am so sick of the Picts painted blue. It just looked bad. Maybe it didn't look home-made enough.... I don't know. I know that is their characteristic but.... Also! They should have been made to speak Welsh and not Scots Gaelic.3) The cheezy dialogue. I winced. (Interactions between the soldiers, etc) Because I heard what they were trying to do, and sometimes it seemed so nice! They were trying to give a good feel for the time. And they failed! Something was just missing. They needed me on their scriptwriting team.4) I already said it sort of above, but this was NOT GRITTY ENOUGH. I want to feel like I am in this time period and things in this movie seemed either silly (heads splattering everywhere, much more easily than they would in real life), or halfassed. I never lost myself in this movie and felt like I was somewhere else. I always felt like I was a 21st century person watching a corny 21st century rendition of... something.... People running a lot across nice landscapes.... etc....",,Anonymous,History
interesting for fans of the roman empire,"it was an very interesting movie to watch. first i will praise the creators, for making a research on the roman army before making this. having made roman reenactment, my self for years ago, it was pretty cool to see some historical accurate armors, weapons etc. in it. its not 100% accurate, but thats all right, and delightful, when you see how inaccurate other movies about the roman empire are. the story isn't that bad either. there will happen some things, that you expect. but they also do things you don't really expect. so all in all i will say, that this is a decent movie. if you have an interest in the roman empire, its definitely worth watching. and if not, i think that you still would find yourself enjoying it.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Despite it's faults it's entertaining,"Well 20 minutes into this movie I had no idea if I wanted to turn it off or keep watching, I went with the latter of the two and don't regret it. Michael Fassbender who I first noticed in the movie ""300"" does a great job with his role and is probably the best part of the movie. The faults within the movie has nothing to do with the acting or even the directing it's more about the screenplay, it almost seemed to simple for this type of movie.I'm a sucker for good action scenes even when most nowadays are ridiculous and completely unbelievable and it's easy to notice here that Neil Marshall focused more on the action then the storyline. Now don't get me wrong I was a fan of ""Dog Soldiers"" and thought ""The Descent"" was one of the best movies of the year. However it seems here that he just wanted to make a bloody action movie. The thing that makes a movie like ""Kingdom of Heaven"" or ""Spartacus"" a great movie is not putting the action ahead of the story or characters. Honestly part of the way through I kind of forgot that this is suppose to be a historical drama.Don't take this the wrong way I enjoyed what I saw I like action movies, I just don't like a movie trying to be something it's not. This movie is a good action movie and perhaps the Roman backdrop was a good idea, I haven't completely decided yet.It's up to you though what you think and if this is your type of movie. I was in Chicago when Neil Marshall was promoting this movie and got to sit in on a Q&A with him at a convention. It seemed he did a lot of research and knew what he was talking about in regards to Roman history and the occupation of Britain. So maybe I missed something.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Superb action film. Likable characters.,"This is a film I can watch again and again. A good fast pace, characters you can care about, and fantastic scenery, beautifully filmed. Having some military experience I thought the 'gung-ho' mindset (and foul language) of the troops was plausible. The Roman Army was a brutal killing machine in it's time, and they had enormous self-belief. I think that is reflected well by the characters, particularly by Fassbender's Centurion character. He is a political fanatic, devoted to his nation/ cause. You could put him in a Soviet or German uniform in WW2 quite easily. Yet somehow, his humanity survives beneath the exterior. The film combines the historical/ war genre with the chase/ survival genre, mixed with military camaraderie and even a love angle. I recommend this film. A big screen, beer and pizza are not essential 'viewing aids', but they don't do any harm either!",9.0,Anonymous,History
A Recommendable Film,"You don't see too many movies within this time period and setting, and very few involving Ancient Rome to begin with. Overall, this movie was great to watch, though it was more on the entertainment aspect (there weren't too many historical errors either, which is something I really pay attention to). The reasoning behind giving it a 7-star review is the fact that some of the scenes are just sort of awkward, with unusual transitions or something of the sort. Acting-wise, I felt that it had a great selection of cast members, especially Liam Cunningham (I loved his part playing Davos Seaworthy in the HBO series based on A Song of Ice and Fire)! And of course, how can anyone forget Michael Fassbender?

I call BS on the whole movie,"First off the timing is completely wrong. The governor they claim at the time, had been dead for over ten years, the ninth has been discovered to have been in Germany when defeated, and picts are not full size Viking like warriors, they are short Pygmy type people. I need go no further for accuracy as there is none. The movie itself was good, if you don't get too technical. While I am of the reality type where women are physically weaker than men, because they are, I really like the blonde archer who seemed to enjoy the fight. The movie over all was good for having a bunch of ""Q"" listers for a cast. The king of the picts was a waste, he didn't even personally go after the guys who killed his like 9 year old son, instead sending a tongueless woman to do his dirty work. The whole thing stinks of political correctness, women who could kick larger men's asses, the one black guy in the whole movie, on and on.",,Anonymous,History

If they had spent more time developing the story and characters, than try to do an LOTR-esque scenic overview of mountains, valleys, hills, it would have been great.

Routine but enjoyable movie focused on Roman legion,"I thought this was a good action and adventure movie loosely based on ancient history about a legion of Roman soldiers manning a remote outpost who end up being overrun by their doggedly determined enemies the Picts.The movie moves along at a quick pace, with good if bloody action pieces at various intervals. One thing that was annoying is the overuse of CGI blood effects which made the sword fighting action look a bit corny with blood spurts being too cartoon like and happening too often to take seriously.The best aspect is the agreeable acting of the small group of men who must band together to try and overcome steep odds in their quest. Competent acting performances by the character actors give the movie some unexpected dramatic heft and substance. The ending of the movie ends up being a stereotypical disappointment, but on the whole a diverting enough experience to get there.",7.0,Anonymous,History

""" You have died well Roman!   Strength and Honor are Yours ""","After years of painstaking research and planning, Neil Marshall finally gave Audiences this finish Movie called "" Centurion. "" The original working title was called ' The Ninth Legion. ' But whatever the title then or now, the Finish product is a marvelous achievement. The story for the purposes of this exceptional film, is recalled by the last surviving member of the Legendary Ninth, Centurion Quintus Dias (Michael Fassbender) who relates to the audience what he remembers of the historical confrontation. Returning to the Land of the Picts, the entire legion of Three Thousand men is brutally attacked and decimated until only a token force of some twenty men are left alive, Then with the discipline of the Roman Legionnaire, they are left with no choice but to try and return to their own lines. The movie is as historical accurate as stated in the scrolls and to that end, the audience is given as much drama as possible. Too gory for some, others believe it wasn't brutal enough. Whichever take you give it, it does establish itself as one of the finest action movies since 'Gladiator.' The beautiful costumes and spacious panoramic landscapes are beautifully breathtaking and every battle scene is given a sober dialog. Indeed, the cast members which include, Andreas Wisniewski, Dave Legeno, Ulrich Thomsen and especially Olga Kurylenko, give a auspicious performance. This is one of those movies which in time will be sought after as a great Classic. To that end I for one easily recommend it for the true Collector. ****",9.0,Anonymous,History

A very gory action adventure...,"This is another take on the legend of the Ninth Legion of Rome. They disappeared in mysterious circumstances when fighting the Picts (Scots) during the time of the Roman occupation of Britain. It's quite an exciting tale with a lot of blood, guts and gore along the way. Although it's far from perfect, I quite liked it for its fast pace and some excellent fight scenes.The Ninth Legion, lead by General Titus Flavius Virilus are sent north to wipe out the troublesome Picts lead by the fearsome Gorlacon. Amongst their number is Centurion Quintus Dias, who has been posted to the region and knows the type of enemies they will face. They also have a Pict tracker in the shape of the mute Etain, she possesses great skill when it comes to finding the enemy. The Legion is ambushed and almost all are slaughtered, but a handful remain alive and try at first to rescue their captured General and then try to get back south to safety. With the Picts hot on their trail and the elements and terrain against then, can they survive long enough to make it home.This film obviously didn't have a huge budget, but considering the limited resourced they had, I think it wasn't a bad effort. A decent cast was lead by Michael Fassbender as Centurion Quintus Dias, with Dominic West as General Titus Flavius Virilus, David Morrissey as Bothos, Ulrich Thomsen as Gorlacon, Olga Kurylenko as Etain, Liam Cunningham as Brick and Imogen Poots (great name!) as Arianne. All did a good job in, what must have been very trying circumstances.The plot is quite fast and exciting with some great fight sequences and a few edge-of-your-seat moments. All this was very good and I was enjoying the chase with a nice little dose of betrayal and intrigue thrown in. Unfortunately about two thirds of the way through all the momentum is lost when the surviving few stop to lick their wounds at the house of an outcast. Although an attempt is made to regain some of the lost inertia, it fails to reach the same level. While I thought this section could have bee shorter to help the pacing, I still thought it was a pretty good film. It has a 15 certificate here in the UK which surprised me a little given the level of violence depicted. But over all, a decent enough film (with a few reservations) Recommended (just).My Score: 7.1/10",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Low budget, badly written tripe","This film couldn't even be saved by its action sequences.

The cast did remarkably well considering the rubbish they were having to work with.The screenplay required several scenes of thousands of extras, but as I mentioned it didn't have the budget for them... and it was left to the boys in the editing suite to try to disguise the lack of cast. They failed.The fight scenes were poor, they consisted of lots and lots of one or two moves of a fight before a cut which were then spliced together, to give the impression of quality action... wrong! It just looks cheap and and gave me the impression the editing department was having to work too hard.They spent quite a lot of their meagre budget on that special effect ""bright red blood splatter"". Just for the record, if you get cut by a knife through your clothes it doesn't produce projectile bright red blood sprays... particularly at night in the dark.

The real fate of the IX Legio,"The real fate of the 9-th is not known, however, although it was indeed present in Britain just before Hadrian wall was built there, it is now believed by most scholars that it was later transferred to the east of the empire, which was a much more important part to the romans than Britain. The fact is that names of several high officers of the Ninth who cannot have served earlier than the alleged destruction of the ninth in Britain, are noted in later references, is clear indication that the legion was not destroyed but transferred. It may have been destroyed some 15 years later, during the Jewish revolt of Simon ben Kosiba (132-136) in which several others Roman legions were wipe-out too, the revolt in which almost half of an entire roman army was involved and eventually, was crushed by General Julius Severus fromBritain, has also put to the end the name Judea, replacing it by Syria Palaestina, which two thousand years later, claimed by the new arrivals: the Palestinians, as their ancient homeland.",,Anonymous,History
Another entertaining effort from ever reliable Neil Marshall.,"The director continues his successful string of titles - ""Dog Soldiers"", ""The Descent"", and ""Doomsday"" - with this stylish take on an old myth. Michael Fassbender, engaging as always, plays Quintus, a centurion with the Roman Army in 117 A.D. who survives an attack on his fort and subsequently takes part in a mission to eliminate the savage warriors known as the Picts. However, the troops get overwhelmed in unfamiliar territory, and Quintus and a select few others make it out alive, intent on rescuing their general (Dominic West) who was captured by the enemy. What Marshall does here is just dive head first into the action, getting any exposition out of the way as quickly as possible, easing us into more character oriented scenes as the story progresses. And the characters are a solidly entertaining bunch, with the effective twist that one of the main antagonists here is a female, the animal like warrior Etain, played by model / actress Olga Kurylenko, who's quite good in the part. The scenery is extremely breathtaking, with superb widescreen photography, and a colour style that mostly avoids brighter colours. This creates a wonderful visual contrast when the Roman troops are besieged by fireballs; the yellow & orange looks great amid the muted blues & greys, etc. The action is respectably intense, with a lot of digital blood spilled as various combatants brutalize each other. Fassbender is well supported by a cast including JJ Feild, David Morrissey, Liam Cunningham, and Noel Clarke as his comrades, as well as the lovely and appealing Imogen Poots as Arianne, ostracized from her fellow Picts, Ulrich Thomsen as Pict leader Gorlacon, and veterans Paul Freeman (""Raiders of the Lost Ark"") as Governor Agricola, Andreas Wisniewski (""The Living Daylights"", ""Die Hard"") as Commander Gratus, and Michael Carter (""An American Werewolf in London"", ""Return of the Jedi"") as General Antoninus. The story here is pretty simple, but efficiently told and the movie does illustrate some of the horrors of war and fleshes out its characters as much as it can while still maintaining its basic visceral appeal. And the fact that it's inspired by history, when the 9th Legion of the Roman Army vanished in Hibernia, is intriguing and may make a viewer want to do a bit of reading on the subject. Overall, it shows once again Marshall's ability to craft good crowd pleasing diversions with a nice amount of pizazz. Seven out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Keeps surprising you,"117 A.D. Rome wants Britain, but it looks like that won't happen. The Picts are holding on to it hard, with guerrilla warfare, that the legions were not used to. But maybe one last attack can do it. The spirited, short-tempered General Virilus(West, clearly enjoying himself) who is part of, not only leading, his own platoon is sent out, and on the way, he meets Centurion Dias(Fassbender, determined and somewhat brooding, without being dull and grating). Though aided by the mute, excellent tracker Etain(Kurylenko, her entire performance via body language and facial expressions, and shining), they soon find themselves on the run. Can they possibly escape alive?A fast-paced 90 minutes(94 with credits) of chase film with frequent fight scenes - every time you think you know what's going to happen next, you're stunned by where it goes instead. The battles are chaotic without us losing track of basically what's going on, and, like the rest of this, brutal, intense and realistic(except for the ending, where some Hollywood creeps in, and some of the moral grey areas are moved towards being black and white). The dry, macho humor/dialog feel endemic to the soldier environment, and the fleshed out characters(yes, that includes the ""villains"") are consistent in their behaviour. One can almost feel the frostbite and hypothermia shooting on location in the harsh nature led to through the screen. This is a compelling take on what might have happened to the historical group. The sparse narration doesn't really add anything, and comes across as a late addition by a producer who worried audiences wouldn't get what had just been established if our protagonist didn't briefly monologue about it.In addition to what I've already mentioned, this contains a lot of strong language including non-graphic descriptions of disturbing sexual situations. The DVD comes with 8 minutes of good deleted scenes, 6 and a half minutes of hit and miss outtakes, a fine 4 minute featurette, and trailers for Buried, Saw 3D, Get Low, 22 Bullets, Micmacs, The kids are all right and this.

Nothing extraordinary but enjoyable adventure film,"Acceptable adventure film of the sword and sandals genre, set in Roman Britain, has some Roman soldiers, survivors from a massacre against the bloody Pict tribes, fleeing behind enemy lines. Historically dubious (the ragtag platoon includes, seemingly for PC reasons and ludicrously from a historical point of view, a black roman soldier), this violent and bloody, muscular and masculine film is, for all its flaws, certainly entertaining. I found this better and more enjoyable than the recent, similarly themed Eagle of the Ninth. The pristine, misty Scottish outdoors where this movie was filmed certainly helps. Acting is not the main point of this movie, as the actors have to put up with some terse, rough lines. Michael Fassbender, who was fine in the more recent X-Men film, fails to make much of an impression here as the top Roman soldier here, but Ukrainian model Olga Kurylenko, is surprisingly OK as the top warrioress of the Picts.",7.0,Anonymous,History

His character is Lovable and enjoyable. So all in all not to bad acting.The movie is very violent and not for the queasy, but the action is very well executed, and doesn't seem unnecessary, it seems to perfectly get the pint across that the Picts are a brutal merciless group of people.

Don't expect another Gladiator...,"This film has been sitting on my shelf for over a year now unwatched. Yesterday, I finally sat down and watched 'Centurion' with no great expectations, I was just wanting to watch a film.The film is very good, the story works well without romanticising the Romans too much and portrays the Picts very well also.The acting in this film was great for the most part, especially by Dominic West who had too small a role, his humorous character provides a lot of comic relief from gory battle scenes and he was probably my favourite character. Michael Fassbender's role was amicable, he succeeded in certain aspects of his character such as the warrior in him but failed at portraying himself as a leader. As a fan of Michael's work. his acting was very good in this but not as great as he has been in other films. However, some actors like Noel Clarke (who was simply playing Noel Clarke) let the film down in certain scenes. Even Olga Kurylenko was good despite her character not saying one word throughout the entire film! Imogen Poots' brief appearance is also welcomed with a very realistic Scottish accent - as a Scottish person myself, there's nothing more fun than laughing at an actor's poor attempts at the accent but Imogen did her's very well and there was nothing to laugh at!The script can be quite predictable at some points which isn't necessarily a bad thing but you would like a little surprise here and there that isn't through the use of over the top gore. The gore in this film is the main problem I have. I certainly don't mind gore in films but it should be used when needed, not added in to places in fight scenes where, realistically, there would not be such a splash of blood!Overall, I would recommend this film if you are just wanting a good old-fashioned war film, but don't expect Gladiator because there are very few points in this film where you are moved emotionally. The film tries its best to be Gladiator-like (with dramatic music, slow motion fight scenes and tiny incidents of tragedy) but I think if it focused more on the film itself it would have been better.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Way too bloody.,"For me the blood and gore over shadows the rest of the film. I simply had a hard time watching this thing with all the squib work and excessive gore and blood splatters.Well shot, there was some cliché acting and story telling involved. The story itself seems to be recycled material from King Arthur with lots of blood, which to me says that the target demographic was probably misread to cater to a more bloodthirsty audience, which probably wasn't all that blood thirsty in the first place, but perhaps more interested in seeing ""realistic action"". Blood gushing from bodies is not realistic.I'm sorry to say that for all the high production values that went into this film the realism gets tossed out the window, and is replaced with pornographic blood letting. Regrettable, but there it is. It seems like five minutes don't go by without someone getting hacked up and spilling a gallon of blood. Is that real? No.The acting is a bit melodramatic, but fits with pacing and overall film. Even so I'd be hard put to call it likable.I guess the best way to sum up this film is that it will appeal to those who have a thirst for grotesque hack-and-slash violence, but not much more. There's nary a love story, little of the politics of the time, little true realism (even little grittiness, as everyone seems very clean, save when they fight), but the film does deliver on incredibly high production values. Watching the deleted scenes one wonders why the first scene in the collection wasn't added (in spite of the director's commentary), because the film needed a few contemplative moments.If you want a true Roman sword and sandal epic, then look elsewhere, though if you're a die hard fan of the genre, then you may want to add this to your collection (which I may begrudgingly do... but more likely not).Not really a film I would recommend.Definitely watch at your own risk.",,Anonymous,History

But while The Descent 2 was so faithful it was almost a remake, Centurion too is eerily similar in many respects.OK so this is set in ancient Rome and not a cave = different, but let's keep going; The Descent – 6 people are isolated by circumstances and beset by enemies.Centurion – 7 people are isolated by circumstances and beset by enemies.The Descent – While on the run one of the party suffers a graphic broken leg.Centurion – Ditto.The Descent – The leaders of the attackers are vicious and unintelligible.Centurion – Ditto.The Descent – To escape one of the survivors willingly and perhaps unnecessarily sacrifices another.Centurion – Ditto.OK one similarity = fair enough, 2? = pushing it But 4 key plot details practically the same and it reeks either of a lack of inspiration or laziness.Centurion follows a small band of Roman soldiers isolated from the main army and caught deep in enemy territory. It is very violent but obviously CGI assisted – this is starting to reduce the visceral impact for me when pinkish blood spurts out in blatantly computerised fashion – and features a couple of good original scenes, but there is just too many similarities that remind you of a former – and much, much better – movie.Even if you are ripping yourself off it still is a little dishonest. The use of supposed rebel hottie fighters is excusable except for the fact that they really only get into one stoush, hard to justify just how awesome they are if they take on an enemy in lesser numbers.There are some sweeping vistas and exciting camera-work that reminded me a lot of the Lord of the Rings in terms of scenery, but the comparisons ended there.If you want to watch a movie about a small group attempting to elude vicious assailants rent The Descent, better yet buy it.If you want to watch the same thing only nowhere near as good you might check this out. Just let it be known that if Neil Marshall lived in the US he might be named Zack Snyder, whether you think that is a good thing or not is up to you.Final Rating – 5.5 / 10. Neil Marshall keeps coming up with fanboy-friendly plots and settings, but it seems he left the best of his ideas behind in The Descent. One more chance Mr Marshall.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Could have been great.,"Anything with 'women warriors' is immediately corny.This movie made the same mistake as every other film made in the last 2 decades - being forced to inject 'diversity'.Even in contemporary times - with all the technological advancements - all standards must be dropped to allow women to pretend.2000 years ago? When brawn dictated all?It's instant 'suspension of disbelief repellent'.They might as well have inserted flying turtles.I'm giving it a 6 because everything else about it is high quality, and it was made before Hollywood should have learned better.If you're a brain dead egalitarian - this movie will probably be an 8 for you.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Entertaining,"6.4 is too low for this movie. In my opinion it is easily a solid 7 if not a tad higher.I had never heard of this movie so I watched it with no expectations on netflix.If you like the sword and sandals genre you will love this movie.It is very violent. The action scenes are great and very gruesome. I would imagine though that war is always gruesome and especially so in this time.It also interesting that Neal Marshall is responsible for this. Just found out about that aspect of it. He also brought us ""The Descent"" which was another very good movie that surprised me. I see he also made ""Dog Soldiers"" which I'm going to watch in a bit.If the review seems thin, well I don't like spoilers, and while I will talk about a movie in general I normally refuse to give away any movie details.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Rubbish,I stumbled on this movie as I'm a fan of this sort of genre but this was abysmal. I switched it off and read a few reviews that were praising it...so I thought I would give it another try. That lasted about 5 minutes.It's just awful. Trying to mix bits of comedy in a film like this I feel is vile. You had one actor Jeremy somebody? That was laughably bad. It was almost like he was in a soap like Corrie or something with his over acting. Literally none of it looked believable.Unlike movies of similar standing ie Gladiator or Brave heart et all you felt something for the characters. But this? I wanted them all to get killed and as quick as possible.I would say avoid at all costs but what's the point most audiences like this new comedy gore crap.,2.0,Anonymous,History
Some Historical issues,"The film is set in Roman Britain in 117AD when the Romans are having their usual problems with the Picts in Scotland. The hero. Having escaped from the captivity of the picts, joins the 9th legion at York. The legion are ordered to destroy the picts but they are ambushed in a forest. A small group of survivors led by our Centurian hero, are unsuccessful in rescuing the legion commander and are subsequently chased by the picts throughout Scotland.I would like to deal with the historical accuracy. The 9th legion was possibly lost in Scotland but it was not ordered there by the Governor Julius Agricola. He had left Britian about 30 years earlier after defeating the tribes in Scotlan. Hadrians wall was certainly not commenced immediately. The Roman forts would have been built surrounded by a deep ditch. The ditches were missing from these forts. The legion would have been accompanied by a large force of auxillaries. These were absent.However it was an enjoyable albeit bloodthirsty, action romp.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Do not look for history,"This movie is pure fantasy, with very little connection to history.Yes, there was a Ninth Legion that was stationed in Britain. It disappeared from Roman records, but there is no evidence that it suffered the fate depicted in this move. There is no evidence that the makers of this movie cared about history at all.The equipment was wrong. The Roman legionary on the march carried his kit suspended by a forked wooden pole over the shoulder, not a spear. He did carry one or two pilum, throwing javelins made of soft metal and a wooden haft, so that when thrown it would deform and not be thrown back by the enemy.The tactics were wrong. The legionary fought with shield and gladius, a short sword used for stabbing, not slashing. What made the legions so effective was that the soldiers fought in close order, highly disciplined. The barbarians fought as individuals, slashing and flailing, not legionaries... except in this movie.The premise of the plot is a total flight of fancy. It is chock full of predictable elements seen in countless movies. I highly recommend that you instead watch ""Northwest Passage"" (1940) for a gripping drama of a military expedition that faces disaster. Then watch ""Centurion"".I give the movie a 2 instead of only a 1 because at least technically it is well made.",2.0,Anonymous,History
"""I don't know about you, but I'm tired of running"".","Film-maker Neil Marshall kicked off his career with two outstanding low- budget horror films; ""Dog Soldiers"" and ""The Descent"". Quite a promising start. Then followed ""Doomsday"", which got a mixed response. I enjoyed it, but it's nothing more than an outrageous homage to post-apocalyptic films like ""Escape to New York"" and the ""Mad Max"" series. So his fourth outing would see Marshall tackle a swords and sandals revenge pursuit on the frontier of the Roman Empire in ""Centurion"". It's a gritty and brutal tale of survival and courage, where Rome's invasion of northern Britain hit's a bump when they encounter the guerrilla tactics of the tribal enemy the Picts. There's something about it that looks epic thanks to its crisp, sweeping photography, but its minimalist story telling makes sure it doesn't quite complement it. The narrative is a fast-paced, cross-country chase of rugged action and bloody onslaughts amongst beautiful highland scenery. Where the terrain is just as harsh and unforgiving, as the Roman's enemy. I think it loses shape and momentum after the hour mark and the heavy-handed script gives us the usual character arches, but Marshall's stylish verve is slick and taut. The battle scenes are executed in a spectacular manner, where it's a barrage of relentless and gusty combat. Michael Fassbender leads the way as a man looking for redemption and Olga Kurylenko makes an impression as a Pict warrior. Also Dominic West pops up. Simple, but effective action romp that for most part doesn't let up and is masterfully framed.""This is a new kind of war"".",7.0,Anonymous,History
A potent combination of historical speculation and gonzo violence,"While there isn't too much depth to the plot or characters, CENTURION is a passable period action film about what might have happened to Rome's 9th Legion. The cast is led by Michael Fassbender as the titular centurion, Quintas Dias, and has Dominic West as a Roman general and Bond girl Olga Kurylenko as a mute Pict warrior. Overall, the performances are decent but nothing truly amazing. Some of the highlights of the film were creative opening titles, some beautiful, blue-tinged cinematography and a rousing score. However, the biggest draw are the action sequences and Neil Marshal really delivered in the blood-and-guts department. Limbs are hacked off, people are stabbed and shot with arrows, and blood flowed freely. The only downside to this aspect of the film was the way in which they were shot, i.e., similar to GLADIATOR and other movies like that. If one were to compare this movie to another one, I would pick KING ARTHUR because of the time period and subject matter. Even the plots are similar. But despite the similarities, I would think CENTURION edges out KING ARTHUR by a little bit because it isn't aspiring to be some epic origin story. This movie is fairly basic and knows it. There's even a half-baked romantic subplot, which isn't even introduced until the movie is half over. So, if you're looking for a decent action movie that won't tax your brain too much, this one should do just fine.",7.0,Anonymous,History

I know he's a man of the people and likes going to festivals doing Q$As so i'm hoping he reads these reviews........please don't ever do a British gangster movie, you, Ridley Scott, Danny Boyle etc are our only hope for a decent film industry over here.Having said that with this film although i loved it like i knew i would being a Scotsman i was a bit confused as to whom i should be cheering on!. Its always been a great bit of Scottish pride knowing we were the only country they couldn't invade and for that reason i was all for the Picts. On the other hand the characters were engaging and you couldn't help wishing them to safety.....its kind of like watching the battle of the bulge from the Germans point of view.Anyway its a good solid movie well worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Solid sword & sandal flick with hints of greatness,"""Centurion"" takes place circa 117-122 AD in Great Britain and speculates the fate of the Roman 9th Legion, which disappeared at the time and remains a mystery to this day.PLOT: Seven legion survivors of a surprise Pictish attack go into enemy territory to retrieve their general (Dominic West). The legionnaires then go deeper into the wilderness to escape the vengeance of the Picts with the intention of looping back around. Unfortunately for them, the Picts have an expert tracker on hand; a mute woman with whom the Romans are quite familiar.ANALYSIS: Michael Fassbender is outstanding as the leader of the remaining legionnaires, Quintus Dias, while Olga Kurylenko is effective as the vengeful Pict tracker, Etain, and Imogen Poots shines as an outcast in the wilderness, Arianne.The scenery of the film is breathtaking, shot on location in England and Scotland, whilst the pace is brisk at a mere 97 minutes. The latter reveals the weakness of the film as this is definitely a tale that would've worked better at 2 hours minimum. Although there are some quality character-defining sequences and near-epic moments, the film needed more. As it is, it's kind of a blur, but still very worthwhile. The score's quite good as well.BOTTOM LINE: ""Centurion"" is reminiscent of 2004's ""King Arthur,"" as far as story, location and overall tone go. The main difference is that the events in ""King Arthur"" take place 350 years later and involve the legendary Arthur as a Roman warrior. ""Centurion,"" by contrast, occurs when Hadrian's Wall was just starting to materialize. Both films are worthwhile to sword & sandal devotees, but ""King Arthur"" ultimately plays better due to its longer runtime and therefore more characterization and epic-ness.Be sure to catch 2011's ""The Eagle,"" which is essentially the (unofficial) sequel to ""Centurion"" where the son of the general of the 9th legion ventures into the Pictish wilderness with a Briton slave to regain the 9th legion's gold eagle standard. ""The Eagle"" is less Hollywoodized, has a much better first act and is all-around more realistic, but ""Centurion"" is more conventionally entertaining, has important female characters and a superior last act.GRADE: B+*** SPOILERS FOLLOW***One reviewer complained that the film fails to provide conventional protagonists: How can you root for the Romans when they're the invading army who were responsible for raping Etain when she was a girl, killing her parents, and cutting out her tongue? In addition, at least one legionnaire is revealed to be a total scumbag. But then it's hard to root for the Picts since Etain is so bitter and vengeful, plus the Picts are pretty much portrayed as the antagonists to the remaining members of the 9th legion.I would argue that the film encourages us to disregard political loyalties (Roman, Pict or otherwise) and root for the persons worthy of rooting for. In this case, Quintus Dias and Arianne (the ""witch""). Why? Because they both prove to have hearts of gold, which is one of the reasons they're so drawn to each other, beyond the physical attraction.As for the film's message, it's driven home at the end: Big government is not worthy of your absolute loyalty and service because they'll throw you to the wolves in a second if it serves their purposes. (Government in general is good and necessary but big government is intrinsically untrustworthy and harmful, i.e. evil).",7.0,Anonymous,History
Marshall takes a stab at medieval fantasy,"Probably a ""better"" movie than Doomsday, though not as fun, and certainly nowhere near the high quality of The Descent, which may probably be the only masterpiece Neil Marshall's got. All the same, it's some bloody good action for the most part, and Olga Kurylenko by proxy of a character literally tongue-less doesn't have the kind of poor acting she had in Quantum of Solace. Also, Michael Fassbender is always made of win. As is lots of gore and violence, sans the CG blood.All this said - after seeing Marshall direct the episode of Game of Thrones in season 2, where the battle happens at the Lannister castle... I forgive this film some of its problems as it served as a 'trial' run for Marshall's best direction yet. If nothing else, Centurion is an interesting film to see the seeds of what would come in mastering that kind of wild, heart-felt and action-packed style of direction.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Centurion,"The eponymous ""Quintus"" (Michael Fassbender) is struggling through the snow to escape the menacing Picts who have just ambushed and destroyed his outpost. He has to get the message to ""Gen. Virilus"" (Dominic West) before the whole of Britain is overrun by these warlike people. That man commands the ninth legion, and en masse they head north into the perilous wilderness - guided by ""Etain"" (Olga Kurylenko) - to seek vengeance. Further into enemy territory they go before betrayal and disaster befalls them. Only ""Quintus"" and a few of his colleagues manage to escape. Can they make it to Hadrian's Wall and safety? The photography is good in this film, the Scottish scenery is shown off in all it's glory, hostility and bleakness as the men strive to outrun their enemy and reach safety. The rest of it, though, is all rather disappointing. Neither the acting nor the writing is really up to very much, and with the possible exception of rather adept with a blade ""Tarak"" (Riz Ahmed) and his extremely fast-acting dead cap mushrooms, the whole thing is just a bit clunky and slow with too much score. The combat effects are generally quite good, though, and at times it has an authentic brutality to it, but neither Fassbender nor West are really in their element and I felt it seemed a great deal longer than 100 minutes. I like the genre and I have seen much worse, but given this must have had a decent budget this could have been better with just a little less prattle, some better casting and a bit more action.",6.0,Anonymous,History
very gruesomely good,"Quite good actually. One should know what to expect from a film, I expected decent historical portrayal of how cruel and dangerous life could be in Britain near the year 100, what being a Roman soldier there was like, a bit about Picts being fearsome fighters, and some gory, untamed fighting scenes. I got all that, plus a convincing Kurylenko in a mute role... One should not expect a brilliant script in a film like this, sure there were minor complaints to be made: Kurylenko's character was supposedly an experienced warrior but she apparently had no clue how to attack a fort or a village defended by only 3 men..., Picts' leader's son is killed by Romans yet he sends only a handful of Picts after them with a woman in charge??.. Well, it seems to be headed for a sequel, with the hero living in a hut with the hot witch, she getting killed by the Picts and our hero on a revenge quest and all... or something like that.

Ancient Rome as victim .,"Strange movie depicting a nation so remote their name was unknown to a mighty empire .Invaders as heroes and natives as insurgents (sound familiar ? ) Here is a quote attributed to Calgacus the Pictish leader : Whenever I consider the origin of this war and the necessities of our position, I have a sure confidence that this day, and this union of yours, will be the beginning of freedom to the whole of Britain. To all of us slavery is a thing unknown; there are no lands beyond us, and even the sea is not safe, menaced as we are by a Roman fleet. And thus in war and battle, in which the brave find glory, even the coward will find safety. Former contests, in which, with varying fortune, the Romans were resisted, still left in us a last hope of succour, inasmuch as being the most renowned nation of Britain, dwelling in the very heart of the country, and out of sight of the shores of the conquered, we could keep even our eyes unpolluted by the contagion of slavery. To us who dwell on the uttermost confines of the earth and of freedom, this remote sanctuary of Britain's glory has up to this time been a defence. Now, however, the furthest limits of Britain are thrown open, and the unknown always passes for the marvellous. But there are no tribes beyond us, nothing indeed but waves and rocks, and the yet more terrible Romans, from whose oppression escape is vainly sought by obedience and submission. Robbers of the world, having by their universal plunder exhausted the land, they rifle the deep. If the enemy be rich, they are rapacious; if he be poor, they lust for dominion; neither the east nor the west has been able to satisfy them. Alone among men they covet with equal eagerness poverty and riches. To robbery, slaughter, plunder, they give the lying name of empire; they make a solitude and call it peace.

Much more interesting than other similar (but more famous) films.,"This film is based on the mysterious disappearance of IX Legio Hispana, one of the Roman legions. We know that it remained a long time in Britain but it's disappearance from the records without any mention has elicited several speculations. This is precisely what this film does, creating a story where it takes advantage of the best known hypothesis for this disappearance: the massacre of this legion in combat. Many classicists disagree with this theory and you can find enough specialized literature on the subject by the hand of the most notable historians, but the fact is that the story created for this film is plausible, which helps to create a pleasant sense of historical accuracy, with some understandable yields when dramatic effect or pragmatic issues prevailed. One of the things that caught my attention was the crystalline similarity between the battle represented in the film and the disastrous Battle of the Teutoburg Forest, where General Varo lost his life and his legions in the time of Augustus. It was, in fact, a good action sequence, with touches of realism that only sinned by the exaggeration, of fake blood used.The cast was very good. Michael Fassbender was very convincing in the role of a centurion, who survives the carnage and tries to return. Less happy was the idea of making each of the surviving soldiers come from a region of the empire. We have already seen this cliché previously, I believe it was used in the 2004 movie ""King Arthur"" but I may be wrong (I'm speaking from my fallible memory). Anyway, the idea sounded false. Dominic West, Ulrich Thomsen and Imogen Poots also did a good job but it was the sweeping performance of Olga Kurylenko who dominated the film. She played an extremely cruel and malicious Pictish woman who decided to dedicate her life to avenge herself on the Romans. This barbarian killing machine was an intense enemy and contrasts with the humanity of Poots character, a woman with a past of pain, but kind and of whom we instinctively like.The production vallues and technical issues also seemed very good to me. In contrary to the current trend, the film virtually waived the green screen and filmed on location, which is a plus point. Action sequences and fights are good, realistic enough and only harmed, as I said, by exaggeration in false blood. It reminded me of the movie ""300"", where I criticized the emphasis on blood. Of course a battle needs blood but we cannot go into exaggerations, by excess or by defect. I really enjoyed the cinematography. She was able to convey the feel of the period as well as the intense cold that was felt. The color tones were excellent and the contrast adequate. The only negative note is the movie soundtrack. It fulfills its role but ends up being forgettable.To summarize, this film is very good and considerably better than other films (""Braveheart"", ""King Arthur"" etc.) in the same style, but that ended up becoming more famous and having greater visibility. Historically realistic, it doesn't depict any historical fact but a theory, under discussion, so don't fully believe in the story the film tells, remember this is not a documentary. Entertaining, is a good movie for those who enjoy history and the Roman period, or simply for those who enjoy a good adventure or action film.",9.0,Anonymous,History

The depiction of the Picts is laughable by the way if you know your history. The Romans;' in one scene you get the stereotypical politician and in another you get to the Syrian cook. Does this director know any history? I have to be honest and say I was looking forward to this. Perhaps, I expected too much. Regardless, avoid.

Thrilling historic fiction movie with a disappointing end,"Centurion by Neil Marshall is set in Ancient Britain during the Roman conquest and is very loosely based on some obscure historic facts. The movie follows the titular character, Quintus Dia (Michael Fassbender), who during one night in a camp gets captured by Picts, a vicious tribe that defiantly fights against Romans. However, he is soon rescued by a legion led by General Virilus (Dominic West). This victory does not lost long, because this legion soon gets ambushed by Picts. Most of the Romans are killed, the General gets captured, so a very small group of survivors has to fight its way through the harsh wilderness and evade a hunting party led by the ruthless mute Etain (Olga Kurylenko).The movie lacks any large-scale proportions and instead focuses on several characters. Dia, Bothos (David Morrissey) and Brick (Liam Cunningham) are the main characters, and most other characters die quite easily. Arianne (Imogen Poots) was originally supposed to be an important character with an interesting back-story, but that was changed and she is just a minor character in the movie. Although the fight scenes are mostly small and with only a few participants, they are extremely violent and gritty. You rarely get to see so much gore and blood in similar movies, so Centurion is unusual with its superbly done gore effects. People often get graphically stabbed with spears, swords or arrows and they sure do bleed a lot, which looks amazing and quite realistic.One of the best things in the movie is the beautiful scenery. The movie shows various landscapes of Britain, such as forests, plains, rivers, hills etc, which look breath-taking. There are even some scenes where the actors really run across some snowy mountains in the freezing weather. Filming all these landscapes must have been quite difficult and few film-makers would put so much effort in it.The ending is something I dislike greatly about this movie, since it's very anticlimactic. There is no big battle between Romans and Picts; instead the plot changes and the last few minutes of the movie are spent portraying the Romans as the bad guys (but not the main characters). Personally, I find this extremely disappointing and badly executed, so it's probably the weakest part of the movie.So, if you like gritty action scenes and movies about Ancient Rome, feel free to watch Centurion. Its ending is quite problematic and most of the scenes are relatively simple, but the movie does have many good moments.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Great movie,"I loved this movie...great action and history combined. Yes, the mystery of the 9th still remains debated but this is a great and believable theory and the historical representation is on point. I know people like to nit pick about various history flaws but as someone that studies ancient Rome I felt that the actor portrayals, fighting, even the gore were great representations. Keep in mind, Pictish peoples were so scary and brutal Rome built a wall to keep them back when they conquered and integrated everyone else. I like to watch The Eagle after this...diff movie, cast and director but really picks up years after Centurion and works great as a sequel. Seriously tho, this was a really good (and very underrated) movie.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Romans go home!,"I know I shouldn't, but I'm incapable of watching any form of media surrounding the Roman Empire without my mind recalling every quote from the classic Monty Python film, 'The Life of Brian.' There, they were depicted as buffoons and lampooned mercilessly. I guess the people of the numerous lands they conquered in real life wouldn't have agreed too much with the escapades of Biggus Diccus and his cohorts.'Centurion' is about the leader (Michael Fassbender) of a legion of doomed Roman troops, sent in to deal with the uprising locals in the north of England and, in particular, Scotland. Apparently, those Scots (or 'Picts' as they were really, back then) were dealing heavy losses to Roman battalions and something has to be done about it. Sadly, for most of Fassbender's party (and I'll keep calling him by the actor's name, seeing as every time I see a - supposedly - authentic Roman name of the period, I keep thinking it looks something like 'Naughtness Maximus!') they get completely wiped out, leaving just him and a handful of others on the run from a band of bloodthirsty locals.And there is plenty of blood. It's not for the faint-hearted and there are plenty of limbs being hacked off left, right and centre. It's primarily one long chase film with action set-pieces thrown in. And it's all good if that's what you're looking for. I'm no historian, so I can't tell you if every Roman infantry man's costume is 100% accurate, or whether this was what it was like back then. But it is a fairly decent action film.It's also well-directed, but then you'd expect that from Neil Marshall (the creative force behind such great little gems as 'Dog Soldiers, The Decent and Doomsday'). I would say that it's worth pausing while you're watching the film and ask yourself the question, 'Who are the 'real' good guys?' In 'Dog Soldiers' the werewolves were clearly the bad guys, then you had the monsters in 'The Decent' and the cannibal gangs in 'Doomsday.' Here, the Romans are clearly the underdogs, but, if you think about it, they are - technically - an invading and most unwelcome force in an occupied land, so are the Picts well within their rights to hack their heads off for fun?I read somewhere that it's based on a true story. And when I say 'true' I mean in 'Hollywood terms,' i.e. there was a sort of account of something that happened that might be a bit like this and this film is one way that events COULD have unfolded. Anyway, it's still good fun. Although there are a few other actors in the film you may recognise from this or that, Fassbender is the only one that you'll remember (unless you count the mute psychotic lady Pict with her blue war-paint sent to dispatch him - I certainly wouldn't mess with her!).There's a - pretty superfluous - love interest thrown in there, but it doesn't impact too much on the action and the gore. It's a fun little period action film that is definitely entertaining. Just try not to think of 'The Life of Brian' too much and shouting 'Bl**dy Romans!' too much at the screen while you watch it!",7.0,Anonymous,History

A good movie for Family above 8,"I have to say that I agree with ""westenicho"" and that users comments about user ""Russ-was-here"" comments. I do not see anywhere in the film makers write ups where it states this is a factual presentation, maybe based on historical events which means they could take one battle form one area and supplant it in another. So if you want a 100% factual representation of the time, this is not for you, what it is, is a great entertaining movie and factual enough to believe the characters and their trials and tribulations. I think the acting was superb and as much as it is not a movie for the Oscars, it is an entertaining movie for family, Sc-Fi, Historical, Roman, History, and Ancient U.K. and surrounds history. Not enough gore so as your 8 year old could not watch but enough so this 53 year old male could enjoy. So watch it for what it is, a tale of long ago and the way things where as seen by the writers and directors whom I thank for bring this film to my lounge room. The scenery is great as well as costumes (even if they are not 100% factual), just a great entertaining movie, worth watching.

Irredeemable,"My husband is taking it back to video store right now to ensure we get $1 credit, we both hated it so much.

Reasonably entertaining pseudo-historical actioner but don't expect big battles,"I still haven't figured out if I'm a fan of Neil Marshall. I love 'The Descent' and 'Dog Soldiers' to bits, but neither 'Doomsday' or 'Centurion' really hit the mark for me. Neither of them were *bad* but neither really got far above average either.The first thing mention is that if you're looking for big battles involving hundreds of extras or thousands of CGI characters, look elsewhere. One might expect that a film specifically about the loss of the mythical Roman ninth legion to the warrior tribes of Scotland would involve some kind of grand scale clash, but there's no such thing offered here. Centurion is about a handful of survivors from the legion fleeing across the bleak highland mountains while group of vengeful Picts pursues them and picks them off one by one. At it's core it's very similar to a backwoods slasher type flick such as Wrong Turn or Deliverance.It's an entertaining enough scenario though, and Michael Fassbender and Olga Kurylenko put in fine performances as the principle adversaries. The films moves along at a good old click and there's not much time to get bored.There are two things that Centurion does in droves, though, that I personally don't enjoy. The first is the use of a 45 degree shutter angle during every action scene to give it that 'hyper kinetic' look that Spielberg introduced us to in Saving Private Ryan (where it worked) and Ridley Scott followed up with in Gladiator (where it barely worked). But Marshall, as talented as he is, is no Spielberg or Scott, and the hyper kinetics in Centurion yanked me out of the movie every time an action scene began. It's a big shame because otherwise the action was pretty well choreographed and satisfyingly violent.The second thing I don't like (and there is NO movie where this technique works) is CGI bloodletting. Centurion strives to go one step further than, say, Braveheart in the brutality of its combat. Limbs and heads go flying left right and center. It's perhaps not quite as over the top as ""Ironclad"" but it's close. The dude in me likes this of course, but give me blood bags and prosthetics any day. The CGI blood and dismemberment of Centurion seemed simply unrealistic and distracting.Despite these two pet peeves of mine, Centurion is still a silly, fun flick that unashamedly eschews historical accuracy in favor of good old action entertainment. It could have been much, much better though - with a bit of a screenplay polish and more careful directing choices - so I can't in good conscience give it much more than a 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Decent enough.,"I will say right off the bat that I am not a historian, by any stretch of the imagination; however, I do have a liking for films that deal with most eras of history, especially the Roman Empire. With this in mind and my liking for Michael Fassbender, I decided to give this film a try.My overall consensus: this film was neither terrific or horrifically bad, but there were more bad aspects than good. One thing that rather grated on my nerves was the lack of character development. I understand that it is difficult to fully develop seven or so characters but having them tell their backstories in one scene seems almost like a pitiful attempt. Speaking of said scene, the only character who doesn't say anything about their past is Centurion Quintus. For being the main character, there really wasn't much of a reason to care for him.The first forty five minutes or so of the film are certainly the best. After that, it descends into a rather formulaic chase film, where characters are killed off left and right and all we can really do is shrug. The film also features a brief romantic subplot that is never really explored and truly feels unnecessary until the end of the film.The film wasn't without its positive aspects, however. For those who are fans of gory battle scenes, Centurion certainly delivers, featuring some good hack and slash battles with gratuitous blood involved. Michael Fassbender also does a decent enough job in his role, working with the script he had to become the only character I really cared about. Overall, if you are a fan of dubiously accurate historical films (like I am), then Centurion certainly isn't a waste of an hour and a half. If this isn't your preferred genre, then I'd recommend giving it a pass.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Violent and entertaining,"A pretty good cast - including Michael Fassbender and Dominic West - make this Roman epic a fun watch, even if it is also a very gory and violent one. There is blood everywhere.The premise of a small unit of soldiers cut off from their main force and pursued doggedly by the enemy through the bleak wintry countryside has been done before and probably done better all things being equal...but there are still some impressive battle sequences here, and no shortage of bodies piling up on either side.A few plot twists kept things interesting right to the end.You could do a lot worse than ""Centurion"" if you're after a Roman Empire-era action movie.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Men on the Run,"It is strange how two otherwise unrelated films on the same topic can sometimes suddenly appear within a short time of one another. In 1960, for example, there were two filmed biographies of Oscar Wilde, a writer whose life had never previously been the subject of a film, and in the early seventies two separate studios were, quite by chance, working on disaster movies about skyscrapers on fire. When they discovered the coincidence they decided to join forces and produce the film now known as ""The Towering Inferno"". More recently, 2009 saw two French biopics of the fashion designer Coco Chanel, ""Coco Chanel et Igor Stravinsky"" and ""Coco avant Chanel"".""Centurion"" is another example of the same phenomenon. It was one of two films from 2010/2011 about the massacre of the Ninth Legion in the early part of the second century AD, the other being ""The Eagle"". Historians of the Roman period are divided about the exact fate of this legion, but both films explore the theory that it was destroyed in battle with the Picts, the inhabitants of what was then known as Caledonia and today as the Scottish Highlands.The film is ostensibly set in AD 117, but there are several historical inaccuracies. The Roman governor of Britannia is named as ""Agricola""; there were two British governors of this name but the first, the famous Gnaeus Julius Agricola, had died in AD 93, and the second, Sextus Calpurnius Agricola, would not become governor until nearly fifty years after the events depicted here. The film also refers to Hadrian's Wall although construction of the wall did not begin until AD 122.Agricola fears that the warlike Picts are becoming a threat to the peace and stability of Britannia, so he sends the Ninth Legion under their commander Titus Flavius Virilus to subdue them. (The commander's cognomen is spelt as ""Virilus"" in the cast list, although the correct spelling should probably be ""Virilis"", meaning ""manly""). The Romans, however, are ambushed by the Picts; Virilus is captured and most of his soldiers killed. The film follows the adventures of a small group of survivors, including the title character Centurion Quintus Dias, as they attempt to make their way to safety through hostile territory.Neither ""Centurion"" nor ""The Eagle"" bears much resemblance to traditional Roman films like ""Ben-Hur"" or ""Spartacus"", or even modern ones like ""Gladiator"". They were made on a much lower budget, and on a much smaller scale than those grand epics. They do not deal with Kings and Emperors or with great, world-shattering events but rather with the lives of relatively humble individuals caught up in desperate power-struggles. Yet despite these resemblances there are also many differences between the two films.An important element in ""The Eagle"" is the close friendship which develops between the retired Roman officer Aquila and his British slave Esca, and the two, very different, men are well characterised by Channing Tatum and Jamie Bell. The characterisation in ""Centurion"" is much more perfunctory; neither Quintus not any of his companions emerge as rounded characters. The one memorable character is the mute British woman Etain who acts as the Legion's guide but who betrays them to the Picts. (Was, I wonder, Etain originally intended to be mute, or was this detail added at a later stage to disguise Olga Kurylenko's foreign accent?) Etain, however, is at the centre of the film's biggest plot hole. We learn that she is mute because the Romans, who have also murdered the rest of her family, have cut out her tongue, but it is never explained why Agricola and Virilus are so stupid as to entrust the safety of the Legion to a woman with such excellent reasons to hate the Roman empire and all it stands for.I must admit that I found ""The Eagle"", which is more than just an action-adventure, by far the better of the two films. It asks some pertinent questions about such concepts as imperialism, honour, freedom and friendship and about respect for alien cultures. ""Centurion"", by contrast, is a simple action thriller which avoids asking questions about deeper issues. The Roman occupation of Britain is simply used as the exotic backdrop to a basic men-on-the-run thriller plot which could equally well have been made about soldiers from any other war in history or, with a modern setting, about escaping prisoners or about a group of friends who have fallen foul of a gang of criminals. In ""Apocalypto"", Mel Gibson was able to endow a similar ""chase"" thriller in an exotic setting with a certain freshness and originality; Neil Marshall, unfortunately, is unable to perform the same service for ""Centurion"". 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,History
"If You Like Graphic, Bloody Violence This Movie Is For You","An over-extended Empire. Its troops stationed on the far frontier, not really understanding why they're there in a place they don't understand, don't care about and just want to get out of so that they can return home. An enemy that's simply relentless and will not give up. A politician who just wants to make a name for himself so that he can get back into the halls of power and isn't above covering up uncomfortable truths. It could be about the beginning of the end for any number of Empires throughout history - including the current American Empire. In that sense, I see this story as a sort of parable; a reflection of today's world put into a very different context. To that extent, it has some - some very little, mind you - point to it.The context of the movie is actually the Roman Empire, and Roman troops stationed and fighting on the extreme northern frontier of the Empire, in Britannia. It's before the construction of Hadrian's Wall, and the Ninth Legion is in Pict territory (basically, Scotland) and is finding itself unable to subdue the pesky Picts. The movie is based on a legend about the Ninth Legion, which did in fact disappear from Roman history sometimes in the 2nd century (and many historians do believe it perished in Britannia.) It's a very violent, very bloody and very graphic movie. If you like those things you'll love this. The story is pretty bare bones and unimaginative really. After a fierce (violent, bloody and graphic) battle against the local Picts, what's left of the Ninth Legion (and it ain't much) has to try to find its way back to the safety of the Roman lines, all the while being hunted down by the Picts. After all that the movie chose to end on what I found to be an awkward romantic note that just didn't fit with the whole tenor of the story.Michael Fassbender starred in this as the commander of the ragged troops trying to find their way home. He was decent enough, but the whole tenor of the movie was its graphic bloodiness with a handful of ""gross-out"" scenes - such as the survivors killing a deer and drinking its blood and eating half digested moss from its stomach. I'd have to give some marks to Olga Kurylenko for her silent performance as Etain - the Pict scout who's out for revenge because years before the Romans killed her father, raped and killed her mother and raped her and cut her tongue out. Her ""Etain"" was not someone I'd want to cross!But you'd really have to like blood and gore with only a very limited storyline to make this worth watching. (2/10)",2.0,Anonymous,History

Another corner of the Roman world brought vividly to life.,"I'm really taken by this film, and recommend it most highly as a gripping evocation of military honour, administrative mendacity, and brutality on the cold northern frontier of the Roman Empire in second- century AD Britain. Neil Marshall directs a cast of wonderfully skilled actors to create the Roman military force, its territorial governor, and the Pict tribe whose territory was overrun by the Romans after Caesar's invasion.The threads of bureaucratic necessity and military tension in this ""***hole of the world"" are set powerfully against the Picts' hatred of the conquerors who took their lands, killed their families, and drove them north into the wilds of what is now Scotland.At the centre of this story is Quintas Dias, the Roman officer who comes to be in the Ninth Legion when it meets its fate on a forest track Michael Fassbender gives a perfectly-sustained performance as the soldier who realises that his task is to locate and rescue the Legion's commanding officer (Dominic West) and then to lead the small band of survivors back to Roman-held territory. The Roman's grudging admiration for the skill and tenacity of his opponents is made more complex by his discovery that the Empire he's sworn to defend is quite capable of betraying its soldiers' loyalty in the name of political expedience. Quintus Dias's final choice will be understood by any viewer who's had to ask where his or her loyalty, and sense of home, truly lies.The magnificently-filmed landscape of Scotland is a perfect, evocative setting for the military encampments of Picts and Romans, and the journeys of escape and pursuit which criss-cross its northern territory. And the cast's discipline in dealing with the snow, wind, and icy waters, make their quests vivid and tense. Several performances stand out - Fassbinder and West as totally-focused military commanders, David Morrissey and Liam Cunningham as centurions for whom the soldier's life is the only reality, Paul Freeman as a self-serving territorial Governor who longs for Rome, and JJ Feild as a soldier whose calculated self- centredness jeopardizes his own comrades. Ulrich Thomsen, the celtic king Gorlacon, and Olga Kurylenko, the tracker Etain, shine as Picts whose hatred of Rome is relentless, and wholly understandable. I give a salute also to Imogen Poots, who plays the celtic necromancer Arianne with warmth, yearning, and strength - a necessary counterpoint to Kurylenko's demonic intensity. Anyone who values the power and craft of Gladiator will be glad to see Centurion - another journey into the world of Empire which makes clear, in very contemporary ways, the ambiguity of the conqueror's role, and the reasons explaining the hatred felt by those who've been conquered. Well done, Neil Marshall.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Very disappointing,"Well I loaded this title into my DVD player with the anticipation of watching a star studded gritty film along the lines of Braveheart or Apocolypto, how disappointed I was. The film has very little story line, has some bloody moments but most battle scenes are a flurry and it's hard to tell who is battling who. Some scenes are ridiculous, for example someone having their throat slit with a 'Shhhting' noise (metal on metal) then immediately dropping dead, there are numerous others but I won't spoil. Other ridiculous elements are the mute waif of a woman portrayed as super warrior and killing everyone she come across, and all the actors were speaking with a modern south England accent.No effort made to portray a Scottish accent or speak in an appropriate manner for the period, but then the script probably didn't demand this.

Remember, this country ruled for 700 years so lets get more of their history up on the big screen and there is no lack of subject matter. This film proves it. On those that nit-pic and find fault, they didn't get their monies worth. Me, I got full value and I believe you will too. Want to munch some popcorn, tasty drink and have a snack while at rest?

Pointless movie about an Italian guy  being chased by a Scottish chick.,"Pointless movie about an Italian guy being chased by a Scottish chick. At least we were warned from the very beginning that there is ""no beginning and no end"" to this story. So, for about one hour and half, they keep on chasing each other, chopping heads, hands but no hens. Somewhere at the end there is the old conflict between the blonde and the brunette in order to throw a meaning to the movie, that is for the spectator to know that the main hero has a reason to live for. Which we don't know for sure since the hero arrives pretty much damaged. Anyway the story can be told regardless the time (Picts and Romans, looks familiar?) or place or even actors.

Awesome,"Centurion is another way underrated film from one of my favorite directors Neil Marshall. This time around it is a Roman period action movie based around the myths of the disappearance of The 9th Roman Legion in The British Isles and what could have possibly happened. Taken from the point of view of a Roman soldier and is a wonderful early performance( from now acclaimed actor) Michael Fassbender. Fassbender is in top physical condition and along with the rest of the cast truly earns his pay in this grueling, physical role. In a time of fake digital effects and seizure inducing cgi, Neil Marshall takes his cast and crew to the mountains and shoots on location in the blistering cold. In the opening scene we see our hero Michael Fassbender running shirtless through a violent snowstorm, which sums up the tone of the film early on. Although similar to Gladiator in many ways, this is much smaller scale and more action packed as well. The battle scenes are very bloody and brutal with lots of gory dismemberments and decapitations. Heads roll and body parts fly in a brutal gory fashion in this period action classic. The acting is quite good as well and the film is very, very gritty. This has a similar feel to John Carpenter's work, I see a big nod to him here. I see some similarities to Assault On Precinct 13 and Ghosts Of Mars in particular. Centurion gives a good glimpse into barbaric times and in my opinion is much better than a lot of much more hyped films that get heaped with praise.",8.0,Anonymous,History
There will be blood...,"... In fact a lethal overdose of blood.How could I not love this movie? Gladiator was one of my all-time favourites, I love Braveheart, and Apocalypto IS still my favourite, so how can I not love this one? Shallow is the magic word. This movie tries to live off its shock value. The gore is presented with gay abandon almost as if it were the main focus point of the film. And maybe it is, I don't know, didn't care to finish it.The frustrating thing is the setting has great potential. Romans are fighting some rebellious tribes in the far north of Britain. You gotta love rebels. Except this movie shows things from the Romans' perspective, which is a let-down, but the deal-breaking flaw is that flying body parts rule the screen, except the heart is missing.",3.0,Anonymous,History
A chase in the land of the Picts or a high-quality budget historical thriller,"A historical action movie. I have already watched this picture once, namely in 2012, when I worked in the Soyuz store chain (there used to be such a network), because even then I loved historical cinema, and then I really liked this action movie. And so, eleven years later, I decided to review it again and write a review. And you know what - the picture is still good, and it's interesting to watch it (to a greater extent). And here's my brief opinion for you - A high-quality budget historical thriller. Despite the fact that I like this picture, I will note both its pros and cons (which were necessary). And that's where I finish this introduction and move on to the analysis.So, the pros:
1. Scenario - the film focuses on the history of Roman centurion Quintus Dius, and his difficult service on the northern borders of the Roman Empire (more precisely in Britain). The entire garrison in which he served was slaughtered by local barbarians - a wild tribe of warlike Picts (ancestors of the Scots). He is captured, from where he safely escapes and meets with the commander of the legendary Ninth Spanish Legion, who was ordered by the Roman governor to exterminate the ruthless Picts once and for all and restore order on the northern border of the Empire. But everything is not going exactly according to plan, and almost the whole picture we will watch the escape of Quintus and his Roman comrades from a group of Picts, led by the ruthless warrior Etain. The finale is predictable, but there is also an intrigue here, for which I thank the screenwriter and director Neil Marshall very much. The characters are memorable, charismatic, and interesting to watch. Historical surroundings play an important role here. In general, I can only praise the script.2. Scenery and costumes - the picture was shot on location (to a greater extent), and in almost the same places that are in question in the picture, so the nature of Scotland here is very beautiful and very fascinating. But the costumes - the creators did their best here. Roman soldiers and commanders wear appropriate clothing and armor. Legionnaires have Empire-era helmets pulled back. But instead of the traditional segmentata lyrics at that time, some commanders (and Quintus Dius himself) wear chain mail. The Picts here also look very much like themselves (although there is enough of them, but it does not catch the eye). Moreover, both Romans and Picts were played by participants in historical reconstruction. Therefore, minor flaws can be forgiven.3. The cruelty of war - the picture shows the ordinary cruelty of war, and on both sides. And the Romans slaughter the Picts, and the Picts of the Romans. The fights and battles themselves are full of blood, severed heads, limbs, and so on. These are rarely shown now. Because war is not about arranging figures on the map and beautiful marches. First of all, it is blood, pain, bowel movements (from all the openings of the human body), dirt, cruelty. This is not a romantic halo, this is hard work, fraught with deadly risks. The picture does not spoil us with large-scale battles (the budget does not allow), but the fights are fleeting and bloody.4. The fate of the Ninth Legion - the disappearance of this unit still excites the minds of historians, writers, and publicists. And there is still no evidence of where he disappeared and what caused it. Screenwriter and director Neil Marshall (like me) adheres to a very popular and logical version - namely, that the Ninth Legion was destroyed in the lands of the Picts when it pursued them. Most likely, the Picts lured the Romans into an ambush in a dense forest - and killed everyone. There were many Picts, far more than four thousand Romans. Perhaps someday, archaeologists and historians will establish the site of the battle and find the remains of armor or weapons, and then this mystery will be solved. For now, this remains only a version.5. The confrontation between Quintus and Etain are two strong warriors who lost everything in this war, and now they will only take revenge. Both are experienced warriors, each with their own strengths, ready to destroy each other, because only death can stop them. Most of the picture is devoted to this confrontation. Cunning, ingenuity, and whose malice is stronger will decide everything here. You look at this confrontation and you can't take your eyes off it.So, the cons:
1. Logic - Quintus escapes from the Picts in only trousers and sandals, even a tunic does not cover his torso, and it's winter outside. How he didn't get frostbite is amazing. He's a tough warrior, of course, but he's not immortal. Why do Picts also flaunt an open torso? Did they also decide that they were immortal? What kind of hedgehog does a Numidian make in the Roman army? How does the Roman governor plan to hide the death of an entire legion? Were there damn four thousand people there? This is not a local militia unit, this is the famous Ninth Legion - created by Julius Caesar himself. Why is the Russian version of the legion commander called a ""general""? There was no such rank in the Roman army, not in the period of the Republic, not in the period of the Empire.2. Boring runaways - I admit, it was these very runaways that the creators turned out to be clearly boring. After all, logic is violated in them too.A little bit about the main characters:
1. Centurion Quintus Dius, played by Michael Fassbender, is a Roman commander, the son of a gladiator who fights all his life. In battle, he shows himself to be a brave and skillful fighter and commander who is ready to die for his soldiers. Michael was very convincing in this role, and external data played a significant role. Well done!2. Etain, performed by Olga Kurylenko, is a warrior from the Pictish tribe, who as a result of the Roman conquest lost all her relatives (and at the same time the maiden part, and also the language), therefore truly hates the Romans and willingly destroys them. It should be recognized that our Russian and French actress coped with the role very successfully. But there is no brilliant acting.It is very sad that this picture failed miserably at the box office, even despite its modest budget. This is certainly not pellum, but a good historical action film worthy of your attention, which is clearly made with soul and diligence. Moreover, they correctly showed here how to pull an arrow out of a wound (I don't remember the last time this was shown in a movie at all).My well-deserved rating is 8 out of 10 and my recommendation for viewing!",8.0,Anonymous,History
"The ultimate ""guy movie""","See it - This action masterpiece stamps itself as the ultimate guy movie in the first few minutes, when a soldier takes a leak off the ramparts of his fort only to be promptly stabbed with a spear where ""the sun don't shine."" Starring Michael Fassbender, this unknown gem can be described in one word – incredible. Picture the opening battle in ""Gladiator,"" but lasting for an hour and a half. Despite its non-stop violence, the film is often poetic and beautiful. The story revolves around a handful of survivors of a Roman legion that is brutally massacred.

Watch this movie for Olga Kurylenko,"I've seen this a couple of times and while it's not a bad little movie set during the Roman invasion of Britain the acting of both Micheal Fassbender and especially Olga Kurylenko elevate it to be better than the script allows it to be.The film itself is based on a real event that happened around the time the Romans were withdrawing from Britain to consolidate power back home and tells the story of the ninth legion which vanished. It's Fassbenders mission to locate them or the eagle.Kurylenko plays Etain and doesn't say a single word throughout the whole movie, thanks to a brutal torture inflicted by the Romans, instead her facial expressions have to convey everything she is feeling and she handles the role with amazing skill that I never thought she had.I give this 8/10, not for the storyline which is derivative and dull but simply for Fassbender and especially Kurylenko who shows what great acting is all about.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Mediocre,"Generally I'm very interested in Roman history but this movie wasn't really able to fascinate me. The plot of the movie is neither especially thrilling nor does it seem very plausible to me. Actually a lot of it seems quite implausible. The movie has some interesting moments in it but most of the time it's long-winded. A positive thing about ""Centurion"" is that there isn't the typical 'good and bad' thing. But the reason for that is, that no character is really symphatetic which on the other hand is not very positive. Better ways to entertain yourself with Roman history are out there but for some pastime it's okay. Don't expect too much.",5.0,Anonymous,History
An excellent depiction,"I, along with some others, feel this movie was very realistic in almost every aspect relating to the location and period. As a history buff I thought the battle scenes brought the horrors of hand- to-hand combat right into my living room; quite possibly the best I've ever seen (Ranks with the Normandy landing in Saving Private Ryan.) and I have viewed hundreds of war movies and programs. Unfortunately, there were moments in the film I felt were to easily anticipated, but all-in-all they were easily forgotten due to the gorgeous scenery and defined plot. Thank God they had enough sense to not add one of those ridiculous gratuitous sex scenes which seem to appear in practically every Hollywood movie of recent years! (I hope that information isn't considered a ""spoiler"". This is my first submission.) Far too many movies lose their entire head of steam with such absurdity. At least in foreign film any love scenes are essential to the plot and portrayed realistically.

A very enjoyable movie,"I started writing reviews because most of the reviews I read don't actually comment on the entertainment factor of the movie. Rather the reviewers (and I'm not being picky) tend to comment on some aspect of the movie which they liked or disliked etc.If you like ancient Roman centurion/gladiator films with great fighting scenes, a solid story line, then this is a film for you.I enjoyed the film immensely because of the story line and for the entertainment value.This film almost falls in to the ""epic"" category and I for one have added it to my DVD collection.",8.0,Anonymous,History

I could have written this (or any of you, to that manner) from the dialogues to the main scenes and ending because there were no surprises, it was all predictable, predictable, PREDICTABLE, from the lines to characters.Plus, there were times the action just became boring, with lame motivations and thin-paper personalities and I couldn't see how it could be possible that this was a Neil Marshall's movie, whose The Descent I absolutely adore!What a waste of time!",4.0,Anonymous,History

Had this been done with the big budgets of Hollywood and its big names it would have got a perfect 10. Not that Fassbender, West, and Cunnigham didn't do an excellent job already.I've already watched it 3 times and i'm still looking forward to watching it a few more times.

"Not great, or even good","Neil Marhall has brought us some fantastic movies. but this is not one of them.The Scottish scenery is stunning, but there is little else to recommend this aimless amble through an alternative history of the Romans stopping in Northern England. The formulae are well worn and but the plot never really seems to work out what it wants to be: Is it an action movie, a buddy movie against the odds, a political thriller, or a forbidden romance? It's simultaneously all and none, everything is touched upon but nothing is developed. Ultimately it leaves the viewer as unsatisfied as its threads of plot.Sure, watch it on DVD, but don't expect much more than a bit of gore and a half-hearted effort at a decent movie. 4/10.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Gritty Action Movie,I am surprised this film is not marked higher and reviewed better. It kept me interested throughout and I will certainly watch it again. It is historical fiction loosely based on fact and works very well particularly bearing in mind it was made on such a low budget. The cast are convincing throughout. The locations and photography are brilliant. The action/fight scenes are convincing. I am not sure about the Pict warrior Bimbos however and there are a few details that the Roman scholars will no doubt mention. Be that as it may the film works very well and is far better than some other big budget efforts in this genre Gladiator for example which was very lame by comparison,10.0,Anonymous,History

Light Escapism and Good for a Laugh or Two,"I read the reviews beforehand so I wasn't expecting anything absolutely historically accurate. After all, we're unlikely to ever know what happened to the Ninth Legion anyway apart from the fact that it never returned (if it was actually the Ninth that disappeared north of the border), however, what irks me are the things that, at a very minimum, the movie makers can afford to get right such as Roman weapons and tactics.Firstly, the Gladius was a stabbing sword. Legionaries did not line up and slog it out with their enemies like Gladiators in the Circus, They stood three or four deep, shields raised and stabbed at their opponents' genitalia or femoral arteries or tried to slice through their Achilles tendons. The whole effect was much like a buzz saw as their swords stabbed and withdrew, stabbed and withdrew, etc. trying to find their mark. When the front rank tired, was injured or killed, the man behind took his place, or was issued an order to that effect.Secondly, I am sure I am not the only one who is sick and tired of seeing a spear of some unknown era with a blunt tip in the hand of a Roman soldier. The armourer for this movie should be ashamed! Where is the Pilum with the slender shaft and the small sharp tip? (no jokes please). It doesn't look at all like the spears in this movie.In summary, it was some fun for 90 minutes but that's all folks!",5.0,Anonymous,History
Great quality per buck ratio,"The movie is clearly a low budget one, from the moment the film starts with a map of Roman Empire Brittania appearing from the mist while a deep voice explains what goes on to the mostly unknown and smallish cast. But they did a great job with what they had!The plot did not go in the direction I would have wanted - I believe an opportunity for a great strategic guerrilla warfare film was missed here - but it worked well, nonetheless. Pict tribes decimate a Roman legion and the few survivors run for their lives. A bit too much running, and to not much avail. And did the story really need the good caring blonde?The acting is very good, the landscapes fantastic, the atmosphere well done and the battles really bloody. It works perfectly as an action film, well as a historic dramatic depiction and kind of fails as a romance. Full thumbs up for movies that are well done by people who care about the film they make!",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Rather hoary old hokum, but it should do the biz for those who like that kind of thing","It would be rather too easy to poke gentle fun at Centurion, and I'm afraid it's a temptation I shall find impossible to resist, but although I've read that it was made on a budget - £10 million is regarded as rather a small budget in the film-making world, I gather - that is not obvious, so it deserves a little respect.Writer/director Neil Marshall has used his imagination well and I doubt whether an extra £90 million would have made much difference, if any at all. All in all it is more or less a piece of Boys' Own hokum about a bunch of Roman soldiers, the sole survivors of a massacre by the Picts of Rome's Ninth Legion, who have to make their way home through a very inhospitable Scotland, all the while tracked by a posse of vicious Picts led by a mute woman who has nothing on her mind at all but revenge (and who sports a startling amount of kohl on her eyelids throughout).In sum, it's a chase film, and there's nothing much wrong with that if that's your bag. Unfortunately, it isn't mine unless there's a little more and here there isn't. Characterisation is minimal and there's no plot to speak off.Aspects of the film which left me underwhelmed were just how fast and loose Marshall played with Scottish geography: one minute our intrepid gang of Romans are several thousand feet high crossing a snowy mountain, and barely ten minutes later they are trekking through the kind of dense woodland you will not find in the Highlands. I hate to disillusion non-Brits, but there's an awful lot of rather dull countryside in the middle of Scotland before you get to the Highlands (and for the record I rather like The Borders).I am also always disconcerted in these films by how men who are living rougher than you and I will ever have the misfortune to live manage to remain more or less clean-shaven throughout. Yes, I know that has a lot to do with production schedules and that films are rarely shot in rigid sequence, but it does rather spoil an illusion. I was also rather puzzled as to where our gang of Romans managed to pick up their rather natty furs. But what the hell, Centurion is, after all, nothing more than hoary old hokum and in its favour is that it pretends to be nothing more. OK, much of the dialogue is quotably heroic and at times a little ponderous but, but who knows, perhaps the Romans were rather like that.And here's a spoiler: the hero gets the girl. I shan't tell you how - for that you'll have to watch the film yourselves. But it is reassuring how some staples of film can never be ignored.",5.0,Anonymous,History

Just Enough of Everything,"Let's get one thing straight with me. I hate action films that revolve around betrayal and/or romance. And because people seem to be horrible at even watching a film, I was completely scared of both of these when watching this film. Without giving anything away, there is everything in this movie and just the right amount of it.UK Films that go back to 1400 AD and lower are always a treat. They give us their hallmark actors and actresses and we get to see them play, generally the same sort of role they did in their previous films. A nice little change is the Charismatic General, Dominic West, still plays his usual egocentric role, but instead of being the antagonist, he plays quite a lovable hero. His second up, Michael Fassbender who plays a determined and soulful leader, does a grand job to pick up on the other end of the scale. The supporting cast that we meet along the way are perfect for their roles and no one misses a beat.This movie does have a storyline that does follow pretty accurate to Rome's history. Around the time of Emperor Commodus, best known for being in the movie Gladiator. However for history buffs, we know it was Commodus who began pushing for the island of Brittany. He was also the first 'duke'/'lord' of it as well. But no Emperor is mentioned, just a fun fact. Along with the accurate story-telling the movie does like to center itself around the fence of gore. Visceral Gore. Whoever began perfecting the use of CG-Gore, my hats off to them. Although it's pretty obvious when it's used, it allows for some crazy hack-n-slash effects. Such as cutting someone in half, cutting someone's arm off, cutting off half of someone's head. These sorts of things that make guys fist pump and lesser men cringe. But the gore is not out of bad taste.Like all British films that have such gore, it some how comes across as tasteful. I don't know if it's realistic, since I've never seen someone get axed in half, but they definitely shot for the grittiness of hand to hand combat. On that same note, many people I can imagine hated the director-of-photography. Many of the action scenes that involve many mêlées are broken up into almost an animate slide show of people putting the finishing blow on their opponent. Some of us may love it, while others enjoy more of the dramatic fights where swords cling more often than blood is spilled. But I'd like to think some of us are educated and know that is not how it worked back then.I am going to begin speaking about the ending now. No spoilers, but if you read too far into it you may begin creating your own ending and I'd hate for you to go into this movie thinking you know the ending. -A lot of people didn't like the ending. They felt it was perhaps weak? I don't see it as weak. I see it as probably the best possible ending. I got exactly what I wanted to be honest. I think people go to movies and still expect faeries and unicorns to make everything be alright. But the facts are facts and this movie obeyed them as best as theatrically possible. +End Ending discussion~!So in conclusion. The movie is amazing. I have to say it's one of the better historical-fiction films I have seen. I think I may like it better than 300; in terms of Greco-Roman history. The movie combines action with just enough character-interaction and drama to keep you interested. Don't expect any twist endings or even any tear jerkers. It's just a good film to watch alone or with some friends. It may even get you interested enough to begin researching the 'rust and iron' age of the Roman Empire.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Missed Opportunities,"This movie could have been spectacular, but the script fell very short. There was obviously a lot of money there, but not much else. It was beautifully shot, with impressive costumes, makeup and some not-bad acting. It's a pity this seemed like a really expensive low budget hack and slash film (if that makes any sense). The characters didn't really develop, and to be blunt, there wasn't a lot of heart in them to begin with. I never thought I was looking at real people. I could tell the actors were doing the best with what they had, but that never appeared to be too much.

Centurion (2010),"The bloody gruesome action is expertly handled. WIth every head slice, throat cut, causing flinches and manly air pumps. The cast are a wonderful mix of up and comers, and recently established stars. Marshall has basically made a Roman version of Dog Soldiers, as a band of survivors all get together to outmaneuver an enemy. Despite these enemies being human, Marshall still decides to make them grotesque and cruel. The male bonding moments are still here, as are the strong female characters. It does hint towards people fighting their own wars based on emotion, but it's the violence everyone came to see. It isn't quite enough to really justify a watch. The parts in between are dull and there's no real progression after the first 30 minutes.",5.0,Anonymous,History
How can one person write every Hollywood cliche imaginable?,"It's hard to believe one person could write something this bad, because usually in order to be this full of nothing but predictable cliches, it takes several chefs to spoil the broth, each sabotaging the other chef's soup.But Neil Marshall does just that.

Another movie where the bang is less than a buck.Marshall writes like a three year old who happens to know most words used in Hollywood writing. Nothing looks or seems natural. You only think of the stunt men and extras being coached to die like cannon fodder. You never get any feeling of being in the historic era.

"Dull, ugly and mostly forgettable","Director Neil Marshall showed a lot of promise with his sophomore feature, The Descent. It was far from perfect, but it was a rare horror movie that was actually frightening. Marshall has unfortunately not advanced any since then. His followup, Doomsday, was an okay B movie, but it was most definitely forgettable. Centurion, his fourth movie (I never have caught up with his debut, Dog Soldiers), is even worse than Doomsday. It's a story about a group of Roman soldiers, led by Michael Fassbender, caught behind enemy lines, trying to make their way to Hadrian's Wall before the Picts, led by mute tracker Olga Kurlyenko, hunt down and kill them. When it's nothing but running and chasing, it ain't half bad. Anything resembling plot, though, stinks. I could barely understand the mush-mouthed Brits that populate the movie (apparently the Romans were made up of Cockney bootblacks), and when the Picts are subtitled, the font and color of the subtitles are illegible. The film has that awful processed blue tint throughout, and the action is edited in such a way that it's often hard to follow (also: CGI blood).",5.0,Anonymous,History
An interesting tale to tell,"At first when you see the gore, the blood and hacked off limbs, you think this is going to be another rip off of Ridly Scott's ""Gladiator"". Then you see the blue paint on the warrior's skin and their axe wielding ways, and it's a rip off of ""Braveheart"". Well it's not. Centurion is about the legendary 9th legion, marched under orders, into the heart of the Picts and was never heard of again. 6 soldiers survive only to be hunted down by a vengeful Etain and her warriors.I have enjoyed this movie because firstly the one big thing I noticed was the cinematography and the use of the wide lens to capture the wilderness of the Scotish highland. Sam McCurdy vision is sublime. Not a soul to be seen for miles, the scenery looked beautiful yet at the same time dangerous as you can see the actual cold shivers of the actors and the breath coming from their mouths. (That's were most of my 6 of my star votes going to).Secondly, costume and set design, looked all authentic, even down to the shoes. I found the Picts garment to be well suited to the climate, while the Roman's wore a much more sturdier clothing. Not overly powering elaborately designed as in Gladiator, but that's the difference between a Hollywood budget and the British Film industry. The props were cleverly done as was the set for Roman garrison and the village of the Picts.Thirdly, the actors: Olga Kurylenko as Etain was a much more realistic character then the skinny, barely covered Kiera Knightly in 'King Arthur"" (2004). She's tough, resilient and vengeful, not one part of her is soft, vulnerable and feminine. Being mute made the actor rely on other methods to convey her feelings; she stand her own ground when it comes to fighting with the men. Centurion Quintus Dias played by Michael Fassbender,certainly looks the part of a Roman soldier. Strong, dependable, loyal and sturdy. His acting was very good and I can only put it down to the harsh conditions the actors were in on location shooting. The supporting cast are good, wonderful to see Liam Cunningham as the veteran fighter, full of wisdom. The man is a GOD!!!Lastly, although this production is flawed (i.e. actors riding saddles) and too much blood and gore, this is overall a very entertaining film. This is not an Hollywood epic nor a history lesson, it has a simple plot and action...don't take it too seriously.There is one thing that I disliked about the film is the ending; not one of it's strong points. It was cheesy, clique and pointless...I won't put a spoiler comment, only you have to see it yourself.",8.0,Anonymous,History
'I am a soldier of Rome! I will not yield!',"Because of the disaster that was Doomsday Neil Marshall's reputation as a director took a bit of a dent. To rectify this he turned to a completely different genre, a historical epic based on the legend of the Ninth Legion of Rome who disappeared in Scotland.In 117AD the Roman Empire are fighting a loosing battle in their most northern frontier in Scotland, then known as Caledonia. The Picts, lead by their king Gorlacon (Ulrich Thomsen) has been leading a brutal guerrilla campaign against the Romans and during a raid capture our protagonist, Quintus Dias (Michael Fassbender). In Roman occupied England General Titus Flavius (Dominic West) and the Ninth Legion has been ordered to invade and find Gorlacon. But they are lead into a trap and only a small band survive, including Quintus who the legion rescues. Quintus and the soldiers have to get back to Roman territory whilst being chased by Gorlacon and tracker Etain (Olga Kurylenko) who are out for revenge.Marshall sets out to give Centurion an earthy look, colours of outfits are toned down, his camera filters give the film a deliberately dark and grainy look and the whole movie was shot on location in muddy woods and fields in winter. But as a man from a horror background Marshall ensures there is a lot of gore and blood. It's a little over the top but it is fun to see and Marshall is certainly inventive involving methods of death. The battle scenes are deliberately chaotic and feels and looks like the opening from Gladiator. We are brought into the heart of a battle and it was very well done considering the budget. But whilst the battles were well done the one on one fights were too choppy and quickly cut. It was hard to tell what was happening. I prefer to actually see fights, have shots that last more then a second or two and keep cuts to a minimum. Marshall and his cinematography Sam McCurdy also employ some sweeping shots of the mountains and the landscape, particularly looking at the ground with a bird's eye view then panning the camera upwards. It was much very like Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings to show the breathtaking scenery and how small the figures are in the wide expands. I expect that Marshall was trying to do for Scotland what Peter Jackson did for his native New Zealand.The story overall is simple but simple does not mean bad. It is still has a manner of life and death for the Romans and Marshall certainly makes a very fast paced adventure. But Marshall also does allow us to get to the know the characters and he employs a strong cast, Fassbender, West, Imogen Poots, David Morissey and Riz Ahmed. Added to that Marshall attempts to show a more complex picture, that both sides are as brutal as each other, that the Picts want to humiliate the Romans, that the Romans are very brutal occupiers using violence and rape to enforce their rule, that the governor is thinking of his political position and that sides think what they are doing is right. No one is being evil just for the sake of being evil like in the God awful Braveheart and that there are tensions within both camps. It was a mix picture and no one is truly a good or bad guy for most of the film.Since the success of the awesomely entertaining 300 there has been a big expansion of historically set action films, Black Death, Clash of the Titans, Solomon Kane, Ironclad, Immortals and many foreign efforts. Centurion is the best post 300 film within the genre so far, a competently made actioneer.Historically it most like that the Ninth Legion was transferred to Germany and then either disbanded or amalgamated with another legion. But compared to the God Awful Braveheart Centurion is like Downfall for historical actuality.Overall Centurion is very enjoyable and deserves a 7.5 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,History
visually nice but too much of an ingredient movie,"I should say this review contains spoilers although i really feel there is not much to spoil :P It's a genre I have a weakness for (historical drama) so I thought I could enjoy it despite the slightly sub standard reviews and rating. But alas, no. It really boiled down to a mix of all too familiar ingredients. The Hollywood-newfound grittiness of Romans in the cold climate(gladiator), the chase, the jumping from a high cliff to escape, the black sheep in our midst. And in the end it get worse: the girl that the hero is getting (you see this coming from miles away what makes it more unbearable) and then the awkward and absurd getting attacked by your own rulers, victim of the system ploy. The last implemented as a means to surprise the audience and have them leave with the feeling they have been watching an unpredictable and meaningful movie. Duh!",4.0,Anonymous,History
Futility of Invasion: A Lesson Yet Unlearned,"CENTURION may not be a great movie - very entertaining, but not great - but it does make some points that are worth considering today. The concept of a big power (here the Roman Empire AD 117) making a preemptive war on a smaller, 'different' culture (the Picts of Scotland) cannot help but muster comparison to current US preemptive (and unsuccessful) attacks in the Middle East. Though it is doubtful that the writer director Neil Marshall's cinematic vision included this idea, the historic decimation of the Roman Ninth Legion's failure to conquer the Picts is poignant food for thought.But on to the story. In 117 AD one of the few areas not controlled by the Roman Empire was the northern portion of the British Isles, land of the Picts, a strange tribal like people with determined, terrifyingly ferocious fighting techniques. General Titus Flavius Virilus (Domenic West) is given orders from the Roman Emperor to capture that stronghold, and he is off with the Ninth Legion to conquer. A born leader and beloved by his troops, Virilus fights valiantly but is captured and there is only one man deemed his replacement - former gladiator Centurion Quintus Dias (Michael Fassbinder, a major actor remembered for this disparate roles as in 'Hunger', 'Inglourious Basterds', '300', 'Band of Brothers' etc). Centurion is finally left with a handful of men (JJ Field, Lee Ross, David Morrisey, Liam Cunningham, Noel Clarke, Dimitri Leonidas, Riz Ahmed) who attempt to complete the mission. One mute female warrior Etain (Olga Kurylenko), a Pict turned Roman Guide, quickly turns her allegiance to her homeland and becomes the most treacherous fighter of them all. At one point the son of Gorlacon (Ulrich Thomsen), the leader of the Picts, is killed by a Roman and the ferocity of the battle is heightened. The Roman troops endure untold hardships, are given hospitality by a Pict castaway Arianne (Imogen Poots) with whom Centurion becomes enamored, and eventually only Centurion remains as the sole survivor of the Roman Ninth Legion. The effect of his experience and knowledge of the war failure causes the Roman Empire to decide a fate for him and the rest is best left unsaid.There is little dialogue, but what there is is solid. The battle scenes are appropriately gory and the cinematography by Sam McCurdy and the musical score by Ilan Eshkeri sustain the atmosphere. Michael Fassbinder proves that he is indeed a major talent, and the entire cast is excellent. It is a great little film for diversion, it could easily have been extended (only 98 minutes) for better fleshing out of the characters, but the final words of the Centurion suggest that there likely will be sequels.Grady Harp",8.0,Anonymous,History

Good film. Once it would have been great - but we're too jaded,"This is a very good film. It is courageous and compelling, gutsy and thought provoking. It's about cultures that are completely opposite that clash over the land they both want and the terrible pain that results. It's also about politics and pure survival, but most of all this film is about comradeship. I am a bit of a cynic but I must say I really enjoyed this movie and once it would have won many awards, but the powers that be think it can be ignored. Despite this it is a film that holds true and should be watched and talked about and celebrated. It is also a timely reminder that cultures do not always mesh together in the politically correct world the powers that be are selling to us - and if truth to be told it is a foretaste of what is to come.",8.0,Anonymous,History

A flawed yet underrated gem,"Since I am such a lover of history, centurion was a must for me, especially since it was a Neil Marshall movie - one of my favourite directors. When I first watched Gladiator, I hoped for some sort of similar epic centred around the Eagle of the Ninth storyline, but it seems like this film has been the answer to my prayers.The story revolves around the legend of the ninth legion. A roman legion marches north of England into what was ancient Scotland (back then called pictland), and they disappeared. A book called Eagle of the Ninth was written about it in the 1950s involving a son of a legionnaire going north to recover the eagle. There was a film made of it in 2011 called 'The Eagle' though I haven't seen it quite yet.This film shows the attack on the legion after advancing into pictland where a handful of men survive and are now trying to escape a hunting group of picts led by the mute Etain (Olga Kurylenko) whose entire existence since her brutalisation and her parents' slaughter at the hands of the Romans, is devoted to taking the lives of Roman soldiers.The cast is top-notch. Michael Fassbender is excellent as the lead role and he puts his all into it. The rest of the cast of survivors are excellent as well, but apart from Riz Ahmed's Arabic cook and Noel Clarke's Greek runner, all seem to be too similar to each other. The picts are excellent as well, but easier to distinguish, especially Dave Legeno and Axelle Carolyn. Olga Kurylenko seems at first a bit too skinny looking to be a really strong Pict warrior, but her mute character and her brutal nature soon overcomes this. She is a really powerful presence on screen, but as well as being intimidating, she also comes across as quite a tragic figure, and her skinny frame also portrays a sense of frailty to her character that comes across very well. She clearly leads an almost heartbreakingly sad existence living only for vengeance.There are a couple of flaws in this film. The Romans carry spears rather than pilums (though that can apparently be explained away by compromise), the weird romantic subplot that appears during the course of the plot seems strangely tacked on and out of place. Also, what struck me as strangest was that after Etain's brutalisation she headed north to Gorlacon's tribe, presumably at such a young age and in the state she'd have been in she'd not have been able to travel too far so she probably came from the northeast of Albion, but how was she able to tell them such a detailed story of her brutality if she was mute? Having said all that, the camera work is excellent. Though the Romans are invaders and one would naturally side with the picts, their own brutality comes through and you really sympathise with the tired, cold, hungry and scared survivors as this unstoppable Pict warrior and her followers, and the extent that even the landscape is a threat to them.If you haven't seen Centurion yet, see it, but recognise that it is not a perfect movie, though a damned fine one at that",8.0,Anonymous,History

Tedious and predictable affair,"Neil Marshall's attempted portrayal of the popular legend of the disappearance of the roman Ninth Legion is a tedious and predictable affair, which seems all too focused on splurting out CGI blood, than on captivating the thrill of the hunt and the adrenaline of the chase. In this version of the myth the entire Legion gets massacred by the Picts, whilst trying to capture their leader Gorlacon (Ulrish Thomsen). Ambushed they are swiftly cut down with only a handful of men surviving. Led by Centurion Quintus Dias they aim to escape from Pict territory in an attempt to return home. Unfortunately for them the Pict's vengeance knows no bound and they are followed by the beautiful and deadly mute Etain (Olga Kurylenko).The spectacular fail of this movie largely lies in the general misdirection. And this despite the actors, who are almost unanimously spot on and without any fault. Michael Fassbender especially has an unbelievable screen presence, which seems to make him destined for international film glory. Nonetheless the characters lack background and focus making the whole affair of their deaths rather disengaging.Warning signs can be caught very early on in the movie, as the historical drama starts off with eagle-eye landscapes of Northern Scotland with humongous corny credits overshadowing the pictures. Than we are treated with a mindgulfingly useless opening scene, where we see a lone man escaping through the mountains coupled with an appallingly daft voice-over (which gets even worse as the movie plods on). After this the movie moves back in time two weeks to 'where this all started', only to be back in the mountains scene within 10 minutes of the film (making the whole opening sequence superfluous). In the meantime we get a bloody visceral fight, where Picts slaughter a Roman stronghold with extremely red CGI blood splattering left and right.Naturally the above is just nitpicking, but the movie is a chaotic mess of some inspired scenes overshadowed by overall crappiness and very bad scripting. Something that not even the brilliance of Fassbender or the beauty of Kurylenko can overshadow. Not exactly knowing if this is a survival thriller, a historical drama or basically a glorious opportunity to hand out some in-your-face carnage the movie is all over the place. My standout scene of badness would have to be finding out that this is no ordinary band of survivors, but a band of unwilling supermen with a Greek cook with remarkable killing skills taking the cake. A close second would have to be a tribute to ""Return of the King"" with the group of legionnaires running on foot for several days straight with almost no food or rest putting to shame all the modern day marathon runners...Surprisingly the movie is also unable to instill any sense of urgency or dread, although we have a group of people on foot escaping horsemen. Theorethically we know they are being chased, but Marshall can never seem to suggest scenes that start the blood pumping and keep you on the edge of your seat. Its quite a terrible achievement to shoot a movie about survival, but never being able to create an atmosphere of impeding death. Surprising given this is the same man who made the gripping ""Descent"".Just to be brutally frank I was also taken aback with Hadrian's Wall showing up in the final minutes of the movie, whilst the film is supposedly set in 117 AD.After the absolute (albeit enjoyable) muddle that was ""Doomsday"" Neil Marshall craps out a real turd and seems to be on a downhill spiral, which hopefully will force him to get back to the basics.",4.0,Anonymous,History

Also there is a romance, a small, but effective and meaningful, not forced at all.In the end I have to mention the great acting, and introduction of one the creepiest female villain played by a beautiful woman.For the very end I have to add that the Marshalls talent of making intelligently choreographed action sequences is also present, and the scenes are bloody as hell.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Worth A Watch!,"Review: Although this movie is nearly 3 years old, I quite enjoyed this medieval ""On The Run"", film which has good performances from all of the cast and a decent storyline. I must admit, I was expecting a more ""Sparta"" type of movie, but I did stay interested throughout the movie and, for once, I didn't fall asleep. The reason why I didn't see the film when it first came out was because I wasn't a big fan of movies in this genre, but after becoming a big fan of The Game Of Thrones, I thought that I would give this movie a go. There is a lot of running throughout the film and the violence was a bit extreme, but it made the film more intense and enjoyable. If you didn't catch this movie when it first came out then you should give it a watch.Round-Up: I've gradually became quite a fan of Michael Fassbender, who has w unique style of acting which suite most of films that he has acted in like Prometheus and X-Men: First Class. It did seem like the director was getting as much English actors as possible because Noel Clarke and Riz Ahmed was a weird choice for the movie, but I did like there characters. Dominic West, from the Wire, played a great king and I liked Liam Cunningham who is also in the Game Of Thrones. After watching the making of the movie, it was good to see that the director didn't rely on CGI, which a lot of people do nowadays, and a lot of the action looked pretty real. In all, its worth a watch.Budget: $12million Worldwide Gross: $7millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there medieval movie based around the Roman Empire days. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,History
Better than GLADIATOR and 300,"CENTURION is very different war movie. There are not really good guys; in fact everybody is really cruel; so even if told through the Roman's eyes, it is clearly stated that they are as barbaric as their enemies (the Britain PICTOS). It is a British movie about how the British barbarians defeated the more sophisticated (and powerful) Roman Empire. Directed by Neil Marshall (the genius behind Dog Soldiers, The Descent and DOOMSDAY) do not expect standard fare action movie (even when action and gore are usually over the top). Acting is good and character development is exactly what is needed (there are usually some dark sides left to viewers imagination).In brief; good action and gore but a very very good movie.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Terrific tale,"Neill Marshall's Centurion is a brutal, streamlined, balls to the wall story of several lost members of a Roman legion trying to survive the elements, ruthless enemy forces, and each other. It's not so much a sweeping, epic piece like 300, Troy or ones like that, but a more intimate, individualistic take on it. It's like the Bourne Identity of the sword flicks, all tooth and nail survival action as opposed to large scale battle sequences. Michael Fassbender plays , a centurion whose legion is decimated by a rogue group of fierce picts, led by Etienne (Olga Kurylenko in full beast mode). Their commander (Dominic West) can't hold the stragglers together, and soon a group of five or six of them are forced to hurdle through the barren, snowy terrain in hopes of escape from their relentless, pelt wearing pursuers. West is killer good in the few scenes he has, peppering his mannerisms and dialogue with a belligerent glint in his eye. Fassbender makes a stalwart protagonist. The gorgeous Imogen Pootds, a relative newcomer when this was released, is radiant as a forest dwelling loner who takes the gaggle of survivors in and cares for them. Liam Cunningham underplays his ageing soldier role beautifully. The camera work is also to be noted, capturing some stunning fight scenes set atop a snow dusted plateau, and later an abandoned keep. It's a fairly underrated slice of bloody genre fun, with Marshall being no stranger to this sort of breathless escapism, and having helmed the pilot of Game Of Thrones, adding all the right touches to make it well worth our while.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Solid period-piece action movie!!,"The romance didn't start until the last third of the movie. But, it was much better than I had expected given the IMDb rating. The costumes and atmosphere had a very authentic feel - at least as far as the 21st century rendition goes. Much of the movie setting felt like the beginning of Gladiator in Germania. Although I think the bad-a$$ femme fatal role is an overrated character part, our feminist-indoctrinated society seems to love it. Olga Kurylenko plays the baggage-laden she-wolf pretty well anyway - and at least she doesn't talk. The romantic interest, in my view, did a much better job at developing a feminine role that real men could appreciate, even so late in the movie. I honestly wasn't expecting that, but I was glad she did finally come to the rescue, because she saved the movie from being a straight action no plot flop.

A good Film that could have been Great,"Centurion is a good movie that could have been a great movie. With the exception of a few silly and foolish scenes, time restrictions, and poor decisions by the Director, Centurion could have been much better than it was. The word funny should not apply to this film in any way. The Roman situation in Britain or the campaign of the Roman 9th Legion is not humorous. Unfortunately the Director tries to add humor to this film by adding scenes which give the viewer the impression of this being a Monty Python production. Barbarians screaming out a battle cry 200 feet away from Roman soldiers is just beyond foolish. It gives away the element of surprise and is not realistic in any way. Nor is it adding any kind of real humor to the film. It only leaves the viewer shaking his head in disgust and disbelief that such foolish scenes were actually included in this film. Also the whole situation Thax created when killing the Pict King's son makes no sense at all. If Thax did not smother the boy to death when they were trying to rescue their General, the Roman soldiers would have been captured or killed right then and there. This was a damned if I do, damned if I don't situation for Thax. This scenario leaves the viewer puzzled and gives the film a makes no sense kind of ending.

A pack of decent action scenes doesn't yet make a movie,"Centurion is the fourth film by Neil Marshall, the director previously responsible for the films Dog Soldiers, The Descent, and Doomsday. So it can be expected that when it comes to action Mr. Marshall should deliver.And deliver he does. The action parts are, if occasionally suffering a bit from slight excess and shaky camera, a pleasure for the viewer. The thought and dedication that went into making them is visible. It has to be noted though, that the amount of graphic violence on screen will definitely be too much for those who think that eg. Robocop or Sabotage are too violent.That is, however, where the praises end. The acting present is good, yet nothing spectacular, and the delightful action scenes would benefit from more flesh in the story to makes the viewer more engaged. The Eagle, that in theory could be a sequel to Centurion, had that side covered better, even with the less-inspired direction and acting. Maybe combining these two would make a real gem of a movie?All and all, this film is worth a watch for those with a bit of taste for action or historical movies, and maybe even a re-watch for those with more than just a bit of that aforementioned taste.

Gritty fantasy,"Watchable because it is well acted (especially by Dominic West), starkly beautiful in its cinematography and grittily realistic in its depiction of warfare, this account of the disappearance of the Romans' Ninth Legion in Caledonia is also shameful in its contempt for historical truth or realism. If you prefer fantasy to historically realistic fiction, fine, but there is no need to deceive the unwary into thinking it depicts something that could have happened. That is taking advantage of and reinforcing a popular ignorance and lack of imagination miserably dominant regarding anything that happened more than a few centuries ago.The only historical character depicted is the Roman governor of Britain, Agricola, shown here in AD 117 as an old man anxious to escape his responsibilities in favour of Roman politics. This is turning the truth on its head as far as possible, for Agricola was governor forty years earlier and in the prime of his life. He is well remembered as having achieved far more than any other Roman governor and having been reluctantly recalled by a jealous emperor because of that. Straying into deeper matters, a Roman legion consisted of about five thousand soldiers, so it is incomprehensible that the commander of the Ninth would have advanced into enemy territory with the few dozen depicted, and in winter when no one campaigned because the invaded would have held all the advantages. But these criticisms suggest taking the film as potentially serious history. I'm afraid challenging it as the latter may be a lost cause as regards anyone so deluded by modern, feminist propaganda as to manage avoiding laughter or despair when presented with the fantasy of primitive ancient viragos even aspiring to slaughter in single combat the best trained soldiers of the age, (and before someone mentions Boudicca, I had better mention that though she rode in a chariot, no ancient source suggests she fought in the battles she presided over).Both this and The Eagle, the other film about the lost Ninth Legion, seem more sympathetic to the Romans than the Picts, the telling fact here being that the Romans speak English while the Picts speak an invented language. I found that interesting just because it was not what I would have expected from 21st century sentiment.Edmund Marlowe, author of Alexander's Choice, a love story, www.amazon.com/dp/1481222112",5.0,Anonymous,History

nice fight for an under the radar movie.,"Thanks for finally bringing back the action to war movies even if it's a smaller scale one. The villain that really pulls the movie to a head is Olga and omg is she scary. I couldn't believe what I was seeing half the time but i couldn't turn away afraid of missing the quick attacks & its action. Plenty of action but not an overdose of slow motion that most movies do. Felt the shots kept the movie moving feeling like it was the legions last desperations, you felt the reality of them being somewhat unable to win. But as always you have to find a way to make men feel better about themselves wen they're getting kicked. And that's when they find an outcast of the Pict tribesmen. This outcast is a fine beauty who helps the remaining crew survive & rest up. This movie doesn't lack in emotional depth like most war movies seem to do. It slowed down enough & shared enough halfhearted laughs to feel for these guys. In another form, this movie somewhat reminded me of a robin hood story since no one seemed to know who & what they were fighting 4. These men were betrayed & some betrayed some in the group, but the select few stuck together like Saving Private Ryan men. Music was off and on & kept it somewhat current but laid in the old dungeon like industrial feel to it. Overall, i got more out of it than i thought even with the narrating voice of the Quintus, that was the genius behind the film.",8.0,Anonymous,History
More for Less,"I like a good ""historical"" film and I'm not picky about whether it's historically accurate or not. (It never is, it's about entertainment and storytelling. Get over it.) So I like Centurion even though it has faults and is bloated and overlong but this impressed me so much more especially bearing in mind Ridley Scott's budget was at least a hundred times more than the one for Centurion. In fact Scott has got really flabby with his work recently - I hated Robin Hood with a vengeance. My suspicion is that Marshall is driven to produce more for less because of budgetary constraints.I did have difficulty sympathising with the Romans in this film because every instinct I have is fully behind the Picts. Yes we make a joke about ""what have the Romans ever done for us?"" but in my case I really hate the Romans. I guess it's part of my racial heritage. Nevertheless the actors do a really good job of appearing to be decent guys and they do win you over, sort of.Cinematography and the score are both excellent too and deserve a mention. This isn't your typical big budget action film made for a zillion bucks in Hollywood. It was made relatively cheaply in the UK and it's all the better for it. (Not something you'll hear me say often as I generally hate modern British films and glad to see the back of the Film Council. In this case though it was taxpayer's money well spent!)",,Anonymous,History
"If you liked ""Gladiator"" you might like this","After staying up late watching this blood-drenched but exciting adventure film, I was stunned to learn that it was something of a box office flop, having made back about half of what it cost to make. Most likely this has to do with how few screens the movie opened with, just over 100 in the UK and about 25 in the US, presumably with no hype. (I never heard of it until seven years after it opened.) This is certainly not your average date movie unless both parties like their violence graphic. So much for the chancy, grim aspects of movie-making. (Almost as grim as the blood in this movie.)The story and acting are pretty good for an adventure/survival yarn: A small band of survivors of an ambush must take a circuitous route through enemy territory to get home. The hero is the son of a gladiator whose father taught him all of his skills and tricks. The best villain is a fierce woman warrior who tracks down the Roman prey. She wears animal skins and war paint, never speaks or smiles, and wields a scary, partisan-like polearm as if it were an extension of her body and soul. (This is not only about guys doing macho stuff, it has a couple of macho women characters, too.)If you do not mind the blood and gore, this is a great adventure story with amazing photography of untamed Scottish mountain country. An interesting note (to me, anyway): The Romans speak English instead of Latin while the Picts speak Scots Gaelic instead of Pictish. Very little Pictish has been preserved, but from what we know of it, it would have been more similar to Gaelic than English is to Latin.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Like a made for TV pilot,"As one reviewer has already said this movie consisted of a lot of blood and guts and heads being chopped off. However the plot was miserable – with no discernible beginning, middle and end. At the end of the movie I was just waiting for a title to come up saying, ""follow the adventures of a centurion in England in the coming TV series"". The lead character Quintus Dias, didn't command your attention and the bad guys seemed rather two dimensional. In fact the whole cast came across as mediocre and bland. The love element was again rather feeble – the witch character being totally unbelievable – and the ending was predictable.All in all it was just interesting enough to keep you awake, but if it had cut off half way through I wouldn't have noticed that I'd missed the end.",4.0,Anonymous,History
This is in response to  Arthur Dent's review.,"What you said about the budget and filming schedule may be true and you may have worked on this film, but of the many names listed above from driver to carpenter to gaffer to second director to whatever or whoever I don't see your name listed anywhere. That leads me to think that maybe you possibly where an extra and being an extra (I was one in a movie back in the 60's) they aren't privy to what the budgets actually are. Again I don't find any fault with your review and it is I think pretty accurate, it's just that you lay claim to working on that movie and I don't see your name listed above anywhere. Now if you used a different name here I would think that you would use the name you used for this movie so that everyone could see that you did indeed work on the movie.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Even Fassbender couldn't save it.,"Comically bad writing. Cartoonish special effects. Idiotic actions by the characters. Use of filters that ruin what cinematography they did achieve. I was looking forward to this, but ended up not being able to finish it.",3.0,Anonymous,History
Bad and generic,"I expected to watch a historic epic in Roman Britain, but it is just one more generic action film Holywood produces at hundreds as if it were a candy factory, just changing the artificial flavour: Rome, space, future dystopia, fake Greek mythology, Vikings, Egypt, stone age... They all have the same silly jokes, the same high body count with spitting blood, the same ungrounded romance just for providing one, the same contemporary Anglophone dialogues, the same lack of concern about even a slight historic accuracy. This flick is just one more of them, completely not credible, looking more like a Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying game than something that loosely resembles Roman Empire. Indeed, Gorlacon seems much more the name of an orc than of a Pict...",5.0,Anonymous,History
A good movie...not recommended for young children,"I have never seen any of Neil Marshall's films, so this was the first of his films that I saw. Centurion was a good movie but not the greatest, tho I liked it but it will never get as close to Ridley Scott's Gladiator. However it was more brutal than Gladiator, it was quite entertaining to watch. Some of the parts were a little too graphic for me though.I understood where Marshall was going with this film, because it's about the disappearance of Rome's ninth legion and what might have caused them to vanish from history from his point of view. Most suggest that a Celtic tribe may have been responsible and there are doubts on whether the Legion reached Scotland or not.Michael Fassbender and Dominic West were good but I couldn't take them seriously as Roman soldiers and was very used to their roles as Spartans. Olga Kurylenko as the cold-hearted and brutal huntress did good but her role is not as memorable since her character remained mute the entire time.Centurion is one of those movies that allows the audience to question which side is good and which side is bad. Do we pity more on the Picts or the surviving Romans? Which side is protecting themselves? Centurion is a good movie, but it's definitely not recommended for young children and for those that are not used to graphic violence.",4.0,Anonymous,History
blood and sheep,"hmmmmmmm, not sure about this one. A good quantity of blood splatter every time a sword strikes and some nice cinema photography, not much else i'm afraid...... The Story is quite frankly just stupid,I can see historians choking on their cup of tea! Some big leaps of faith are needed for the viewer to keep watching without saying what the f*$£""k. My advice is not to think about things as you watch it, maybe drink a few beers first and just enjoy the sword play such as it is. They seemed to put all the effort into blood splatter effects and not so much into choreographing the fight scenes though some scenes were good. I will say the right actors were in place and did there best. The film was entertaining as I was able to switch my brain off for most of the film! Not bad at all for an English film going by recent efforts!For future ref to film makers hunters on horseback catching up to their prey and loosing them several times is not very realistic, these boys must have been olympic runners or something......One final point, why were the romans the heroes of the film? it seems there's a lot of Brit bashing going on in films these days. You'd think as England once had an empire spanning half the world, being an island race we have also defended against virtually every nation in Europe trying to invade us in ancient times and modern - some interesting stories there - there should at least be a few modern movies where the Brits are not the villains!!!!!",4.0,Anonymous,History

Seriously with these ratings?,"All of you that ranked this higher than a few points need to seek medical attention immediately, you may have a brain tumor. Aside from shots of beautiful landscape and a handful of good actors, this film is garbage, through and through. Not even the fight scenes were any good. Bottom line, the writing from start to beginning is so weak it's laughable. I'm not going to waste a ton of time tearing this thing apart in a review. It has wasted enough of my life already. I'm only bothering with this review as a warning to others and to hopefully bring down this rating a little bit because it doesn't deserve more than 2 or maybe 3 out of 10. The acting talent in this was a waste. Michael Fasbender is an amazing actor, and his skill is overshadowed by just how clumsily this was written. I know some are saying that the director of this film has done good work, but with this being something he wrote and directed, I'd gladly skip anything else he's done. Half the film is just Roman soldiers running from Pict hunters. They clearly didn't have enough story to fill a 90 minute feature film, so they just filled it with running scenes and boring dialogue scenes that went nowhere. There is not pay off, the main character achieves none of his goals. The only good thing is that the centurion presumably gets to bang the hot witch in the woods one day. The end. Don't waste your time.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Well the action scenes were well shot,"This started out really well, than just became boring. The first 10 min of this movie actually had a interesting story or at least was a good build up. Than it just became a story of how the Ninth Legion trying to escape the wrath of vengeance from the picts. There weren't any epic battles either, there is a scene where it was suppose to be over 3000 Romans in the Ninth Legion fighting the picts, but that was the only highlight of this film. After that the surviving Romans on the run from the picts. There are some good scenes here and there about loyalty and honor, but most of it is composed of boring chase scenes. I liked Olga Kurylenko playing Etain who is a tracker, but even that didn't make any sense sometimes. So she can track them from miles away but can't find them when they are right near her? It's disappointing to see a film that starts out with potential later go to waste. On the positive I thought the action sequences were well shot and you can actually tell what the hell is actually going on.5.8/10",5.0,Anonymous,History
Not the kind of Gladiator i am looking for,"We came to this movie while waiting for the other big names like Salt and Inception so I didn't check any background of this before we sat in the best place in showroom.Right at the beginning I don't like the script. It's too modern for me or at least I don't expect Roman say a lot of F- work. I thought those are soldiers go thru a time machine to Roman age.This film has a good story, a Roman tragedy. There are too much blood and dirty kills than it needs but the story and senses of mountains, forests worth a bit. It has the Roman taste and I quote ""duty and honor, a man without these two words is just a beast"". Also i like Olga acting is as usual.",5.0,Anonymous,History
It might have worked with a better script and more interesting characters.,"I don't know exactly what it is that made me not enjoy the film as much as I had hoped I would. Maybe because it felt like it was trying to be like '300' (2006) or 'Pathfinder' (2007), but without the incredible visuals and photography.'Centurion' certainly was better than 'Pathfinder' but not nearly as good or interesting as '300'. It was fast-paced with lots of action, good cinematography, and good acting, yet it still lacked something, and I can't quite put my finger on it. It was incredibly brutal, bloody and gory - but then again so was '300', and I loved that movie. Maybe it was just too barbaric, and I didn't quite enjoy the characters. None of them really stood out for me, not even Centurion Quintus Dias (Michael Fassbender) as the hero. There was nothing special about him. He kept surviving attacks because every time luck was on his side, not because he was a strategist, or good fighter, or even clever enough to outsmart the enemy.The main protagonist was Etain, but I didn't buy her character and I didn't feel Olga Kurylenko did the character justice. She was just trying too hard. And then there's the other antagonist, Gorlacon. His army is in pursuit of Quintus' legion because his son was killed by one of them, but Gorlacon simply vanishes from the script towards the end. What, no reckoning???Don't get me wrong, this is not a badly made film. I just don't like it.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Scope's to big for Mr. Marshall,"You might already know that what you can expect regarding Neil Marshall is blood and guts flying around, which he of course does quite well. But in this certain case, this is really not enough and the movie doesn't have much more to show up either.So, while visually impressing and with a potent production value Centurion gradually drifts into an alibi for repeated scenes of people cutting each others throats. Problem is that the over the top splish- splash gutting and cutting just seems slightly out of place here considering, the movie tries to be rather serious. Now attempts of giving the movie meaning are the other thing that seems out of place, so where does this leave us...?Now not that Neil Marshal would be a useless director, I just think he was the wrong guy to give this movie to. Or if this was his attempt to emerge as a ""serious"" movie maker maybe he should have refrained from the gore and give attention to the characters I guess.I'd wish he'd go back to movies with smaller scope, I want more of The Decent, where his abilities where sufficient and more then welcome. I just don't see any potential in him directing something of luminous range, if for nothing else, then for the fact that he can't get over himself with the gore. Well, on the other hand I guess this is what is expected from him.Unfortunately Centurion however turned out being rather forgettable.5/10",5.0,Anonymous,History
PICTISH WARS,"I thought the northern frontier of the Roman Empire in Britain might be an unusual and interesting setting for a historical military drama but, though it is novel to see centurions marching in the snow, it's really just another excuse for sped-up violence, cgi gore and unlikely warrior princesses. Worse, it's sloppy: Thanks to cgi, the enemy barbarians slash their Roman captive's chest. Then, in a later scene the next day, his chest appears without a trace of a gash! I can't watch a movie that insults my memory that much..",4.0,Anonymous,History
Government paid nationalist propaganda,"I have seen quite a few Communist China movies lately. And this is only a little bit more creative. A movie about the glorious past with god like creatures.
