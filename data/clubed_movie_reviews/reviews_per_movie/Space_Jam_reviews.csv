milestone of childhood,"This movie has defined generations. Kids loved it because this dude who was a good sports player got to play with these loony tones which is what the movie was all about. Its not about MJ, its not about Bugs Bunny, its not about a deep storyline or memorable characters. Its about fun and cartoons,which barely ever make sense, if you remember. Its great fun for the young folks out there, with animation that really is worth watching. Its entertainment for the entire family, combining real life with cartoons as its never done before. I love it, ill always love it. Looks like i have to add a few lines for this review to be accepted and posted. I really have nothing else to add, go ahead and watch it without expecting nothing more than fun and entertainment and you will get far more then you expect.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Nostalgia,"This movie is filled with nostalgia all the way back to 1996, back when having live action in an animated environment was mind blowing.The looney tunes are entertaining and Michael Jordan isn't that bad, the animation on the looney tunes weren't that bad either for 1996.This movie is just an interesting, fun and entertaining watch for the people who want to see the looney tunes.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"The Movie of My Childhood, and Still Today.","Arguably my favorite movie of All Time, Space Jam was an instant classic from the first time i laid eyes on it as an Infant. Even though you may not entirely understand everything that is going on in the movie at a Young age, it is still pretty easy to get into the movie.Not spoiling anything in this movie in this Review..but i will say that even today it is an entertaining Movie that i will pick up here and there and still have a fun time watching. Such a simple storyline, yet enjoyable down the years. Michael Jordan, Looney Tunes, and your classic cartoon villains trying to take over.This is just one of the Movies that, well...got me interested in movies. And that's why i gave it a 10. Not necessarily just because it was my favorite....it had a lot of elements that i simply enjoy. And on top of everything, its a movie about Basketball, which is something i'm passionate about.In all honesty, when it comes right down to it. I can only say one thing. If you haven't seen this movie yet, or even haven't watched it in a while. Go pick it up. You'll find yourself having a very entertaining time. Guaranteed.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Silly but hard to dislike,"Movie about Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes characters (Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Roadrunner etc etc). An evil animated monster runs Moron Mountain--a planet with an amusement park. They need a new ride so he sends five helpers to Earth to kidnap the Looney Tunes characters. Then they can be used as a new act at the amusement park. Bugs and the others agree--IF they play them in a basketball game and win. Bugs and the others convince Michael Jordan to help them--but the aliens have evil plans up their sleeve.Michael Jordan meets the Looney Tunes. Sounds like a sure recipe for disaster. I was positive this film was going to be a bomb when it was released (with HEAVY publicity) in 1996. Yes--it's silly but if you love Looney Tunes (like I do) you'll probably love this. The characters are treated (more or less) respectfully and during the climatic basketball game the stands are full of every Warner Bros. cartoon character ever made. One small mouse character who talks nonstop I remembered from childhood and I literally broke up laughing when he appeared! The animation is just great, the merging of live action with cartoon figures works and the script is fun. There are groaners and stupid lines but, all in all, it was pretty amusing.The debits: Michael Jordan just can't act. I'm sure he was a wonderful basketball player but his acting was as wooden as a basketball court. Also various other sports figures pop up and prove they're worse actors than Jordan! Bill Murray (who can be good) is just lousy in a supporting role. And Wayne Knight is just SO annoying. Also I could have lived without seeing the Warner Bros. logo popping up everywhere. At one point it's on Daffy Duck's butt...and he kisses it! And there's a brief take-off on ""Pulp Fiction"" which isn't as funny now as it was in 1996. So, these things lessen the movie but don't destroy it. Worth catching if you're a Warner Bros. animation fan. Kids will love it. I give it a 7.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
It's got game,"Space Jam is a very enjoyable movie featuring probably the most popular cartoon characters ever. The plot may seem rather weak to you and me, but let's not forget that this movie was made for children. Space Jam has all the humor of the classic shorts that made us love Bugs, Daffy and all the rest. Michael Jordan actually wasn't that bad in this movie, considering he is not a professional actor. Bill Murray was very hilarious. Thumbs up on this one.""That's all folks!""",,Anonymous,Animation
Hit em high (low),"What a soundtrack ... I just rewatched this to be ready for the new one ... and wow! I was quite blown away by all the songs on this, that I almost had forgotten about too. I've watched the new one too and while for me MJ is the one (you can feel differently about that, we can have different feelings on who is the GOAT, it's all good), when it comes to acting ... well LeBron is better for sure.That being said, in a movie like this, there is not much you have to do acting wise. What I did like is that MJ does not take himself too seriously. While he has serious moments in there - the sub story with his dad, that I am certain was very important to him - maybe not so important to viewers who are unaware, but it's a nice touch for sure - overall this is a funny affair.Add to that some really good actors who have some hits and misses with their jokes (I love Bill Murray, but certain scenes did not age well) - of course this completely ridiculous story (or shall I say ... ""looney""?) is aimed at a younger audience. A now maybe grown up audience that went ahead and watched the new one with their kids. It's been 25 years since this was released.There is some lessons to be learned here ... but overall you should watch it with a grain of salt .. and a lot of suspension of disbelief.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

I Was Entertained,"I notice a lot of people have very few kind words to say about SPACE JAM . I must admit that being a Scot I have little interest in basketball and know very little of the career of Michael Jordan ( Who's Michael Jordan ? ) but I still found this movie to be fair entertainment . I guess a lot of people dislike this movie because Mr Jordan played for such and such a basketball teamA bunch of evil aliens invade Looney Tunes World and cast the cartoon characters into slavery and it's left to a sports legend to save them ! Come on guys , plots don't come anymore original than that so what's there to dislike ? We also have a subplot of the aliens interfering with other basketball players which did cause some amusement to this audience member . Also very enjoyable were the number of cameos that crept up through the movie , most notably Bill MurrayOkay I wouldn't say SPACE JAM is as great as WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT but it's still an entertaining family movie regardless of how you feel about sport . With this in mind I'm totally puzzled why my local ITV station decided to broadcast it at 1.10 am !",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Big Macs for life,"How any critic can call Looney Tunes: Back in Action an exercise in franchise promotion but not puke at the 80-minute commercial that is Space Jam is beyond me.Our plot has Danny Devito play the voice of an evil, monster type businessman who's theme park is failing. In desperation he sends 5 little creatures to capture the Looney Tunes and bring them back as the new attraction.So...where is Looney Tune land? Apparently it's underground. And digging up any golf ball hole will eventually lead to it. When the Looney Tunes challenge the would-be kidnappers to a basketball game they kidnap Michael Jordan to be on their team.The quality of the film nosedives from here on. Jordan's acting is so wooden it's mahogany. He expresses no confusion, joy or surprise at being yanked into Looney Tune land and confronted by all the toons. 'Bugs Bunny you're a cartoon you're not real', he says in the most flat, boring and dullest way (missing commas intended as he doesn't use them).And then the big game follows. Once it's over, and there's no reason left to continue watching, the film goes on for another 10 minutes (to beef the running time up 'feature length') with the basketball/Jordan story. It's rubbish.It's no surprise that the film is directed by Joe Pytka (he's NOT Joe Dante that's for sure), a man who has never done any other features but over a 1000 TV ads, or something. Space Jam is nowt but 100% proof Warner whored out their most famous creation to make a few quick, and cheap, bucks. It's heartbreaking, heinous stuff.Casting Michael Jordan alongside the Looney Tunes is not inspired and imaginative. It's crass and desperate. Now they can attract sports fans AND kiddies. And Michael Jordan of all people! He's not a good actor and his fame outside of the U.S. is minimal to say the least. Moreso today.The only part of the film that comes (very, very remotely) close to the true spirit of the Looney Tunes is the score. James Newton Howard (a truly bizarre choice, how about Jerry Goldsmith, Bruce Broughton or even Danny Elfman) recognizes the classic Looney Tunes themes and uses them appropriately in certain moments but the rest of the score is generic and uninspired.Back in Action was intelligent, witty and satirical. Space Jam is corny, cheap and classless. It's an absolute travesty. How can we honestly take seriously a movie that has every cast member awe at Michael Jordan, has not too subtle product placement for McDonalds and has the Looney Tunes (one of the most ingenious creations in history) exploited in the most shameless and guilt free manner. With Space Jam, Warner showed that they'd cash in the Looney Tunes at a pawn shop for $5 if they could. A total lack of respect for Chuck Jones, Friz Freleng and Robert McKimson.And they don't even act Looney. The only laughs come from Bugs and Daffy. And it's sporadic and inconsistent. Producer Ivan Reitman (who has no experience and no business with this franchise) managed to convince Bill Murray to appear in this drek (for about 10 minutes) so the trailer could boast an ACTUAL star other than Jordan. Murray's performance is the bare minimum and has a let's-get-this-over-with feel (though Murray working below-par is still miles ahead of many other actors at the top of their game). His appearance in the film is massively oversold.It's just not fair that THIS is a big hit while Back In Action flopped horribly. I consider it the biggest miscarriage in justice ever. I still blame the marketing for Back in Action. It was bad, REAL bad. But still has some sort of quiet dignity about it when compared to the McDonalds promoted, in your face junk that was Space Jam's marketing. Is it any wonder Joe Dante had Back In Action nicknamed 'The Anti-Space Jam movie'?And just what the hell is a Space Jam anyway? It's not even set in Space!!!It took Warner 3 tries but the finally released the movie in its original aspect ratio. The DVD presents the film is 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen with pretty active Dolby 5.1 sound. There are loads of features but they are all fluff. Some 80's Looney Tunes shorts are included too.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
Simply Fun,"If you're looking for intelligent, high-brow comedy...what is WRONG with you, this is a LOONEY TUNES MOVIE!  Sheesh...this film is nothing outstanding, but it is simply fun.  I'm sure that Michael Jordan enjoyed star billing, but as is usually the case when your co-star is a cartoon rabbit with more than 50 years of experience behind him (and one of the best catch phrases in cinema), he is up-staged by Bugs Bunny.  Oh, not to say that Jordan turned in a poor performance.  Thank goodness this guy at least seems to have a good sense of humor.But there's some simple, pure enjoyment in watching this film.  I got a kick out of the big basketball game, and found the sequence with Bugs and Daffy retrieving Michael's lucky boxers to be a riot.  Yea, the plot is pretty hare-brained ('scuse me, Bugs...duck-brained;D), but it's nothing unworthy of Looney Tunes.  Don't ever forget that-this is a Looney Tunes film.  They got away with using anything for a plot, and this movie is in the same tradition.  It's like asking a movie about Beavis and Butthead to be artful and dramatic.  Looney Tunes represent the goofy side of animation, and this film adheres well to that philosophy.  I recommend this for any fan of Looney Tunes...oh yea, if your a sports fan, you should enjoy it too.  I, a mild basketball fan, really enjoyed myself.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A ""Monstarosity""","Space Jam could've been way better if they had made it more like the originals. But then Michael Jordan wouldn't have been needed in the film..

Good cartoon with plenty for adults  more than just selling products,"A group of aliens arrive in Loony Tune world and challenge the inhabitants to a battle for the ownership of that world.  Seeing the aliens are tiny, Bugs Bunny decides a game of basketball should be easily won.  However the aliens steal the talent from several NBA players and look set to win easily. However Bugs and Daffy kidnap Michael Jordan and ask for his help.At the time of release I must admit that I wasn't keen on seeing this film as the whole merchandising thing had left me with a sour taste in my mouth, putting me off the film.  Happy Meals and such were everywhere!  Later I saw it on TV, away from all the hype and found it enjoyable but not great.  The plot is silly, but who cares  it's a cartoon.  The comedy is good and has plenty for kids with the cartoon characters doing cartoon things, but also for adults.  The film is full of in-jokes for adults ranging from a 3 second spoof of Pulp Fiction to some really funny lines  `oh great, no one told me Dan Aykroyd was in this film' when Bill Murray makes an appearance, was my favourite.  Also as a big basketball (and Knick) fan it was fun to have tonnes of basketball stars make fun of themselves as well.However it is a cartoon at heart and I imagine that those who don't like pratfalls etc and aren't basketball fans won't be laughing all the time. Also, surprisingly for Jordan's first film, the basketball action is pretty poor.  I know it didn't have to be realistic but the great man is amazing enough in action without giving him amazing rubber arms etc with special effects.Jordan is good and is a better actor than others I've seen, but he is only playing himself and not that naturally either!  The support cast is where the money is and they all work well.  Whether it be the cartoon characters or adults they all do what they have to.  De Vito is funny and Randle is sexy but as usual Murray steals each and every scene he is in!Overall this manages to be more than a sales drive for Happy Meals (although the McDonalds product placement is a bit tasteless  hey! Just like the burgers!) and is an enjoyable film.  The kids will be happy with the cartoon element and most adults will like the in-jokes and the NBA players making jokes at their expense.",,Anonymous,Animation

Can you still watch even after decades? Yes.,"For those who watch the Looney Tunes from before, you may even like the plot that focuses on something simpler and more infatilooid, enough to entertain only the youngest and a story full of charisma with very characteristic classic characters, without even needing Michael Jordan be the highlight of the scenes because that wouldn't even be necessary.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Authentic fun on everyone's behalf,"NOTE: This film was recommended to me by Ryan Clevenger for ""Steve Pulaski Sees It.""Living in Illinois, Space Jam is a film that hits the tender spots of the last two generations; one generation that got to experience Michael Jordan's unfathomable legacy as arguably the greatest basketball player who ever lived, and the other, mine, that reflects on his legacy through highlights and documentaries to keep the memory of such an all-star alive. Jordan's legacy didn't stop at on-court talent, as he was one of the most marketed athletes of his time and helped popularize the NBA, let alone the Chicago Bulls, on a previously unforeseen international level.If we remove the nostalgia factor from Space Jam, which is a very difficult thing to do by the way, then the film serves as Jordan's versatility. After retiring from the NBA at a relatively young age to pursue a career in baseball, Jordan only became more of a fascinating person, in addition to someone with impeccable charisma. Space Jam exists as a response to Jordan's departure from the NBA to the MLB, as the Looney Tune gang of Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Tweety Bird, Sylvester the Cat, Porky Pig, and Lola Bunny all call Jordan out of retirement when they challenge a group of intergalactic invaders from ""Moron Mountain"" to a basketball game in exchange for the planet.The Looney Tunes thing this will be an easy win, until the aliens from Moron Mountain, who are relatively puny in size and strength, find a way to steal the talents of star basketball players like Charles Barkley and Larry Johnson and become the ""Monstars"" of the court. Meanwhile, Jordan agrees to play for the Looney Tunes team, but it takes all of the five minutes of practice to show that the team is disproportionately talented towards Jordan. As a result, the team indulges in some aggressive training tactics to beat the Monstars and save the planet.As an amalgamation of live-action and animation, especially in an age where Pixar was coming on the scene and traditional animation was soon to be phased out, Space Jam is bright and vivid. The real-life characters of Michael Jordan, Wayne Knight, who has an amusing role, like he always does, Larry Bird, and even Bill Murray's interactions with the animated characters of Bugs Bunny and the like in a convincing, believable manner. The result is a beautifully colored and nicely executed mix of whimsy.Because both worlds of reality and animation are explored here, Space Jam has the luxury of being a film that can go beyond traditional boundaries of a sports film, and the Looney Tunes are no better characters to incite such zaniness. The animated bunch are quick-witted and ecstatic, and Jordan is clearly doing this for fun and excitement rather than a phoned-in project or another endorsement. Had Space Jam been more of a lackluster cash-in, sports fans and Jordan fans would've seen it from a mile away and dismissed the film immediately. However, because everyone involved recognizes what a zany project this is, they don't try to fight the lunacy, but instead, play along, and that provides us, the audience, with a wickedly entertaining stride into a lively sports film that is so fun you almost, almost miss the clichéd underdog element.Starring: Michael Jordan, Wayne Knight, Bill Murray, and Larry Bird. Directed by: Joe Pytka.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Weird and fun,"It's barely has a plot and the visual effects and blending of live action with animated is weak and looks really dated but Space Jam is still enjoyably weird and fun with a unique charm. It's fast paced with a short run time and has enough funny moments to outweigh those that aren't. Michael Jordan gives a solid and charismatic lead performance, Wayne Knight is good and Bill Murray is a scene stealer. The soundtrack is great.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
What is the point of this film..?,"I must have watched this in 1996 and liked it when I was a kid but seeing it again all the nostalgia flies out the window...the 90s were so weird. The thinking mush have been: ""Michael Jordan is popular and we like money, so let's just make a flimsy, badly written vehicle to shoe horn him into a film and bingo! Dollars roll in! We just need some cartoon characters who are cheap...Disney won't do it. I know!! That sub group of characters...""The animation is dated, yes but just the concept of it wouldn't 'fly' now despite the theme tune. And why the looney tunes?? So bizarre seeing a sassy 1940s rabbit on the screen with a basketball player! What were they smoking in the late 90s??",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Silly and somewhat juvenile, but entertaining for what it is","I notice that there are people who like ""Space Jam"", but others who don't so much. While I think it has flaws, I think it is an entertaining and energetic film, not as good as ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" and ""Looney Tunes:Back in Action"" but an entertaining movie for Looney Tunes and basketball lovers(I admit I am more of a Looney Tunes fan). The story is a very nice idea, but there were parts when it was rather juvenile, likewise with some of the dialogue. Michael Jordan is a great athlete, and his skills are put to great use, but his acting isn't as impressive, it seems as though he is playing himself at times. Flaws aside, it is very funny with some great jokes and constant energy, and excellent supporting characters. Bill Murray, wearing clothes that you shouldn't ideally wear on a golf course, steals every scene he's in, and Danny DeVito is great fun as evil Swackhammer. The Looney Tunes are hilarious, especially Daffy, and technically with all the radiant colours the film works wonders. Overall, I like ""Space Jam"", it isn't Oscar worthy material, but it is fun to watch. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Shameful Mention,"What on earth were Warner Brothers thinking making this monstrosity of a movie called Space Jam? The director/producer should've been either bankrupt, or fired a very, very, very long time ago. This trainwreck of a movie has such a pointless plot, Wayne Knight was such an embarrassment in this movie, because all he did in this movie, was act so annoying and stupid. At least 3 years after, he had redeemed himself by doing the voice of Al, from Toy Story 2, I mean it's as simple as that. Bill Murray was an unnecessary choice for the movie, the villains were weak and pathetic, and Michael Jordan I understand he is a great basketball player, but he makes a terrible actor with this movie. Dr. Swackhammer was an annoying and a unimaginative villains in film history, the Nerdlucks don't even look like aliens at all, instead they look more like cockroaches that I could step on, and when they turn into Monstars, it doesn't get better, instead, it gets worse, because the Monstars are one of the weakest and most pathetic names ever for a basketball team along with the ToonSquad. And the Looney Tunes characters looks like that it comes from one of the Happy Meal boxes, and looks like bunches of ugly caricatures, and worse, the voice- acting sounds different, and doesn't even connect to the original Looney Tunes. That is a very bad excuse for Looney Tunes, and that's just shameful. It even makes the voices of Fanboy & Chum-Chum were slightly better than this. And also, not to mention, the two worst Looney Tunes characters are Tweety and Lola Bunny, I mean, why did those two had to appear in this trainwreck of a movie? This makes me wanna hate this movie even more, because not only are Tweety and Lola Bunny's the worst Looney Tunes characters ever, they are the most annoying cartoon characters ever, almost as annoying as Dora The Explorer. And not only that, there was a seen where they ripped-off one of the scenes from Walt Disney's Alice in Wonderland. Also, the jokes in it is absolutely miserable. It has no real jokes at all, all it is just a bunch of wretched jokes that makes one feel disgusted every time they here a cringeworthy jokes from this movie. This movie should've won some Razzie Awards for being the worst movie ever. The animation is horrible, the jokes are pathetic, the characters are annoying, the plot is repugnant, and the music is also suckish. This is the worst Looney Tunes ever next to Tweety's High-Flying Adventure that I had ever seen in my entire life. It's even worse than Shrek Forever After, which that sequel is bad, but not as bad as Space Jam. This movie will only entertain little kids and younger, and frustrates adults. This is one of those family films that you should stay away, if you wanna watch a much better family film, watch Ferdinand and The Greatest Showman. But, STAY, AWAY, from Space Jam, it is a terrible film. I give this movie a 1/10. Looney Tunes Back In Action was bad, but I will admit, it's not as bad as Space Jam, Space Jam is just a horrible excuse, and it just feels like a preschool affair.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
My Favorite Movie,"I have a reason of it being my fav. It is because this is THE first movie I remember seeing. This movie is great. I cant stop watching it. It mixes 2 of my favorite things........... Basketball and Cartoons. I'm glad Michael Jordan knows how to act well. Watching Bugs on the Bigscreen and as well as Roadrunner and Coyote was a real kick. I liked the fact that the plot was interesting as well as a killer soundtrack. I'm very glad I saw this movie because I'm never going to forget it. The Monstars were at points hilarious and also the hilarious Halftime Scene. (not to spoil a thing) I'm glad it ended on a happy note.

It has moments of comedy...but,"Space Jam was a movie that had some pretty good comedy at times. Watching Barkley get packed by a girl was laugh out loud funny...at times the looney tunes could get a few chuckles.The story wasn't half bad either, and the game (despite multiple rule violations that even made me as a kid question why the ref sucks) was entertaining.

Space Gem...,"To put it simply, ""Space Jam"" is the twice successful revival of Michael Jordan and Bugs Bunny's career.At 33, Jordan was past his prime and his controversial retirement following the death of his father, for a baseball reconversion, prompted Warner Bros studios to find a new vehicle to a necessary come-back. Meanwhile, the Looney Tunes were a milestone of TV and pop culture, but in the 90s, Bart and Homer Simpson had stolen a big chunk of their thunder, they had to deal with 3D competition, not to mention the eternal rivalry with Disney. Warner Bros studios never had their Renaissance and they never really mastered the world of animated feature to begin with.It's interesting that we're comparing one real character, who was perhaps the greatest and most iconic Michael of the 90s, after Jackson, and animated characters, but who would reduce Bugs Bunny to ink and paint? (And Daffy too) The legendary stinker and wisecracker (who was drawn that way) was the animated embodiment of Groucho Marx with a cooler look, perhaps the animated hero with the most personality before Bart. As a matter of fact, he's so good that if the film had been about Bugs visiting the human world, it would have worked as well. But then we wouldn't have Porky, Daffy, Tweety and all the gang and that would have been a shame because say what you want about Disney, zaniness isn't its strongest suit.And when you see how animation can ruin even the best animated characters, take the ""Tom and Jerry"" movies for instances, one should applaud the way the film respects the spirit of these old cartoons whose ""Merrie Melodies"" theme have been one of the most instantly identifiable music for all generations, a real hymn to the Golden Age of animation and beyond. Even as a kid who grew up with MGM and Disney, I found an odd little charm in the Looney Tunes and if I preferred Donald over Daffy, between Mickey and Bugs, there was no contest. Remember when the two titan rodents met in ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", equal screen time but who got the best line? Bugs!""Space Jam"" is no ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" however, but not every animation and live action crossover film has this pretension. Directed officially by Joe Pytka (Ivan Reitman is credited as producer), ""Space Jam"" is pretty straightforward in its marketing and since it decided to have a basketball player for the main role, it's obvious it didn't mean to sweep acting awards. But if Jordan is an amateur, his work is far beyond amateurish and the way he plays himself in a role that floats between two universes is remarkable. Working in a green screen and pretending to have interactions with some of the most beloved characters is a feat and his choice to play it straightforward as if he was mildly surprised is the right one, acting surprised might have put him in the way of his ""character"" and be a total distraction.Once Michael gets in Looney Tunes' land, he faces the deal and learns he must coach the Toons to win a game against the Monstars, previously known as the (far less intimidating) Nerdlocks, small creatures who took their height and talent from other basketball icons: Patrick Ewing, Shawn Bradley, Charles Parker and Muggsy Bogues. So, there's not just Jordan's freedom at stakes but the career of four players and the whole future of the NBA jeopardized by an animated crook named Swackhammer and voiced by Danny De Vito. The plot is spiced up by two other characters who'd have nothing to do: Wayne Knight as an obsessed (almost enamored) publicist and Bill Murray playing himself as a guy who wants to have a shot at the game. That these characters end up serving purpose is a joke, but there's nothing better than a comedy that doesn't take itself seriously, it's all a matter of pay-offs.And that's the spirit of the cartoon. The animation looks like something borrowed from an ad for Sprite of Nike but the film has no pretension either to hide its marketing value, there's even a scene where Daffy reminds that they are property of Warner Bros and a few other comments involving copyrights and ""take that"" nods to Disney. The film makes money through sponsors with the same wit than ""Wayne's World"" product placement but that's because everything is a product placement when you have characters not with names but brand names. But Jordan brings life to what could have been a dull and average performance and instead of showing off as the player with skills, he only becomes the guy who has fun playing with toons, avenges Tweety, act like a coach or a toon. Anyway, he's having fun and so are we.The film has an enthusiasm that is communicative and catching and reminds of these times when everything was simpler even in its corniness, Jordan may not be the best actor but he's a presence as valuable as the other giant and he doesn't even try to overdo it, and it works, everyone plays his part perfectly and that goes for Bill Murray too. There's no message, no patronizing statement, though the human story carries a few drama elements and one can't ignore how magic and transporting ""I Believe I Can Fly"" works. Another 90s gem at a time where R. Kelly was still popular.Still, even if the film grossed a quarter billion dollar, it didn't have the same lasting success like a Disney blockbuster or its obvious counterpart ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", maybe that's the limit of the marketed silliness, at the end, it lacks the universal touch, the timeless value, the fairy dust. Even the character of Lola Bunny was an interesting addition but a Jessica Rabbit she wasn't. It's certainly a pure product of the 90s, an era I'll forever cherish, my teen years, but it's a product nonetheless.That's all, folks!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A good movie.,"This movie was intended to be a kid's movie! And all of us MJ fans alike respect the movie simply because he was in it. The acting wasn't bad -- it was just on a children's level... of which it was intended! I really liked Space Jam when I was younger, I still like the movie from time to time, even. So saying it is like a Muppets movie is absurd! I do agree that Marvin the Martian should have been the villain, mainly because DeVito's character got on my nerves.

This one plays more like a Muppets movie.,"This movie was really bad.  The only saving graces are Bill Murray and Larry Bird's all to brief appearances.  We have definitely found something Jordan can't do and that is act.  That is kind of bad considering he is playing himself in this one.  Though most of his costars weren't there, so it might have been difficult.  At least he stopped after this one unlike Shaq who made four or five pictures...Thank God Phil Jackson came along and refocused him.  As for the plot being like a Muppets movie it is.  A few appearances here and there from a surprise celebrity, the whole working with live actors.  It just did not seem to be a Looney tunes movie.  Though they stopped being Looney a long time ago.  I liked Daffy Duck when he was, well, daffy...he has been smart aleck duck for a while now.  It just doesn't feel right.  All the Looney Tunes on one team, some being life long enemies...and what is the point of introducing the bad guy voiced by I think Danny DeVito. The Martian has always been trying to take over the world, why not just let it be him.  Also, what is up with the girl bunny?  Why introduce a new character?  I guess we just had to be politically correct.  Well this one may be good for the kiddies, but most of us are going to recognize it for what it is...one long commercial.  I saw a clip from the next Looney Tunes movie and it is even more Muppet looking than this one",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
Slam Dunk For Bugs,"One of my earliest inspirations was Bugs Bunny and the Warner Bros. Looney Tunes.  This movie brings back all the favorites.  And not just Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and the other stars.  This movie features every character that ever appeared in a Warner Bros. cartoon.  Your eyes are certainly kept busy looking for each one!

"Cute, colorful, and funny, but so what?","Honestly, what is there to this movie, other than Michael Jordan making lots of money with the help of the Looney Tunes?  I've seen Looney Tunes cartoons that had more to them than this!  This movie is enjoyable, yes, with lots of laughs and colorful animation, but so what?  What's the point?  Is there one?  And howcome I'm the only person on the IMDB who doesn't seriously like this movie?  It's entertaining, but where's the plot?  The old Looney Tunes had Elmer Fudd hunting for wabbits.  Those cartoons had more than this movie does.  It's a brainless, plotless, potentially pointless event that has all of the Looney Tunes helping Michael Jordan play basketball against aliens from outer space.  Catchy idea for a Looney Tunes short, but not a whole movie!  ""Beavis and Butt-head Do America"" had more to it than this!  What amazes me the most is that the critics loved it.  I don't get it.  It was entertaining, but that's it!  Nothing else involved or achieved.  After this, Michael Jordan literally lived on all of the commercials with Looney Tunes in them.  The network TV premiere ads called this a ""one-time, unforgettable, major event"".  What?!  This a major event?!  It just amazes me that people go to the movies, simply to turn their minds off and watch meaningless and pointless box-office glitter!  I guess this was made for kids, but I've seen children's movies that made more sense than this!  Or they probably made it to make Michael Jordan an extra bag of money(not that he doesn't already have enough money).  Oh well, ""Space Jam"" is out there, proving to the world that if you have Michael Jordan, the Looney Tunes, and no plot, you can actually channel it onto celluloid and make tons of money off of it!",,Anonymous,Animation
A movie I'll make my kid watch so he subliminally decides to get into basketball,"I saw this at the cinemas when it came out with a bunch of my homies...a scary thought.The movie (I'm reviewing this as if it was an ordinary movie) revolves around the pending basketball match between the Looney Tunes characters (Daffy Duck, Road Runner, Tweety Bird etc) and the characters from Moron Mountain. You see Moron Mounatin, located in outer space, is struggling for patrons, so the boss decides to try to kidnap the Looney Tunes guys. In a shrewd move, Bugs Bunny manages to stave off the kidnapping by getting them to agree to a basketball match to decide their fate. If his squad loses, the Looney Tunes characters move to Moron Mountain as entertainers forever. If they win, they are free. Sounds fair. But then the Moron Mountain squad decides to play dirty and goes and steals the talents of some of the NBA elite. The Looney Tunes manage a coup of their own, signing up the greatest player ever, Michael Jordan. The teams train and prepare for the biggest games of their lives. What will be the Looney Tunes fate? See it and find out! Entertaining enough, but pretty cheesy. Some good cameos from some NBA stars (Barkley,Ewing etc) and some entertainment greats. Confusing a bit for kids, but they'll get it in the end.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Falling in the shadow of what preceded it and relying on its heightened USP to drive its shoddy narrative, Space Jam just abouts gets by on novelty and energy.","It's difficult to find a stone wall resting place upon which to perch one's self in regards to Space Jam, a film with an immense amount of charm in its thrashing together of live action sporting super stars and the Looney Tunes brigade, although it does come with an equal amount of flaw. This is not, of course, the first time we've seen live action and animation blend together like this; 1988's Who Framed Roger Rabbit is the film that immediately springs to mind, and throughout Space Jam it is tough to rid it from one's head once it's in there. The bad news is that Space Jam is a film which needs its cartoonified contingent in order to be at all interesting, whereas you're able to get so wrapped up in Who Framed Roger Rabbit that it's easy to forget you're even watching a live action cross-pollination. In short: you could remove the animated characters from Bob Zemeckis' minor masterpiece and still be caught up in a central character confronting his grief; alcoholism and prejudices as a twisting, adult narrative unfolds around him. Remove the 'toons from this similarly pitched 1996 effort, and you get the likes of Michael Jordan mugging his way through some awkward green-screen routines and a dull circular narrative about him rediscovering his love for the game of basketball.Ah, yes: Michael Jordan. There are certain personalities in certain sports you've just ""heard of"", regardless of the sport in question. At the time of the film's production, names synonymous with the likes of golf, tennis and football might very well have been Nicklaus; Sampras and Pele – in Jordan (of whom even I have heard, and I know nothing of the game of basketball) we have a mainstream figure dropped into the centre of a film arriving will all the baggage; hysteria and reputation that comes with him on top of that buzz of seeing cartoon characters that have been famous for as many as three times the number of years Jordan has even existed. Indeed, in case you were not already aware: Jordan is a superstar; a man whose achievements in basketball open the film in montage format. We observe the trophies he's won, the millions of adoring fans he's garnered and even the Olympic medals he's picked up.Jordan, however, is tired of basketball; a premise to this ""character's"" existence which might ordinarily be greeted with scoffing and furrowed brows as this stinking rich superstar slumps into an apparent pit of discontent at a life of being suffocated by those around him and adorned just a tad too much by his peers. That is, if we weren't already aware he did indeed grow weary of said lifestyle and thus moved briefly into baseball. Meanwhile, narrative and conflict arrives in the form of a slimy alien creature voiced by Danny de Vito; an alien who owns a theme park on a planet many moons away. He's in monetary trouble, and proposes to his equally bug-like accomplices that they travel to Planet Earth; warp their way, somehow, into our television sets (which apparently hold the key to entry into the programmes aided therein); kidnap an array of the Looney Tunes and bring them back so that they may act as a permanent feature to the theme park, thus reigniting business.So far, so Looney. The 'toons have an issue with being thrust from their home in order to be taken to somewhere else so that they may perform the same gags over and over again to an ogling audience.....wait-a-second, isn't that what they do anyway? In light of it all, they propose a basketball match with the gribblies: if they win, they stay here; if they lose, they'll pack up and come with them for eternal slavery. Thudding into the narrative hub lumbers Jordan, a basketball player the 'toons recruit equating to certain success, right? Not necessarily: the small, slug like aliens steal the ""talents"" of various then NBA professionals before growing themselves to a larger scale into order to win the bet.The film is mostly underdog fluff, but underdog fluff made a little more interesting than usual with the presence of people such as Yosemite Sam and Daffy Duck going up against these third party extra-terrestrials, furthermore aided by that basketball player you've probably heard of and that bloke out of Jurassic Park and Basic Instinct. The film's droll liberal agenda dominates proceedings more than any sort of interest in the result or anything else; this is ultimately a film about people and creatures from all walks of life coming together and working as a team, whereas the only ""winner"" (without giving anything away) is basketball (or more specifically: ""sports"") itself. The framework about Jordan playing for a cause as worthy as the one wherein he defends a group of little animals from hulking monsters, thus rediscovering his love for the game of basketball, is as meek and as plodding as it sounds whereas one scene wherein a character verbally runs through all the companies & products Jordan has previously endorsed is disturbingly ambiguous in regards to whether it's lampooning how much Jordan has sold out or is just guilt edged product placement. No matter, the film is a blast; the match itself is constructed with energy and verve, while the makers manage to slide in a new Warner Brother's Looney Tune altogether in the form of Lola Bunny - someone who's fresh and fun and doesn't discredit the old guard. Like most of these sorts of things, you'd need to be pretty sniffy to not enjoy it. I went with it, and enjoyed it.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

"""Air and hare - What a Concept""","During the year 1994, Michael Jordan was set to retire from the game of basketball, when he got the idea of going on to play professional baseball.  One year later, he was given the opportunity to act in front of the camera (as himself, of course) and retain his marksmanship of playing the game of B-Ball.  The 1996 animated/live-action release of ""Space Jam"" shows a bit of both.Who would of thought that his supporting actors would be the most recognizable, brilliant and crazy co-stars Bugs Bunny and the Looney Tunes themselves?  Ivan Reitman can, since the director of ""Ghost Busters"" produced the family feature at a cost of $100 million dollars plus, almost three times the amount it cost to create the walt Disney masterpiece, ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit,"" which ""Space Jam"" tried to compare to, but received lukewarm results.It's really interesting to see for the first time that the entire Looney Tunes bunch come to the big screen in a while, especially now when the use of digital effects for the film by Kodak's Cinesite Studios (U.S. and U.K.) make it fun to see.  But few of the cartoon gags, jokes and pranks (perfectionized by Chuck Jones, Friz Freleng, Robert McKimson and others during the heyday of Warner Bros. cartoons in the 40's and 50's) are rarely seen in the film.  Plus the weak dialogue the Mon-Stars talk out with (the script penned by Leo Benvenuti, Steve Rudnick, Tim Harris and Herschel Weingrod) can't compare well to thew wit and humor exemplified by Jeffery S. Price and Peter Seaman in ""Roger Rabbit"" in 1988, which makes the outcome seem disappointing. But the addition to the cute, sexy and dazzling Lola Bunny to the Looney Tunes roster, who can now be seen on almost every detail of merchandise you see in stores with Bugs and company, and hopefully in feature cartoons, still makes it all the more fun to look at.The fact that `Space Jam' was based on the successful 1991 Nike commercial pairing Air Jordan and the wabbit together, somehow make up the reason that the movie only earned $90 million nationwide out of its $100 milion budget, (it did, however, exceed $225 million worldwide altogether, so that helps.)  Nonetheless, Space Jam is worth seeing, if you don't mind that it's an attempt to score the winning basket, be it a winning franchise, that is.Rating: 3 stars out of 5NOTE: The Two-Disc Special Edition DVD of the 1996 release of Warner Bros. Entertainment's `Space Jam' is coming everwhere to stores late October 2003.

I loved it as a kid ...,"Michael Jordan . Bugs Bunny . Together in one movie . Which kid could resist that ? I still remember how I laughed as a kid , when I was watching this movie for the first time. I did watch it at least a couple of times and I still have good memories regarding it . So , I was surprised not in a positive way when I saw the not too good rating (5.9) of ""Space jam"" here on IMDb. Also while surfing the web I often found not too many pleasant comments from other people about this movie . It gave me motivation to find some free time to watch ""SJ"" and confront my childhood's memories with reality. After all many things that we've liked as kids aren't that good when we look at them from the point of view of adult.So , I've seen the movie for the first time since childhood . And you know what ? The film itself lacks either the energy or the visual invention that the Chuck Jones originals had. For visual humour, it tends to substitute one-liners and lame pop culture in-jokes.""Space jam"" not only has Michael Jordan and Bugs Bunny in it , but also Wayne Knight (""Jurassic park"") , Bill Murray (""Ghostbusters"") , famous basketball players ( Larry Johnson , Charles Barkley, Patrick Ewing ) and all the Looney tunes characters .""Space jam"" also introduces original characters to the audience – the aliens ( Moonstars) and Lola . I must say that I love Lola . She's a great original Looney Tunes character . She's a wonderful partner for Bugs , yet she has her own personality. I wish that Warner Bros would use her in the future , especially if the will make new Looney Tunes cartoons. The aliens are also nice . Moonstars look funny as the caricatures of famous basketball players . The certainly are memorable villains , just like their boss.The animation looks alright to me . Only the CGI alien amusement park has dated badly . Joe Pytka directs the movie like a normal movie with some cartoon elements in it instead of choosing Joe Dante way in ""Looney tunes back in action"" and making it a live action cartoon.In terms of acting Bugs and team are the best . Murray and Knight give a fun performance . Jordan and others are OK since they basically playing themselves.The soundtrack is good with great songs like : R. Kelly "" I believe I can fly "" , Seal ""Fly like eagle "" , Coolio , LL Cool J and Method Man ""Beat them up"".""Space Jam"" is a feature-length expansion of a Pepsi commercial that paired Bugs Bunny and NBA star Michael Jordan.

"MJ and Bugs slam dunk in ""Space Jam""","I saw ""Space Jam"" the first day it was released in November of '96. I was eight years old, and of course like any child, I loved it.

Jordan's acting ain't that great but nonetheless I can still sit down and watch the whole movie, and love every minute of it.  What upsets me about this movie is that it is hard to find on DVD.

Michael Jordan in a jam,"Space Jam has become sort of a cult film for kids now and many of them probably only know Michael Jordan from this film and not for all his real life achievements as a sports star.It's not as funny as I remember it being as a kid, but it's certainly enjoyable enough fare, with some nice moments.The basketball game does go on a bit too long though, and the ending feels a bit rushed because of this.It is a film though that has taken on a bit of a cult status, and it will be interesting to see how the recently released sequel shapes up in comparison.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Actually the worst,"I tried watching this for the first time in 2016. I'm a fan of nineties cheese, so I thought this would be a good watch. Boy, was I wrong!This is just bad. Not bad in a funny way. Not bad in a so bad it's good way. Just a hard watch. The animation is ugly. There are parts that were done in a 3D that looked like a 1994 screen saver. There were attempts at making the characters look more 3D using an airbrushing effect that had the effect of making them look like they had the bevel effect applied in Photoshop. Despite coming out a whole eight years after Who Framed Roger Rabbit it somehow were much worse at integrating live actors with the animation. Heck, I think Mary Poppins probably did a better job in the sixties.The Mel Blanc impressions were incredibly jarring, with dialogue that made Chuck Jones cringe. Not Billy West's proudest moment I must say. The movie takes itself way too seriously, and the product placement is so clumsy one scene is literally just a character reading out sponsors. There's no punchline, no self-referential wink and it doesn't even go on for long enough to make it a joke.At least these days, the 90s hip hop and R&B soundtrack has a certain charm where at the time it was meant to capitalise on what the cool kids were listening to at the time.Not sure how could manage to make Looney Tunes so soulsuckingly dreary and unfunny, but there you have it: The worst product of cynical marketing towards kids.

MJ and Bugs do well in Feature Film Effort!,"An export from the sports arena is teamed up with animated Warner Brothers characters! Michael Jordan: one of the all-time greats on the hardwood debuts on the big-screen. In reality the cartoon characters are not really there! He is basically in a room by himself responding to voices! Acting in this environment would be difficult enough for a veteran actor; but would be close to impossible for someone else.Audiences were used to seeing ""Air Jordan"" teamed up with the animated Warner Brothers characters in ""Nike"" and ""McDonalds"" endorsements; so a feature film would not be so far fetched! Someone at Warner Brothers had to write a feature film in an effort to attract kids and MJ fans into the cineplexes! the WB is not quite as versed in kidddie fair as their Disney competitors, but they did a decent job at putting this one together. They also had to cater to kids short attention spans by devising a simple plot. However it earned a ""PG"" rating because of it's mild violence!This movie would not be the best barometer for Jordan's acting ability because he spends two-thirds of the flick interacting with characters that he couldn't see! Fortunately he did better at this than he did playing baseball!",,Anonymous,Animation

Bit of a stretch.,"'Space Jam (1996)' follows Michael Jordan as he's recruited by the Looney Tunes to help them win their freedom, via a basketball match, from their would-be enslavers, a group of similarly 2D extra-terrestrials who are enhanced with the basketball skills of various other NBA players. Oh, and Bill Murray is involved, too. Needless to say, it's a really weird concept for a movie. It's both a sports drama and a family comedy, a well-done live-action/2D animation hybrid with potentially contrasting target audiences. Though it's a bit slow to get going, it eventually picks itself up and becomes a rather enjoyable time. It works best when Jordan is firmly in the land of the Looney Tunes, though some elements involving other starring-as-themselves basketball players also provide a couple of chuckles. It's silly, but that's the point. It's also relatively accomplished from a technical standpoint, with most of its visual effects holding up remarkably well - although some of its full CG body doubles are a little disconcerting and the 'soft' look of the cartoon characters takes a little getting used to. It's a goofy, easy-to-watch experience with a fair bit of charm to it. It isn't great, but it's good enough. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Why, Bugs?  Why?","Way, WAY back in high school, I took an animation class over the summer, and everyone in the class, myself included, were huge fans of the classic Warner Brothers cartoons.  They were, essentially, the very reason we were all into animation in the first place, and we were all a bit upset about the current sneaker commercials that featured the characters playing second-fiddle to athletes.  So, as you might imagine, when one student mentioned that he had heard a rumor that they were going to make a *movie* based on the commercials, we took the news in the same way lots of people reacted to the ""Star Wars Episode II"" rumor that Boba Fett may turn out to be JarJar Binks in disguise.I could totally rip this movie apart, but I don't happen to have the energy. Just know that, indeed, the classic Bugs Bunny we all know and adore would need *NO* help in defeating the (ergh) ""Mean Team"".  (OH, hahaha!  I get it! Oh, brilliance!  Oh rapturous laughter such a pun hath generated!)  I can also sum up, in two words, the gut-wrenching, toe-curling, fan-pooping-on badness of this *thing*:  Lola Bunny.  Yes, even the once totally anarchic Looney Tunes must bow to (cringes) Political Correctness and have a Strong Female Character retrofitted into their world.

Michael Jordan and Looney Tunes join forces to beats a group of aliens called the morons. Who've come to earth to enslaved the Looney tunes as attractions for their home moron mountain. The tunes recruit Jordan whose reluctant to return to basketball, after taking up his career in baseball. This movie is 90 subpar comedy where it's bad but tries to be quirky.

Pretty pathetic,"I was kinda looking forward to seeing Space Jam, ever have since I was a kid, but for some reason I never got the opportunity to see it. Well, my friend owned the movie and lent it to me, I love Looney Toons, they're just so cool and funny and I remember being a huge fan of the Chicago Bulls, so I was very excited to see this film. There is one thing I forgot, this is not 1996, the height of popularity for Michael and The Bulls and this movie seemed like a cheap publicity stunt.Michael is playing himself from the time where his father had died in that car accident and decided to join a baseball team, despite the fact that it's not the Sox represented in the film, which is the team he really played for. But the toons are invaded by aliens who want them for their amusement park in space. They challenge them to a basketball game, of course the toons suck, so they ask for Michael's help.Over all, Space Jam is just a cheap thrill for some, but for me it really wasn't all that. I was really disappointed and not to mention, keep Michael away from the big screen, because I hate to spill the beans, he's not that good of an actor. It's a pretty bad film, even if it is for kids.3/10",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
I loved this movie infinitely as a child,"If you look at the movie as an adult then you realize that nostalgic goggles have covered a lot. For example, that the story is a bit stupid that most of the seats are not so funny, it has just about all the typical sports movie clichés from the book that the Looney Tunes are more weird than really crazy and funny in the cartoon and the humor Michael Jordan as the other athletes can not actors.But this does not matter to us all because this movie is fun from start to finish the effects are pretty silly and that helps the movie and the fast paying the interaction between the real people and the cartoon characters is pretty good and is pretty much even during the basketball game seamless, you can make a game of how many cameos in this movie occur in both the cartoon characters and the actors and I still love it.Already as a child, I found the feelings in this film between Lola Bunny and Bugs Bunny really strange and wondered if they were just a couple because they are both rabbits now as an adult is that a bit more unpleasant because you know the devintart anyway I am thankful to this day that this character was invented and you can also see it as a career as it began.

For example, that the story is a bit stupid that most of the seats are not so funny, it has just about all the typical sports movie clichés from the book that the Looney Tunes are more weird than really crazy and funny in the cartoon and the humor Michael Jordan as the other athletes can not actors.But this does not matter to us all because this movie is fun from start to finish the effects are pretty silly and that helps the movie and the fast paying the interaction between the real people and the cartoon characters is pretty good and is pretty much even during the basketball game seamless, you can make a game of how many cameos in this movie occur in both the cartoon characters and the actors and I still love it.Already as a child, I found the feelings in this film between Lola Bunny and Bugs Bunny really strange and wondered if they were just a couple because they are both rabbits now as an adult is that a bit more unpleasant because you know the devintart anyway I am thankful to this day that this character was invented and you can also see it as a career as it began.

"Simple Looney Tunes Fun,","Space Jam is a great movie with a well written plot, a great cast and immensely talented voice cast. This movie is certainly nothing fantastic, the story is far fetched even for Looney Tunes standards and it does not deliver any memorable lines like we've seen in many of their well known cartoons. However, I have seen this many times and still love it to this day, it was a big movie from my childhood and it is certainly great nostalgia. The movie does hold up pretty well as a great family film, obviously people of all ages love the Looney Tunes, I find it impossible to not feel joy when Bugs Bunny or Daffy Duck are onscreen, and watching them play basketball with the surprisingly good actor and professional basketball player Michael Jordan, who has a great presence on screen, against a group of aliens is fun and enjoyable from start to finish. Comedic actors such Bill Murray and Wayne Knight are more fun for adults and provide some great one liners. Watch it with the whole family and just forget about real life for 90 minutes, the whole house will get a great kick out of Space Jam.Michael Jordan plays a basketball game with Bugs Bunny and the rest of the Looney Tunes against a group of aliens that are looking to keep them as slaves for their theme park.Best Performance: Michael Jordan",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"So Totally, Horribly Wrong-Headed...","Let's get one thing straight right off the bat: Bugs Bunny would not need ANYONE's help in defeating a bunch of goofy basketball playing aliens.  Bugs Bunny could take on the entire universe with one hand behind his back and win...without Michael Jordan's help.God, how I hate this movie.  How I loathe and despise it.  It somehow manages to get the spirit of the classic WB characters totally wrong with animation that lacks any of the charm and style the the classics had.  It manages to spend 90 minutes making Bugs, Daffy and the rest lest interesting and less compelling than they were in a 6-minute short 50 years ago.Michael Jordan, at the very least, is an entertaining, engaging screen presence.  I can't exactly call him an ""actor,"" as he doesn't really play a role...but he is entertaining.  It's just too bad that he's surrounded by such aimless, annoying dreck.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
Jammed,"The big Looney Tunes fans awaits the long awaited Space Jam sequel. Family sports movies was at it's peak in the 1990's with The Sandlot, Space Jam. and more. An odd mix of live action and old toons gainst raw aliens including a classic soundtrack.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Space Jam,"Space Jam is a film directed by Joe Pytka that stars Michael Jordan, Wayne Knight and the Looney tunes in which the Monstars challenge the Looney Tunes to a game of basketball who in turn recruit the now retired Michael Jordan for help. Space Jam is something of a cult classic is most film circles and while I can see the appeal it has at least from a pop culture standpoint, I can't see that appeal from a filmmaking standpoint. The plot doesn't really have character development beyond Michael Jordan at least as characters mature through their issues really just because the script says they do. Speaking of the script, it is littered with repetitive dialogue, product placement and one-dimensional and obnoxious characters both human and animated. I really feel that these Looney Tunes work better in a quick 15 minute or half an hour show because their humor doesn't wear out in that time frame the way it does over the length of a film. Now on a more positive note, I have to say that I do enjoy the music in the film and when the tunes are at their looniest the animation is stellar but even the animation led itself to some pretty awful editing during the third act. The third and first acts of this film felt incredibly short as well as the second act dragged on and on and while this film was an hour and a half long it felt like two hours and fifteen minutes. If you enjoyed this film, I understand why as there are elements of appeal that exist here and even I can't deny that but I also can't deny that this film had plenty of problems and while I didn't go into this film expecting it to be a masterpiece or a game changer, I expected it to be at least decent and entertaining and for me, it was inconsistent and forgettable.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
"It's a Jam. (What does that mean, anyway?)","There's a great scene far into ""Space Jam,"" when comedian Bill Murray makes an unbilled appearence at a basketball game with Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes. An alien creature (voiced by Danny DeVito) says, ""Hey! I didn't know Dan Aykroyd was in this picture!"" Bill Murray helps out the Looney Tunes team and then leaves the scene. But he comes back later again at the end when Larry Byrd takes a seat next to Bill, who, watching Michael Jordan dribbling the ball on court, says, ""That coulda been me.""Humor like that comes in abundance during ""Space Jam,"" a fun family film that has been ridiculed by critics and audiences alike for, as far as I can see it, no purpose whatsoever. Roger Ebert saw the side of the movie that I saw in ""Space Jam,"" and that is an energetic motion picture that is fun for both the adults and kids in the audience.I saw ""Space Jam"" in the theater when it was released. I think it was a good choice. There was a lot of laughter and a lot of joy in the cinema--kids were laughing at certain physical gags and adults were laughing at in-jokes referencing such subjects as Michael Jordan's sports career to political humor to Bill Murray humor like mentioned above.Daffy Duck has always been my favorite Looney Tune, and he's given the usual treatment here. Take the scene when his team is introduced. Claps echo from the stadium until he walks out into the court. You can hear a pin drop it's so silent. People accuse this of being a cheap film made to boost Michael Jordan's career (which would end and then spark again in the years to come).""Space Jam"" opens with Michael Jordan as a young boy shooting hoops outside his home in North Carolina. We skip forward years later and, during the opening credits, see flashes of him soaring through the air in pairs of Air Jordans. Then the movie really starts: Michael has retired from basketball, taking up a career in baseball. Needless to say, he's not too great at baseball--and we're given good proof of that.Then Bugs Bunny drops in for a visit from the cartoon world. A pack of aliens has challenged the Tunes to a basketball game, and if they lose, something catastrophic happens (don't blame me for not remembering, folks). Little did the Tunes know when they agreed to the bet that the space creatures would steal the talent from NBA players and morph into huge, skilled b-ball players.So Michael Jordan strikes a bet with the aliens in Tune World. If they lose, they have to give their powers back to his NBA friends. If he loses, he is their slave for eternity. (Or until he dies in the next forty years.)Fun comes in big doses for this film. I understand how some people could be turned off by the way Michael Jordan is treated as a god and becomes the highlight of the entire motion picture, as if he is the primary star and the Tunes are just there for comedy relief. But, folks, that really is the point of this movie. The Looney Tunes are getting their own movie soon with Brendan Fraser. But in ""Space Jam,"" they are merely sidekicks to Michael Jordan--co-stars, if you wish to say. But they do provide some great comic relief, as does Bill Murray and Wayne Knight. And Michael Jordan playing basketball in a cartoon world with no limits? No way!The Tunes' world is brought to life through great animation, and as ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" contributed to the animation genre, ""Space Jam"" adds its own touch, too. I liked this flick. Michael Jordan is in it a bit too much--who cares? After all, there's a reason he's on all the posters.And Daffy Duck is still better than Bugs Bunny.4/5 stars.John Ulmer",,Anonymous,Animation

"This is far from an all time great animated picture in the Who Framed Roger Rabbit mold, but is still a great and fun family film","Space Jam (1996) is a movie we recently watched as a family on HBOMAX. The storyline involves the toons being in trouble when some toons from another galaxy arrive and threaten to ruin their world and enslave them. They invaders challenge the toons at a game of basketball and cheat by stealing the skills from current NBA players. The toons only hope is to kidnap Michael Jordan and beg for him to play on their team and save their existence. This movie is directed by Joe Pytka (Lets it Ride) and stars Michael Jordan, Bill Murray (Ghostbusters) and Theresa Randle (Bad Boys). The storyline for this is fun and does a great job of creating villains and tying it back into what is happening back in the real world and outside of toon land. The villains and their set-up might be the best part of this picture. The jokes and interactions of the players whose skills were stolen had me cracking. It is so fun seeing the toons interacting together all in one environment instead of within their own storylines. Bill Murray's cameos are fantastic and the ending was great and a fun way to wrap up the movie. Overall this is far from an all time great animated picture in the Who Framed Roger Rabbit mold, but is still a great and fun family film. I would score this a 6.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fun/Entertaining,"This is one of the movies I would watch as a kid. It seems like a lot of the people on these IMDb message boards and reviews for this movie Space Jam are around the same age I am and remember watching this movie when we were younger. My parents still have this movie on VHS, and I remember giving it to my older sister for her 17th Birthday, but I don't think she ever really watched it, or maybe once. Whenever I watch this movie, it's a trip down Memory Lane. I still remember it pretty well from when the movie was new and when I was a kid watching it on VHS.Here is what makes this movie interesting. Well, there are lots of sports movies including certain sports movies for kids. From what the internet tells us, this movie is still the highest grossing basketball movie to date, and keep in mind this movie is almost 20-years old. In this movie, we get to see real basketball players who play themselves. Obviously, the main one Michael Jordan. We also have Charles Barkley, Patrick Ewing, Mugsy Bogues, Larry Johnson, and Shawn Bradley. We also have Bill Murray in this movie who plays a character with the same name, but not supposed to be the same person.What makes this movie entertaining. Well, Michael Jordan was talked about more in the '90s. He doesn't seem talked about so much anymore. But, I think that was nice of him to star in a fun entertaining movie where the target audience was kids. Kids being able to see their hero in an entertaining 1.5 hour movie. This movie wasn't a documentary featuring him or a movie about his life, but a movie for entertainment. Yeah, it's a movie featuring Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes. We've all seen the Looney Tunes cartoons, Merry Melodies and those cartoons are from decades ago, but we still remember the characters and the sound effects including the sound effects where a character like Wile. E. Coyote falls off a cliff. That sound effect sounds like a bomb being dropped from a military plane. It's just cool seeing a plot involving Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes, and the movie will definitely keep us entertained and our eyes on the screen.So, I enjoy watching this movie. It still entertains me as an adult. With sports movies that have been made and ones that will be eventually make for kids, we can ask which one will come out next? I believe there is a Space Jam 2 in the works. But, if they could make a certain sports movie for kids, this is one I'd love to see becoming a film even though I doubt it will become one. The funniest book I've read in my entire life is a 1993 book called, The Toilet Paper Tigers by Gordon Korman. I crack up while reading it and in terms of reading I'd recommend it for you if you like reading. With coming up with new ideas for sports films, that would be awesome if they did a well done version of that book into a movie.To conclude, if you want to relive your childhood days, or the days when Michael Jordan was a bigger athlete, you can watch this film. You most likely will consider it Fun/Entertaining!!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
pleasant watch,"Space Jam is a good entertaining movie. I am a huge basketball fan so there was no way i could have missed this film. Still i expected much more from it. The story is probably known by everyone who got to read this. Bugs, Daffy and the other Looney Tunes, together with Michael Jordan, have to play a match against some aliens that steal the talent of 5 NBA players.It's funny many times, and the idea of mixing real-life and cartoons is very good. If you start watching this, you won't quit til the end, that's for sure. The presence of so many NBA stars is welcomed and adored by all NBA fans out there. Michael is good for his first role and i am convinced that with a little bit of work he could easily become a professional actor. The other NBA stars used in the film are funny, especially Pat Ewing and Charles Barkley, after they lose their talent. Also you'll get to see plaing themselves other stars like Mugsey Bogues, Larry Bird, Bill Murray (funny as he always is - definetely one of my fav comedians nowadays). The soundtrack is also great, especially R Kelly's I Believe I Can Fly. Amazing song.Well these are the good parts. What went wrong with the movie? Some of the scenes are just not funny. I was convinced i'll laugh alot, but i didn't, just because some gags don't work. They're either weak or they have been seen again. The voices of some cartoon characters are not the real ones, which is bad for the movie. And after all it's just a simple comedy.Definetely worth to watch, still can't give it more than a 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

THE WAY M. Jordan also does the actor makes me more fair of him than before. One of the best entertaining and sport movies of the '90s watched. Also fine the interaction between cartoons and human characters and well organized and overlapped, considering the relevance of Looneu Tunes.

Nostalgic but doesn't hold up as well now,"To get ready for Space Jam: A New Legacy, I decided to rewatch the original Space Jam after many years. Even though the film doesn't hold up as well now for me, there is still some fun to be had with Space Jam.Space Jam follows the Looney Tunes as they ask Michael Jordon for his help to win a basketball match against a group of aliens that want to enslave them for their theme park.This was a childhood favourite of mine. Seeing the Looney Tunes play with an iconic basketball player like Michael Jordan was something I didn't expect but I loved it a lot as a kid. Watching it today, I see how silly and outdated the film really is. This is a film that could only come from the 90's. A lot of the 2D animation does hold up but when Michael Jordan enters the 2D world, the CGI is very obvious. Some of the effects involving Jordan and the green screen do look bad for today's standards. It's also evident how Michael Jordan isn't an actor. His performance is very wooden and doesn't come off as natural at all. The Looney Tunes are fun and the voice acting is great even though the storyline is incredibly cheesy and predictable.I do have a personal bias towards Space Jam because of how nostalgic this film is to me. However, watching this as an adult, I can see how silly, corny and dated Space Jam really is. It's a guilty pleasure that has it's charm and entertainment and will hold a special place in my heart but it's not something that stood the test of time.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

It's okay...but I am not the target audience.,"A group of brightly colored slug-like animated creatures want to take all the Looney Tunes characters back to their planet. However, Bugs convinces them to give them an opportunity to win their freedom and so he challenges them to a basketball game...not knowing that the slugs were not averse to a lot of cheating. After stealing the talents from some of the best NBA players, it's just the Looney Tunes characters AND Michael Jordan against the super-nasty slugs.A friend of mine, Angelo, insisted that I should watch ""Space Jam"", as it's apparently a movie he loves. Well, on his insistence I watched the movie and found it mildly enjoyable and not much more. On the other hand, I am NOT the target audience, as I am not a basketball fan and I like my Looney Tunes cartoons like they were long ago...without all the modern sensibilities and CGI. This really is NOT a slam against the film...I am sure a lot of younger folks would enjoy it and the film made a lot of money (especially abroad). For me, it just didn't resonate and if I want to see a film that integrates cartoons with real life, I'd rather see ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"".",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Good harmless fun,"You'd think the easiest thing to do is play yourself in a movie. Yet the great Michael Jordan clearly seemed uncomfortable with his lines. Larry Bird and the other ball players (Patrick Ewing, Muggsy Bogues, Charles Barkely,etc.) seemed more at ease in front of the camera.But Jordan sure can play ball.  The basketball moments are what this film's about.  MJ was at the height of his popularity and it was great for the kids to see their favorite looney tune characters interact with MJ and Bill Murray and the rest.This is just a popcorn movie for kids, and those who like hoops will find it real entertaining.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Judge it on its own merit and it's quite good,"Some of the complaints of this film,if I recall correctly,was that it seemed to skimp on the Looney Tunes characters,added characters that weren't of any great likability or memorability and seemed to make Michael Jordan into a sort of caricature/parody of himself. And while I suppose this movie doesn't seem particularly true to either the element of animation or to MJ(though,I'd say,between the two,Jordan comes away as the winner and I'll explain why),this still is a perfectly good piece of entertainment for the whole family.Aliens come to earth seeming innocuous enough(they measure in inches) but they have a less-than honorable mission:they want to take the Looney Tunes characters back to their planet and make them into something just above slaves for their entertainment. Bugs Buny,infinitely confident,challenges the critters to a game of basketball. They respond by siphoning the talents of five of the top players of the day(PAtrick Ewing,Tyrone ""Mugsy""Bogues,Charles BArkley,Shawn Bradley and Larry Johnson. What?! No Scottie Pippen??). To counterbalance this,Bugs and company turn to his old Nike commercial-making days,and the battle is on.To me,this movie succeeds on it's own merit,and this could be no better demonstrated than by the co-star himself. Jordan plays nobody but himself,and his un-forced sense reaction to the situations actually works well to balance the zaniness around him. An almost un-credited cameo by Bill Murray just about steals the movie. All the familiar characters from the universe of WArner Toons are along for the ride,plus some new ones(a sexy,girl cager rabbit name Lola,as well as the globby aliens,led by a cigar-chomping boss voiced by Danny DeVito)to lend their various talents(Daffy Duck's neuroses are particularly enjoyable)and while this is hardly the best work of animation here(Mel Blanc's invaluable voice is missed,of course),this still works. THe live-action characters seem to be compromised some--THeresa Randle as Michael's wife and Wayne KNight as his harried manager come to mind--but that seems to be a fairly minor crime for a film that aims to be as big,bold,fanciful and childlike as possible. I don't think you need to be a fan of Looney Tunes or necessarily know that much about pro basketball(in fact,it might help!)to enjoy this film,just an ability to appreciate this rarefied blend of familiar animation with commercial savvy.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

They all have to cooperate and work as a team to win this basketball match.I found this movie entertaining and funny. The plot is very simple but funny enough to entertain you. The direction which was made by Joe Pytka was good and he succeed on presenting very well his main characters, the plot and also the back stories of the main characters.

The Good & Bad Of 'Space Jam',"GOOD - Simply an enjoyable movie; lots of fun to watch and highlighted by a humorous Basketball game. Also, the surround sound is very good, the colors are beautiful, the cartoon effects well done and funny. Some of the humor is laugh-out-loud variety. As with a many good animated movies, there is so much to see and hear it would take many viewings to catch all the gags. With each viewing, you'll laugh at things you never noticed before.As far as ""live"" actors working with cartoon figures, this was much better done than the earlier ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit,"" so progress has been made in that area. While there is a lot going on, there are enough lulls to give viewers periodic breaks. The basketball action is fun to watch and I was surprised how well real-life stars Larry Bird and Michael Jordan acted.BAD - The story gets a little too juvenile in spots. The PC-minded female character (rabbit) is overly feminist, to the point of irritation and the occult gets far too much credibility in this story. Also, there are a few sexual innuendos in here that adults would catch but, hopefully, not little kids.OVERALL, a movie that appeals to adults and kids. Basketball fans will really enjoy it.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"DON'T Let This Movie's Significantly Large Fanbase Fool You, ""Space Jam"" is ALL Sorts of Terrible","Ladies and gentleman, I'll come clean about this:Coming from a guy who still remembers his time watching this movie around last year, I found ""Space Jam"" to be an uneventful stinker that hardly put a smile on my face, even as a Looney Tunes film. Even today, I get a headache just thinking about this dung heap.For instance, the character development in articulation was hugely lacking, mainly because none of the characters had any kind of growth throughout the film and were rather bland. To top it all off, the human-visible cast members looked like they'd rather be doing something else more than be on the screen, especially that of Michael Jordan. The voices of the Looney Tunes and the Mon-Stars sounded kinda annoying, if I may add. A definite example came from Billy West's portrayal of Bugs Bunny, which hardly sounded anywhere close to the late Mel Blanc's portrayal of the character and was extremely squeaky.On the subject of the film's main antagonist, Swackhammer...I never really cared for him at all. He was basically one of the most bland and forgettable villains I've ever seen. He was nothing but a one-dimensional theme park owner who had little in the ways of a personality, development, or sense of humor. His lack of ultimate motivations other than to find a way to keep his park going did not help in making him more compelling whatsoever, and the fact that he wanted to enslave the Looney Tunes just to ""improve"" his theme park was likewise not only ridiculous but extremely stupid. In addition to this, Danny DeVito's talents were clearly wasted thanks to getting cast as the character. Along with his performance lacking personality and humor compared to much of his other work, DeVito sounded as if he was openly restrained.Likewise, the Mon-Stars/Nerdlucks were less-than-memorable additions, and the reasons behind that are pretty much the same as Swackhammer. Even when they absorbed the talents of the other basketball players featured in the film, they were nothing but irritating and idiotic cardboards who lacked personality and depth.The hand-drawn animation and CGI weren't the most eye-catching either, really.I get that this movie was made in the late 1990s, but come on! For a film of that time period, the special effects used with things like Moron Mountain and the spaceships looked extremely cheesy, especially to where you could tell it was all done by computer. Along with that, the hand-drawn animation seemed to have a vibe saying that the animators were hardly putting any dedication into their work, even in making sure it blended well with the live-action settings and elements.Finally, the direction by Joe Pytka, and the story by Leo Benevuti, Steve Rudnick, Timothy Harris, and Herschel Weingard were hardly what I'd like to call award-worthy.The comedy that was featured wasn't very laughable, as the jokes often fell flat and were awfully cringy despite the film trying to be funny. Likewise, I couldn't help but note that the film was lacking a sense of heart and soul, with little emotional connection between the characters or morals for the characters and audiences to live by. The overall concept had also been so confusing I could hardly understand or get it, which is why I couldn't give a summary of this film before analyzing it. To put it bluntly, the story is not as simple or understandable as people make it sound due to many of the aspects the film contained.In the end, ""Space Jam"" was FAR from fun. Everything about it seemed like a mindless cash-grab by Warner Bros. Just to make money off of Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes being in one film, and the way it played out was like it wasn't made by people at all.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation

Childish but entertaining.,"This film is made for kids.

Good combo of animation and sports,"As a guy who likes animation and sports movies, ""Space Jam"" seemed like it would be perfect for me. Well it was! Its great to see the Looney Toons on the big screen. Thats a fun reminder of the childhood days watching them on Saturday morning. Jordan and all the other NBA players involved contribute a lot to the humor in the film. This film should also be a must for any Bill Murray fan. He's hilarious playing himself here. Just one question, Shawn Bradley as an NBA superstar? That just may be the funniest element to the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Charming and Moderately Fun Movie with an Underwhelming Plot,"A rather strange concoction of basketball and bugs bunny, 'Space Jam' is a truly unique family friendly film. The highlight is the smooth and well integrated animation that has strong and vibrant colouration. Bill Murray brings a much needed dose of human humour to balance with the toony humour.However there isn't a lot of depth to the characters and it's a poor introduction to the toons. The final act is also somewhat ugly and silly with antagonists that are stereotypical and not very likeable.The whole movie felt like an idea that, although was reasonably well executed, they perhaps should have shelved in place of something more relatable to the toon franchise.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
#23's feature film debut,"""Space Jam"" marked the feature film debut of His Airness, Michael Jordan. I, being a Chicago native, have enjoyed watching #23 over the years as a member of the Chicago Bulls. Nobody played the game of basketball better than he did. And I thought he did a good job acting in ""Space Jam"". You have to admit, Jordan did a much better job acting in a major motion picture than Shaquille O'Neal did in ""Kazaam"". Here, Jordan's main co-stars are the Bugs Bunny characters. Also, you get cameo appearances from some of Jordan's friends which include Bill Murray, and former and present NBA stars. ""Space Jam"" isn't a great film, but it's good, silly fun. Perfect for kids.*** (out of four)",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Brand Synergy,"With its sequel upcoming and the who's-left-standing-after-injuries of an NBA Finals getting under way, it seemed as good a time as any to rewatch ""Space Jam."" Michael Jordan was a great basketball player, obviously, but more than that he was a great brand--and still is as sneaker sales and ""The Last Dance"" (2020) miniseries attest. After all, Air Jordan is reported to have earned ""only"" a little over $90 million over his career throwing a ball through a hoop, while making near $2 billion and counting from corporate sponsors of the likes of Nike, Gatorade, Hanes, McDonald's, Warner Bros., etc. Actor he is not, though, as evidenced by his lack of personality here even as he plays a version of himself, including glossing over the more sympathetic aspects of his biography such as his father's death that led to his first NBA retirement and stint in baseball minor leagues.Instead, what we get here is more branding. Aliens from a slave-based amusement park planet called ""Moron Mountain"" or the ""NCAA"" or something invade the domain of Warner Bros. Looney Tunes--where Daffy Duck's posterior is even tattooed with the media conglomerate's logo. Convincing the aliens that they must wager such an enslavement over a game of hoops, however, Bugs Bunny and gang enlist the help of another brand, Jordan, to preserve their capitalist empire. Jordan agrees as long as he can advertise his shoes, as well. Newman and ""Dan Aykroyd"" are brought along for alleged comic relief from the other failed jokes, which even include Bugs and Daffy complaining about their lack of compensation for merchandise bearing their likeness, among everything else being thrown at the wall from pretending Jordan drinks steroids to randomly referencing that favorite family film, ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994).Whoever wins the game is irrelevant, as the all mighty dollar is the true victor. Otherwise, the only thing here of slight interest methinks is the NBA being postponed in the movie due to players appearing to be infected by mysterious germs--in fact, the aliens removing their talents from their bodies for their own use in the big game. Aside from the comedic exaggeration of gas masks and wrapping an entire stadium in plastic, rather prescient of what happened to the league, as well as the rest of the world, this past pandemic year. In the end, though, money won again despite players' training and rest patterns being disrupted and their off-season shortened--hence this injury-plagued season.... Bring on the NBA Finals and Space Jam 2, I guess.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation

But now that I'm a whole 5 years older, I read some of the comments on this movie and realize how right they are.

"A funny, wacky family friendly film, but comes up short..","Since the release of Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, animators and producers have been trying to emulate the blockbuster success. Some were good, many were mediocre or worse. Space Jam happens to fall into the category of okay, but with many flaws.This wacky film stars basketball legend Michael Jordan, who is more or less, a so-so actor. At the height of his career, Michael wanted to retire from basketball to play baseball. To promote sales and products, Hollywood producers gave him a chance to act in front of the camera. He agreed, but only playing as himself.The real strong point of this film is that it stars the Looney Tunes, some of the world's most recognized and beloved cartoon characters. Despite their grand entrance, the movie received lukewarm reviews in it's first few weeks. It was also criticized for having a somewhat ridiculous story, in which a tyrant named Mr. Swackhammer (Danny Devito) wants to build a new attraction by kidnapping Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes at a distant theme park known as Moron Mountain. Throughout the movie, Michael and his buddies work hard to challenge the tyrant's helpers to a basketball game. If they lose, they will be forced to entertain the hard-pleased natives of Moron Mountain for all eternity.Space Jam is one of the few films where the Looney Tunes characters get their chance to express themselves on the big screen. Whereas most of their movies had basically added segments and poor animation, Space Jam was an original concept that gave the cartoon characters more depth. The animation looks beautiful and the live action blends in well with the cartoon environment.Unfortunately that doesn't make up for the fact that the jokes and gags that are famous in numerous Looney Tune cartoons didn't make it into the movie. Weak dialog and somewhat poor plots revealed in Space Jam doesn't compare to the humor of the old cartoons or the better writing seen in Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Some of the actors come up short, including the NBA players who simply play themselves. Wayne Knight was a goofy addition to the cast, but he was simply more annoying than tolerable. Bill Murray (Saturday Night Live, GhostBusters, Groundhog Day) was a disappointment, coming across as irritated and unlikeable by playing himself.Still the good outnumbers the bad, and personally I think the critics were being too harsh on this film. The addition of Lola Bunny was a nice touch, and there were a few hilarious moments worth mentioning. It also has a good soundtrack, which fits in with the theme of Space Jam.The film had a lot of merchandise going for it, and sadly it didn't hold up to it's full potential. If you get past the so-so acting of the live actors and the somewhat clichéd plot, Space Jam is a funny film that will entertain kids and Looney Tune fans alike. It wasn't merely aiming at an adult demographic, but it is still enjoyable by those who have watched the cartoon shorts. Not the best live action/animated film, but certainly not the worst either.Six out of Ten.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Funny, entertaining and whacky, what more do you want?","When people hate on this film I'm gonna ask them this, what do you expect from a Looney tunes movie? I expect laughter, craziness and entertainment, because that's all this needs to succeed!! And guess what, it has all of that. MJ is pretty good for a non actor in this movie, and the looney tunes as usual are all great.This movie also has an amazing soundtrack, and the space jam song makes me want to start playing basketball again once I hear it. If you have a sense of humor and a soul then your criticisms for this film should be minimal. Because if your watching Looney Tunes, then you should know what your getting yourself into, otherwise it's your fault and your idiot. Nuff said.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Totally Unrealistic,"I watched this movie on a plane recently. It was pretty good until cartoons started interacting with real people. It was cool to see michal jackson playing basketball and baseball, but then it got really looney. He gets transported to some kind of planet and starts playing basketball with cartoon characters.It was cool because bill murry is in it and he is always funny. But I just couldnt wrap my head around the ludicrous storyline. They are playing basketball to save the planet. And it's against cartoon characters. Yep, you read that correctly.If you want to see a good sports movie, you can watch Rudy, which is about a guy who plays football against, yea, real people.There is one moment in this movie where michal jackson's arm stretches like the length of the basketball court and slams dunking it in. Totally unrealistic. But otherwise, the movie is kind of fun. You can probably eat popcorn with a little kid and watch it with them and they wont be able to notice the inconsistencies and probably wont think it is strange. But if you have any taste in great cinema, pass on it, or be sure to be prepared for it to not make sense.If you like watching people play basketball with cartoons then you will be my guest, but dont say I didnt warn you about what it would be about.That's pretty much all it's about.

Just not very good,"I am not a fan of basketball, Michael Jordan or the Looney Tunes. Why, then, do I own a store-bought VHS copy of this film, you ask? Darned if I know. Maybe it was a present. Maybe it was from a time where my taste was less discriminating... but hey, even kids must have some limit, some point at which they stare in disbelief at the crap thrown at them. The film opens to a scene which has a soundtrack song the choice of which is so painfully obvious, that actually choosing it is almost ridiculous, goes on with such highlights as a number of the Looneys all spitting in unison, and ends in a major showdown, with occasional awful acting by basketball players, and one rather underdeveloped, faint attempt at an emotion-evoking subplot along the way. The strange thing is that, save for said showdown, there's really hardly any basket played in the film... one would think that to be one of the main attractions. Their lead is one of the good players of the sport, and the plot can't be summed up or described without mentioning said free-time activity. Scenes that seem like they'd lead to at least *some* basketball... just exactly don't. Dan Castellaneta shows up in a cameo, doing nothing. The plot is OK. The pacing isn't too bad. The humor isn't all good, but it has its moments. The large cast of characters, some of which are animated, allows fairly little time for almost all of them, but I suppose people aren't used to spending too much time with the Tunes, so that may not be a bad thing. Oddly enough, they really hardly do any of their trademark gags. The film doesn't overstay its welcome, coming in at not much under an hour and a half. This is the introduction of Lola Bunny, who, I gather from the Trivia entry regarding this, stayed with the franchise. Bugs is this time, and some from this point on, performed by Billy West, also known from Futurama. If you listen carefully, you can tell the ""Fry"" in some of Bunny's lines. The direction is done by Joe Pytka, who, before this, had done a few Michael Jackson videos and a Richard Dreyfuss comedy. The blend of animation and live action isn't always smooth. The effects look dated today, in particular the CGI, but the general animation isn't bad. The film does have some reasonable moments... the initial arrival of the aliens to the land of cartoons, for example. The music is good enough. I guess it's a decent enough film for those who are fans of the sport and/or the cartoons. Just strange how much there is to be found in the film that features neither. I recommend this to anyone who finds themselves in either or both of the aforementioned groups, as well as anyone still interested after reading this review. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
So whose stupid idea was this?,"The result of this unholy exhumation of Warner Brothers has-beens is even worse than could have been expected: one of the vilest films ever produced in the United States.  It's unique among bad films in the way it starts at the bottom and digs DOWN.  I mean, it's bad enough that it's a basketball movie - the one thing in the world worse than a baseball movie (although baseball finds its way into the plot as well).  It's bad enough that it's one big Michael Jordan publicity still.  Isn't Jordan just the greatest guy in the world! seems to be the only point behind the opening scenes, especially those honey-covered ones with his family.  (Not his real family.)But then we meet the cartoon characters ...  Whoever's responsible for the animation has evidently mistaken motion for life, because we have all the frenetic running around, squashing, stretching and camera-swerving of the world's most over-produced computer game - all in vain.  Consider `The Rabbit of Seville', with its staid camera work and underplayed Bugs Bunny. It had less than a third of the motion on display in `Space Jam' - and more than four times as much energy.But it gets worse.  Oh, believe me, does it get worse!  I don't know why they made Bugs Bunny the star - he is NOT the most successful creation of Warner Brothers, not by a long shot.  Indeed he's scarcely a character at all.  He's whatever a talented director makes of him.  There's the anarchic Bugs of Tex Avery; the innocent, childlike Bugs of Chuck Jones; the (it must be said) dull, vulgar Bugs of Friz Freleng; and the (sorry) just plain dull Bugs of Robert McKimson.  This Bugs is worse than any of them.  All the inconsistenies have been added together, and new ones added.  Remember what a signal failure the modern-day Mickey Mouse of Disney's `Runaway Brain' was?  You ain't seen nothing yet.I have not yet begun to describe what's wrong with the cartoon bits.  Every second of animation is manic but serves no purpose any of the writers might have had, economic motives aside.  The art direction is just terrible  It's all painfully unfunny.  And remember what happened when the Warner Brothers cartoons began to die in the first place, in the 1960s?  They were no longer fresh, and writers desperately tried to jolly things along by casting more and more characters alongside each other, with predictable results.  Too many zany characters cancel each other out.  Well, `Space Jam' combines EVERY SINGLE Warner Brothers character in the one work, and they all do their zany schtick at once - you can imagine how counter-productive this is. No, on second thoughts, you probably I can't.  It's worse than you can imagine.And it CONTINUES to get worse.  We're introduced to a new Warner Brothers star (star? hah!) - a `sexy' female rabbit, a feisty basketball player who blows back her ears and says, `Don't call me doll.'  Some rap music worms its way into the soundtrack.  The climactic basketball game is even more ineptly staged than the earlier scenes would have led us to expect. Possibly worst of all, the slender and soulless plot is laden with enough contrived sentiment to make us scream, `Oh, come ON!  No-one in the WORLD is so easily manipulated!'One final note - something that pleases me.  `Space Jam' received its first outing on Australian television only because a cricket game which the network had expected to take place, didn't.  THAT puts the movie in its place.  Basketball, too.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation

I still say that there's always reason to be doubtful about any of what they produced after Mel Blanc died.,"What made the classic Looney Tunes cartoons so great was their clever stories (with occasional social commentary) and their avoidance of gross commercialism; and of course there were Mel Blanc's voices. It seems like everything that they produced after his death was mostly really corporate. I'll admit that ""Space Jam"" is pretty entertaining, as Michael Jordan comes to the rescue of Bugs, Daffy, Porky, etc., after some aliens try to kidnap them. But aside from the over-emphasis on Jordan himself, it seems like this movie was just trying to sell a bunch of things (not to mention that the voices don't sound right without Mel Blanc). And if it was intended for young children, then some of what it showed wasn't particularly appropriate for children, namely the ""nice butt"" scene.So, it's OK as straight entertainment. But you'll do far better to just stick with the classic cartoons. Also starring Wayne Knight, Bill Murray and the voice of Danny DeVito.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

Overall, a decent, fun watch that was geared mostly for kids as it was good to see how two icons (MJ in the NBA and Bugs Bunny in Looney Tunes) were able to come together to give off a lot of iconic moments with the battle with the monstars as the movie does not try to take itself too seriously.Pretty Bad Direction, Bad Acting (Decent from Michael Jordan, Pretty Good to Good from Wayne Knight, Great from Danny DeVito, Very Bad from the rest of the live acting cast; Great Voice Acting by the entire Looney Tunes cast), Good Story, Screenplay of two halves (Looney Tunes Parts were great and very similar to its traditional style, Real life parts were bad to pretty bad overall; there were some good references and jokes that I did appreciate (Mighty Ducks, Pulp Fiction, Patton, etc.)), Decent to Pretty Good Score (Liked how it incorporated Looney Tunes elements); Good Soundtrack, Pretty Good Cinematography (made it feel very animated), Decent Sound, Decent Editing, Pretty Good Animation and stitches with real life (especially for the time) as it gives it a pretty cartoony feel, Pacing was very fast and really rushed between plot elements; Runtime was very short (definitely could have used 15-20 minutes in the rising action as the film goes from exposition to the climax), Skips build to climax; the actual basketball game (climax) was executed very well as it was the best part of the movie and gives off a good message to the audience, The movie is pretty surface level but the majority of it is geared towards kids and people who wanted to see MJ so i give it a pass.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
A nostalgic blend of sports and animation,"""Space Jam"" combines live-action and animation in a whimsical tale that brings together basketball superstar Michael Jordan and the beloved Looney Tunes characters.

Looney Tunes can't disappoint,"I leading roles - Michael Jordan and Bugs Bunny! How could anyone resist this announcement... In 1996, this movie was a miracle that, even without the internet, caused big hype.

Beside probably every Warner animated character and Michael Jordan, there are few more NBA players and genius comedians Wayne Knight and Bill Murray. From today's perspective, the film is technically rather outdated, but even if you are not able to look at it from the perspective of the time in which it originated, its speed, humor and a lot of interesting details and references (which you have no chance to catch all during a single viewing) leave you no time to bother with technical shortcomings. I also particularly liked the music (Seal, R.

Sheer ugliness,"This is a terrible movie, and the fact that Leonard Maltin likes it makes me wonder what happened to his brain cells since he introduced the Golden Jubilee series of Looney Tunes videos in 1985.  If you want a good Looney Tunes film, check out any of the compilation flicks like ""The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Movie.""To start the movie off, we're treated to a supposed-to-be-heartwarming scene in which a young Michael (you know, that classic Looney Tunes character Michael Jordan) is playing basketball outside and tells his dad about all the things he wants to do when he grows up.  Yeah, like we need to know why a tall, bald, black guy is playing basketball thirty years later.  It's definitely not the nine zillion he makes annually, but because it's his boyhood dream.  Besides, one line of adult Michael's slushy-voiced dialogue reveals that he's probably not qualified for too many other professions.After the obligatory scene in which the bad guys plot their evil scheme (and oh boy, someone got Danny DeVito to do the voice of the leader Swackhammer...I guess Tim Curry was unavailable), we're finally introduced to the Looney Tunes characters.  Bugs Bunny acts like the annoying kid in the classroom with ADD and sounds like Stimpy (great, Billy West does some of the voices, like I needed another reason to hate this movie!) and is for some reason intimidated by these little alien creatures that Tweety would have no trouble kicking the behinds of.  Anyway, Bugs & Co. challenge the aliens to a game of basketball, drag Michael to (shudder) ""Looney Tunes Land"" (shudder), and they win.  Yay-freakin'-ay.First, the special effects of combining Bugs and Michael are just passable but not great.  There is no sense of wonder or real interaction like in ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?""  Perhaps the writers weren't very imaginative on how the characters could be more physical with each other, but Bugs looked more alive next to human co-stars in the 1948 movie ""My Dream is Yours.""The Looney Tunes characters are pale imitations of their actual selves.  A new unnecessary female rabbit named Lola is introduced (I guess the writers forgot about Honey Bunny, whom I would have loved to see turned into a main character for this flick).  She is nothing more than a placeholder for the ""token female"" spot.  And I'm sure Ivan Reitman thought the ""Don't ever call me 'doll'"" line was going to be springing from the lips of every young girl out there who didn't leave the theater in disgust at this point.  Instead, it's just a stupid built-in merchandise slogan.  Give me ""Beep Beep"" any day over that.Daffy's in it, Porky's in it, Foghorn's in it, Sylvester's in it, and Elmer's in it (really, practically no other characters were given dialogue). They look ugly, they sound ugly, and their personalities have all been reduced to expansions on their vocal traits.  Are we positive Disney wasn't secretly involved in hopes to ruin these great characters?Then there is a very disturbing long sequence in which several Looney Tunes get hurt during the basketball game, followed by a long shot of some minor characters in various states of dying.  Did someone actually think this is FUNNY??  I've never considered any cartoon violence as ""gratuitous,"" but this is most certainly an ugly, witless scene of just pain.  And this movie comes from the same man who did the fun, harmless ""Ghostbusters??""This movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever.  It's a ninety-minute Nike commercial.  There's even a line of dialogue in which the sometimes-funny Wayne Knight tells Michael to support all of his endorsements (""Put on your Hanes(TM), we'll grab a Big Mac(TM)...,"" etc.).  It's supposed to be disguised as self-parody, but comes off as pompousness.  I guess promoting ninety different companies was also part of young Michael's boyhood dream.

A hit-and-miss live action/animated crossover,"This 1996 live action/animated crossover, starring then-basketball champion Michael Jordan as himself, plus the popular Looney Tunes characters, was obviously a success. I never saw it around that time in the late 90's, but clearly remember the craze, with all the merchandise. I was familiar with the Looney Tunes characters (at least most of them) from old cartoons I had seen. Although I've certainly never been an avid follower of professional basketball (or any sport you see on TV, for that matter), I was also familiar with Jordan, as this was his heyday, and he had a huge reputation. Despite all this, I didn't see ""Space Jam"" until last night. A few years ago, I saw ""Looney Tunes: Back in Action"", and remember hating it, but despite my fairly low expectations for its predecessor, this one does have some redeeming qualities.Michael Jordan announces his retirement from the NBA and switches to professional baseball, but is not very successful with this sport. Meanwhile, on a distant planet, Mr. Swackhammer owns a theme park called Moron Mountain. He is desperate for new attractions for his park, and thinks the Looney Tunes would be great. He sends his minions, five small aliens known as the ""Nerdlucks"" (Pound, Blanko, Nawt, Bupkus, and Bang) to Looney Tune Land, below the surface of the Earth, to capture the Looney Tunes and force them to act as attractions for Moron Mountain, whether they like it or not! However, Bugs Bunny tricks them into agreeing to a basketball game, which will determine whether Moron Mountain gets them as attractions, or they remain free. Since the Nerdlucks are so small, the Looney Tunes figure they can easily clobber them in the sport, but the clever aliens steal the talent of several NBA players and become the giant Monstars! Knowing this won't be as easy as they thought, the Looney Tunes recruit Michael Jordan for the competition.For much of the film, it seemed I would only be able to rate it 5/10. I found that the plot was pretty dull, and most of it wasn't that funny (though there are some funny moments early on, such as Bugs Bunny telling the Nerdlucks he hasn't seen Bugs Bunny). I really don't know how to go into details about this, but for me, these were problems that brought the movie down in quality. However, to me it eventually improved, and I started finding it funnier. The cartoon characters in the film can sometimes be funny, and Stan Podolak, Michael Jordan's assistant played by Wayne Knight, can also be quite comical, especially later in the film. (Mind you, despite all the good jokes, there is a major fart joke towards the end, unfortunately.) Also, Jordan doesn't put on that bad a performance, considering the fact that he's not an actor, the film has some nice animation, and the big basketball competition is intense. With these qualities, ""Space Jam"" certainly isn't classic family fare, but they're enough to make it a mixed blessing. Maybe this movie has more appeal to kids, but adults might enjoy it as well, even if it's basically fluff.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"We be ""Jam""min'...","For the first time in his illustrious career, Michael ""Air"" Jordan shares the court and the spotlight with some of the most intimidating players in basketball...most of which have fur and feathers.""Space Jam"" melds real-life and cartoon-life as well as in ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" and with about the same result.  No one can say that they skimped on the FX, or the story - which yields some mighty big laughs.Seems that Looney Tune Land is under threat from aliens from an other-worldly amusement park and the only way Bugs, Daffy, Porky and Tweety can save themselves from intergalactic slavery is by challenging them to a basketball game.  But when the aliens in question acquire powers from Earth's best b-ball players (Ewing, Barkley, Bogues, etc.) and become Mon-Stars, Bugs and company acquire the newly-retired Jordan to help them get game.Jordan is comfortable in front of the camera, even when surrounded by cartoon characters and Bill Murray (!), so he proves he has even a future as a movie star, especially in movies like this.  And as if there were ever a doubt, Bugs Bunny shows he still has what it takes after all these years.I love this movie; I've always been a fan of animation and ""Space Jam"" doesn't disappoint.  Every figure, shadow and shade of skin is perfect and shares screen time with real people so seamlessly that, sure, it looks real enough that we could be surprised that this kind of thing doesn't happen every day.Anyway, you have to love a movie where Murray's big entrance is heralded by someone shouting ""I didn't know Dan Aykroyd was in this picture!""Ten stars and a pair of Nikes for ""Space Jam"".Now, how about a sequel with Joe Montana?",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Childhood milestone.,"Space Jam was a lot of 90s kids' first ever introduction to Looney Tunes, and what a wacky intro to the likes of Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and co. The movie is definitely a 1996 movie through and through, what with its 'sooky' marquee song 'I Believe I Can Fly' bookending the film from start to finish and the emphasis on movies that were new at the time like Pulp Fiction getting referenced; and the film was probably made possible due to Who Framed Roger Rabbit showing animation and live-action can still work on-screen, but made easier thanks to the 1990s' rapidly evolving technological advances in cinema.Space Jam was a commercial hit at the time but critical buzz was mixed, and Chuck Jones himself apparently hated the movie. All of that didn't stop many of us looking back on this movie with equally genuine and ironic sentiment years down the track. Fast forward to the 2020s and of course there's a sequel, and it didn't seem to work like the first time around.Space Jam may not be a typical cinephile's cup of tea exactly, but it makes the viewers happy and the vibes of the live-action stuff mixed with the Looney Tunes cast makes this movie a camp classic that has garnered a massive cult following. 7/10 IMDb points. 3.5/5 stars. It's easy stuff to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"""Who are these 'toons?""","What I never understood about this movie is, simply put, what the hell happened to these cartoon characters?

These _are_ characters with histories, not just walking corporate properties.  Have some respect for your source material, people.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
"High-spirited, lots of laughs","There were two forces at work which kept me from seeing this film for a great long while.  One was the trailer, along with all the other promotional stuff.  They gave off the idea that this film was going to be self-conscious, obnoxious, and unfunny.  The other force was the saccharine R.Kelly tune, ""I Believe I Can Fly"".  Pop music written for movies has been on a deep decline since ""The Morning After"" from ""The Poseidon Adventure"", so I won't elaborate on that any further.Having finally seen it the other day, I was pleasantly surprised.  Many things are right with it, and I will list a few.First, it's very funny.  The directors and writers (who were, without a doubt, yes-men for the studio execs, but no matter) have the rare gift of being able to achieve and sustain the perfect comic pitch for most, if not all, of the picture.  Many sight-gags abound; some are old-fashioned, and they remind us of why we laugh at decades-old Looney Toons when we see them today; some are well-placed pop culture references (the one for ""Pulp Fiction"", with Yosemite Sam and Elmer Fudd in the Vince and Jules outfits, is the best one).  The sub-plot, with a half-dozen real-life NBA players dealing with the mysterious, supernatural larceny of their ball-handling skills, provides quite a few laughs--if you have a minimum knowledge-base on ""The Holy Game"", you will get the jokes.Second, the darned thing works.  The special effects are startlingly innovative, and not over-done.  Michael Jordan, despite not being the world's greatest line-reader, has a great screen presence, and works well against the (invisible, during the filming) cartoon characters--that's harder than it looks.  The games, set in the animated universe, are well staged.  Bill Murray is funny just by BEING, and Wayne Knight is...well, forget it, he's kind of annoying.In the final analysis, ""Space Jam"" doesn't quite do it as well as ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", but for what it is, it's got game.",,Anonymous,Animation
Jam On,"Nostalgia dies hard sometimes. I loved this movie when I was a kid. I wasn't even a basketball fan yet seeing Michael Jordan step into the world of Looney Toons for a goofy, cartoon game against alien Monstars? Oh that hit me just right.Watched this for the first time in a long time a couple days ago and, despite the fact that now I'm older and more critical, I can't deny that this transported me right back to when I was a kid.That being said, this movie is ridiculous. It makes no sense whatsoever and the second you stop to ask why or how it either falls apart or gives you a headache. The acting is not great, but at the same time, Jordan's not an actor and considering this movie has to be like 80% him just living in a green screen world, it's pretty impressive and I'll forgive him for not having all his eyelines down.I'd be really curious to see someone watch this now who didn't watch this as a kid. Like I said, nostalgia plays heavily with me on this and I know it. Seeing someone come to this fresh would be fascinating. Regardless, I'd almost say it's worth watching for that soundtrack alone!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"It was a landmark film for young people and children in the 90s, but it is currently forgotten.","This is one of those movies that almost everyone has seen or heard about... or, at least, everyone who was children or teenager in the 90s, like me. Currently, the film is largely forgotten, and I feel that not even the release of a new film has served to spark interest in it. I don't know if that's entirely fair, because the movie is quite entertaining and works well, providing some nice, enjoyable fun for everyone... even non-basketball fans like me, who've never even seen a game.The plot is simple: a group of tiny, seemingly unthreatening aliens are willing to do anything to kidnap the Looney Tunes and take them to their planet. Watching them, Bugs Bunny comes up with the idea of challenging them to a basketball game that will decide the toons fate, convinced that everything will be resolved easily. But lo and behold, the aliens steal the talent of top NBA players and turn into monsters, dominating the match. Aware of the situation, Bugs and Daffy Duck decide to bring in Michael Jordan, who had retired to play baseball.The film was, financially, a safe bet for Warner Bros. We don't just have Looney Tunes, the crazy creatures we've grown used to after decades of cartoons, but also basketball, a particularly popular sport in the US. In addition to Jordan, other famous players of the time will appear in the film, also representing themselves, in addition to their teams, and I have no doubt that the NBA paid a lot of money for all this publicity. And it's not even worth talking about the huge amount of products that come up strategically or that are named in the dialogues, and that also paid for it. Add to the advertising revenue the box office receipts (it was the most successful basketball movie to date) and all the merchandising that was sold afterward, from toys to coasters... and we have an idea of how profitable the movie was for the studio.Michael Jordan made his cinematic debut here, as it was the first (and, I think, the only) feature film he starred in. He's not an actor, he's not trained as such, but he managed it reasonably well, which shouldn't have been too difficult, as everything was limited to playing himself and making a few passes with the ball. The other players also did a decent job, and seem to be enjoying while parodying themselves. In the dramatic field, it is really Bill Murray who shines, as a professional comic actor, giving us the best performance in the film. There are several competent voice actors here, with Danny De Vito being the most easily identifiable and the one who stands out the most.Technically, the film deserves an applause for the quality of the animations, and for the positive way in which they play with real characters. It's not a pioneering film, ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" did the same several years earlier, and with better results, but what we're given here is good enough. The cinematography is good and the same can be said for the effects. As for the soundtrack, only the song ""I Believe I Can Fly"" stands out particularly, and this film contributed a lot to popularize it and guarantee it the Grammy Award that year.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

It is still a classic,"It's not often I get to rewatch Space Jam in fact it's very few and far between but when I have the chance and the time I make sure I watch it. Even in the year of 2023 the animation of the Looney Tunes characters blending into our world has aged superbly especially since this movie came out in 1996 but looks as though it came out today. Scratch that, the animation of Space Jam in this movie still looks better than the animation and CGI of today which says somethingThe story is excellent which the whole family can still enjoy or if your by yourself at any age. It's funny, heartwarming, the typical 90s style movie with optimism and hope. Plus it has not only Michael Jordan but also and I cant believe I forgot he was in this movie - Newman from SeinfeldSpace Jam has aged liked fine wine over the years and will continue to do so for many more years to come in the future.

Pretty good,"This movie has received a lot of flak over the last couple of years and I honestly don't know why. OK, it's not terrific or a masterpiece, but it does accomplish one simple goal: it's entertaining.The plot concerns Michael Jordan (playing himself and proving to be a rather charming actor) who, after retiring from basketball, finds himself roped (literally) into helping Bugs Bunny and the Looney Tunes in a do or die game against aliens. Sound ridiculous? It is but this is the Looney Tunes, not ""2001.""The pros are pretty significant. The cast performs well (with Wayne Knight and Bill Murray stand-outs), the animation is colorful and lively and the comedy concerning the now-talentless NBA players is really a treat with a particular shout-out going to Albert Hague who plays a psychiatrist. Let's also mention the phenomenal soundtrack which I will never fault this film for.Although it lacks solidity and most of the live action scenes without the Tunes are pretty dull, overall I enjoyed it. And I still do almost fourteen years later.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Remembering #23 in the world of Looney Tunes.,"Michael Jordan's recent departure from basketball will make SPACE JAM a memorable video collector's item to behold, now and forever. His appearances with Bugs & Company in past TV commercials put the tall guy into greater stardom than on the court. Here's where the magic is!Frankly, SPACE JAM is a swift update for the LOONEY TUNES cast due to some modernized comedy. I can't believe Porky Pig actually said he wet his pants! It's no surprise this got a PG rating, and that's largely due to the animated effects of Jordan and other real-life humans sucking into holes, which is amusing, but points out the subject of ""mild violence"". It's not bad as it is cartoonish. To say it simple, it's great fun for all ages because of Bugs, Daffy, & Company who have timelessly entertained us for decades.When Jordan spoke his words about retiring, there's one thing he forgot to say to the public: ""TH-TH-TH-TH-THAT'S ALL FOLKS!""",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Brings a lot memories back to my childhood,"""Space Jam"" is one of those movies that is part of my childhood aside from the ""Star Wars"" movies; ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?;"" ""The Wizard of Oz;"" and many other movies that I grew up with. Now, by looking back it today, it still holds up and it does bring a lot memories back to my childhood. However, is it up there with ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?""? No. But I still think this is a fun movie for kids and adults to enjoy. ""Space Jam"" tells a story in a fictional way that Michael Jordan has retired from being a famous basketball player to become a baseball player like what his father want him to play. When the evil Swackhammer send his Nerdlucks to capture Bugs Bunny and the rest of the Looney Tunes to make them part of their attractions at an amusement park place called Moron Mountain. So Bugs and the rest of the gang decide to challenge them for playing basketball, the Nerdlucks stole Charles Barkley and the other famous NBA player's talents to become the Monstars which it all leads to the Looney Tunes to recruit Jordan to come back playing basketball and to beat the Monstars. I got to say that Michael Jordan's acting isn't that bad as what others say about him. I thought he did well as he is only playing himself, and playing natural as an everyday guy that plays sports and has a family on his own. So, in my opinion, I thought he did good job for not only playing himself, but able to do his own stunts when he is playing basketball. I don't have much thoughts on Wayne Knight's performance, but I thought he did fine. Bill Murray is also fun to watch as he is like Jordan playing himself. Forgot to mention, Danny DeVito was also fun for voicing Swackhammer. Billy West and Dee Bradley Baker both nail their voice acting really well for playing Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck. Same goes to other voice actor. Although they are not on par with Mel Blanc, but they were able to remain true on what their voices are suppose to sound like. Of course I got to mention Lola Bunny, I thought she was a great addition to the other Looney Tunes; I know some others reacted negatively that they want her to be like what the Looney Tunes do, but I appreciate her from being different and I do think that she is a perfect love interest to Bugs Bunny. I never saw what ""The Looney Tunes Show"" did with her character differently, and not sure how I will feel about that. I thought the special effects in this movie are just as good as what ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" did for its mixture of animation and live action. The basketball court is CGI, but it did not bothered me because I thought it kind of looks like an actual court if it was really there. The bad ones that I know are CG is the Monstars made Michael Jordan look like a basketball, and Wayne Knight's character to be inflated like a balloon until he returns back to his normal size. Aside from the bad ones, most of the special effects are really good. I thought the basketball scene in the last act of the movie is well done. James Newton Howard's score for the film is also well done as well as the film's soundtrack. I love Seal's ""Fly Like an Eagle;"" R.Kelly's ""I Believe I Can Fly;"" Quad City DJ's ""Space Jam"" theme song, and some others. Joe Pytka's direction in this movie was absolutely great, and I thought he handle the basketball scenes as he knows where to point the camera at and how it should be edit. On a side note, I like to mention that Ivan Reitman produce this movie, and Bill Murray makes a joke about how he got to the cartoon world where he mentions a producer that he is friends with and sent a Teamster to drop him off. Nothing important, but I had to bring that up in case if you didn't know about. Anyway, ""Space Jam"" is a fun movie and I still enjoy it! I give it a 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Not terrible, just... underwhelming","It's really hard to comment on a movie like ""Space Jam"". Most people trash it because it is untrue to the tradition of Looney Tunes. I agree with this; I groan at the inclusion of Lola Bunny, and Bugs and costars would NOT need Michael Jordan's help in defeating these Monstars. The only thing that can kill them is Dip, for crying out loud. Nevertheless, the film has it's charms (though they are few).One cannot review 'Space Jam' without mentioning Michael Jordan. I wouldn't mind the movie so much if it didn't center around Jordan worship. Here's an idea: Why not have a real actor play a fictional basketball player? A legend out of their prime, called out again in a time of need for the Looney Tunes. Doesn't that seem like a good premise? Apparently, Warner Bros. didn't think so, and much of the film has gallons of praise for Jordan. Michael Jordan is not a bad actor per se, but he really is just being himself. The Looney Tunes are still funny, but their personalities do not seem as apparent in this movie. I mean, when you get down to it, the personalities of the Looney Tunes is what makes them funny. Here, they just seem... like cookie-cutter cartoon characters. That ain't good. Bill Murray shows up to inject some much-needed laughs in the final act, and he seems more adept at acting alongside 'Toons than Michael Jordan.Ultimately, Space Jam's problem is that it falls flat. It's dead in the water. 'Space Jam' is a disappointment.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

Just take it for what it is; don't whine about how Michael Jordan can't act (yeah, and Marlon Brando probably couldn't dunk; what's your point?), how it ruins the Tunes' personalities (they're freaking ink and paint; get over it), the ""PC-ness"" of Lola Bunny (yeah, because God forbid they try to add a female touch to the all-male Looney Tunes crowd), and all of the other related complaints.

"Bugs, Daffy...and Jordan? Not as bad as they say, but...","Okay. This is NOT a tremendous success, and it really hasn't aged well. The voices are terrible. Few or none of the WB characters sound like the original inspirations. The inclusion of Jordan is just plain bizarre. Retains very little feel of the classic cartoons.That being said...It's not nearly as bad as some of the more poisoned pen reviewers on this site might suggest. First off, kids love it. It made a fortune at the box office. They love the character's hijinks and they love the basketball stuff (the game, the superstars, etc.). Some of our movie loving brethren across the pond and around the world may not appreciate the distinctly American past time of basketball (as some of the especially angry reviewers have noted) but we really dig it here. There are also some inspired bits here and there and some really funny stuff with Bill Murray. It is tragic, however, that the funniest scenes of a WB cartoon character driven film are the result of a human performance (and not a drawn one). All in all Looney fans all say they hate it, but most of us own it anyway. There are worse things to show your kids (and they really will like it) and there are glimmers of great scenes. The new LOONEY TUNES BACK IN ACTION is a FAR SUPERIOR film and I would make that your top priority, but Space Jam may pass the time until the newer film hits the DVD stands.",,Anonymous,Animation
Jordan Devlin,"I was surprised to learn that the ""How Did That Get Made"" podcast had picked ""Space Jam"" as one of the movies they were going to do. Though I hadn't seen the movie in years, I remember as a 16 year old, taking my younger brother to see it at the cinema - just the two of us and it wasn't, in my memory at least, a bad film. Turns out, they were right, as the movie is a pretty shambolic mix of advertisements and nonsense.With his space amusement park failing, Mr. Swackhammer (Danny DeVito) sends his lackeys to Earth to capture the Looney Tunes characters as his new attraction. Thinking fast, Bugs Bunny (Billy West) says that the Tunes characters have the right to defend themselves in a competition of their choosing. Given the small stature of their captures, Bugs picks Basketball, but the Aliens have a plan, and steal the skills of various NBA players (as well as a series of physical enhancements). Seeing that they'll now struggle, the tunes recruit Michael Jordan to play for their team.Overall it's a bit of a mess. I can actually take the advertisements, they're not as egregious as it's been made out to be in other areas, but the plot is horribly under baked and lacking, the voices sound wrong (mostly because they're different people) and worst of all, it's not funny. Not even slightly. Not even when Bill Murray is in it. The best bits, oddly, revolve around the real human basketball players and their struggles once the aliens have taken their basketball skills. Their visits to hospitals and psychiatrists trying to get to the bottom of it. The animation work is poor too, with the interaction with the real world less convincing than ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" despite that being almost a decade later.Michael Jordan actually does OK performance-wise. So much so you wonder why he hasn't taken up acting since his actual retirement and he's unquestionably the greatest NBA player of all time, so I understand the desire to eulogise him in a film like this. But even taking into consideration ""It's a Kids film"", like that's some sort of genuine excuse, ""Space Jam"" is far from a slamdunk.Also. R-Kelly (Shudder).",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Beautiful 90's Childhood favourite of mine & one of the greatest Family Films Ever!!!!,"I love ""Space Jam"" & remember fondly how big this movie was back in 1996, it was a massive blockbuster hit movie & i had some of the Awesome Action figures & remember buying ""Space Jam"" the day it was released to buy on home video from the Blockbuster video store, i miss that place & those days so much!!! I loved the 90's & this movie is an absolute product of that lovely time period, when the legendary Michael Jordan was a Basketball super star legend & to put him at the height of his superstardom in a kids animated fantasy adventure was pure genius.Space Jam is so beautifully 90's, & was a huge film to me growing up as a young teenager. I had Space Jam & Men In Black around that time that were mega movies to me. Space Jam is a wonderful animated & live-action family-friendly classic that's up there with the 80's Classic, Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, a childhood vhs classic of mine.Everybody has always loved the Looney Tunes characters & here Michael Jordan is brought to the tunes animated universe to help save their world from an evil group of Monsters/Aliens that need a new attraction for their planets theme park & the great Danny DeVito does the excellent voice work of the evil mastermind ""Swackhammer"" & his group of colourful monster/alien things magically steal some professional NBA players talents & challenge the Looney tunes to a Basketball game & the prize is if they win is to keep their world!!!Bugs Bunny & Daffy Duff mission it to the human world & seek out the greatest player ""Michael Jordan"" for help, that's the plot & it's a blast of amazing animation & hilarious antics but all feelgood family fun.Super star Michael Jordan is actually a really nice presence on screen although not a great actor but that didn't matter because he was himself really & wasn't supposed to give a big powerful performance but he genuinely comes accross as a nice guy & for some reason worked so well surrounded by those maniac Looney Tunes characters & the film hit all the right spots especially for it's time of 1996 & that's why it's held up so well & is cherished by us who grew up in the 90's like myself. Space Jam was a huge event movie & i loved all the merchandise & toys that came out & i brought some of the Awesome Action figures. MJ was a huge part of the 90's & that's why the movie is such a Nostalgic piece for us who grew up watching it & that fondness only grows as time goes on as the film is a time capsule of a better time without all the technology & ever changing everything of today.I love Space Jam & I'm not even a Basketball fan or into any sports & that shows you what a great fun fantasy film it is. You don't have to even like Basketball to enjoy all the craziness of the movie.Space Jam is silly light-hearted family fun that anyone can enjoy & i still do at 37!!!""Space Jam"" is a wonderful fantasy adventure that is just a joy to watch & is buzzing with energy & a sense of Fun. The music is sweet & nice & this Classic is produced by the great IVAN REITMAN, the genius who made both Ghostbusters films, Kindergarten Cop, Evolution, Twins & Junior, so this man knows great fantasy comedy.We also gets an Awesome & hilarious little role from comic genius BILL MURRAY!!! There's also the big funny guy, Wayne Knight (Jurassic Park) & famous faces from the NBA.All in all ""Space Jam"" is a Comedy CLASSIC from the 90's that i have a big soft spot for & have always loved.Big Nostalgia Love for this lovely product of it's time.The only thing that hasn't aged well with the film is of course having R.

why the negativity?,"Michael Jordan is sucked into Looney Tune land to help Bugs Bunny and co win a basketball game against 5 aliens who will make them slaves if they lose.The Looney Tunes are a great creation. The wackiness and imagination behind each character is a simple bliss. And each character is brought to the big screen in this sports comedy which has received disappointing reviews. It is a wonder why this film is looked at negatively considering that it is funny and is ultimately light hearted entertainment.With one of the best positive songs to ever open a film, Space Jam dives deep into one of basketball's all time greats in Michael Jordan.As the title song by Quad City DJ pounds out ""Welcome to the Space Jam, alright!"" we are immediately uplifted and shown numerous pictures from Jordan's life as a basketball player, giving the audience a reflection on the passage to stardom. Sweet, if somewhat cliché inspirational.After Jordan declares he is to leave basketball to become a baseball player we are taken to a typically evil setting, a theme park run by Danny De Vito's Mr Swackhammer, that ugly looking animated evil genius.And then the real fun begins as we see comparisons from real life to fantasy and a charm and sweetness about the extraordinary is encoded to give a feel of light-heartedness.Ultimately Space Jam is actually really funny because it is so silly. There is little realism with just in time situations and how humans actually get into Looney Tune land, but is this a film to give explanation to anything? No. This 1996 Pytka picture is about entertaining the whole family and it does just that.This is a film anyone from the family can sit back and enjoy. The likability of the Looney Tunes will make children laugh, especially the slapstick humour. The basketball players who lose their talents are great viewing for the elder viewers, pure real life styled comedy.The acting from everyone, especially Jordan is poor. Bill Murray (Lost in Translation) is in a small role and as always is great to watch.The music from this picture is outstanding, perfectly fitting to the narrative. From the opening song to Seal's ""Fly like an eagle"" we are given perfect harmony. Not to forget R Kelly's I believe I can fly which speaks for itself.The plot is always entertaining and equally predictable. However the comedy, the likability and relaxation of the film is good enough reason to sit back and enjoy",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Just Plug It,"It's hard not to see this as one long advertisement for Nike, and to many is a step over the line as far as product placement, its the example they will use in the future as the film that went too far.It gained a mark for one or two funny lines, but then maybe I expected them coming from my childhood cartoon heroes, if it had been unfunny then I would show no forgiveness, but as it is I'm pretty cynical as to what the film is bringing to us so it does no harm. I can imagine the number of children wanting expensive sneakers rose highly after witnessing the film, although the number of children wanting to punch Michael Jordan for horrendous acting and the comedy timing of a wombat should have been higher.Redeemable only for a huuuuuuuuge dunk by Elmer Fudd or Porky Pig, which is a classic moment in movie history.

"Not Looney Tunes Style, But Still Good!","This movie is not classic Looney Tunes funny, but it's still pretty good. The characters are fun watching together in one movie, and it's kind of cool that they finally get a feature length movie. The Looney Tunes have always been my favorite cartoons (I'm 19 now). Bugs and Daffy will always be my favorite. I guess I liked it because I'm a big Looney Tune fan. So, for anyone, big or small, watch it.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A movie-length commercial and nothing more.,"""Space Jam"" is an animation/live-action hybrid starring NBA superstar Michael Jordan and the greatest cartoon characters of all time, the Looney Tunes.The plot of the movie is: Mister Swackhammer wants a new attraction for his alien theme park ""Moron Mountain"". He chooses the Looney Tunes, and sends his minions the nerdlucks to earth so they can capture them. The nerdlucks change into giant monsters and kick the Looney Tunes's butts in basketball, so Bugs Bunny and the gang find Michael Jordan to help them.Due to Michael Jordan's HUGE popularity in the '90s, there was obviously a lot of hype surrounding this movie when it came out back in 1996, but just because it has big names doesn't mean it's a good movie, and that is the case with ""Space Jam"". This movie is pretty much an insult to Looney Tunes and the Looney Tunes fans. For one thing this movie introduces Lola Bunny. A pointless character whose only purpose in the franchise is to give Bugs a love interest. Also instead of the physical comedy and battles of wits that made these characters famous, we get overly violent, crude and mean-spirited humor.Other flaws include Jordan's uninspired and overall boring acting performance, the obnoxious and irritating characters that are the nerdlucks, and for the film being just a giant advertisement for Michael Jordan and all of his sponsors.The only good things about this movie are the animation and the voice acting, which are both outstanding, and there a few mildly funny jokes here and there, but overall this movie sucks.Not recommended for hard-core Looney Tunes fans, or people who have been exposed to some actually well made animated movies. If you want to see a good animation/live-action hybrid film, just watch ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" instead, or this film's sequel ""Looney Tunes: Back in Action"". This movie is just bland and one-dimensional.Rating: 3/10 ""Bad""",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
Pure Nostalgia,"Like the Looney Tunes cartoons themselves, they may not have the deepest plot, but thankfully the film captures the fun spirit and humor of the infamous characters just enough to make quite an enjoyable and memorable ride. First i'll address my problems with the film. Like I said before, the plot isn't anything special,and truly amounts as an excuse to get ordan and these characters on the screen together. Jordan is obviously not known for acting, and it can show in certain parts of the film, but for a sports star in his film debut- he's honestly not TOO bad. I also found it kind out of place how they sexualized Lola Bunny, as the main female character, it feels like they definitely could have spent a bit more time developing her character rather than simply someone for people to gush over. That all being said,there is a lot of fun to be had with this film. The CGI is dated, but funny nevertheless, and the use of the 2D animation even in human settings is surprisingly done quite well. I love the look and design of all the Tune characters, as well as the voice actors throughout. The soundtrack is catchy and timely, and all together very enjoyable, and fitting for this 'sports film.' The film is also ridiculously entertaining and quite fast paced, and I laughed many times while watching it, even with having seen it over a dozen times before. At first glance, it may not seem like much other than a timely cash grab to appeal to kids- but at its core the film is very heartfelt and memorable. It may not be a deep film, but its a guilty pleasure I certainly will never get tired of anytime soon.My Rating: 8.4/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A commercial,"I still remember seeing this movie the first time back in '97 or '98 when it arrived on video. As a kid who was obsessed with the NBA and was a WB toons fan this had to be a treat.When I first watched it, I couldn't really pinpoint what really bothered me. I didn't sit right with me and I remember regretting forcing my parents to buy the VHS. I know I was disappointed with the way basketball was depicted... it had absolutely no foul or any sort of rules for that matter. Naturally, no one should expect realistic basketball from this movie, but I still had hoped they would've managed to keep some rules in some way, while still delivering the looney exaggerations.But as an adult I have to say that this is the least of the movies problems. At the time as a kid, I didn't notice that I didn't laugh... or better yet, I've noticed it - I just didn't want to admit it to myself. This is really weak humor, especially compared to the old, classic WB cartoons. It's uninspired, toned-down to the bare minimum and in some instances really annoyed me, because it tried to be ""cool"" at the same time. And that is the main problem I'm having with this one - it's not funny to me, at all, both as a kid and adult.The acting is bad, but that's rather forgiving considering that NBA players aren't professional actors to begin with. The animation and artwork is good, great actually, but by far not enough to save it. It's just a heartless commercial for all the merchandise. Watch ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" and/or ""White Men Can't Jump"" instead.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
"An Great Extravaganza of Comedy, Animation and Basketball.

A Blister on Bugs' Backside,"This movie undoes in 90 minutes what the masters Avery and Jones (and to a lesser extent Freling and McKimpson) did in 20 years and was maintained for 30 more.The plot is inane: If Bugs and co. can't defeat the alien ""Monstars"" in basketball game, they will be enslaved forever. However, with some intelligent writing they could pull it off, but for some reason Bugs has become a complete wimp and enlists old pal Michael Jordan (they had several mutual commercials) to help. Come on! Bugs has defeated threats ten times more menacing all on his own!The characters have seriously degraded. The filmmakers pride themselves on ""modernizing"" the characters. This means that Bugs makes a complete moron out of himself in front of newcomer ""Lola Bunny"", who is the cardboard cutout ""independent female"" and bears absolutely no connection to any element of the Looney Tunes. We are also supposed to laugh at Bugs repeatedly getting pounded into submission. Who is this impostor? He's such a wimp, he can't even defend himself against an ordinary pit bull!And Daffy! After all of the blood, sweat and tears Chuck Jones put into making him one the greatest characters of all time, they reduce him to the spluttering lunatic we thought we'd never see again. His body proportions have been mutated to ridiculous, and his voice is just horrible. Whatever happened to Joe Alaskey?It gets worse. Tweety has lost his innocence, Sylvester is a dolt, Taz is a prop, the Roadrunner and Wile E. Coyote keep up their usual rivalry but have absolutely nothing to do, nobody seems to know what to do with Porky, who seems lost in the movie's jarring, unmerciful pace, and some of the best players for the team (Gossamer, Crusher) are never used. The Nerdlucks/Monstars start out as cuddly, colour-coded Disney sweeties and become uninteresting, uninspired props. Way to go, guys.The only satisfying character is Marvin the Martian, who referees the game. Whoever directed his short sequences had the right idea about what this movie could have been. Instead, we get jokes about urination, saliva and nudity, and some jarring incidences like Daffy muttering ""we're gettin' thcrewed."" Since when do they talk like that?The writers should know that THE LOONEY TUNES DO NOT NEED TO BE MODERNIZED. They have been carefully crafted to always be entertaining well into the new millennium and beyond. Injecting Ren and Stimpy-brand humour and secular music is not becoming at all. Calling in Chuck Jones as a creative consultant would help immensely. However, the only indication that the producer know that he's alive is a sign advertising ""CJ's Toys"". Call me old-fashioned, but I think that would make a better movie than ""Space Jam"".",,Anonymous,Animation
Michael Jordan and Bugs Bunny,"Michael Jordan is playing baseball and really sucks at it. Swackhammer is the owner of the amusement park planet Moron Mountain and he needs new attractions. His underlings arrive on Earth to take Bugs Bunny and the rest of the gang back as prisoners. Bugs trick the tiny aliens into playing basketball for their freedom. However the aliens steal the talents of the greatest NBA star to become basketball monsters. While playing golf with Bill Murray and Larry Bird, Jordan is taken by Bugs to join their team.One has to compare and contrast this to 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit'. There is no excuse for this but the animation looks cheaper. There is some CGI but it's in its early form. It looks like a 90s TV cartoon and doesn't really hold up. There is a more timeless quality about Roger Rabbit. Then there is Jordan. This is very much a vehicle for Jordan but it doesn't make him a good actor. There is really no acting in this. As a pop artifact, it's kind of interesting to see but it's not a good movie. It's mostly for kiddie Jordan fans back in the day.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

Corporate Commerce Disguised as a Movie,"Some cult movies age well, some cult movies don't so much, and some cult movies divide audiences heavily: Space Jam is among the third category. This whole movie was essentially a corporate brain-child to make a movie based on these basketball commercials with Michael Jordan and Bugs Bunny, and when it was out, it gained enough success to garnish a following amongst a whole generation of 90s kids. So now that its legacy is leading us to a sequel next year, how exactly does this movie age? Well, in my eyes, it ages fine...as much as any other dated sports movie.The plot focuses on an evil alien theme park owner named Swackhammer who sends his gang, the Nerdlucks, to kidnap Bugs Bunny and the Looney Tunes for put in the theme park. When Bugs bet their lives on a basketball game to determine their fate, the aliens steal the powers of NBA basketball players, causing Bugs to get help from superstar Michael Jordan. Insane concept enough, and yet that right there sums up the movie's core problem: how determined it is to sell out. As a 90s sports movie, it does little to stand out from the crowd, but considering how obvious the executive meddling was behind the scenes to sell Nike products, it broke the cardinal sin of souring the Looney Tunes even more. Had this been a 7 minute short, Bugs Bunny would have taken the bad guys down so fast, and he wouldn't even need the help from any basketball celebrity. It never feels like anyone of the staff knew how to balance the Looney Tunes or Air Jordan gimmick well, but what would you expect when basing your movie off of corporate commerce?Beyond that, the movie's structure is so weak, as it goes from being about Michael Jordan's career from basketball to baseball, to suddenly being about an inter-galactic amusement park, to the aliens taking away the talents of basketball players, to the Looney Tunes and Jordan teaming up, and yawns ensue. The film's first half is so rushed just to get to the big game that you feel like you need to take a breather after watching it, not helped by the exhausting amount of exposition. If you can't make up your mind on whether your movie is a biopic on Michael Jordan or a weird sports-fantasy Looney Tunes vehicle, either pick one or the other. It feels more like the film focused on the icing more than the cake, because even some scenes that should last about a minute go on for way too long, especially with an unnecessary padded-out B-plot concerning the aforementioned NBA players such as Patrick Ewing and Charles Barkley, who like Jordan himself, can't act to save their lives. It's almost as if there are three different movies in this one 90-minute cluster.Now if there's anything positive to say about the movie, for its time the visuals looked impressive, and not just the wacky and upbeat animation done on the Looney Tunes characters. The huge scope of the movie between the intergalactic amusement park and the insane attention to detail around the basketball stadium is astounding, especially given how much compositing was put into the crowd. That, and even most of the Looney Tunes voice-actors such as Billy West, Dee Baker, Bill Farmer and Bob Bergen did seem to have fun with the material they were given, even if it was third-rate. Unfortunately, that's where the positives sorta seize, and you know some characters like Lola Bunny and Swackhammer are so bland and paper-thin that not even talents like Kath Soucie and DannyDeVito can save them. However, at least Lola went from every other hot-girl archetype into a more fully realized character in later Looney Tunes incarnations; the same cannot be said for those obnoxious Nerdlucks they're so irritating.In the end, Space Jam may be fondly remembered by generations of 90s kids, but to anyone else, it's little more than a cynical cash-grab from Warner Bros. to capitalize on the popularity of both Looney Tunes and Michael Jordan through corporate synergy...and yet it worked. To this day, there's still the occasional merchandising of the Tasmanian devil in Chicago Bulls attire, and the movie was replayed in theaters for its 20th anniversary. With a sequel planned to come out next year, until time will tell if LeBron James, Malcolm D. Lee and Warners nowadays can at least do a better job than Joe Pytka and Ivan Reitman.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation

Stupid But Entertaining,"Michael Jordan and assorted Looney Tunes cartoon characters play against aliens in a game of basketball. Adapted from an unpublished Shakespeare play, I believe.

Bill Murray is great in his small part but that's no surprise. As for the Looney Tunes characters: as with most modern versions of them, they are pretty lame. They lack the edge and humor of the classics. Not to mention the voices are weak. The addition of a new politically correct character, Lola Bunny, is insulting on several levels.

Watching Old Footage of Jordan With the Bulls Would Be More Fulfilling.,"NBA superstar Michael Jordan made the leap from the hardcourts to the big screen in this small film that is little more than a ploy to capitalize on the popular Nike commercials starring Jordan and Bugs Bunny. The Looney Tunes are about to become slaves to some evil little animated monsters unless they can defeat the creatures in a winner-take-all basketball game. Naturally the monsters change by stealing the talents of various other NBA stars (Patrick Ewing, Charles Barkley, Tyrone Bogues, Larry Johnson and Shawn Bradley) and it is up to Bugs, Daffy and company to enlist the help of the greatest player ever---Jordan. Larry Bird and Bill Murray are super in limited action, but overall the movie is just one of those films used to make money and little else. Jordan does prove to be a likeable screen presence as he just plays himself. Not a bad film, but nothing really impressive either. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,Animation

It seems like it was made in an attempt to keep them relevant and in the public eye while capitalising on Michael Jordan's popularity of the time.I'm afraid it did nothing for me, bar a few laughs. The basketball players were quite obviously not actors and the alien creatures were too much.

"Lousy and awful, find something else to watch!!","What a horribly made movie, blame the producer, director or who ever is responsible for such a STUPID STORYLINE.it COULD have been good, it had all the looney tunes cartoons and some basketball greats.

Its as if it was MJ's mother who wrote the movie, all about kissing his a.. and often showing MJs shoes then slowly going up to his up close face; and this happens at least a few times. if you're a female and have some romantic ""thing"" for MJ? and like seeing his UP CLOSE!! face over and over, showing his mid section up close? then its the movie for you.if you want a family movie? Then DO NOT waste time on Space Jam. find something else. towards the beginning it has bugs sexually frustrated in a stupid, awkward way.

"What's Up, Mike?","Mixing together live-action and cartoon, Space Jam brings real world NBA into the goofy world of the Looney Tunes, in a perplexing, but charming team-up. While the story is whimsical and maintains the fun of the Looney Tunes show, the plot feels as if it were built around signing Michael Jordan, with slow and boring parts throughout. With that being said, I would have watched a full movie about the 5 basketball players, stripped of their skills and adjusting to comical life. The voice cast and live action cast have a ton of fun in their roles, with Michael Jordan having a lot of energy and charisma onscreen. The jokes are entertaining, with nothing too noteworthy or quotable throughout, but the Looney Tunes have always been about entertainment and not laugh out loud hysteria. While it was a fun ride, I don't see myself running back to rewatch Space Jam again anytime soon.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Spectacle collab with an empty story,"Space Jam is a movie that finds an excuse to bring Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes characters together into a basketball match. The excuse is that a space amusement park wants to steal the cartoon characters and they agree to go if they loose in a basketball match against some space critters who steal NBA players talent and became huge to get an edge. The story is super predictable. It is full of clichés like they are bad at the first half, then they become great in the second, or a 1 point score difference as a result of a prolonged ending. Obviously, it was written in advance, it isn't live sport. The whole story is nonsense anyway. Of course, it is a Looney Tunes movie so what could we expect? The jokes should be the main selling point, but it isn't funny nonsense, its just unconcerning for the viewer. The real world scenes cannot be taken seriously and the overacted roles with the forced jokes doesn't work at all. Every IRL scene was mind numbing to watch. The Looney Tunes characters were fine in their goofiness, they did deliver a few good jokes, but they don't really excel as well IRL as in their cartoon world, and other than the novelty of seeing them in our world, there aren't really any jokes coming from them being here.Michael Jordan doesn't provide much apart from his fame. He is mostly just there being cool. Wayne Knight is outright annoying. His clumsy, overzealous, slapstick humor is not funny at all, and every scene he is in is just unbearable. Same can be said about Bill Murray: he is just there being nonsense and not funny.Technical implementation is nice, especially for the time. It is the greatest thing the movie can offer. While there are some imperfections and a few scene's effects are really cheap by today's standard, generally the characters are well integrated, especially in the night scenes where they matched the lighting and the mood really well.All in all, the greatest thing this movie offers is that you can see Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes characters together. Sadly it doesn't deliver in any other areas and by its own, this isn't enough. Seeing cartoon characters in the real world and their goofiness might be fine for kids, but it was mostly a boring watch.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
"An Energetic, Enjoyable, Altogether Fun Movie With Great Animation","This may sound pathetic, but of all the films I have seen (and I have seen many), ""Space Jam"" holds a special place in my heart. It's actually the first film I saw by myself at the movie theaters. I liked it when I was 14, but I always make sure when I write a review that I see a movie more recently. Movies as I remember them are not always what they are.Fourteen years later, even though Michael Jordan has retired and CGI animation reigns supreme, ""Space Jam"" still stands up. Critics may label it a kid's movie, but its dialogue is funny and far from intelligence insulting. Plus, I thought the overall story was creative and inventive, although a little weird and out there sometimes. But hey, aren't all Looney Tunes a little weird and out there? Aren't those characteristics what has made them relevant throughout many generations?I loved the fact that this movie could have been a vanity piece for Michael Jordan, but it wasn't. The temptation must have been there to make a movie similar to Muhammad Ali's mediocre ""The Greatest"" (1977). After all, Jordan was at the height of his popularity at the time this movie was released, and the Chicago Bulls had just won the NBA Finals that year (with two more championship wins to come).With the Looney Tunes added into the mix, you get a far more creative premise. I really liked how the movie took place circa 1993-1995, from when Jordan retired from the NBA to his notorious stint playing minor league baseball for the Birmingham Barons (a farm team for the Chicago White Sox) to his triumphant return to the Bulls. I would really like to know how the premise came about to have the Looney Tunes characters persuade Jordan to take up basketball again. It doesn't matter who came up with it or how. It was just weaved into the real life story very creatively.As random a plot as it is, the Looney Tunes live in a cartoon community underneath the Earth, and puny aliens from a failing intergalactic amusement park called Moron Mountain come to abduct the cartoon characters for their next attraction. These aliens are not very smart, prompting the clever Bugs Bunny to convince them to challenge the Looney Tunes to a basketball game instead of immediately kidnapping them. The aliens agree, except they also apparently have the ability to steal basketball playing ability (or talent) from real NBA players. Each of the five aliens gets into the brains of Charles Barkley, Patrick Ewing, Larry Johnson, Muggsy Bogues, and Shawn Bradley, and steal their talent. Apparently, this also gives the aliens the ability to shape shift and become large monsters, or ""MonSTARS"", as they are known here.If you really try to insert logic into this plot, you're going to hate this movie. Looney Tunes cartoons were never logical, so why should this plot be? They were always funny and entertaining, and so is this movie.Once Michael Jordan enters their cartoon world, it's amazing how well he interacts with the characters. Perhaps the best scene is when Bugs Bunny kisses Jordan, and the reaction from him that follows. Jordan's not a great actor, obviously, but you really forget while you're watching this movie that he is actually in front of a green screen not talking to anyone. This is by far the best live action and animation combination since ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" (1988).There's really little to fault this movie on. It's funny both in animation and real life. Wayne Knight as pushy publicist Stan Podolak was very funny, and Bill Murray (as himself) was especially hilarious, particularly when he joins the Tune Squad. I still love how Daffy Duck asked him how he got to the cartoon world, and he says (in typical Bill Murray style), ""Oh, the producer's a friend of mine. I had one of the teamster's drop me off."" It gets me every time.I highly recommend ""Space Jam"". It is one of the best kids movies ever made, its story is random, but solid, and its a highly enjoyable film, not to mention a fitting tribute to the Looney Tunes and the NBA glory days of the 1990's. And this movie managed to pull this off without letting product placement or short term endorsements get in the way. That feat is still incredible.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
MJ with the Slam,"Space Jam is a very good movie for children who love sports. This movie stars Michael Jordan who is an NBA star at the beginning and then converts into a Major League Baseball player in the Chicago White Sox farm system. But soon after becoming a baseball player like his dad, many of the NBA's greatest get their talents stolen by aliens from another planet. When Michael finds out he soon is alerted and goes after these aliens to get the stars their talents back. While he's golfing in an instant he finds himself slipping through a small golf hole. When he comes out the other end of the hole he finds himself in looney toon land. He sees Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Lola Bunny and all the looney toon characters you can think of. This movie teaches kids to keep thriving for what they want and never give up. It's telling them no matter how tall people are, how tough people are, never give up because of some disadvantages. When Michael is challenged by the aliens who stole the stars talents Michael takes the challenge to face them. But they made a deal. If Michael won the stars would get their talents back, and if the aliens won Michael had to stay in looney toon land forever. The aliens had accepted the challenge. Halfway through the game Bill Murray shows up and helps Michael. When Michael gets the help from Bill, they come from behind and win. The stars get their talents back and Michael gets to go home. The moral of this story is to always keep thriving and never give up.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Treat for Kids and Adults Alike,"Space Jam really is an inter-generational film, anybody will enjoy it. First of all, the Looney Tunes appear which appeals to just about anyone who grew up from 1930 forward. Secondly, it's a sports film aimed at kids with Michael Jordan appearing. Everybody knows who he is, unless they've lived under a rock the last 30 years!The story is sort of cheesy and corny, but that's just pure Looney Tunes. New characters were developed specifically for this film too, there's Lola Bunny and the MonStars. Who can forget Danny DeVito as the voice of their leader? And Bill Murray cameos as himself and gets mistaken for Dan Aykroyd! How?The music in the film is mostly remembered by one song, I Believe I Can Fly by R. Kelly. Space Jam is a magical, whimsical film for kids and adults alike.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"The main lesson of this film is: never have the ""Looney Tunes"" characters play basketball. Ever!","""Space Jam"" (1996), for those of you who may not know, I'm a devoted fan of the ""Looney Tunes"" cartoons. In fact, ""Looney Tunes"" is one of my top ten all-time favorite animated shows! I remember very vaguely when this ""movie"" was brand new. Although, I was around four years old at the time! When I watched ""Space Jam"" for the first time, I was either eight or nine and I did like it, somewhat. However, when I watched it years later, I just found myself feeling empty and disappointed. Then, the more I saw it, the more the problems just continued to show on the screen. ""Space Jam"" has a dumb and cliched storyline, standard to horrible acting, and a boring soundtrack to try and tie it all together. The plot is, the ""Looney Tunes"" characters must win a basketball game in order to earn their freedom. So, they enlist the help of basketball champion Michael Jordan. Yes, it's just as stupid as it sounds. It's basically real-life humans entering the animated world and cartoon characters uttering one-liners and corny dialogue, while trying to give some sort of resemblance of a performance. Watching this ""film"" today, there is next to no humor, I don't feel any kind of tension and for the most part, nothing happens. To tell you the truth, the biggest reason I gave into watching this ""movie"", was because the ""Looney Tunes"" were in it! There are other films out there that do a much better job putting animated characters, including ""Looney Tunes"", with real-life people. A few prime examples are: ""Mary Poppins"" (1964), ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" (1988) and ""Looney Tunes: Back in Action"" (2003). Those three movies are phenomenal, and they all mix animation with live-action seamlessly. Unfortunately, ""Space Jam"" looks extremely lazy and rushed. Also, some of you already know this, but if you don't, I'm not a fan of sports. However, since ""Space Jam"" is just a ""film"", I'm able to overlook that fact. There are plenty of sports movies I enjoy, including basketball films. That being said, ""Looney Tunes"" and basketball do not go together, at all. Listen, I'm all for reinventing a genre while pushing the envelope. But, ""Space Jam"" goes way too far with it's overall premise. The fact that I liked it as a kid just blows my mind! As for the acting, it's a big letdown. The best performances come from the voice actors of the ""Looney Tunes"" characters. At this point, the one and only Mel Blanc was dead and they needed different voice actors for the main characters. I thought the ones they got did a decent job! Sadly, the dialogue is what ruined everything for me. But, probably the worst performance in this ""movie"" is from Michael Jordan. To be fair, he is trying very hard and it shows here. Because, for the most part, he's reacting to nothing but a green or blue screen. He may have been putting effort into his role, but the most crucial thing was missing here, acting! As far as the soundtrack goes, it's about as boring and cliched as you can get. To be fair, there are some good parts in this film score. But overall, it's nothing to write home about. The crazy thing is, that this soundtrack was composed by James Newton-Howard! I was shocked by that, because he has written some great film scores for other movies. What happened to him here? Now, let's get to the only two good elements in this piece of garbage. The only good things are the sets/locations and the special effects. All of the sets/locations are great and give this ""film"" a decent atmosphere. As far as the special effects go, all of them are well-done and still hold up to this day. They do get a little cheesy at times, but for a ""movie"" like this, it's warranted. ""Space Jam"" is, quite possibly, the biggest disappointment in all of ""Looney Tunes"" media. I'm giving this ""film"" 2 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Just stay away from ""Space Jam"", even if you're a ""Looney Tunes"" fan. This ""movie"" disgraces those iconic characters, don't watch it. The crazy thing is, that it somehow milked a sequel, called: ""Space Jam: A New Legacy"" (2021)! Of course, I'm not interested in seeing it. Especially due to the fact that they actually had the balls to make the ""Looney Tunes"" characters into CGI abominations. ""Looney Tunes"" has suffered the CGI touch of death! Any way, for the sake of your decency, avoid ""Space Jam"" at all costs. You'll wind up with nothing but pure emptiness and disappointment!",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
A fun movie and a milestone in visual effects,"Much like ""Who framed Roger Rabbit?"" before it, this movie set out to combine animation with live action, this time bringing the iconic Looney Tunes-characters to life.The results are just what you could imagine, a very impressive movie with ground-breaking effects and, as always when it comes to Looney Tunes, a fun setting.It's not a masterpiece really, but it stands out as an important adventure movie that captures the feeling of childhood, with a surprisingly good performance by basket ball player Michael Jordan.Overall, it is definitely a movie to give a watch for anyone with a child's perspective and appreciation for good effects!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
That was a slam dunk.,"Space Jam (1996) was a movie I watched back when I was a kid on one of the old movie channels and I loved it. Now I'm not say that this is a good movie because it isn't, but it is a personal favorite guilty pleasure of mine.Positives for Space Jam (1996):
This movie has a simple job and that is to entertain the audience with some Looney Tunes shenanigans and basketball. The movie is extremely well paced and it keeps your attention from beginning to end. The Looney Tunes are just as entertaining and wild with their antics as they've always been. I have to say that Micheal Jordan was very good as himself here. I also liked seeing both Wayne Knight and Bill Murray getting involved in the action . Then, you have Mr. Swackhammer and the Monstars who are excellent as the main villains of the movie. And finally, the basketball game mixed with the Looney Tunes slapstick humor is one of the best and most entertaining movie games in the history of cinema.Overall, Space Jam (1996) is everything I'm looking for in a guilty pleasure movie and while it might not be considered high art, it is so damn entertaining.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

I love this movie,"The story is smart and clever with lots of laughs. Balancing the Looney Tunes with the NBA was no easy task, but they did a terrific job blending the two. This was based on commercials in 1992 except for the aliens from outer space trying to kidnap the Looney Tunes and take the talents of the various basketball players. When the Looney Tunes see the results of how the aliens literally transform into the appearances of the basketball players they've stolen the talents of, they immediately seek Michael Jordan for help. The only thing that doesn't make sense is how the Looney Tunes knew where Michael Jordan was. During the golf course scene, Bill Murray and Larry Bird didn't even care. I still love the rest.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Slam Dunk!,"After years of growing up, I saw this in theaters for an anniversary screening, and not only do I think it's good, I think it's great. It's an under-appreciated Warner Bros. Animated Movie. It's funny, intense, and catchy. All in all, it's entertaining. My only nitpick is the Animaniacs Characters aren't in there, and that could've made the movie a lot funnier, but then again, this is really nit picky, it's a great movie for 90's kids, and it's a good movie for all sports fans all around the world.

No Roger Rabbit but it still scores high,"It's hard to get sport celebrities in with big name franchises. The main reason why it's difficult is because of how well the celebrity can act. Michael Jordan is no Oscar nominee but his acting isn't bad and he fits in well with his surroundings. Even if they are a bunch of post- production drawings.Space Jam is the story of a once really good basketball player, Michael Jordan, who ends up off his game. But it's not until he's brought back to life and into the world of playing basketball when he runs into some very looney characters. These individuals are none other than the Looney Tunes characters. The Tunes' problem is that they've been challenged by a group of aliens who call themselves ""The Monstars"" to a game of basketball and if they lose, they surrender their freedom to becoming main attractions to a lousy theme park known as ""Moron Mountain"".The owner of Moron Mountain is Swackhammer played by Danny DeVito, who oddly enough sounds a lot like Phil from Disney's Hercules (1997). Unfortunately, the rest of the voice actors who play the Looney Tunes characters are not performed by Mel Blanc or by his son. That's just one of two problems I have with this film. I'm not saying they're not good but Blanc is the best.Daffy Duck's voice just isn't the same. It is close, but it's not the right fit. At least the casting department could have had Joe Alaskey from Looney Tunes: Back In Action (LTBIA)(2003) to do Daffy's voice. His imitation was much better. And as a personal favorite I would've preferred to see Marvin the Martian have more screen time than just being a ref for the game. LTBIA had more screen time for him even if he was an antagonist.Besides this, everything else was done really well. The animation is good as are the sequences where live-action takes over which were also very well executed. The jokes are great too. Even adding in a love interest for Bugs was an interesting take. Too bad Lola was cut from LTBIA. The music, composed by James Newton Howard was also great to listen to. It had all the characteristics one would expect to hear in a live-action animation feature film.Space Jam combines live-action animation and sports to create a kid/adult friendly film for everyone to enjoy. The music, jokes and characters (including Michael Jordan) are all respectable.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Top Notch Acting or Basketball?,"The 1996 smash hit, Space Jam, received as much adoration from its young fans as it did receive criticism from its adult viewers. Directed by Joe Pytka, it stars NBA legend Michael Jordan, as he teams up with the Looney Tunes, to play in the ""Ultimate Game"" that decides the fate of these cartoon characters. It (the film) also features other NBA stars like Charles Barkley, Patrick Ewing, and so on. This was a Live- Action/Animated film, unique among its kind, following the other famous Live-Action/Animated film, Who Framed Roger Rabbit?.Although it received widespread acclaim from its younger viewers, people ultimately came to see Michael Jordan play basketball with the Looney Tunes, not to see him act. The real live athletes/actors, especially Jordan, were at best good, if not decent. These guys make their living playing sports, not reading scripts. To say, when it came to acting, they wouldn't win an Oscar. However, there is no doubt in anyone one's mind that the only person meant to play the hero in this movie would be none other than Michael Jordan. He doesn't possess the proper acting skills that a hero should have but his personality and the fact that he is who he is suits him best to the action of the film. Some critics claimed that MJ would eventually be featured in a full length film, this being ""the one."" Michael Jordan, at the time, possessed a certain aura, deeming him to be the best basketball player at the time, if not in history.In the same way people wanted to see MJ play basketball with the Looney Tunes, people wanted to see how the Looney Tunes would fare in a full feature length film. Scenes involving them spared no detail, as the personalities that we have come to know and love like Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck are marvelously created and adapted to this movie. At certain points of the movie, the acting of the characters, especially the dialogue that went on with, was whimsical and clever at the same time. The personality and the acting of the Looney Tunes were best suited for the film, being that these characters would easily adapt to the plot of the film better than those of the Disney Brand. In one scene, there was a reference to Pulp Fiction and another scene where they made jest of Disney. In comparison to their famous short length cartoons, the Looney Tunes characters had to stretch out a bit more of their talent. New jokes and references were made, as they had a lot more screen time than they are accustomed to. The Looney Tunes had rougher acting than the real live actors because there was the demand the children put on them. Though there were references that were only understood by older audiences, the cartoon characters were put there to capture the attention and hearts of the children. Although they've included some of the classic acts of the characters, more had to be done because of the longer screen time they had.Overall, the film was great for younger audiences and, at the time, a technological marvel, as it combined the use of live action and animation to act as one. As a result, when it came to acting, it wasn't Oscar-winning material, but it sure captured the love of many children. I'd say that the athletes and characters gave the movie a bit more hype than it should have. I rate the film an 8.5 out of 10.

Michael Jordan...,"Michael Jordan and Bugs Bunny team up to create a master piece of galactic preportions. The mix of real life and cartoon is flawless, and Michael Jordan's kids are cute. The Looney Tunes team is the perfect comedic relief needed for the oppression of the Monstars. Bill Murray is definitely good, he sweats a lot as well which is good, as well. Michael Jordan's epic slam dunk at the end when he stretches his arm across the entire basketball court in the cartoon world against the Monstars is definitely his best slam dunk ever...even beating the classic Air Jordan...and he's a bad baseball player, that's why he returns to basketball. Muggsy Bogues, Charles Barkley, Patrick Ewing, and Shawn Bradley are good. Larry Bird is an impressive golfer.

The pace of the movie is good and doesn't get boring for kids. The merging of animation and reality was superb, similar to Roger Rabbit, which I believe was made by the same producer. The reason it was not a ten for me was that some scenes were not necessary or drag out a little too long. Also the story could have been a little fine-tuned to make it just a little more logical for adults.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
One Of My Favorite Films Growing Up,"Space Jam is one of my favorite childhood films. Set during Michael Jordan's struggling baseball career, the basketball legend is summoned to Looney Tune Land as it faces it biggest crisis: little aliens from an intergalactic amusement park have been sent to force them there as entertainment, and after challenging them to a basketball game, the aliens decide to take the talent of the best basketball players of the time and use it to transform into Monstars.Yeah, this is a good movie. The story is set around real life (as Michael is playing baseball) and it has some good characters. Wayne Knight (best known for playing Newman in Seinfeld and Dennis Nerdy in Jurassic Park) plays Stanley Podolak, who serves as one of the comic reliefs of the movie, and the film would be the one to introduce Lola Bunny, a female bunny who Bugs would have a crush on. Also, NBA players Charles Barkley, Patrick Ewing, Shawn Bradley, Larry Johnson, and Muggsy Bogues, who were NBA greats at the time of the film, star as the players who get their talent stolen, and even Bill Murray and Larry Bird are in this.For voice work, Billy West (best known to some as the voice of Phillip J. Fry in Futurama as well as the red M&M) voices Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd, with Kath Souric voicing Lola. Danny DeVito voices the film's villain, Swackhammer. The voice acting is perfect, as the actors nail the characters they voice.As for humor, there is plenty of it. Otherwise, it wouldn't be Looney Tunes.

"A Nostalgic Landmark For Those Who ""Lived It""","Most people consider ""Toy Story"" to be the animated movie that bridged the ""playful kiddie stuff"" with ""sophisticated adult appeal"" to produce a product that all could enjoy. However, I think that sometimes this quirky little gem is overlooked in the pantheon of animated fare as it shares many of those same ""Toy Story"" traits.For a basic plot summary, ""Space Jam"" sees ""former"" (during his ""baseball years"") NBA great Michael Jordan (played by himself, of course!) join forces with Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, and all the other Looney Tunes gang to play a b-ball games against the evil minions of Swackhammer of Moron Mountain in Toon Land.The reason this film works so well is two-fold:First, it is just a great kid's movie. I mean, what kid doesn't like the Looney Tunes, right?! There are enough crazy antics to keep most kids entertained for the runtime.The true hallmark of the film, though, is how well it stands up to ""nostalgia viewers"" like myself, or those who saw it ""live"" back in 1996. ""Space Jam"" took full advantage of Michael Jordan's mystique (back when the NBA was relevant to everyone and still fighting the NFL for popularity), added some great music, and even capitalized on Jordan's retirement by making it a plot point.Simply put, ""Space Jam"" may be somewhat of a forgotten effort due to basketball's waning popularity, the time gone by after Jordan, and the fact that even the Looney Tunes themselves are no longer as popular as they once were. However, the cultural significance of this movie (for those who ""lived it"") cannot be ignored. When Jordan is flying around the court and ""I Believe I Can Fly"" is crooning in the background, this is pure magic for the nostalgic set.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Michael Jordan decides whether or not he wants to help the Looney Tunes in their basketball game against aliens to help free them from living a life of slavery.,"Space Jam, made in 1996, has major sentimental values to me regarding my childhood. However, when evaluating the movie considering these three criteria: plot, characters, and rating, I must remove all emotional connections from ""Space Jam.""Michael Jordan began filming this movie during his second year back from his first retirement. However, the movie is about his retirement in which he plays baseball for the Barons. The Looney Tunes, in trouble with some aliens from outer space, know that he is the best and ""kidnap"" Michael to play against the little midget aliens in basketball. However, the aliens steal the talent of five famous NBA players and soon go from being little monsters to the ""Monstars."" Michael Jordan agrees to help the Looney Tunes in one more basketball game to help the Looney Tunes with their freedom. This plot, obviously cheesy, is a somewhat oversensitive to the target age group.The Looney Tunes, one of the most successful bunch of characters of all time, create the perfect environment for this movie. The mixture of cartoon characters and Michael Jordan make an odd balance dimensionally, but still did a solid job of creating a somewhat authentic reality.Lastly, the ratings for this movie are pretty low. This makes sense because these ratings are only done by adults, who are less likely to enjoy the movie simply because it was not addressed to their age group. Also, the movie is overall.. Well, corny! It's hard to enjoy something you know is too unrealistic to relate with.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

A Masterpiece For Family Entertainment and a Decent Movie Overall,"I think Space Jam is a timeless family classic that is one of the best of it's genre. I first watched this movie when I was 5 years old and 7 years later I still love it!I don't think the remake would be great because remaking this movie for me is like remaking Back To The Future. It was great for this story this time, and it's just like an idea that some comedians made up that TOTALLY works. Of course coming from this genre it isn't a masterpiece or something like that but it is really outstanding like I said for it's genre. I think the characters are great. The Looney Tunes are funny as always,Lola Bunny is a good addition for Bugs Bunny's Love interest. And I always loved Bill Murray's Cameo. For it's genre a 10/10 but overall an 8/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Space Jam - A '90s Guilty Pleasure,"This movie is far from being a masterpiece, but it is a dumb & fun film to enjoy, especially with your kids, as well. I mean come on, you've got Michael Jordon helping the Looney Tunes in a basketball game to save them from being enslaved by aliens for their amusement park, it is an unbelievable thing to see in film, but hey, Hollywood will green-light anything. This is a movie I've seen as a little kid on VHS, and I simply fell in love with it, and since then it has become a guilty pleasure of mine.I wasn't put off by Jordon's acting, I thought he did... okay. Not Oscar-worthy, but I believe he did better than Shaq. I also enjoy the other famous b-ball players playing themselves in this, especially Charles Barkley and Patrick Ewing. And you've got Bill Murray basically playing his nonchalant self. *Spoilers:* There's one moment when the villain first sees Murray, he says, ""I didn't know Dan Aykroyd was in this picture."" Love that. XD The animation with the Looney Tunes was really good for its time, aside from the basketball court which looks really fake, but, eh. And it's also good to see ALL of the Tunes in this, a majority of them attending the b-ball game.The one thing one can't deny is the amazing soundtrack featured in the film, especially the title song, Fly Like an Eagle, I Believe I Can Fly, Basketball Jones, For You I Will, etc. I even always sit through the entire end credits just to listen to the songs in it. It's astounding this one film has so many great singers on its soundtrack.Also, check out the DVD audio commentary to this film, it's actually hilarious, it has voice actors Billy West (Bugs Bunny) and Dee Bradley Baker (Daffy Duck) interacting with Bugs and Daffy, the latter two who steal the show. And it's always a bit funny to hear director Joe Pitka literally walk in and out of the commentary by hearing his footsteps and door closing.I'm sorry, I couldn't be the only one who truly likes this film. It's certainly better than Looney Tunes: Back in Action, that's for sure. If you (or your kid) likes Looney Tunes, then give this one a shot, you may find some form on entertainment out of it. Not a masterpiece, but certainly not as bad as the Rotten Tomatoes rating makes it out.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Our childhood.,"This film is associated with my childhood. Recently I rewatched it, and it looks great too. Firstly, the plot is very interesting, it was something new - to connect real actors with animation. The idea of basketball match was new too, this film doesn't look like something else. Secondly, the animation itself and the way how it includes to real action look great.
So, it's nice film for all family.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
This movie is my favorite one,I love this movie man it is so good. So first off it's about basketball and who could not like basketball. Second off my favorite player is in it and that is Michael Jordan he is so cool bro. But that chicken character has to go because chickens give me the creeps. Bugs Bunny is cool with me though. This movie aged very well and it is better then all modern movies even Space Jam a new legacy which that movie is still a 10 it is way worse then this one. They should really make a third movie for space jam to be honest. So this movie overall is very good and deserves a 10 for everything in this movie.,10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Without a doubt, THE 2ND-GREATEST MOVIE IN THE HISTORY OF THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE!!!","This is absolutely awesome!!! Terrific! I love and highly recommend it! No one wouldn't like it! It has to be the best Sci-Fi movie, the best sports movie, the best looney toons movie, the best 1990's movie, the coolest movie and the 2nd-best movie ever! IT HAS TO BE!!!The quality and animation effects of this movie is AWESOME for its time!!! They've done an awesome job!!! The effects look so real and yet cartoon at the same time! The chroma key is so real!!! The animation is the best cartoon animation!!!The actors mostly play themselves, Michael Jordan, William Murray along with Michael's family and the NBA. There's also the voice of Daniel Devito (from Jumanji 3: Third Level, The Simpsons, the one and only Ivan and Hercules), William Richard Werstine (from Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius, he hates the next looney toons movie after this 'cause he didn't play Bugs Bunny), Dee Bradley Baker (from Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius and many Spider-Man toons) and William Farmer (actor of Goofy). The humour is just as good as usual in looney toons, it also stars Wayne Knight (from Toy Story 2 and Jurassic Park) and Franklin Windell Welker who talentedly plays animal sounds in pretty much every movie. Twice in this movie, it uses the 2nd-greatest noise in the universe!!! CASTLE THUNDER!!!This movie stands out for ""fun"". And the main moral is to not stop doing what you love.The music is EPIC!!! No wonder it's called Space ""JAM"". The theme song is jammy rockin' awesomely cool!!! Other songs too but especially the theme!!!Overall in conclusion, I highly recommend this movie for anyone in the universe especially on special occasions, 'cause you'll never not like it! Get or see this movie if you haven't already, maybe you could get the songs too! The metal versions are better. This movie is only in 2nd place in the best movies in the world just under Wallace and Gromit!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A 1996 Family Classic That Holds Up Well To This Day,"I was a kid in grade school when this movie first came out on Nov. 15th, 1996. I still remembered how excited I was wanting to see Bugs Bunny and fellow Tunes teaming up with NBA legend Michael Jordan against alien forces challenging them to a game of basketball. Essentially, it's like paying two for the price of one movie if you catch my meaning. It also marked the debut of female bunny Lola as an avid team player that won the heart of Bugs himself and countless other fans with her skills.The Looney Tunes have had numerous cartoon shorts for decades that showed off their whimsical, fourth wall-breaking, meta humor. So to utilize all of that into a live-action/animated sports adventure comedy was cutting edge in technology at the time with the animation sequences blending seamlessly well in either a live-action environment or a live character in an animated world. It worked for Who Framed Roger Rabbit and it's likely the filmmakers used that movie as an influence to crafting this production.Without a doubt it's a movie that I still hold dear with its talented cast in the likes of Jordan (not bad for a non-actor), featuring comedians Wayne Knight and Bill Murray. They've all done their part and performed with such ease. And its music soundtrack is also mesmerizing. Whether you're familiar with Jordan's b-ball playing prowess or how much you've tuned in to Looney Tunes growing up on TV, today's audiences should check this out if they haven't already.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Excellent basketball film with humour, fun and an awesome soundtrack","'Space Jam' is an excellent. It is a completely different film to different Basketball films such as 'White Men Can't Jump' and Above The Rim' and might seem a bit unusual but it is a film which is fun to watch. 'Space Jam' is a film about Michael Jordan who plays himself and has retired from Basketball and is now playing Baseball. Some small weird animated characters led by an evil cigar smoking boss wants to get hold of some people. So they hear about The Looney Tunes Characters Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Sylvester The Cat, Tweetie Pie and some other characters. They do manage to get hold of these characters led by Bugs Bunny and want him. Meanwhile some other famous Basketball Players who play themselves such as Charles Barkley, Patrick Ewing, Larry Bird etc are still playing and are involved in matches, but when they are still playing matches in the NBA, the small animated characters get inside both Charles Barkleys body and Patrick Ewings body making them lose their strength, skill and ability and steal it which also turns the small animated characters into huge powerful giants and also cause Charles Barkley, Patrick Ewing, Larry Bird and others to stop playing because they've lost it all. Bugs Bunny confronts Michael Jordan and tells him about playing Basketball, he says he's retired but the Looney tunes characters really want him to play. They also have created a basketball court where none of the human basketball fans can see them play. Michael Needs some of the Looney Tunes characters to get his Basketball Clothes and Boots from his house. When that is done they have to face these huge aggressive animated characters in a match but he tells his Looney Tunes team to stick together and work hard and not give up. Bill Murray also comes to a match to help. Before the final match Michael has to make a deal with these huge animated characters that if he wins he stays with his Looney Tunes team or if he losses they can have him. So a tough match goes ahead and finally Michael wins doing a massive slam dunk, jumping above the huge animated characters and managing to put the ball into the net. He succeeds and after the match the evil cigar smoking boss of the huge animated character comes and they get rid of him. The next thing they are able to pull their bodies making themselves go down to the very small size they were. They said they didn't want to be so huge. Jordan puts the Ball into his bag and leaves. In a hall, Charles Barkley, Patrick Ewing, Larry Bird etc are all seated. Michael walks in, they all say hi and then Michael takes the ball out of his bag and tells them to hold it by putting their hand on it, they are afraid but slowly they do it after being told again to hold it and they get their skills, abilities and stamina back. This film has an awesome soundtrack and was definitely a fun, humorous and enjoyable film to watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Space Jam: A Surprising Cinematic Slam Dunk,"""Space Jam emerged as a wholly unexpected cinematic experience upon its release, transforming a trip to the movies into an unparalleled spectacle. Witnessing this film on the big screen, coupled with its extensive marketing campaign, was nothing short of a phenomenon. Moreover, we cannot overlook the significant influence Warner Brothers wielded at the time, making Space Jam a fresh and unexpected twist in the cinematic landscape.While not the first attempt to blend animated characters with the real world, Space Jam executed this concept impressively well. And how could one resist the allure of the movie? It featured the most celebrated and acclaimed basketball player of the era, alongside the most iconic and beloved cartoon characters of the time, in an animated format. Watching this wildly entertaining adventure was an absolute delight. Each character remained true to their essence, and as for the plot and script, they might have been considered 'standard' both then and now, but that doesn't detract from the film becoming a classic among classics. An excellent 9/10.The movie boasts a strong sound design and an artistic approach that skillfully combines animation with reality (though admittedly, it leans heavily into the fantastical). Its frenetic action also evokes a wide range of emotions in the audience. Simply put, I loved it.""",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Let your kids enjoy,"So many here have said it better than I'll be able to do. It isn't about what we as parents remember or the continuity of a story once told.

A slam dunk even today!,"I remember the NBA was a big thing in the 90's and Michael Jordan was the king of the court. He was good enough to convince me to be a basketball player for some time (until I dropped out of the sport as we all do). At the same time, I loved the Looney Tunes as well, inventive, funny, and sometimes even thought-provoking at times. So this movie was the perfect combination like peanut butter and jelly. Michael surprisingly acts decent, not Oscar-worthy mind you, but decent. The slamming soundtrack and cartoon antics just add to the fun. Even 20 years after its release, I still come back to this time and time again, it's just too much fun to watch plus some nice comedy thrown into the mix as well.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

The great nineties classic of Michael Jordan and Bugs Bunny,"With the fame of Looney Tunes in the world of animation and the fame of Michael Jordan and other NBA stars in the world of basketball, uniting them both in a movie was a crazy idea that ended up resulting in a memorable movie from the 90s. Using the method of live action mixed with animation, the film is a fantasy story where the real world and the world of animation intersect. The CGI used in this movie didn't need to look professional because it's part of the cartoony tone the movie has and it fits it perfectly. Watching Michael interact with the Looney Tunes is something that remains memorable and this film was the one that introduced the beloved Lola Bunny for the first time. The film has all of that light-hearted, freewheeling humor that has made Looney Tunes so memorable. It has a great soundtrack with good songs and a great score by James Newton Howard. Space Jam is a memorable and unforgettable film that takes its place alongside other great films of the 90s. My final rating for this film is a 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Just flat out terrible,"I only saw the last 20 or so minutes of this travesty but just by the sequence where MJ tries to get those basketball players to touch the ball, I have no desire to see how bad the rest of it is... and no desire to comment on how bad the part I saw was. Instead, I'll echo what some other commentators have said about Bugs needing help to defeat a bunch of stupid-looking aliens. Bugs needing help? The Bugs Bunny who once single-handedly defeated the large, brutish baseball team, the Gashouse Gorillas [Baseball Bugs - 1946], needing help? The Bugs who once went psycho and sawed Florida loose from the USA, among other disasters[Rebel Rabbit - 1949]; needing help?? The Bugs who once trampled a huge, murderous black bull [Bully for Bugs - 1953] (who makes an appearance in this film in one of the film's few pleasant surprises). That Bugs? Needing help??? Uh...no, I think NOT. The ""character"" in this film bears little resemblance to the real thing. To even suggest such a possibility of Bugs enlisting aidto overcome a challenge basically destroys an essential aspect of his character. That's what this film does pretty well, after all: destroys characters.",,Anonymous,Animation

Space jam more like sell outs,"Since the late Mel Blanc's death, many of the Looney Tunes barely sound the same, even though the voice acting was excellent such as Bob Bergen as Porky Pig and Billy West as Elmer Fudd.In particular, Billy West's voice impression on BugsBunny isn't as good as Mel Blanc's or (to a lesser-known extent) Jeff Bergman or Joe Alaskey's impressions, depending on your opinion.Speaking of acting, Michael Jordan's acting is not that good (unsurprising since this was one of his first acting roles). Foreign dubs salvage his performance, though.There are way too many close-up shots.While Lola Bunny is an excellent character with formidable talents for basketball and is voiced by a great cartoon voice actress that gives her a strong personality, she doesn't have that much of a character fully built up, making her kind of stand out as just a one-dimensional love interest for Bugs Bunny. Futureprojects would try to give Lola a personality upgrade, notably The Looney Tunes Show, which portrays her as eccentric and dense, and New Looney Tunes, which portrays her as being a clever trickster yet very bubbly and spontaneous.Not to mention, she was the only character that was flanderized in Space Jam: A New Legacy.Some of the Looney Tunes character didn't get any barely screentime, especially like Speedy Gonzalez, Wile E Coyote, Road Runner, Sniffles and Barnyard Dog. Especially on the scene when most of them get hardly injured after beaten up by the Monstars, which was offscreen on some of them.Road Runner was shown injured in the scene eventhough he was among the fastest member on the team (along with Speedy) which was never explained how he got beaten up by the Monstars in the first place.The CGI, despite being well animated and mostly immersive, aged very poorly.There are a couple of plot holes.The film hasn't aged well over the years, thanks to a lot of the dialogue seeming very cheesy nowadays. Not helping that it's reputation was ruined by Space Jam: A New Legacy.There is some product placement in the movie, though it's thankfully not as bad as the product placement in Space Jam: A New Legacy.",,Anonymous,Animation
Wacky live-action perfectly blends with slapstick animation to make a great movie for young and old alike.,"`Space Jam' is an impressive and genuinely humorous movie with the Loony Toon characters and actors all on top form. The plot is an attractive one and the overall effect is a generally agreeable one. While the animated scenes are more superior to the plain live-action ones, both are equally enjoyable.But the film is best when it mixes these styles as it transports Michael Jordan into the Loony Toon world. It's real candy for the eyes and makes the movie a visual treat. This blend has proved to be hit (Song of the South, Who Framed Roger Rabbit) and miss (The Pagemaster) in the past, but `Space Jam' is one of the better ones.The main star of the film is Basketball star, Michael Jordan. He isn't a professional actor but all of his in-experience and flaws go by relatively un-noticed. But Theresa Randle, the weasly Wayne Knight and the always-reliable Bill Murray ably support him. The Loony Toon characters are all on top-form aswell. I don't think the antics of the likes of Bugs Bunny, Taz, Sylvester, Tweedy, Foghorn Leghorn, Daffy and the rest of the gang will ever get old. Newcomer, Lola Bunny is a very welcome addition to the group aswell. The enemies of the movie are all equally likeable as the basketball rivals.The only flaw the film has is the R. Kelly theme song. It seems inappropriate to say the least, even if it is memorable. The basketball game conclusion is very imaginative and there are even great puns on `Pulp Fiction' and `Ghostbusters' in it. It brings the film to satisfying and appropriate conclusion.There's witty dialogue, stunning visuals, likeable characters, a great title and plenty else to keep you entertained. `Space Jam' hits a lot more times than it misses and is the best animation/reality crossover film in a long time. I give it 7.3/10.",,Anonymous,Animation

That's More Than Enough Folks,"Michael Jordan playing baseball. That certainly belongs in the world of Looney Tunes and would be really laughable if he hadn't tried to do so in real life. As well as being rotten at baseball he makes Jackie Chan look like Anthony Hopkins on the acting front and he is playing himself. However,this movie is really enjoyable. It is a film for all the family though is really aimed at the kids. It is well-paced and there is never a dull moment as Michael and the cartoon characters take on the aliens.It would be great if cartoon characters could enter the real world.Just imagine Elmer Fudd as Secretary General of the United Nations or Daffy Duck as Mayor of New York.Still, better leave the toons to Michael.",,Anonymous,Animation

The tunes recruit MJ to help them, but can he recapture his desire to play the game? Once you get past the basic silliness it's a nifty little feature with good vocal work, those lovable characters, memorable NBA cameos, an excellent soundtrack, plus it's also able to serve as a semi-biographical account of the revered Jordan's legendary career.
