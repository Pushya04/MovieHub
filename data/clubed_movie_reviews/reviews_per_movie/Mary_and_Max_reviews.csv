Mary & Max - wonderfully unique and personal animation,"There's a constant stream of animated films these days, but mostly they're either glossy Hollywood product (Pixar/Dreamworks), or Japanese anime. For adults wanting something different we have to wait for the likes of The Nightmare Before Christmas, Waltz With Bashir, Persepolis, or Aardman's films to turn up. Mary & Max is one of these films that comes as a complete departure from all the others, both in visual and storytelling style, and sticks in the mind because of it. I won't repeat the plot here, so I'll just mention a few pros and cons. The cons are obvious. Some people will be put off by the almost constant narration (which took me a while to get used to), the rather numerous calamities (a lot more than you'd expect if you thought this was just a kids film), and the sadness within some of these people's stories. It's actually a little surprising that the film got made without the people financing it demanding a script that was more tailored to appeal to a wider audience. What we get is something that feels a whole lot more personal than the higher profile animated films. It feels personal, and therefore real, and the explanation is that it was written from life by a director who has a real feeling and sympathy for people who don't quite fit into the world, and feel alienated or are misunderstood by others. Mary was partly inspired by the director's own childhood (and there's a little bit of Toni Collette's Muriel Heslop thrown in I suspect), and Max is also based on a real person he's been pen friends with (but so far has never met in person). The way the film handles his Asperger's Syndrome just feels different to how you'd normally see such an issue handled on screen. There's a constant stream of humour (ironic, black, childish), and I really enjoyed the small perfect touches on growing up in an Australian suburb in the 70's and 80's, and the depiction of grey New York, as it appears to the easily frightened Max. The animation is constantly a joy to watch, and I highly recommend seeing it on the big screen where it can be properly appreciated in all it's hand-made glory.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Masterpiece!,"To say it short, this movie is about a friendless 8 year old girl in Australia who befriends an obese 44 year old male in New York by writing mails to each other.I'm not a big animation fan, so I wasn't looking forward to see this movie. I am currently working on the IMDb Top 250 list and Mary and Max just entered the IMDb top 250, so I took a look at it.I watched it with a small screen on my computer while chatting with someone on Facebook. But then I logged out because I got hooked by the fantastic but sad narration mixed with humor by Barry Humphries, so I watched it with a big screen. Thank God that I did that, because this is an unforgettable and heartbreaking cinematic experience! It got fantastic narration and dialogue that will make you laugh and cry!PS.There are many scenes that will choke you up, so bring some tissues.PSS.Don't watch this movie with your kids!I hope this review was useful!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Witty, well observed and wondrous","I went into this film at the Berlinale with mixed feelings. I knew that Adam Elliot's shorts were great but frankly the last few years haven't been great for Australian films and a number of short filmmakers have made disappointing first features.But right from the opening frame, this film shattered any of my doubts. It's so refreshing to see a film told with such a strong unique vision and pulled off so effortlessly. This is made even more remarkable not only as it's made using stop motion animation but also because of the characters and subject matter it tackles.Mary is an 8 year old outcast living in the suburbs of Melbourne. On a whim, she chooses a name at random in a phone book and sends off a letter asking about life on the other side of the world. The letter is received by Max, an overweight depressive in his 40's living in New York, suffering from Aspergers Syndrome. A friendship is born as the pair exchange letters over the next 20 years. offering each other support, advice and the chance to see life through another set of eyes.While the world is painted in gloomy hues of brown and grey and the characters lead bleak lives, the genius of the script is that the characters never wallow or feel sorry for themselves. The tone is kept humorous and balanced allowing us to be moved by the characters as they stumble through life but also laugh at their foibles and observations of the world they struggle to fit into. Not since Muriel's Wedding has Australia produced so fine a comedy with such rich detail and I probably got even more laughs out of this.My only criticism of the film would be some of its music particularly its use in one key scene of the Humming Chorus (already used so memorably in the finale of Heavenly Creatures). It meant that in a critical moment I was thinking of Kate Winslet up to no good instead of connecting with Mary & Max. But this is more a personal concern and if that's the weakest thing about the film, it's doing pretty well. I hope this film is seen by the wide audience it so richly deserves.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"So excellent, that I couldn't recommend it more!","It's hard to describe just how excellent this film is. The story is great, both very funny and touching. The art-design and animation are a delight, thoughtful, very rich in details, and very consistent in style. The music is great. The storyline and direction... I can't find a bad word to say, except that the story drags a little half- way through, but then picks itself up again toward the end. Truly, a must-see. If you like adult animation, this is definitely for you. I agree with those comparing it to Aardman films, Waltz with Bashir and Persepolis, but this movie's animation is so professional, that only Aardman truly compares.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
lovely oddball and admirably complex,"Coming from Australia, Mary and Max is one of these few films you'll remember all your life. This amazing claymation touches upon an unlikely friendship between two pen pals: a young girl living in Australia and an aging Jew from New York. It's unbelievable what a precisely structured narrative this is. Director-writer Adam Elliot blends odd scatological, yet clever humour with poignant dramatizations to a splendid effect creating one of the best tragicomedies of the past few years. The fact that it's in the form of claymation only helps to enhance uniqueness of the whole experience. The movie was 5 years in the making and this is visible in its every frame. Elliot masterly captures the motion in an endlessly creative manner. Most importantly though, his lovably oddball characters are well developed and admirably complex with all their awkward traits and quirks. Due to its serious themes and dark tone, Mary and Max is an adult movie aiming much higher than its big studio counterparts. It happens to be more contemplative, and intelligent mimicking the real life with all its ups and downs. Calling Elliot's movie an extraordinary piece of art is certainly not an overstatement.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Refreshing and engaging given the home-grown talent involved.,"In Australia in 1976, a young girl named Mary (voiced by Bethany Whitmore) is a lonely child looking for a friend. She lives with both her parents but her mother is a chain smoking drunk and a thief and her father, who works in a factory putting the strings on teabags, would rather spend time with his collection of dead birds. Mary remains curious about life and finds the address of an American living in New York. She writes him a letter to become his pen pal. The recipient is Max (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a severely overweight Jewish hypochondriac and full-time no-hoper. Gradually, as they send each other letters, Mary and Max's relationship develops and we begin to learn more about their past and their heartache and insecurities of being alone.Following the short animated film, Harvey Krumpet, director Adam Elliot has constructed his first full feature claymation picture, displaying as much skill as many of the major mainstream studios. The film has been immaculately designed, with many tiny details and features placed into the sets, all of which would have taken many countless hours to mould. The lighting and colour scheme too are significant to the unique look of the film, ranging from highly saturated to almost entirely black and white, to reflect the self-depreciative and sometimes gloomy tone of the narrative. It is a film made of great patience and craftsmanship.Yet the strongest asset of the film is the humour of the screenplay. Whereas many mainstream animated films such as Shrek and The Incredibles adopt a great deal of hilarity from their pop culture references, Elliot has an eye for the simpler things in life. From the way Mary and Max share their eating habits of chocolate hot dogs, to how Max describes his past jobs, including a street cleaner and a member of the Communist Party, the humour of the film remains truly original, bizarre and often very witty. Elliot excels in his ability write about the most normal things and then turn them on their heads, or degrade his miserable characters in the most hilarious way. Yet there are moments of poignancy too, such as where Mary describes her difficulty at school as she is teased for the birthmark on her forehead, that provide the film's screenplay with a subtext - no matter how simple â€“ about isolation and the need for friends.The use of Barry Humphries' voice over to convey much of the story is initially highly annoying and intrusive. In the opening scenes it feels overly used and distracting from the story and the detail of the scenes. Gradually though, as the film moves from its opening exposition, the voice over is used slightly less and its scarcity achieves the storybook quality and poetry that it deserves. Barry Humphries reads his lines beautifully. The rest of the voice actors too are splendid. Philip Seymour Hoffman is again in fine form, adding a slight accent to his voice and the decision to model his voice with a character of a similar physique fits nicely. He is quickly become one of the most diverse actors in the world. Bethany Whitmore as the young Mary is equally impressive too and her voice has a real innocence about it. Toni Collette and Eric Bana also have much smaller roles too. It is a well thought out voice cast and while some of the minor characters verge on grotesque, there is still a real sweetness about this film that carries it.Elliot has described his film as being suitable for everyone. This is rather optimistic. I don't know how particularly young children, who have been conditioned by the more mainstream animated titles, would appreciate the film. It is extremely funny for the most part, but there is also a real sense of gloom around these characters that might not be as appealing to children. And towards the end, the film, despite being well under two hours, begins to lose a bit of momentum as the characters wave in and out of their depleted lives. Perhaps the films message of learning to live with your flaws and accepting the path life has given you is something that children, even if they don't entirely understand now though, needs to be seen anyway. Regardless, it remains a mostly sharp and funny film that many will find refreshing and engaging given the home-grown talent involved.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Solitude, Isolation & Loneliness...","Masterfully directed, edited and animated to pique your interest from the off, it has you falling into the worlds of Mary and Max and sharing their challenging journeys through life, as well as their genuine, realistic and engaging correspondence and gifts to each other. Stuffed full of sad and sorrowful events, the solitude and isolation felt by both characters is palpable all the way through. Not really a film to make you smile but one that will make you think and that, after all, is what the best of storytelling is really all about.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Unforgettable and Heartbreaking Bleak Tale of Friendship and Loneliness,"In 1976, in Australia, the misfit and outcast eight-year old girl Mary Daisy Dinkle lives in Mount Waverley with her alcoholic shoplifter mother Vera Lorraine Dinkle that is addicted in Sherry and her absent father Noel Norman Dinkle that works in the Earl Grey Factory attaching strings in the teabag and spends his leisure time in his hobby - taxidermy. Mary has absolutely no friends and is teased by her schoolmate Benny Clifford. She has a complex because of her brown birthmark in the forehead and she adores her favorite cartoon The Noblets that she watches with her rooster Ethel and condensed milk. Meanwhile, in New York, the lonely forty-four year-old Max Jerry Horowitz has Asperge Syndrome and trouble to sleep and is obese since he eats chocolate hot-dogs to compensate his anxiety. He frequently goes to the Overeaters Anonymous Meeting. Max does not have any friend, only the invisible Mr. Ravioli, and also loves The Noblets. His life goals are to have a friend, Noblets and chocolate. One day, Mary picks Max address out of an American phone-book and she decides to write to him to ask from where babies come in America. Along their lives, they become pen pals and their unusual friendship oscillates due to the anxiety attacks of the unstable Max.""Mary and Max"" is an unforgettable and heartbreaking bleak tale of friendship and loneliness. The story is bittersweet and witty, with an ironic black humor and provokes the most conflictive emotions in the viewers, funny in a moment, and depressive in the other. The excellent animation follows the dark style of Tim Burton and the screenplay is a profound insight in human behavior.

"Depression, Suicide, Drugs, Sex, Death","Mary and Max is a well-crafted film for adults; it deals with depression, suicide, drugs, sex, and death. The plot is basic but the film is anything but. Mary lives in Australia and Max lives in New York. Both have lonely, depressing lives, until one day they become pen pals and their lives change for better/worse. I am excessively surprised how polished this low-budget film is. The attention to detail is unparalleled, and it might be one of the most unique animated film ever created, not based on the plot, but what occurs throughout the film and the themes you'll see. You will be wowed by their relationship and dialog and may even be able to relate to them. My only complaint is that I did not feel the emotion that many others felt. The creators did a poor job of portraying the sad occurrences in the film through screen; no need for tissues. Stop-motion movies are a rare form of cinema, and it is movies like Mary and Max that prove that stop-motion is one of the premier ways to tell a story.",,Anonymous,Animation

Awful in every aspect,"This movie was just bad to the point of being unwatchable.From the very first lines of the movie, I had a feeling that the movie would be extremely unfunny. My suspicions were confirmed. Nothing in this movie works. Not a single thing. It was as unfunny a film as I've seen, melancholy in every aspect, boring as watching paint dry, the characters were bad, and the story was just simply dumb. The only things this movie might have going for it is its musical score (which is alright), and that it is relatively short (so the torture ends quickly). However, even with its relatively short length, I was unable to watch the movie in one sitting. I have seen other reviews bring comparisons to Waltz with Bashir and Persepolis, but those movies had cool animation, political commentary, and interesting characters and story. This movie has none of that. Save yourself, don't make the mistake of watching it that I made. My hope is that writing this review will save at least 1 person from watching the movie. If it does that, then maybe watching this movie might have been worth the suffering I endured.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great Movie,"I thought this movie was very well made. I can relate to Max's character, as i work with people who have Asperges Syndrome. The creator showed the audience what it is really like, in society, to have a mental disability of this kind. The use of gray colour with a splash of red when showing the scenes with Max, was very effective, and give the audience the sense of what Max was feeling. I saw this movie with work colleagues who also work with children with this disorder, and we were all curious to see how this disorder would be shown. We were all very pleased.This movie shows the audience what people with asperges syndrome go through in day to day life, and how they don't understand things that most people would. As well as how they do/do not cope with some issues.This movie is not for children. It is quite sad, but with some really funny parts. and for those who live in Melbourne, especially, you will understand some of the references.I give this movie 10/10.After 5 years in the making it is definitely worth watching",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
It's a genuine celebration of the value of difference.,"Oscar winning (and proudly gay) animation artist Adam Elliot's acclaimed clay-mation feature film ""Mary & Max"" is astoundingly rewarding wonderful entertainment on the big screen.It's an intriguing tale, starting in the mid seventies, of the ongoing true friendship of two long distance pen-pals, younger Mary in rural Australia and older Max in the rat-race of New York City. A significant element of the story involves Max's experience of living with Asperger Syndrome, knowing painfully full well that he senses the world in a radically different way to most. I've never seen any other project deal so honestly and powerfully with that condition. It's a genuine celebration of the value of difference.There's lots to laugh and think about - and the attention to detail is staggering. Australia's living legend Barry Humphries excels as the narrator.I loved the soundtrack which strongly featured two of my favourite Penguin Cafe Orchestra compositions. I've ordered the soundtrack CD already.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"After seeing his previous films, I just had to watch this one...","Having already watched several of Adam Elliot's other films (""Harvey Krumpet"", ""Brother"", ""Cousin"" and ""Uncle""), I felt a strong compulsion to watch ""Mary and Max"". After all, these other films were wonderful and very original and you find yourself hooked when you watch them--though you probably won't know why. Now, with Elliot's latest film, I have a chance to finally watch a feature-length version of his wonderful and very strange work.The film begins in Australia and concerns a very lonely girl named Mary. Her parents are completely inept at parenting and mostly she entertains herself. One day, on a lark, she rips a name out of an American phone book and writes to a ""M. Horowitz""--telling him about herself as well as asking him where babies come from in America. As Max Horowitz is a socially inept odd-ball, his response to her strange letter is amusing to say the least. And, through their ensuing letters to each other they become friends--an 8 year-old girl and a 40+ year-old man and the film consists of showing each writing and narrating their letters.Where this bizarre business goes, you'll just need to see for yourself. However, without spoiling the film, I can safely say that I never, ever could predict where the film would go next!! Like all of Adam Elliot films, the film is just plain odd--with a delightful strangeness you can't help but like. And, even more than his shorter films, you can't believe how much time and effort he took to make this movie. It's amazing....really. And, fortunately, his work is totally unique and inventive. Aside from his previous shorts, I've never seen anything like it--and I am pretty sure you'll feel the same way if you try this delightfully strange film. Just don't try to understand or make sense of it...it might just make your brain explode. Oh, and do NOT watch it if you are feeling depressed. Although it's got lots of funny moments, the film is VERY, VERY dark--so much so that you should think twice before watching it. And, although the film looks like a kids movie, I would probably think twice before showing it to young kids.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Strangely Enjoyable,"I wasn't even sure I wanted to watch this film when it came on at 11:20 pm. I was tired and a little let down after having just finished watching Clear and Present Danger (had heard great things about it). But I decided to watch the first 5 minutes or so as the listing description claimed it to be an ""Adult Claymation"". I was intrigued as I do have quite an interest in claymation myself. The minutes rolled on by and soon half an hour had been and gone already.Within that half hour I had felt happy, sad, sympathetic, uncomfortable, frustrated, confused the list goes on. This film has a marvellous ability to switch between moods in the blink of an eye in a way that doesn't seem obnoxious or intrusive. The subject matter made me squirm a little at first, however that is quickly accounted for and you are eventually put at ease. All I can say is give this film a chance. It drags on a little in places, well, it drags on throughout the entire film really. There is no action, only one particularly intense scene I can recall and due to the story there is very little character to character to dialogue. Yet somehow it is so gloriously intriguing you can get past that.It's a bitter-sweet film that may leave some with a bit of a bad taste in their mouth having finished watching it. But to those willing to put a little effort in I can guarantee an enjoyable and incredibly deep watch.It get's a 7 from me. Whilst there were no major issues there was also nothing that really stood out about this film other than the story. Animation was somewhat lacklustre even despite the gloomy setting of the plot, acting was a little frayed round the edges at times and I did find myself rolling my eyes to a few parts that were seemingly supposed to be emotional. However, it's a good all-rounder on all fronts bar the outstanding writing. If you are going to give this a go, make sure to have some tissues handy. You have been warned",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
And you thought Dial-up was slow....,"A couple of claymation misfits who are worlds apart, form an unlikely dialog, in a pre-Internet age where it takes weeks to get a reply.There is a growing trend amongst publishers and in Hollywood, where the writer is strongly urged to rather show the story rather than tell it. This is fine for certain works, especially action films, but I personally believe that the aforementioned edict is a steaming pile of moronic dribble. People are more than intelligent enough to garner rich satisfaction from being provided a story in any form as long as the story itself holds interest. Its worked fine for all the classics in literature, most of which are still being read in droves, but many believe that audiences are stupid and need to shown everything and must capture their attention in the first five seconds. Indeed, most manuscripts are rejected based upon their first page, a ridiculous scenario.In this case, there is much in the way of telling via the voice-over of the wondrous Barry Humphries and yet the visuals provide us with an extra layer on information, working with the voice-over rather than being hindered by it. Occasionally it goes on too long, but Adam Elliot is incredibly brave in wanting to tell this story his way. Aside from stylistic similarities to his earlier shorts, he has remained true to himself. He thanks a lot of people in regards to his script; its clear he has made the effort to get it right, proving the basic notion in screen writing, is to get right on the page first folks. The script is a gem, finding the humor in a rather grim tale, without ever being patronizing to the characters or their plight. If anything, he manages to reinforce their humanity.The choice of music is ideal, setting a tone that is complimentary and yet as though these classical pieces were designed specifically for this wide, but often claustrophobic gray universe. I hope audiences embrace it on the big screen as there is glorious detail lurking in the background, providing an extra chuckle or irony for the keen eye. If there was ever a reason to leave the home theater, this is it. Mary and Max is a brilliant, entertaining work of visual art combined with depth and grace.There was a couple of moments when I raised eyebrows at certain things that didn't fit correctly for the late seventies, such as the mention of Stephen Hawking as well as cigarette patches (which debuted in the early 90's) but otherwise this laugh out loud, tear to the eye unique celluloid experience is one of the standouts of the year.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disappointing,"Mary & Max sets out to be a thought-provoking film that inspires with its originality, but it is ultimately an unsatisfying production. The opening scenes establish the film's nonlinearity and its willingness to be blunt and grim with its protagonists' struggles--once you notice these features, you grasp the film's entire hook. The movie constantly maintains this tone but never leads it to a payoff or a twist; I appreciate the filmmakers' decision to make something so unconventional, but the fact remains that these few original elements cannot support an entire 90-minute movie. The creative animation is definitely the best part.The film is in large part a dark comedy, but all the comedic elements are tepidly clever at best but never truly funny. The quirky concepts have potential, but they are intended to be funny in & of themselves, never building to any new surprising result. Max's descriptions of his jobs, for instance, aren't poignant or charming, they're just ""zany"" with some angst thrown in. The film relies obnoxiously on scatological humor--even though this is usually deadpan, the sheer number of butt jokes gets old very fast.Through the events in Mary's life, the movie sets up what could have been a moving message about accepting your own flaws, but the impact is spoiled when they hit you over the head with the message, via narration by both Damien and Max. Towards the end, Max's lengthy letter about being happy with yourself is so heavy-handed that it eliminates any possibility of thought-provoking subtlety. The very end of the film was also cheesily melodramatic and unsubtle. I didn't feel moved by the characters' suffering along the way, either, because we meet Mary as a lonely, bullied kid... and then the movie describes over and over how she's lonely & bullied, which has no impact on us because we understood that from early on. The same goes for Max being lonely and awkward.There is obviously great effort behind the animation, with impressive, detailed sets, and the art style is engaging. The ""Que Sera Sera"" sequence in which Mary reaches the depths of depression is artistic and very nicely-done, but the film's successes in terms of visual presentation do not compensate for its story or hamfisted theme, which fall flat in the end. If you just want something out of the ordinary, you can enjoy Mary & Max, but if you expect true depth (not phony depth where the filmmakers comment ""oh, loneliness sure is sad!"") or richness of writing, you will come away disappointed.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Sublime film of warmth, humour and power","In this cinematic era of computer animation, the art of claymation (for which hand-moulded figurines are painstakingly photographed one frame at a time) is slowly dissolving. Aardman Studios (the guys behind Wallace and Gromit) seem to be the only ones who still possess the patience required to continue the practise into the 21st Century. It's therefore refreshing to witness the Australian film Mary and Max (the feature film debut of Adam Elliot, who won an Oscar for his short film Harvie Krumpet), which was created using this claymation method to tell a bizarre, sweet and mature story. Tremendously inventive, clever, hilarious and wise, Mary and Max is a sublime movie of warmth and compassion about life's dissonances. The animation is superb, the characters are endearing, the humour is abundant, and it honestly and thoroughly explores several topical themes. If American Beauty director Sam Mendes collaborated with Aardman Animations, the product would be something like Mary and Max.Based partly on Elliot's own life experiences, Mary and Max is a feature about two people leading a mundane existence on the fringe of society; finding solace only in their heartfelt pen-pal letters to each other. Mary Daisy Dinkle (voiced by Bethany Whitmore and Toni Collette) is a chubby, friendless 8-year-old living in the suburbs of Melbourne with her neglectful parents. One day, Mary randomly selects a name from the Manhattan phone book and writes a letter to him. She chooses Max Horovitz (Hoffman); a severely obese 44-year-old Jewish man with Asperger's Syndrome living in the chaos of New York City. It turns out they have a lot in common - beyond loneliness and a complete lack of friends, they share a love of chocolate and a TV show called The Noblets. Thus begins a 20-year correspondence, with their friendship surviving more than the average diet of life's ups and downs.There's plenty of playful narration (almost constant) courtesy of Aussie legend Barry Humphries which gives the film the feel of a children's tale, but Mary and Max is not for kids. The movie doesn't shy away from covering an array of mature, confronting issues, such as depression, sexuality, suicide, obesity and mental illness. Unlike most mainstream movies in which friendship saves the day and everybody is happy, Mary and Max is unmistakably dark - both physically dark, and dark in its depiction of reality. Max is never able to lose weight, and Mary can never escape the shadow of her parents. Mary eternally resides in her brown-tinged Melbourne suburb, while Max's New York City is depicted as a grey metropolis whose only bright colours are those that come from Mary (a red pompom, for instance). The predominantly colourless and ominous cityscape of NYC is clearly symbolic of Max's melancholy, mental distress and isolation. The ending in particular underlines the film's dark disposition; showing that in real life there may be happy middles, but happy endings are almost non-existent. But despite this, Mary and Max is by no means a highly depressing venture; it's a cinematic delight, with its downbeat content matched by constant laughs, a super- abundance of heart, and several deeply moving moments. Somehow, all of this is squeezed into an 85-minute timeframe, which at times feels longer due narrative simplicity and the occasional pacing issues. This is probably to be expected, however, as Elliot has only previously worked on shorts.Even though a mere claymation short could take up to a year to create, old-school animators such as Adam Elliot and his team display a palpable affection for this approach. Mary and Max spent a total of five years in the making, with six dedicated animation teams working under Elliot's direction in a converted factory in Melbourne, and each team creating an average of 4 seconds of footage per day. A huge kudos to Adam Elliot and his claymation team for creating such a vivid, picturesque world here, with the grim landscape evoking a film-noir feel. Every one of the characters, created from plasticine, is intricately and lovingly detailed. The detail does generate the illusion that we're watching a computer-animated movie, yet the painstaking claymation process affords a look, feel and soul that has yet to be replicated through computers. One must have patience and passion to undertake a stop-motion feature of such scale, and these are two qualities Adam Elliot infinitely exerts.Another tremendous pleasure of Mary and Max is the voice cast; a cornucopia of vocal talent from across the globe. Without a doubt, Philip Seymour Hoffman has proved one of the most versatile actors of recent years with his exceptional vocal work (Capote, anyone?), and he's virtually unrecognisable here. This is, of course, the true essence of voice acting - a viewer should not be given the chance to focus on the actor providing the voice, but instead the character they are voicing. Meanwhile Bethany Whitmore is effortlessly endearing as the young Mary, and Toni Collette is pitch-perfect as Mary in her later years.Through an immense artistry as well as an evident maturity emanated by the makers, Mary and Max affirmatively and genuinely answers a potent question: is there someone for everyone? In adulthood, we understand that we're born into our families but choose our friends, and the 20- year friendship between these two vastly different yet curiously similar individuals proves the theory. Adam Elliot's ambitious first feature- length claymation movie is an absolute delight, merging witty laughs with heartfelt emotion to generate this genuinely moving slice of animation. Mary and Max is, at least for this reviewer's money, the best animated motion picture of 2009 (yes, better than Up). After the terrific Harvie Krumpet and now this, it's clear Elliot is a highly talented filmmaker one should keep an eye on in future years.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Unforgettable,"One of my favourites of 2009, Mary and Max is a truly unforgettable film in all respects. The clay animation is just gorgeous with all the characters well modelled and the colours done in atmospheric shades, and gives a nostalgic and unique feel to it, and the music is beautiful and heart-breaking. The characters add a lot to the film as well, the title characters are sweet, emphatic and engaging, with Mary very cute and Max endearing in his own way, and the audience sympathises with them and their predicaments, while the writing is both funny and poignant and the haunting, affecting and personal story packs a real emotional punch on its own and is thematically quite deep. The voice work is top notch, Barry Humphries provides a both amusing and gentle narrative and Toni Collette(Bethany Whitmore as the younger Mary) and Phillip Seymour Hoffmann are brilliant as Mary and Max. What made Mary and Max other than the superb direction and gentle pacing was the adept mix of hilarious humour and poignant drama, there is evidence of both and both are done wonderfully. Overall, a beautiful, unforgettable film with a 10/10. Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Watching that movie felt like discovering a jewel ! I LOVED IT !,"The movie was about mental illness ( Asperger syndrome, addiction and depression), loneliness follows and imprison people whom have been flagellated with despise, neglect, bullying, till they are incapable to communicate with the world nor with themselves .. their world is nothing but a boring repetitive aimless cycle of inhale and exhale, till the moment they stand and make a choice, a choice that will free them from the prison of illusion, and proceed with the in the road of life even if it was not well paved.
.
But what bring that moment?
For max's case the answer is: A true friend who will be the wind that moves the clouds in our gloomy days, so that the sun will rise again in our sky.
.
I find it absolutely brilliant to present a heavy dark material through stop-motion animation, this reduced the darkness of the topic. Other factors that worked in compatibility with the animation was the simple funny scenario the comedy that added a fluffy touch to the darkness along with the deep philosophical dimensions in the dialogue, not to mention the music that lightened the whole movie. ðŸ˜„",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Angry, Dense, Unforgettable","""Mary and Max"" is a difficult movie to review.A good place to begin is by pointing out that Adam Elliot painstakingly created a broken world here. The inhabitants of this world are, with few exceptions, wounded or maimed. It is a world not governed by a loving God, but by chance.By chance, Max Jerry Horovitz has asperger's syndrome.By chance, Mary Daisy Dinkle was born with a birth mark that looks like a poo stain, has an alcoholic mother, and stumbles upon a stray rooster.By chance, the two become pen pals.Mary and Max's lives and relationship with one another are at the heart of movie. Both have miserable/nonexistent family structures. Both are so alienated from society that two of their main sources of pleasure come from eating and watching a television show called ""The Noblets."" About halfway through the movie, I came to the realization that ""Mary and Max"" is really a portrait of contemporary, industrialized societies. War, poverty, alcoholism, bullying, obesity, mind-numbing careers, distrust, distorted body images, suicide, mental illness, loneliness, half-hearted self-help books - heck, even siphoning off charitable donations is covered in a quick 80 minutes.One of Elliot's most impressive accomplishments in the movie is the pace: we feel the sluggishness and lethargy of the two main characters.Yet, Elliot also treats us to many disarmingly hilarious scenes. One minute you'll be cringing, the next you'll be genuinely moved, and in a blink, you'll be grinning ear to ear. Sounds like a microcosm of life itself.The quotation that closes ""Mary and Max"" invokes God in a surprising way. I honestly don't know what to make of it.In my opinion, ""Mary and Max"" is a work of high art and one of the finest movies I have seen in a long time. It will stay with you. A must see.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Sloppy clash of moods, but it's genuinely touching at times and certainly worth a watch","An Australian stop-motion animated film about a dumpy little girl (voiced by Toni Collette) who randomly chooses a name in a New York phone book and writes him a letter. The man on the other side (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is an obese, middle-aged Jew with Asperger's Syndrome. Neither of these people have friends in real life, and they soon become each other's only friends. This is a rather sad story, filmed in a very muted color scheme. The New York sequences, in particular, are almost black and white. The Australian sequences have a lot of brown in them. Writer/director Elliot (claiming he based it on a true story) injects a lot of quirky humor into the picture, almost making it seem like an Aardman product at times. The big difference between this and Aardman: the animators of Mary & Max go out of their way to make everything hideously ugly. There's a big mental disconnect between all of these elements. It wants to be depressing, it wants to be charming, it wants to be hilarious, it wants to be freakish. Fortunately, it does succeed enough of the time where it's well worth watching. At its heart, there's a very touching story. I do not think this deserves to be mentioned alongside the slew of wonderful animated films of the year, except maybe for a footnote.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
When i sobbed like a baby,"I just entered my room and switched on the TV without even changing, and there it was on a movie channel. For the next approx 90 minutes i was sitting on the corner of my bed sobbing like a little boy denied of his rightful chocolate. A beautiful script with some amazing characters, depicting the most expressive situations with ease and sometimes triumphing over the real human emotions as well.i never thought an animation( clay model) movie can create so much of an impact as far as depicting emotions, but now i would rate it as the best i have ever seen.i have known characters like Mary , and tears roll down the eyes remembering them.A Blizzard wrapped in sunshine is what you can expect.

"Unique,sad and at times weird","Mary and Max is a story of two lonely people residing miles away from each other and become unlikely friends through constant letter writing. The kids may not find this animated movie nice as there are dark and realistic portrayals of what we encounter in our lives. The movie is mostly black and white clay animation with slight shades of red. I haven't seen many stop-motion animated movies but the best I recall was 'Coraline' also released in 2009. Well as much as Coraline was filled with fantasy this one far realistic.The script is very good, giving us lessons we need to learn in life like moving on no matter what happens. The voice-actors also did fine job especially Philip Hoffman as Max. I liked the movie but it felt kind of repetitive after 1-2 conversations though the letters between Mary and Max. Also it tries to pity its characters a bit too much. What I did like is there were humorous moments popping up here and there despite the theme of the whole film being sad. If you don't like stop-motion animation or realistic films with not much excitement unlike what you see in your day to day animation films I suggest you keep away from this one.RATING: [3.5/5]",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
You got to love Mary And Max,"Mary and Max are two individuals which are poles apart from each other, live in separate continents and have an age difference of more than 30. But there is something which makes them care about and think about each other. It is the great relation of friendship. We hear that our best friends are those who accept us along with our faults and shortcomings. Mary and Max are the best examples of that. Mary is a 8 year old girl from Australia and Max is a 40 somewhat obese guy from New York. Both have some things common such as they have no friends, love a particular Cartoon and have the fetish for Chocolate. They interact with each other through letters which reveals to the viewer their life story .Sorry, if I missed to mention that this is an animated movie - Not ordinary but clay animation. It is somewhat difficult to emote through clay animation but this movie does not suffer from that. The movie is filled with dark, satirical humor but you never feel offended by it. Along with it, it has it's 'cry buckets' moments which really move you. I will certainly call it a very matured animation movie by a newbie director. It is right up there in my list of favorite animations.Rating : 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Touching,"Because of some of the crass bits early on, I was a little worried that this was going to be a little too dark for my taste, but it turned out to be quite a touching portrait of loneliness and those with Asperger's. To feel isolated in the world, and yet to have an improbable friend in a pen-pal you've never met - just to know they're out there and to hear from them as you trundle through life - the connection is meaningful and beautiful. The film is also visually striking, and I loved the voices from Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Toni Colette.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Cute, fun and heartbreaking","A lovely example of how the childish look of claymation can lighten a very grim story. If this film was made as live action, many would likely find it way too depressing - after all, the story mostly consist of bad things happening. Similarly, the comedic angle that the whole film is seen through only works as well as it does because of the claymation. Most of the jokes, if made to look like real life, would feel too cruel.Even if the story works so well because we feel like we're not really watching real people, the empathy we get to feel for the characters is absolutely genuine. Since mostly everything that happens in this film is over the top, the few moments that feel real hit like a hammer. If I had been asked halfway through, ""think you're going to cry by the end?"" I would've scoffed dismissingly. Yet here we are - the ending of Mary and Max is one of the best endings ever.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A wonderful heartwarming Film,"I just watched this film for the first time. I knew what the basic story was, but I had no idea how good it would be. It started off like a normal kid friendly stop motion animated movie. It ended up being much, much more. It deals with themes of mental illness, drugs addiction, death, depression and suicide. The movie greatly moved me and by the end I almost cried and not many movies invoke that sort of emotion from me. It isn't perfect by any means, but it is a great film none the less and I recommend you watch it.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Honest and True,"Mary and Max is one of the darkest animated films I have ever seen. It deals with certain issues that are rarely dealt with in films, let alone animated ones. This is certainly not a kid's film, but it is a learning film. It tells the story of a lonely girl named Mary who lives with her problematic parents and who creates a friendship with a man named Max who lives across the world from her. The writing is incredible and it gives us so much insight into each of these characters' worlds. Thanks to the narration and the visually-amazing stop-motion animation, we are able to care deeply for these characters. By the time the final 30 minutes roll around, it begins to get darker and more sinister, simply because it shows us that it is the way the world gets as you grow up. The ending is very, very sad, but it rings a chord in every viewers' hearts I am sure.All in all, this is an honest and very true animated film about the life of two uncertain people. It is better than most animated films hope to be, and it is better than Pixar's Up. See this film, but not simply for entertainment or humor because you will get more than what you bargained for.",,Anonymous,Animation
A complicated tale meant for adults,"Mary and Max is a multi-award winning animation that chronicles the relationship between Mary Daisy Dinkle (Toni Collette), a young, insecure girl in Australia who is the only daughter of an alcoholic mother and a neglectful father, and Max Jerry Horowitz (Philip Seymour Hoffman), an overweight, panic-ridden man in New York. One day, Mary picks the first name she finds in a phone book and sends a letter, along with a chocolate bar, prompting a decades long correspondence of letters and chocolate treats. Although Max has longed for a real friend (his imaginary friend sits on a stool reading all day), Mary's sensitive questions propel him into anxiety attacks, one so severe he ends up in a mental institution.Many years pass with no mail from Max. In between waiting for word from him, Mary becomes smitten with the next door neighbor boy, Damien (Eric Bana), and continues helping her agoraphobic neighbor, Len. Considering advice from his therapist, he finally writes to Mary and confides in her that he has Asperger's Syndrome which affects his social interaction. She decides to enter into university to study mental disorders and ends up penning a highly acclaimed book with Max as her case study. The news is not well-received by Max and he cuts off communication with her, which sends Mary into a drug-induced, drunken stupor (after shredding her hard work to pieces and damning her career). On the verge of suicide, she wonders if Max will ever forgive her.Let me immediately point out that this is not for young children or tweens. Don't be wooed by the cartoon cover art or pictures of adorable Mary Daisy Dinkle with her clunky glasses and red barrette. It's a complicated tale meant for adults. If you are unable to process rather gloomy, disheartening material without being able to bounce back emotionally, avoid this movie. Aside from the celebration of enduring friendship, there isn't much to smile about. Alcoholism, mental illness, loneliness, pill popping, heartbreak, four deaths, overeating, involuntary manslaughter, schoolyard bullying... a small list of the obstacles the characters struggle to overcome.The animation is beautifully done and the characters are a peculiar, quirky bunch with a myriad of flaws but endearing in their own ways. The stop-motion figures on the screen breathe life, full of raw, human emotion in such a profound manner, it can be a distressing, suffocating experience. That's balanced with some incredibly kooky humor. The storyline flows effortlessly but, ultimately, it won't appeal to a wider audience. High praise for writer and director, Adam Elliot, for having a unique vision and sticking to his guns. There has been mixed reviews on Barry Humphries' narration. Personally, I found his voice very soothing.This film appeases two long-time love affairs, claymation and stop- motion. It tickled my funny bone at the right moments but it was too melancholy, even for me.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

One is upset over the age difference, several are mad that the two don't overcome their positions in life, and most of them are tossing around pejoratives like ""losers"". Seriously?? She's a socially awkward 9 year old Australian being raised by an alcoholic mother who shoplifts, the other is a 60 year old man with debilitating Asperger's who sells pencil's from a cardboard box in NY.

Beautiful but bleak,"Touching, original, funny and full of surprises - highly recommended, not only for claymation fans like me. The visual gags are good and often surprising, and the story enters areas usually left untrodden by animation.The technical aspects themselves are below Aardman or Laika standard, but efficient; what keeps this film from getting a better grade from me is the drab colour palette and overall depressing tone - don't get me wrong, those are parts of life, too - but you can overdo everything and nearly 90 minutes are a bit much for my taste. So the re-watch value is not that high, for me at least.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Once in a while a movie just stays with you.,"Some movies are just special and a want to think carefully before I review them. I've known of this movie for ages without knowing any details. I'm always fascinated by animation that is neither the family movie idiom or its polar opposite (Like, you know, Family Guy of which I am actually a big fan).Describing this movie is hard, but that's partly because it's intelligence lies in the simplicity its idea, though this is not really a simple movie.It's tempting to say that it didn't need to be animated but a movie more than the logistics of its plot, this movie has a style and tonality all of its own which more than justifies the work needed to stop motion animate it like a vintage kids show as this movie embodies that part of all of us that still feels like a small child trying to understand a challenging world.Always visually compelling, the narrator is agreeable enough but I can't help but feel that they over use him; several times in the story we can see quite clearly how capable the movie is of conveying the narrative visually but the overall picture feels simply like an audiobook that happens to be elaborately illustrated as we see the hypotheticals, fantasies and fears of the characters as they describe them to each other. But since the narrative is all about a penpal correspondence and thus very internal, they can sort of get away with this more than the average movie could and very little of it is objectionable anyway.A grotesquely but still beautifully painted in muted colors and grotesquely charming (but usually just grotesque) visions of the human form that made me feel like I was witnessing the human race like an alien would; unbiased by any local standard of beauty. Mary's waddling walk and the cartoonish proportions of the characters combined with the stylized vision of the foreboding inner city and the stark antipodean suburbs give an effect that is at once naive and sophisticated somehow.It's a dark vision of a seemingly hopeless world. Everyone is ugly and destruction is everywhere, especially of the self. It gets so relentlessly unfortunate that it becomes comical and then bursts out the other side and becomes just dark again.I never knew what this movie would throw at me and I was figuratively brought to the edge of my seat at least once. The shameless use of scatological detail and crass jokes make this a movie that is not aspiring to any particular standard of beauty and the small lifeline at the centre of the picture of two individuals who despite everything found each is like nothing I've seen before in any artistic medium. It makes you feel like laughing, crying and low key recoiling and each turn leads seamlessly to the others.It's abuse of the Penguin Cafe Orchestra notwithstanding, this movie had me in tears and punches home with a remarkable honesty and humility that people are all basically broken and although I have a couple of objection to where ended up considering what this movie puts you though, I walked away from this with a greater capacity for empathy than when I begun it.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

A poignant treatise on friendship and loneliness that is rich with dark and subtle humor,"Mary Daisy Dinkle (Bethany Whitmore/ Toni Collette) is an unfortunate 8-year old living in Mount Waverly Australia in 1976. Her mother is an alcoholic, chain-smoking kleptomaniac and her father is a reclusive blue collar worker who attaches the strings to tea packets. Mary has no friends. Despite having an unfortunate birthmark on her forehead and generally being teased and bullied by the other children at school, Mary is an incredibly curious child that is keen on learning everything she can about the world.One day while her mother is out 'borrowing' supplies from the local post-office, Mary hits upon the idea of writing someone on the other side of the world to ask whether or not babies come from the same place as they do in Australia. According to her grandfather, who has recently passed away at the start of the film, babies come from the bottom of beer glasses, a fact that Mary is utterly intrigued by and one she is compelled to explore further.After randomly selecting a prospective pen-pal in New York City, she sends her crudely scribbled inquiries to a Mr. Max Jerry Horowitz (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), as well as a bar of chocolate. Max is a morbidly obese, middle-aged Jew-turned-Athiest that lives alone at the top of a decaying domicile. He attends Overeaters Anonymous meetings and is prone to severe anxiety attacks. Plagued by his eccentricities and his inability to form meaningful relationships with anyone, Max is gripped by a sudden uncontrollable panic attack after reading Mary's letter. Eventually he responds to his new pen-pal and the two begin a correspondent friendship that last several decades.I believe Mary and Max to be one of those rare treasures you stumble upon accidentally and never quite forget. Its an absolutely beautiful story rich in both the mastery and detail of the animation and also memorable character development. Elliot does a superb job of crafting characters that are ultimately shaped by their idiosyncrasies. Also the atmospheres he create for both Mary and Max make you fully appreciate the respective isolation felt by each title character. In one realm you have Max's noirish New York that represents his inherent pessimism and distrust. With Mary you have a muted Sepia feeling that represents parental neglect and abandonment.It's a clever black comedy that left me incredibly refreshed and pleased with my Saturday Night.Read this and other reviews on the DriveInZeppelin website",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
An animated life,"In 2004, Adam Elliot took home Oscar gold with his animated short film Harvie Krumpet, a film about the life of a simple man named Harvie Krumpet who tries to learn as much as he can about life. He used stop motion animation, a form of animation that is most commonly linked with TV Christmas specials like Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. The film is somewhat grim, funny, and heartfelt, something that this type of animation is rarely scene with.Five years later, Elliot comes back with his first feature film Mary and Max. As impressed as I was with Harvie Krumpet I was doubly impressed with this one. He uses the same style of animation only this time his skills are much more precise, detailed, and effective. He tells the story of Mary Daisy Dinkle, a young girl living in 1970s Australia who has no friends except for her pet rooster and favorite television show. One day she decides to reach out across the world to someone who might be her friend. She finds a New York City phone book picks out a random name: Max Jerry Horovitz.Max lives alone in his apartment with his one eyed cat and pet fish (who he needs to constantly replace). He is an overweight, middle aged man with Asperger syndrome, a form of autism. He too has no friends and is in need of some companionship, although he is somewhat afraid of the outside world and strangers. He finally decides to write her back, and the two begin their friendship across the sea.The film is comprised of narration, by Barry Humphries, and voice over from Mary and Max reading their letters, voiced by Bethany Whitmore as younger Mary, Toni Collette as older Mary, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman as Max. Their letters and the in between narration is hysterical and incredibly clever. I like the little tidbits we are given like the way Mary's mother drinks her sherry and how Max eats chocolate hot dogs, his own recipe. They make the characters more interesting.Elliot creates a vivid world filled with right and wrong. He uses colors to define the two different continents, giving Australia brown and earthy tones while New York is black, white, and everything in between, with the exception of a red pompom that Mary sends Max. Much like their separate worlds, they both blend in as if no one else would notice them. These characters are simple, average people who go the distance to make their lives a little more comfortable. It's sublime to see these characters grow up through the years and age and learn. We become so attached.There is so much to love about this movie. The quirky little one liners to the incredibly detailed and well done stop motion animation. Each character has clearly defined features, unique movement, and like so many stop motion pieces, there is nothing jumpy or out of place about the animation. It is smooth, coherent, and compelling to watch. As impressive as it is the writing is just as good. You really get a feeling for these characters through the narration and their writing. If there was some way you could help them out you would. They are just so lovable.This is one of the best films I have seen this year. It's a wonderful film aimed at a more mature audience. I don't know if it can compete with Disney and Pixar's Up, but I wouldn't be surprised to see this at least get a nomination from the Academy, as it has already been honored at this year's Berlin International Film Festival. It's a great achievement when a film can make you feel so happy the entire way through.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not Your Typical Animation,"A tale of friendship between two unlikely pen pals: Mary, a lonely, eight-year-old girl living in the suburbs of Melbourne, and Max, a forty-four-year old, severely obese man living in New York.At the outset, I was a bit skeptical of the high praise this film has received and how it continues (in 2015) to stay on the IMDb Top 250, despite competing with so many classics and the disproportionately-rated superhero movies. Was this a fluke or some hidden gem that has not received enough attention?Indeed, it turns out to be the latter. Although not a children's film like it first appears, that makes it all the better. Jokes about prostitutes, condoms, homophobia, atheism... never in an offensive way, but still subject matter that will never be rated G.

Mary and Max - A tale of friendship,"""The reason I forgive you is because you are not perfect. You are imperfect. And so am I. All humans are imperfect."" It is pretty rare to connect so deeply with an animated film. The animated aspect can often serve as a barrier that prevents people from deeply identifying with the characters they are witnessing on screen and therefore prevents them from deeply caring for them. With Mary and Max, this couldn't be farther from the truth. This is a film that I think I, and many others, will remember for a long time.This film is a poignant clay-animation film that records the 20 year relationship between two social eccentrics. Mary Daisy Dinkle (voiced by Bethany Whitmore as a child and Toni Colette as an adult), is a lonely 8 year old who lives in Austrailia who loves condensed milk, her pet rooster and a smurfs-like show called The Noblets. At school, she is teased because of having an unlucky birthmark on her forehead. Max Jerry Horowitz (voiced by Philip Seymour Hoffman) is a morbidly obese, 44 year old formerly Jewish atheist who, due to mental and social problems, has trouble forming close bonds with people. Their lives both change when Mary fortuitously choose a fellow lonely soul to write to. The quirkiness that separated them in society ultimately links these two pen pals together.The creative idea to use Claymation helps the audience in seeing the films protagonists not merely as characters but as fellow human beings. This is further established by the strong, and true to life, humanization this film creates of its characters. Upon viewing, it is clear that director Adam Elliot's masterful creation was a painstaking process, further solidified when the viewer take one look at the beautiful landscape showcased in each frame of this film. Every detail is manually drawn up with considerable care and beauty (according to Elliot, every detail!). Elliot calls his films Clayography, a portmanteau for 'clay animated biography', each taking 5 years to materialize.In short, the story is a bittersweet tale of friendship that will have you in a mix of emotions come the movie's end. My simply writing about the enthralling animation and creative brilliance would not do this wonderful film justice; it is simply, to recite a common clichÃ©, a matter of experiencing it yourself to fully appreciate it. A film that can so deftly juxtapose its humorous and heartbreaking moments are so rare and Mary and Max seems to be able to pull this off so effortlessly. The witty dialogue, the majestic narration of Barry Humphries, the transient theme music - that almost reminds me of the Friday Night Lights intro song, in the sense that it takes you on a roller coaster of emotions that includes happiness, sadness, hope, regret in its short duration.Philip Seymour Hoffman deserves a lot of praise for how he approached Max's character. His voice was tailored perfectly to that of Max's appearance, from the accent to the tone in which he spoke. He brought a certain poignancy and virtue to the character, giving life to one of the most memorable characters I can remember in recent animation. Even knowing it was him behind the character of Max, I couldn't wrap my head around it. He was truly one of the most diverse actors of our generation and he will forever be missed by many, whether it being his presence on the big screen or merely his voice.It is a shame that the idea of animation movies might dissuade many people from experiencing this movie. At its core, this film is beautiful in all of its forms â€“ direction, narration, acting and, of course, animation. It manages to be humorous, melancholy, hopeful and a million other things all in one. It excels in staying true to the human condition and does not in any way try to patronize the characters or idealize their situations; it is, in simplest terms, real. My words cannot do this film justice; it was and will continue to serve as one of the finest animations brought to life. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A different animation...,"""Mary and Max"" is an animation movie in we watch two pen friends Mary who is a lonely girl living in the suburbs of Melbourne and Max who is an obese man living in New York. We watch how they are creating their relationship and also how this relationship affect their lives.I liked this movie very much because it was not a simple animation movie, it gives people many things to think of and raise many issues that we have nowadays. One more thing that I liked in this movie was the beautiful voice of Philip Seymour Hoffman as Max Jerry Horovitz who I believe that his voice fit so well in this character. One more thing that it had to being mentioned is about the direction made by Adam Elliot and it was really good.Finally I have to say that ""Mary and Max"" is a must see animation movie from which I believe everyone can gain something because after watching this movie you reconsider many things about life in general and not only.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

It's still one of those movies that's not going to be for everyone though, especially since it seems like Adam Elliot is trying to come up with the worst possible things to happen to these characters. And I find some of the humor a little too reliant on simply being odd. But hey, I still enjoyed my time with this film and the stop motion was so buttery smooth it looked fake at times.

A Tale of an Unlikely Friendship,"In 2009, an independent stop-motion film came all the way from Australia known as Mary and Max, the feature-length debut of stop-motion filmmaker Adam Elliot. Although the film garnered critical acclaim and rave attention at Sundance, it has remained somewhat obscure outside of the film & animation world, possibly due to its heavily mature themes not often touched upon in the mainstream. That being said, this film can best be described as a darkly enticing tale of an unlikely friendship, and one that has rarely been crafted with such earnest sincerity and enlightenment in most other artforms.The film tells the story of two pen-pals writing to each other for over 20 years about their strange and dark lives; Mary Daisy Dinkle, a lonely Australian girl, and Max Jerry Horowitz, an overweight Jewish American man with Asperger's syndrome. As this film was inspired by Elliot's own pen-pal relationship, Mary & Max is as heartwarmingly charming as it is heartbreaking as a whole, since the film captures both of our lead's individual lives in raw detail and shocking misery. Mary has to deal with neglectful parents and being an unpopular outcast, whereas Max suffers from severe obesity and mental issues relating to Aspergers. While the film covers numerous themes such as loneliness, anxiety, bullying, addiction, isolation and international friendships, it does so in a way where we can sympathize with our leads and also relate to them, since Max's hysterical quirks and Mary's childlike curiosity are what make them perfectly imperfect in a world that doesn't understand them. Sprinkled throughout are layers of black comedy and surreal imagery to lighten the mood from being too dour altogether.As the film chronicles Mary and Max's friendships in severe road bumps from perplexing insecurities and misunderstandings, it also comes with the many characters they know along the way. On top of Mary's depressingly absent parents, there are those she finds interesting from a personality standpoint like her agoraphobic neighbor Len Hislop and those she grows an obvious attraction to like her stuttering neighbor Damien Popodopoulos. Max on the other hand hardly seeks much companionship beyond the advice of his rabbi therapist and the small acts of kindness from his legally blind apartment neighbor Ivy. Since this film is carried through elaborate narration, both from narrator Barry Humphries and the letters our leads exchange to one another, we get to understand how content Max is as an autistic man and how Mary is still learning about the world beyond her dismal upbringing. Add on to that strong performances from Toni Collette and Phillip Seymour Hoffman and you have an unorthodox friendship that is more earnest than society would think otherwise.In presenting the film through intricately crafted sets and overly cartoony character designs, Elliot and his team managed to put in so much personality and humbleness into every single frame. The brownish hues of Mary's dreary suburban home compliment her point of view as not having much sunshine for a kid, whereas the bleak monochrome look of New York authentically portrays the gloomy life Max seems content with. Since the film depicts each of our lead's lives without making one seem better than the other, it captures that through charming visual gags, highly expressive acting and exaggerated wordplay. The cinematography compliments this with appropriate lighting, on top of so many shots and cuts that show off so many sets and characters only used for one or two takes, and an upbeat music score courtesy of Dale Cornelius. The pacing of each shot flows so naturally that you forget you're watching claymation puppets and instead feel transported into a genuine reflection of harsh thematic elements mixed with characters you can't help but adore.As emotionally resonating as it is inventively crafted, Mary and Max is a phenomenal tale of friendship forming in the most unlikely of places. Whether you're familiar with the works of Adam Elliot or not, this film is a must watch for anyone interested in genuine topics of mental health, depression, and unlikely formed friendships. Now that Adam Elliot is currently making another feature-length project, it's only a matter of time until we get to see more fascinating ideas come up from his creative independent process. It's works like these that make unique topics worth dissecting through the art of filmmaking.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Beautiful and Poignant,"So much emotion and empathy, truly a first class effort. I was 3/4 of the way through before I really realized what I was being taught a life lesson. This definitely isn't for everyone, but I can assure it is clever, well crafted and heart rendering. It pulled a lot of emotion from me and I was a little misty at the end.

Fantastic,"""Mary and Max"" is a 2009 Australian stop-motion animated film directed by Adam Elliot. The film is a poignant and darkly comedic tale about an unlikely friendship between two people: Mary, a lonely young girl from Melbourne, and Max, an older, obese man with Asperger's Syndrome from New York.The film is notable for its unique visual style, characterized by its clay animation and a muted color palette, which complements the film's emotional depth and quirky humor. The narrative explores themes of loneliness, mental illness, and the search for connection, all while maintaining a touching and often humorous tone.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Achingly sweet and touching!,"Amazingly, the film opens on a Saturday afternoon. And here I am watching on a Saturday afternoon! A great sign that this movie's meant for me. Only 37 minutes into it so far, and already, I think this is one of the best films I've ever seen!! In-love!!UPDATE: Would rate it higher, but it ended up having too much sadness for my liking. However, the sweetness (almost achingly sweet) makes up for it. So, I still really like the movie overall. A word of advice for anyone thinking of watching it though: be ready to let the tears flow!Sadness aside, one of my favorite things about this film is how it shows that even the people who have the seemingly most simple, uneventful or dull lives can actually have a very rich, complex inner world, and how profound that inner world actually is.I also love how this is a movie that shows people who gain joy from the simple things- like the sound of rain, chocolate, and their favorite TV show. In this way, they are like my twins- as they are also twins to each-other on some level. So, yes, I would classify this as a twin flame movie. A very unique, and special relationship.

deeply    touching,"its basic virtue is the art to be out of rules. or expectations. to be a touching story not exactly about two people, not only adaptation of a real case but a form of eulogy of insignificant details/existences of many of us. more important - the message has same importance than the technique conception. it is a form of masterpiece for the care to each detail, for the use of dark nuances and for precision to transform animation in slice of viewer existence. a common situation who becomes special. a strange correspondence who becomes reflection of society. it is not an ordinary movie. maybe because you can become one of characters. or for the delicate science to present yours secrets. a film about two people from different countries. and a deeply touching adventure.",,Anonymous,Animation

A Heartwarming Gem You Can't Miss!,"Mary and Max (2009) is hands down one of the most touching, quirky, and beautifully crafted films I've ever seen. It's the kind of movie that makes you laugh, cry, and reflect on life all at once. The claymation style adds so much charm, but it's the story of the unlikely pen-pal friendship between a lonely little girl, Mary, and Max, an older man with Asperger's, that really tugs at your heartstrings.What I love most is how it balances heavy themes like mental health, loneliness, and connection with humor and heart. The writing is clever, the voice acting (Toni Collette and Philip Seymour Hoffman!) is stellar, and the soundtrack hits all the right notes.It's not your typical animated film-it's raw, real, and at times bittersweet. But that's what makes it so unforgettable. If you haven't seen ""Mary and Max,"" do yourself a favor and watch it. 10/10, an absolute masterpiece!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great movie!,"Mary and Max is a profoundly moving and beautifully crafted film that delves into the unlikely friendship between two outcasts: a young girl in Australia and a middle-aged man with Asperger's in New York. The film's unique stop-motion animation style enhances its emotional depth, and its poignant storytelling addresses themes of loneliness, mental health, and the power of human connection. The heartfelt performances and dark humor balance the narrative, making it both thought-provoking and comforting. Mary and Max is a must-watch for anyone who appreciates deeply human stories told with creativity and sensitivity.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Adult theme but still enjoyable by youngsters,"I do love an adult oriented animation, but I do normally want them to be accessible to children as well so it can be viewed and appreciated by more people. This movie has the funny bits that children and enjoy but adult would pick up the dark themes and message.The animation is superb, the colours are so relevant to the vibes of the film. You can tell how much work is done for the animation, l'm overwhelmed. The characters are complex and very interesting, you would want to root for them at the same time ask questions why. The voices in the movie are top A Australian actors and I wouldn't recognize their voices I just know they are perfect!The movie is very very moving and not just on the end but all across the film.I totally recommend this movie to everyone who want to see heartwarming story and in incredible execution.Warning to parents though that are seeing this with their children, they may ask a lot of questions, be prepared.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Underrated and a masterpiece!,"As far as I'm concerned this is one of the best animated films ever conceived!Every single one of the characters is written perfectly! The two main leads are especially like-able!The humor is juvenile but hilarious!The emotional scenes are powerful!The character designs are all amazing!The colors are super well-done!The animation is beautiful!The voice-acting is incredible!There are a lot of movies where narration throws a movie off track, but this is not one of them!The music adds a lot!It keeps throwing clever idea after clever idea at you! There will be several moments in this movie where you'll be thinking to yourself, ""How did they come up with this?!""You don't feel the runtime at all!And as someone who has Aspergers, I greatly appreciated how it was portrayed in this movie. The whole time I was like, ""That's true."", ""I do that."", ""I used to do that."", ""That's correct."" Finally, a movie that doesn't treat autism like it's a super power.The only thing I can complain about is that the conflict near the end of the movie is a little forced.

The Marvelous Mary and Max,"Simple and blunt, the 2009 animated flick, Mary and Max, is a fantastic film and cinematic accomplishment. A beautiful, funny and touching story that delivers on all fronts of meaningful film-making.In comparable style to Wallace and Gromit, the film uses it's charming and silly style to great effect by relating two unique characters. A middle-aged man with social disabilites named Max Jerry Horovitz receives a letter one day from an inquisitive little Australian girl named Mary Daisy Dinkle. The two via letters relate to one another instantly, and an amazing bond of friendship begins.About 2 hours ago I finished watching this flick and I'm still beaming. It's really a special, special film that just screams perfection. I feel bad for the people who'll look at the cover and dismiss it due to being animated, as this will most undoubtedly happen. But lucky for me and you, huh?",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Bittersweet animated story masterfully executed,"Clamation has become popular with the duo of Wallace and Gromit. Until ""Mary and Max"", Nick Park's creations were tops. Now this film has claimed the acme. It does it by a masterful combination of uncannily perfect story telling, imaginative self-deprecating characters, well-managed timing in plot development, a fair amount of humor balanced with endearing bittersweetness, and wonderful animation that serves the story's needs perfectly.The story is one of contesseration by a young girl in Australia of a randomly chosen older man in the USA. It is based on real events, though the script writer almost certainly added embellishments and the kinds of twists and turns that make for a compelling story. Watching ""Mary and Max"" is like reading a book you cannot let go. The story is so unusual, so original, so endearing, so fascinating, that it grabs you right from the start and keeps you in its grip to the end. The events are so well timed, the surprises so well placed, that we never loose our curiosity for the characters, for the evolving plot, for the possible endings. It's constant fascination.There is a good deal of humor. Some outright riots. Yet there are many bittersweet moments. It even succeeds in being a deeply felt tearjerker. It will make you laugh and cry at the same time. A rare and precious combination.In short, ""Mary and Max"" is a masterpiece. Don't miss it!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
It's really a great film!,"Although the clay animation it was, the shining spot of the film would never be underestimated, at least in my mind. It was really a unique, personal and wonderful animation film this year and later! For Adults, the more stuffs will be conveyed if the more life experience watchers had been passed through. It shows how irreplaceable and constant is the friendship of our human being, and shows how far-reaching is our relationship to us.

My favorite animation film up to now,"I had no idea what the film was about, when I started watching the DVD my friend gave me as a birthday present the other day suggesting that 'I will absolutely love it'. And I did. I think it's the best animation film I have ever watched, until today.It's been 6 months since I first watched it, but I can still recall the strong emotions and feelings it caused me. This film has wonderful meanings about accepting differentiation in society and showing all those people the love every human being needs to receive. I think the movie didn't receive the publicity it deserved, unlike other animation films produced by bigger companies (and advertising budgets).I was extremely touched and so I suggest that everyone should watch it and reflect on the matters it refers to.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Sad, but makes you smile","It's interesting to see how a friendship can be so deep and so well outlined, without the actual meeting of the two main characters. Even though pen friends, the bound between Mary and Max takes shape quickly, due to the lack of friends that both of them struggle with. But we can easily understand that this is not because of them, but because of the society: they are both caring and willing to give their advice to whoever wants or needs it.Brief, this is a story of two underrated members of two superficial communities who have the luck to find each other. The plot is sad and the ending is even sadder - but it makes you smile in the end, thinking that anyone can find a friend, exactly when they less expect.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Charming, sublime, unique, moving, hilarious.","I had never heard of this film until my friend told me about a clip of it he'd seen, knowing I was a fan of black comedy. So we sat down to watch the first 10 minutes at 3 in the morning and then we ended up watching the whole thing, neither of us moving from our seats the entire time, fixated. This film is a genuine masterpiece; a unique, stark aesthetic as framework for an engaging exchange between two incredibly complex and lovable characters, the socially awkward Mary and Max, who communicate via letter across different countries.To skip to the meat of the issue; these characters are hilarious. Their world is hilarious. A universe filled with unexpected visual gags that range from innocent to pitch black. Often you'll not know whether to laugh or cry, as the story developments crush you but imagery on screen is side splitting. For these characters are not just funny, they are tragic. Their world is also tragic. It pleasantly reminds me of Forrest Gump, in the sense that we fall in love with these characters and their naivety because they make us laugh and feel elated, so that when misfortune befalls them the empathy coupled with drastic change of tone hits you like a wrecking ball.Although many people claim there is no such thing as a perfect film, I don't believe so. To me, a perfect film successfully achieves exactly what it sets out to do with excellent execution that keeps us engaged and entertained. If a film does all this, and lacks any mistakes or moments where it unintentionally takes me out of the experience, to me that is as good as cinema gets for me. This is a perfect film. Whether you agree or disagree, appreciate the effort, charm and beauty that has gone in to this project. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
An outstanding animation,"This stop motion animation is about the unlikely friendship between a young and unattractive girl in Australia, and a socially inept man in New York.""Mary And Max"" is captivating and touching beyond my expectations. I never thought that an animation with bleak colours and unattractive characters would be so engrossing. The plot exposes in detail the emotional depths of both Mary and Max. It tells viewers their inner world unreservedly. Max may have an unusual personality, but his inner experiences undoubtedly strike a chord with many people. As for Mary, her loneliness and low self esteem are saddening. Her unhappy childhood evoke much sympathy from viewers. It's quite amazing that these two characters alone are so riveting and captivating, that they create waves of strong emotions. ""Mary And Max"" is an outstanding animation that serves as a testament as to what friendship is really about.",,Anonymous,Animation

It tackles the strong subject of how things are perceived by the people and difference between the sane and insane on the deeper grounds.The lives through the eyes from two strangers,the outcasts of the society at far ends of the world who later develop a strong bond of friendship. The higher thinking of what's good or what's bad is left for the viewers.The start is slow where the plot is being build and it gradually thickens into a gripping movie, weaving together a bleak tale of friendship and loneliness.It's different give it a try.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Overly puerile, right from the opening line.","I wanted to like this film, but the ""birthmark the color of poo"" in the opening line of the film sets up the puerile tone seen throughout the entire movie.The sets, art, and animation are all unique and wonderful. The characters are pretty good. The narration is excellent. Every minute, though, there is another attempt at a poo joke, and these become impossible to ignore.The script needed some work to cut this poorer material out. There are several extended shots of full frontal nudity that seemed to serve no purpose. Most of the characters have some form of underlying unpleasantness which could have been toned down some.

I loved this,Wow a little gem of a movie I rented this last night for my daughter(7) who unfortunately did not like this. I can't fault her for that because unknown to me at the time it's really geared for adults. Mary a lonely 8 year old in Melbourne decides one day to write ramdomly to a person across the world to find out where babies come from in America. She chooses Max an equally lonely 40 something jew in New York who has aspergers syndrome and many deep routed personal and social issues. An unlikely friendship that spans 20 years through letters evolve between the two. This film is totally charming you laugh you cry you become a part of it. I wouldn't recommend it for young children 11 and up would be the ideal age as it is full of dark and often depressing themes. Want to see something that has a little depth to it I would put it up there with Wall-E as one of the greatest animated features of all time.,8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Is wonderful, but Harvie Krumpet is the real gem...","I love this film and am still blown away by the music. Especially, Perpetuum Mobile by Penguin Cafe (Mary's Theme).I understand why some people dislike it so much. It can be very very very depressing BUT ONLY IF YOU DON'T WATCH IT UNTIL THE VERY END. It's one of those 'depressing' films that has a feel good ending that wraps everything up nice and neatly.Anyway, everyone must remember that this film is Adam Elliot's second work of this style. Harvey Krumpet is the first. It's a 22 minute short on the ridiculousness of life and appreciating its' simple pleasures. Harvie Krumpet is the real gem.It's my favourite film of all time.

"So many letters to define Mary and Max, and not enough words to describe them...","Every once in a while, there's a movie you expect to 'watch' but what happens after the very first minutes goes beyond the idea of watching. I had ""Mary and Max"" pending in my watch-list for a long time mainly because of its presence in the Top 250. So, when I found it in the DVD store, I thought time had come to give it a shot. Well, let's just say that after five minutes, I was entranced by its beautiful ugliness and if I had one intimate conviction is that it would not disappoint me and that every second of it was to be savored like a tiny bite of my favorite chocolate.That film is Adam Elliott's ""Mary and Max"", and it's so profoundly and deeply human that it drowns you into its story. It's about two persons who couldn't have been more opposite, age-wise and geographically, but they have in common a few things like their initials, their passion for chocolate, for Smurfs-like creatures named Noblets and last but not least, they're outcasts. Mary is a shy, insecure Australian girl with an odd birth mark looking like poo stain on her forehead, that she wears glasses and is a bit plump completes the ungrateful portrait. But the tone of the film never mocks her, she's not that way because she's supposed to incarnate a stereotype, her personality is the consequence of her insecurity which is a consequence of her appearance. Anyone who's been an insecure child can relate to Mary, and one who was lucky enough to meet beauty standards can at least feel for her, because people like Mary tend to develop a rare virtue in our individualistic world: she care for others, she's empathetic.She's also extremely curious and naive like any child, and just to fulfill her curiosity, she opens an American phone book and rips a page that contains the address of Max Horowitz, a New Yorker, she sends him a letter, asking a few random question about babies and the stuff she likes. Little did she know that she had just started a twenty-year correspondence and one of the most beautiful on-screen friendships, and friendships are never as believable and solid as when they're slowly built by the passing of time, and step by step, the letters Max will receive from Mary will become an indispensable part of his life. And we're not even shocked that this is going between a little girl and a man in his forties because for one thing, their exchanges exude sincerity. Later, Max finally reveals he's got Asperger's syndrome, which finally explains why so many things make him irritable, including a few letters from Mary.These letters occupy the most of the film, but they never, absolutely never, feel as fillers, they help us to learn more about the evolution (or lack of) of Mary and Max and the people who populate their world. Mary's father is an ordinary man whose work in a tea bag factory inspired Mary's dream to marry an Englishman named Earl Grey and live in Scotland with her nine babies. Mary's mother, an alcoholic kleptomaniac, is the kind of mother you wouldn't even wish for your bully, and if it wasn't for a providential slip, Mary would never have read Max' first letter and know how much they had in common, in fact, she would have never known him, period.There is something very true to life in these letters, they tell you more than Mary or Max' lives, they're about the cathartic effect of writing, having someone we can share our problems with as a tool to overcome our own weaknesses. And many people with lamentable social skills have a tremendous capability for expressing their emotions, because they spent so much time in long introspection they know exactly what's going inside. In a way, Mary and Max' blessings came from their curses, and in some of the film's most heartbreaking moments, they both recall the worst episodes of their life, especially when they were bullied. There's a scene with a kid taking Mary's sandwich and peeing on it, and yes, kids can be that cruel. A victim of bullying will never understand the bully's delight in violence because of this empathy. And having discussed about bullying lately, the film sure hit a sensitive chord.Max is a pacifist, but he's not much an empathetic man, more of the apathetic kind, he lives his life according to his nature and never questions his social disabilities, like anyone, he has a past with its burdens and its positive stuff, he regularly sees a therapist Dr. Hazelhof and tries more or less to give a meaning to his life, and what better than goals to achieve this. Basically, Max' got three goals in life: collecting all the Noblets, having chocolate supply for life and having a friend, not an imaginary one. This is the effect Mary has on Max and through an extraordinary reciprocity, even Max positively influences Mary. Well, by that point of the film, it either comes to go further and spoil it or just invite anybody who thinks he or she's seen all in movies to watch this magnificent little gem. I was shocked that it didn't make it in the Oscar nominations because it IS a powerful existential masterpiece.It has the upbeat poetry of ""AmÃ©lie"", the dark humor of ""About Schmidt"" (which was also about an old curmudgeon venting his anger through a letter he sent to a little African boy) but the result is admirably original because the letters make the plot, they're not accessories to it and because the ending is just perfect. I'm not saying it's sad or it's happy, it's just that after one hour and half of this existential ride, we have an emotionally rewarding ending.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
beautifully ugly,"In the tiny town of Mount Waverley in Australia, Mary Daisy Dinkle (Toni Collette) is a poor 8 years old friendless confused picked-on girl with an alcoholic mother and a cold father.

He likes to eat chocolate hot dogs despite overeating anonymous. They begin a lifelong correspondent friendship as they struggle through their life.The dry off-center humor is quite effective. It does get some getting used to and this is not everybody's idea of comedy. The same goes for the beautiful ugliness of the black and white claymation. The story is so poignant and so touching.

I'm the only one who thinks this movie is not good,"I know I'm probably gonna be hated on for this, but I genuinely strongly dislike this movie, especially because of the ""oooh, so awesome"" reviews I read. The animation was pretty much intended for a childish audience, but some of the stuff they talked about wasn't funny and really vulgar- It was annoying in every sense of the word. Adult topics coupled with kid-like clay animation shut out their audience, which pretty much meant that it was appealing to no one. If Max has Asperger's as well as Panic Syndrome, along with obesity AND he's living alone, there's pretty much 0 chance he lived to that age. The only thing going for this movie is its soundtrack, which is pretty good. I would not recommend this movie, unless you have a twisted sense of humor and sentimentality.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Interesting, dark, witty and depressing.","I wouldn't necessarily regard this as a great movie but for the most part I think it's pretty good. The clay animation is superb--which I swear they're using CG because the stop motion is so damn good--the voice acting is pretty decent although they could have just taken it easy on the narration but it does a little to let the moment sink in when needed but only narrate in the beginning and the end and let the emotions do all the talking. The environment looks depressing and a bit dark but that's a positive for me. I love dark movies. It doesn't push the darkness too far, it has some funny moments to lighten the depressing mood that the characters are going through and has some touching elements that cannot be ignored, in my opinion. This looks like another Tim Burton clay animation but for adults which I was hoping it would be but it's not. I wouldn't recommend this to children but I would say chance it for yourself. Oh, I almost forgot. It has a moral for everyone that we can all learn in life. About choosing the right friends even if there is only one in life, and that person could also be your best friend because he/she is your only friend. It tells you to choose and appreciate the friends you have even if there are few. Thank you for that, movie. Thank you.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A truly unusually brilliant film.,"I was tempted to give this film ten stars, but ""Mary and Max"" seems to give the message that Aspies and Autistic people shouldn't be ""cured"" in any way, which is not the case.I was lucky enough to watch this at a pre-release screening in Scotland and I must say I am very glad I watched ""Mary and Max"". Not only is it well-animated, but the ideas presented, the ironic, black humour and the storyline are simply spectacular. When I saw an advert for this film the animation reminded me of Tim Burton animations such as ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"", but it is a totally different from anything like that. There are many adult themes and black jokes presented in this film, meaning I would not recommend it for anyone under the age of twelve, simply because it is too good to misunderstand.I will continue this review by commenting on each of the aspects in turn.Dialogue and storyline: This film is very well written. The idea of a young girl writing to a 40 year old man with Asperger's is one which is not only very unexpected, but very clever. It allows not only an intelligent, at times funny script, but it also allows the viewer to understand more about Aspies and the world in general. Some of the humour included is very funny, but at the same time this film also has very sad parts. Overall, this film is not to be taken lightly.Animation and filming: This film is almost solely plasticine animation, which gives it an appropriately nostalgic style, along with the sepia and black and white filming. The life of the Australian girl is sepia, in browns like her birthmark and eyes. The life of the American is black and white, reflecting how gloomy most of his experiences are.Themes: The themes presented include: Asperger's Syndrome, Depression, Alcoholism, Homophobia, Communism, Psychology, Processed foods, Sweet foods, Blindness and Suicide, among many others. Some of these may not be apparent to younger or even very Aspie viewers, to truly understand this view one needs quite a wide knowledge of the world. The themes are either dealt with in a comic or melancholy way, each leaving its own imprint on the film and making it more entertaining.As I mentioned above, the only thing that I disliked about this film is how the makers hint that people with Asperger's should be left pretty much as they are. Some Aspies can do with therapy or guidance in life to make sure they cope with normal people. The therapist that Max has in this film is shown to be a bad therapist, but now there are many different methods for teaching Aspies and Autistic people how to become more normal, while still appreciating many of their Aspie traits.Overall I recommend this to anyone who wants more of an idea of people with Asperger's, Aspies themselves, or pretty much anyone over the age of 12 who can deal with a rather depressing film. I hope you find ""Mary and Max"" worth watching! :-)",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
It would be cute if it wasn't morbid...,"It would be cute if it wasn't morbid... The beginning is very promising and just when I thought it would become one of my favorites it starts to slip into ruin. Ideas and essence of this movie are great, but author simply does not know when to stop. There's a bunch of beautiful and witty scenes, destroyed by overdoing until they end up distasteful. I'm disappointed and sad to see such inspirational idea and quality realization messed up and spoiled with some completely unnecessary moments.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Extremely sweet yet rather depressing.,"Do not let yourself get thrown off by the brilliant, but rather cutesy animation; this is not a movie for children. It is, however, the perfect movie for a teenager or adult ready for an exploration into solitude, loneliness, and simply being completely misunderstood by everyone around you. It made me reminisce about times in my childhood - putting a new perspective on events and emotional states that confused me when I was young. The animation is detailed, yet often appears drab and dark much like a rainy day (this does fit with the emotions put forth by the film). Mary's world in Australia appears in mostly shades of brown whereas Max's world in New York City appears in shades of grey. Do not be expecting a cheery film, but be ready for an amazing piece of film making.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A bittersweet movie.,"I suppose, as I have never written a review before, I don't know if any of you will find this useful. I think this movie deserves a review.So Mary and Max left one of the sweetest, but also painful marks on my chest I have ever come by. The characters were bought to life using stop-motion. Where did stop-motion go? It really adds to a film. Everything was very detailed and you grew to love the characters, because they weren't perfect. They were imperfect. And the imperfection, even though the story was narrated the whole time, was what really made me fall in love with the characters.So much hurt happens throughout their 20 years of friendship, and a lot of it seems relevant even today. But the movie also shows that there are always things to live for. Even if it is only one person.Australia has always made great movies and television shows. Most of them are always pushing the boundaries, and a bit of that humor shines though in this movie also.I highly recommend this movie to anyone that will watch. It is certainly not a kids movie so don't get it for your kids! This movie will make you laugh, cry and give you all the warm fuzzies.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Based on a trues story? Hmm....,"I thoroughly enjoyed this little gem. It's such a simple story but has a big impact on the lives of the characters. The stop animation has that new-generation of clean and smooth action similar to Coraline and it it very well executed here.So the story in a nutshell is about a dumpy little girl in Australia whose life is made miserable by a Sherry-saturated mother and garage-dwelling taxidermy hobbyist father who by their lack of interest, leave poor Mary to her own imagination and devices. Meanwhile, in New York, we have an obese apostate named Max living a hermetic shut-in life of chocolate hot dogs, Overeaters Anonymous, and Aspergerian perplexity about the world around him. Mary, seeking answers to the questions of life, happens to write to Max after having ripped his address information from a US phone book during one of Mary's mother's ""borrowing"" episodes. And so begins their comedic pen-pal friendship through the course of nearly 20 years.We see Mary grow and we see Max getting more and more obese. There are many moments, often funny, where Max and Mary are helping each other through their writing. I know it's just a story but how does Max NOT become diabetic? Sometimes the absurdity reminds me of Nick Park's Wallace and Gromit characters but a little more hip. While the story is not intended to be a comedy, there are some very original and funny comic elements, especially those of poor Henry the goldfish.Anyhow, we later see Mary's futile attempt to understand Max's Asperger's through the lens of wanting to ""fix the world"", as many a young adult wants to do and we see a rift come between the two as Max, content to accept his life but resentful for Mary wanting to ""fix"" him, recedes into himself.There is a resolution to their rift and the ending is rather touching. The story was very well delivered and is not made to be unbelievable. Look for this one to win awards very soon. Find any way you can to watch this one and get the bragging rights this wonderful movie deserves. Well worth you time.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
its all about feelings..,"Lovely mood.. Strong feelings.. Amazing music.. It will be a difficult movie for those who live in their lonely planet but for sure is a strong slap on their face. We can talk about an hymn to friendship between different and unlikely people. The story is great, both very funny and touching. There is a good deal of humor. The choice of music is amazing according to a perfect match with the feelings of the movie (The Humming Chorus performed by Nana Mouskouri is a great choice).Themes as Asperger's Syndrome, Depression, Alcoholism, Homophobia, Psychology, junk food, Blindness and Suicide are given in a raw way and make you think deeper. This movie really touches heart to the core...i definitely recommend ""Mary and Max"" to everybody!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
the joy and pain of connecting in (friendly) love,"Mary and Max is like opening up a graphic novel, meant more for adults than children (not that it's explicit, just... adult), and finding something that justifies the reason for this medium to expand as it sometimes does. In other words, this is a film that takes animation, claymation in fact, and takes it to another level of possibility. There are a lot of funny things that happen in this story of two pen-pals - one, initially, a 7 year-old Australian girl, and the other a 44 year-old man in New York city - who first connect over a cartoon show and find they have some things very much in common. This is a story that is profound and moving for the depths to which it explores the fragility in human beings, how vulnerable some of us can get, and what being on the 'outside' really means in society, being on the margins as being a woman, or mentally ill, or ""ugly"" whatever that means, or unable to control oneself.Something about this style of animation that Adam Eliot implements is fascinating to see unfold. Only occasionally do we see characters talking, with their mouths moving. Perhaps this was a challenge that the filmmaker gave himself and, especially, to see to what lengths he could take voice-over narration (usually a big no-no if you take a screen writing class, to which I wonder if Mary and Max would be thrown out as ""improper""). The film is mostly presented as the series of letters that Mary and Max are writing each other over the years - she starts off as a little girl with a dysfunctional family (well, more than others, though abusive more in the sense of neglect) and a sense of wonder about the world around her, and questions of things like being bullied and, frankly, what sex is; he is diagnosed later with Aspergers, but we can tell early on that something is 'off' about this single, lonely, dejected Jewish man who has an imaginary friend who for a while now sits in the corner reading self-help books.Their relationship has its ups and its downs - a stint in a mental institution brings a time gap (Max sometimes, or, no, almost all of the time) freaks out and gets anxiety attacks at the sorts of questions that an adult has to answer truthfully to someone like a little girl - and yet the narration, both from a third-person perspective and then the letters (voiced brilliantly by Hoffman and Collette) really is exceptional work. We see everything that is being described on screen, so it's not un-cinematic, and at the same time the words being spoken provide a nice counter-point at times to what we're seeing, how Max may see things in his 'way' and Mary with her attention to her looks or that boy across the street who stutters and is Greek and has an interesting smell about him. It's the sort of thing that were this a graphic novel no one would question the structure. But as presented, it's really incredible how it all holds and unfolds with great pacing and attention to character and detail.Much of this relies on both the humor in the writing, the voice work, and the exaggerated style in the animations. Mary's mother, for example, is one such a piece of work, a drunk who is kind of a harridan but fascinating to watch. Or that one older woman who sometimes cooks for Max (despite the hair, which he picks out). Some of Eliot and company's work here is nightmarish, garish, bringing out the fears and horrors of the characters to the forefront. And yet there was rarely a moment I wasn't completely, emotionally invested with these two people. So what if they're animated? When Mary is teased and goes through her hardships, it's difficult to watch (I almost felt tears welling up myself, mostly in the childhood scenes). This isn't simple manipulation - it's carefully, even spiritually, bringing us along into these character's level of awareness and how they feel things.I wondered at times if this would work as well if it was live-action, which it could have been. I think the animation adds to this story and shapes Mary and Max into the unique experience it is, though one I wish would be done more in this medium. There are several visual quirks and possibilities given that it's stop-motion animation - water is depicted really Styrofoam bubbles - but, ultimately, it comes down to the truth in the characters, and yet... no, there is an extra element that it being this way brings, I'm sure of it.Perhaps a certain innocence is evoked too? The fact that animated characters come together due to an animated cartoon in their world - and their hand-made and, later, collectible figurines? There's a lot to Mary and Max I hope to explore in further viewings - how much Judaism is satirized here to great effect, even as it's still a serious matter when a character is mocked for being Jewish, for example, or that neighbor of Mary's who can't get out of his house - and it's such a rich, harrowing experience that I can't recommend it enough.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Good Animation, but flat boring dull story line","Not sure what film everyone else watched but I found this film exceptionally boring and going nowhere and pointless. The animation was good but I never once thought I was believing any of it.It only got a 3 vote because it had some funny one liners, but apart from a few cringy laughs the whole film was monotone and a waste of time.The storyline was just highlighting the sad lives these two people were living and to me makes sad viewing, let alone in an animated world of freakish characters...All in all a dull flat dreary film",,Anonymous,Animation
Wasted creativity on a weak plot line,"You can't fault the artistry behind Mary & Max. Done in a claymation manner similar to Wallace and Gromit, but less impressively than Coraline, the film walks that comedic line, giving its characters off- beat personality traits that aren't too wacky to be believable, but are strange enough to make us laugh. It's cute, like a children's book.Unfortunately, there's a dark undercurrent in the film, and without giving away the plot line, I found that the entire 2nd half of the film and its ending departed from this theme. Instead of lovable failings that we can all laugh at and identify with, the two protagonists end up making mistakes that are genuine and contain genuine pain.Comedies can have a kind of cartoony pain where you know everything's going to turn out all right. They should not have genuine pain. If the film's early promise (from its first half) had been dramatic, rather than comedic, the 2nd half might have made some sense. But why build us up for a feel-good story and then leave us feeling bad?By the end of the film, there's no sense that the pain will end.Although I didn't like it, I appreciated the film's originality and its artistry. So I'll give Mary and Max a humble 6 out of 10, the highest score I'll give a film that I wish I had not chosen to watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
If you want to see some emotional scenes WATCH IT!,"Their friendship begins with a random letter and evolves to a close relation. Although it has some depressing scenes everyone can watch it. Because of it's emotional intensity it makes you feel different. The animation that has a pessimist atmosphere but the theme of Friendship can be worked up quite successfully. Sometimeswe can become entangled in contradictions just like Max. Director wanted to mention about this situation. Depressing scenes affected me too much. I was surprised at the animation because it was like real life. Musics between the scenes are really good and on time and well-advised. I noticed that there was little comedy item but it is considerably important for me because when we are extremely sad and in depression we need all of them because they help me. Mary lives in her own world and own designed toys that I really admired. She has desserts and cream and his own life that in loneliness. Max is really interesting man because of chocolate in the bread etc. Our characteristics can be changed and sometimes come to a halt and This situation can cause bad experiences in our lives. It is good to see this examples in animations. LOVE YOURSELF FIRST Mary and Max's common point was it. The thing that strengthen their friendship is that. They accepted themselves with their defects. Nothing is excellent in the life because life is defective. To be happy we must learn how to live with our faults.The film's themes including childhood neglect, teasing, loneliness, autism, obesity, depression and anxiety. The funniest scene is that eating chocolate with bread and Max was the most suitable type and I really liked it beside this Mary's mother is an other fascinating character on the other hand her red lips and cigarettes support each other's features. I really recommend it everybody. My vote is 10/9 You won't be bored while watching it.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Very depressing but a amazing animated movie.,IMDb is great site. I was bored just looking at random movies I like and I get recommended to watch this movie and it's exactly a movie I deserved to watch. It's about two different people with similar depressing lives pen paling one another. A 44 year old man and a 8 year old girl. Sounds creepy right? Well why there is some weird type of humor that may be creepy to some for the most part you feel a wonderful bond between these two characters. I hardly ever cry in movies but this movie made me cry I suggest anybody who likes a good sad movie to see then watch this. You won't regret it. Brilliant writing. This movie is not for children. Not even sure teens can handle its depressing nature. Even as adult I could barely handle it but I still loved it.P.S.: Sorry for my bad grammar. P.P.S: Sorry for making you notice my bad grammar.

A must-see animation,"It is interesting how animated features are mostly marked as 'children movies' â€“ something that started a long time ago with the first animations in the early 20's. Due to this fact, we see that the mainstream animations are made only by big Hollywood studios aiming in particular the young audience. Sometimes we see a film like Up(2009) or Wall-e(2008) that are not exclusively for kids, but for adults as well. However, we rarely see a true adult animation like Persepolis(2007) or Silvain Chomet's The Triplets of Belleville (2003).Mary and Max is one of those 'rare' animations. It tells the story about Mary, a girl neglected by her parents who is very lonely and doesn't have any friends. She then decides to choose randomly someone from New York to write a letter â€“ she end up picking up Max's address. Max is a forty-something old obese man who is also lonely, sad, depressed and doesn't have any perspective on life. When he receives Mary's letter, he is enchanted by it and both start a friendship that lasts more than twenty years.The story seems a bit silly, but the film story deals with a lot of deep issues such as anxiety, depression, suicide and even Asperger Syndrome - black-humor is also present. The main theme is, however, friendship and the film does a great work on it, being sometimes very sad or very touching and optimistic. In any moment the story or the characters fall into clichÃ©s.The director also made an interesting use of colors - in the whole film, there are almost only two colors: brown and gray. They are used with the intention of being a metaphor of Mary and Max's vision of their own lives. Mary's life is brown because it is uninteresting and boring; Max's life is gray because it is depressing, sad and without any hope or perspective of getting better.So, with no colored images and no happy characters, this is not the kind of movie to show to children â€“ most of them wouldn't understand it. However, it isn't for all adults as well â€“ this film require a more sensitive audience that is able to capture and understand the elements presented in the story and the meanings of it.This is a must-see film for those who want to appreciate other styles of animation rather than just see the conventional ones.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great movie!,"We live in an age of cookie cutter movies: action, romantic comedy, drama, thriller, you know what you're getting - it may be comforting both for the movie goer and the producers, but boy this decade stinks when it comes to original outstanding film - rather than a copy of a copy of a copy.Max and Mary is for those who admire the effort of originality. Telling with great humor, warmth, insight, and a certain darkness, and above all a unique style, it is the story of a small girl in suburban Australia, who is desperately lonely and an outsider, who, by random chance, befriends as a penpal a middle-aged Jewish Asperger: Max.This is not a charming film (though it has heart) it is a film about radical honestly, and a stark reminder that contact is what makes us human.The fact that it is also a true story just tops off a truly original piece of work.

Transports you into a universe of its own where the surprises never stop coming - a small masterpiece!,"I've been watching too many mediocre/sub-par flicks lately. Which makes me so happy that once in a blue moon, there's still a movie that is able to just sweep in from nowhere and trigger that soaring feeling inside your chest, making you grateful for being alive to have experienced it. This amazingly detailed clay-animated (Ã¡ la Wallace & Gromit with a grayish twist!), but QUITE adult fairy tale is one of those: Unhappy 8-year-old Mary in a small Australian town, writes a chance letter in the 1970's to middle-aged obese man, Max in NYC, USA - and so an unlikely pen-pal-correspondence begins... that is nothing but a marvel to share!The biggest miracle this movie pulls off is to literally transport you into another universe of its own, where the surprises never stop coming. Through the lives and fates of two simply unforgettable characters, it takes a firm, heartfelt stand for The Outsider and dives head-first into dark places where, say Pixar rarely would dare to go (mental afflictions, alcoholism, bullying, family deaths etc). Almost guaranteed to move you to tears, (even a few more might be shed knowing that recently diseased Philip Seymour Hoffman provides the fantastic voice of Max) it also serves up top-notch black humor and is hysterically funny at times.Yes, I am seriously in love with this wonderful film and can't wait until I get to watch it again.

Animation at its very best.,"Take one disillusioned Australian child called Mary and one mentally deficient New York adult called Max add to that a script that manages to be poignant, humorous and moving all at the same time and animate it as if Robert Crumb worked for Aardman making Wallace and Gromit for adults and you have 'Mary and Max'. A film so special and made with so much care and attention that not only is it one of my films of the year it has instantly become one of my favourite films of all time. Its not very often you feel such a strong attachment to characters in a film that spending an hour and half with them just isn't enough, its even stranger when they are not even real. But in that is where the genius of this film shines through, by taking two opposite ends of the spectrum on two opposite sides of the world it shows that space, age, distance and time actually don't make us all that different and problems are problems no matter who or where you are. In the accidental blossoming of their pen pal friendship the two main characters teach each other so much and show us the viewer the powerful nature of the human spirit. Bursting with ideas and an attention to detail that even extends to the colouring you can't fail to fall in love with this movie. In a sea of blockbuster dirge it's amazing to actually see a film this good could make it to the surface, my advice if you see one film this year make it this one, you will not be disappointed.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
6.7/10. Recommended.,"First of all, i think it's overrated. This is not a 8.1/10 movie. On the contrary, this 72/100 Metascore is closer to its worth. This could have been much better with a few changes on the script. And i mean something that happened around 20 minutes before the ending. It was unnecessary. Up until then, you could even say that this is a realistic and convincing movie. Not realistic like a non animation movie, but for an animation movie, i totally bought it. Characters felt real, their struggles felt real, even this friendship felt something like magical realism.And then, something happened and made me feel underwhelmed. Just tension for the sake of tension, drama for the sake of drama. Ok, i get it, at this point something should have happened in order to things get ""escalated"". They could have thought something else though. This movie was already sad. Why make it unbearably sad? And i don't even mean the ending. The ending was strong, i liked it. But the whole charade before the ending was unnecessary in my opinion.Still, this is a good movie. Weird, original, a lot of creativity, nice soundtrack. Touching and clever. An artistic creation.

"I finally watched it, and I loved it while being depressed","This is a movie with a lot of themes and social issues. It has abuse, drug issues, rejection, bullying, divorce, death, people who are ""disabled"", and many others. This means this movie can move just about anyone, because it reaches out to so many subjects. Of course this means that the movie is very depressing, and can leave you really upset at times.On a note: this is not a kids movie. Just because it is clay animated, and has a mildly friendly title does not mean it is a kids movie. It has many mature themes in it, and has some nudity. So just kind of saying that. There are some jokes that are very subtle, but are pretty mature. Especially how Mary's dad gets ""all the Teabags he wants"". At first I didn't think it was a joke, but they put a lot of emphasis on it.The movie has a great soundtrack, while the main theme may be overused a little bit, it is still nice. This movie has a very nice visual appeal. Mary's world in Australia is shades of brown, white, red, and gray. While Max's world in New York is shades of black, white, and red. The movie keeps these colors except for only a couple of scenes. And the one scene in the movie that is in full color is arguably one of the saddest and most depressing scenes.The movie is about a young girl who has no friends, her father isn't paid much and he spends no time with his daughter. Her mom is a bit abusive, smokes a lot, drinks a lot and is really not nice at all. Mary decides to make a pen pal with some random person, and meets Max who lives in New York. He is obese and has Aspergers. It is interesting seeing his view on the world, and sort of how he thinks. Kind of an eye opener. The plot revolves around their notes to each other and how their lives change because of their friendship with each other, so the movie does have slower parts about halfway through and can get a bit boring.Either way Mary and Max is a beautiful film that will most likely depress you after watching it. The ending could be seen a mile away, but it was still good.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Well worth a look!,"I knew very little about this film before seeing it; I knew it was animated and that it was an Australian film. Someone had mentioned it online, stating it was pretty good and so I added it to 'The List' and waited for it to appear. It finally did and I duly recorded it expecting some strange Aussie humour. To be honest, I wasn't quite sure what I was going to see when I hit the play button. Imagine my surprise when I found a wonderful, funny and deeply touching story, beautifully animated with such great characters. I would even go so far as to say I loved it! (And I don't say that often!). Rather than give a summary, I'll give you a very brief outline of what the film is about.Mary is a lonely eight year old girl who lives in the suburbs of Melbourne (Australia). One day she randomly picks a name from an American phone book she finds in the local post office. She writes to one Max Horovitz, a forty four year old man who lives in New York (USAÂ… that's just for balance). The unlikely pair strike up a friendship and write to each other on and off over the next twenty years. I really don't want to say too much more, but the film covers issues like loneliness, mental health, love and hate, it's all quite grown up, so not really one for the kids. I think I stopped just before the Spoiler Police wrapped me up and sent me to their pen palÂ… in Alaska.The two main characters are fully rounded and you get a great sense of what they are feeling due to an excellent script and also to the voice talents of the actors playing their parts. So I must give praise to the voice talents of both Toni Collette as Mary Daisy Dinkle and Philip Seymour Hoffman as Max Jerry Horovitz. Also, the narrator, voiced by Barry Humphries had a great part to play, so a big chunk of praise going his way too.Made in the 'claymation' style favoured by the Ardman studio here in the UK (responsible for the likes of 'Wallace and Gromit' amongst others), I thought it was really well done. Lots of little visual gags in amongst the rather serious story that unfolds. It's witty, intelligent, charming, but there are also some serious messages in there. I found it quite touching at the end, but I can't really talk about the ending here. Over allÂ… HIGHLY Recommended.My score: 9.2/10.IMDb Score: 8.2/10 (based on 31,658 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 94/100 (based on 54 reviews counted at the time of going to press).

An Unexpected Masterpiece,"Mary and Max was everything I wanted and more. The story is about a girl named Mary who doesn't have any friends so she sends a letter to a random person in the phone book. The letter is sent to a man in New York. The whole movie is about their relashinship as each other's only friends. This film absolutely drained me emotionally. Their relashinship made me laugh and cry a lot. It really gives off the feel of a real relashinship with all of the ups and downs. In other movies friendships usually don't seem real and are predictable. In this film, their relashinship is anything but predictable. That leads to the rollercoaster of emotions. The best part of this movie though is the writing. Mary's writing perfectly captures the thoughts of a child. Max's writing perfectly captures the thoughts of a man just trying to make a friend. They never tried to go too houmerous with the writing as well. The characters say lines that are funny in context, but because of the excellent voice acting from Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Bethany Witmore, as well as Toni Collete the lines become more humerous because they don't talk like they're making the joke. It just sounds like they're talking like a regular person which makes the joke seem more real and not seem like ""okay, this is where they put the joke."" All the writing seems natural. I've heard complaints about the pacing of this film but I found it great. Nothing was ever too slow or fast. The last thing I want to touch on is the stop motion. It is absolutely stellar. This is some of the best stop motion animation I've ever seen, especially with the very smal budget this film had. There is so much detail in the environments, it's crazy.

"Wonderful, heart-warming, thought-provoking movie","Wonderful, heart-warming, thought-provoking movie.It's 1976. Mary is an eight year old girl living in Melbourne. Her mother is an alcoholic (and a mean one at that) and her father is...distant. Nothing seems to be going right. Then she randomly writes to a stranger in New York, Max, and they become pen-pals. What follows is a wonderful friendship and journey...Great movie with incredible warmth and depth. Sensitively explores subjects like depression, Asperger's Syndrome (and mental illness in general), loneliness and friendship. All this while delivering some sharp, often dark, humour. Not unnecessarily politically correct either - I'm sure there's enough in the movie to offend the humourless, dial-a-complaint crowd. Quite real and gritty.Great, original animation. However, don't be fooled by the animation - this is certainly not a kid's movie. While it may seem suitable for kids initially, it explores some very dark themes towards the end.Good voice casting too, with Toni Collette as Mary, Philip Seymour Hoffman as Max and narration by Barry Humphries plus a supporting cast that includes Eric Bana.Superb.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Grungey odd-couple comedy/drama...but how true is it?,"This is a hard movie to rate. I do remember seeing posters, I think,  which stated that this movie was based on a true story. That wasn't  enough to make me want to watch this movie. So, when the TV show ""At  the movies"" reviewed it, and I saw some funny things, I decided to  watch it.  Watching this claymation movie, I had forgotten about the claims to  truth of this movie, which made me think that this was a very strange  movie indeed. It concerns the titular characters: Mary (voiced by  Bethany Whitmore for the child, and by ""The sixth sense""'s Toni  Collette for the adult), a young Australian girl, and Max, an  American middle-aged man (voiced by Philip Seymour Hoffman). Feeling  bored one day, Mary randomly picks a name out of a phone book and  writes to them...which is how she sends Max a letter. The movie airs  the contents of their letters over many years, and displays each  character's psychological state. Barry Humphries provides the narration  in the movie. That element doesn't work particularly well in this  movie, I don't think, as the story-book format can drag at times.  The clip I saw on ""At the movies"" was indicative of the quality of the  film...there are some genuinely funny exchanges between Mary and  Max...laugh out loud funny at times. However, forgetting that this  movie was supposedly based on a true story, I would think that the  content of the movie was very odd. It was quite dark at times. For that  reason, I don't think that this movie is appropriate for pre-teen  children, even though it is made with claymation (plasticine figurines  which are moved and photoed, to create the illusion of life in cinema).  So, as I said, this movie is hard to rate. It is genuinely funny at  times, but sometimes gloomily overwrought, which pegs it back a little.  If this movie bares no relation to reality, then I'd give it 6/10. If  there truth to it, I'd give it a score closer to 7/10. Did read an  interview with the movie's maker, Adam Elliott, in a local suburban  paper where I live (The Monash Leader, 14/04/2009, i.e. ten days ago),  where Elliott admits that the movie is based on his penfriend-ship with  an American when he, Elliott, was a child. On that basis, the high  melodrama that you see in this movie with Mary doesn't really seem to  be based on anything that Elliott himself experienced. On that basis  I'd mark this movie down a bit...it's gloom seems unmotivated. I'll  give it around 65/100.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
I didn't like it.,"For this movie, I have to say, it just isn't my taste. At all. Too trying to be artistic and too dull. Or I just wasn't in a mood for this movie.I can't rate this higher than animated movies with much better graphics. With much better humor. With more emotional power. With better music. etc. Still, I did recognize why people like this movie. It can connect with people experiencing loneliness and struggling to find friends. But even so, the characters aren't too likable. I don't know. I think this just isn't a movie for me. And that is all there is to say about it. I see some people loving some girls I don't find beautiful at all. So, we all have our own tastes. Nothing new here.Why the high rating? I can only assume, only a select audience is viewing this. Real blockbuster audience would rate this 7.0 tops.But I guess this is how it is. And that is why IMDb ratings can't be fully trusted.My Real Rating 3.9",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
How on earth an Animated flick be so intellectual about real life theories? One Of The Best Animated Picture You Will Ever See.,"Mary And Max (2009) :
Brief Review -How on earth an Animated flick be so intellectual about real life theories? One Of The Best Animated Picture You Will Ever See. A Masterpiece ! After a few moments I finished watching Mary and Max i tried to recall some memorable Classic Animated films i loved and most of them were from Pixar and Disney. This animated drama by Melodrama Pictures has now entered in that list and certainly roaming somewhere in Top 5 Animated Films i have ever seen. It's a tale of long distance friendship between two unlikely pen pals: Mary, a lonely, eight-year-old girl living in Australia, and Max, a forty-four-year old, severely obese man living in New York. These 2 exchange a tight bond of friendship, feelings and even anger sometimes but all those conversations between them are Highly intellectual. The writing deserves a standing ovation (i am standing and clapping right now, believe me) as it left me gushing over it's smartness and intelligence that depicts all real life theories so perfectly. I don't know from where to start and where to end for admiring the dialogues of the film. It's just Incredible. The one line at the end says, ""God gave us relatives. Thank god that we can chose friends"".. Just Amazing.. It's about life, it's about morality, it's about human behaviour, it's about human nature, it's about human reactions, it's about love, it's about hatred, it's about mistakes, it's about family, it's about loneliness and bla bla, ohh gosh i just can't stop finding more and more. The intresting conversations and words between them comes in written form and are told as if someone is reading or narrating it to leave more impact. Mary and Max has everything i could expect from any film concerned about Human Lifestyle, although it was little predictable but still i had tears rolling down at the end. The emotional touch worked despite being predictable then tell me what else and how better it could be? After all, my eyes were moisty, heart was touched, feelings were battling each other and that's all what matters. Adam Elliot made a fascinating world in Stop-motion-animation method, his writing was Marvellous and his directing techniques were even more thoughtful and touching. Max And Mary would tug a ring in your heart for sure, it's a definite Tear-jerker but apart from that it is a comedy and also solemnly Intellectual film and belive me this mixture is very rare. If you really love Classic animated flicks and want to see something really worthy then Mary and Max is not a thing that can be missed. A Must Watch even if you have to pay double or triple.RATING - 9/10*By - #samthebestest",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
we all have a Mary and a Max inside us,"i remember when i watched this movie the mixed feelings i got afterwards , it was so overwhelming and beautiful. it was really amazing how different parts of me could deeply relate to both of them , specially Mary's pure innocence and Max's loneliness. it was very elegant how the story goes and how smoothly it delivered satisfaction to me at the end. Adam Elliot was as brilliant as ever, he just knows how to reach that deep and complicated feelings of human beings and put in a story that may seem very simple and light. for me its in the top of my animation movie recommendations list. without hesitation i give it 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Sweet and beautifully animated,"Adam Elliot's first full-length animated feature continues in the stylistic footsteps of his short films, on a larger, more ambitious scope, though the focus is still around similar motifs of loneliness and alienation. The quality of animation has improved, though, and the story is sweet and even moving; if you still need proof that animation isn't just for kids, Mary and Max is solid evidence. It could have easily been an independent tragicomedy by a director like Todd Solondz or Gus Van Sant, but the animation compliments the imaginative story and the colorful characters.The movie doesn't quite do well with the long format, though; when compared to Elliot's Oscar-winning Harvie Krumpet (2003) it's easy to see why. The characters of Mary and Max are both too flawed, and they both do very little growth for this long a movie, and the viewer gets a feeling of treading water. Despite the fact that the movie keeps inventing throughout, it get dull, and I couldn't help but feel that it would have been better with a 40 minute runtime. For that reason it feels very fresh at first, but it can't maintain the feeling of surprise and originality that Harvie Krumpet had, but it's still recommended for animation lovers.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Dark and Quirky, But Not My Cup of Tea","Mary and Max is a stop-motion animated film that tells the story of an unlikely friendship between Mary, a lonely young girl in Australia, and Max, a middle-aged man with Asperger's syndrome living in New York. The film is known for its dark humor, unique animation style, and exploration of themes like loneliness, mental illness, and the human condition.Despite its critical acclaim, Mary and Max did not appeal to me at all. The film's dark and quirky tone felt off-putting, and I found it difficult to connect with the characters or the story. The humor, which is often praised for its wit, didn't resonate with me, and the overall narrative felt too bleak and depressing without much payoff.While I can see why Mary and Max might be appreciated by those who enjoy unconventional and thought-provoking films, it's not one that I found enjoyable. I give it a 1/10, as it simply wasn't my kind of movie, and I wouldn't recommend it.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation

A Cinematic Masterpiece That Touches the Heart and Provokes Thought,"When an old boulder like me is moved by something, it means something. ""Mary & Max"" is so delicately heartfelt that you almost don't realize how emotionally overwhelmed you become - until you find yourself sitting there at the end with a tear inevitably streaming down your cheek.In recent years, I can guarantee that I have rarely seen a film with such a brilliantly written story. It is rich in detail, unique, without being overly sentimental or fluffy in its naivety, but rather embedded in a world that is not very funny.Intelligent, lovable, touching, thought-provoking, with moments that make you smile, and above all, fantastically well thought out. Without a doubt, this is truly great cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not As Great As Expected!,"Mary and Max had been a part of my movie collection from the very beginning, having landed in the list because I was following the IMDb Top 250 back then. Anyway, it's the very first time I've seen this film & a part of me keeps wondering why I didn't check it out earlier for I could have gotten rid of it sooner & would've retrieved some storage space on my disk.The story of Mary and Max follows the two titular characters: one is an 8-year-old girl living a lonely life in Australia, other is a morbidly obese 44-year-old man living in America who struggles to form close bonds with people & has been diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. The plot covers the unlikely friendship between these two pen-pals who understand each other better than anyone else.Written & directed by Adam Elliot, everything about Mary and Max is unconventional, from the way its story is narrated to the manner its themes are addressed. Even its animation is neither hand-drawn paintings nor computer renderings but makes use of clay, or claymation as it's called. And while a lot of it is worthy of commendation, it's not a film that's everyone is going to enjoy or appreciate.The entire story is told in voice-overs since we barely see these characters communicating with anyone verbally. The script is brilliantly written plus the themes of loneliness, anxiety, depression, isolation, friendship, Asperger syndrome & obesity are beautifully depicted. The stop-motion photography makes use of separate tints for separate place, sepia for Australia & grayscale for America and the level of detail is impressive.What I also liked is how wonderfully it captures the entire hypocrisy of the society we live in & it's extremely evident when seen from Max's perspective. Editing deliberately keeps a dull pace to reflects their lives but after a point, it becomes unbearable. And music manages to soar in few scenes. Also, the voice cast is wisely chosen & all of them end up doing a good job in infusing more personality into their respective characters.On an overall scale, Mary and Max is an art-house feature from Australian cinema that has a lot many great things going on and while the tone may seem depressing, it offers plenty of laughs along the way, doesn't matter if the humour is deadpan. The best thing about it is the two characters we have in Mary & Max plus the relaxed manner in which their friendship is progressed over the course of its runtime. Definitely worth a shot.",,Anonymous,Animation

"Beautiful, heartbreaking film","'Mary and Max' is an animated film about a little 8-year-old girl, Mary, from Australia becoming pen pals with a 44-year-old man, Max, from New York with Asperger syndrome, a form of autism. Both lead bleak, troubling lives for different reasons, but they become best friends over 20 years of writing back and forth. Neither had any friends until they found one another. They find lots in common even though their communications are wholly through physical letters, from across the world and generational differences. They have some misunderstandings along the way and ups and downs like any friends, but they hang in there. It's a humorous story of friendship as they share their sorrows and isolation and build each other's confidence in a chaotic world that keeps bringing them down.'Mary and Max' is a beautiful, humorous, heartbreaking film that makes you think. It's such a unique film, unlike any other animated (or non-animated) film I have seen before. The ending will have you fighting back tears. The writing, animation, direction, soundtrack, and voice acting are well done. I don't think it's a kid film because it covers dark themes like depression, mental health, pessimism, suicide, and loneliness. I felt the pacing was a bit of a letdown, and it didn't hold my attention all the way through, unfortunately. Parts of it were easy to drift off into other thoughts. The narrator's monotone didn't help matters.Would I recommend this? I am a bit on the fence about this film. The characters are likable. The story is relatable to probably everyone, but there is also a disconnect somewhere. I believe it's worth a watch. Even if it doesn't leave you with a smile, there is something magical and poignant about it.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Mary is the little red flower on Max's hat, and Max is the cinnabar mole that Mary cannot spot","I don't know why this film reminds me of a non mainstream animation I've watched before. Because it has a very obvious clay style, it should be produced in Czech Republic, and the title seems to be called ""Czech Night"", which is very recommended. Of course, this Australian produced film is visually considerate to the audience, at least the nose is still the nose, and the eyes are still the eyes.As for D's question about the relationship between Mary and Max, I don't think there's any doubt at all. Isn't it just love? What else could it be-- There are many types of love, just like Mary and Max, who are also a special type among many people. Their love is also a rare one among many types of love. The so-called ""love"" is not equivalent to ""kissing, going to bed, getting married, giving birth to many, many babies, and living happily together forever."" If we limit this word in this way, human love is inevitably too few and monotonous. Anyway, in my formula, the identity of love is not written like this. I didn't love until I did, and I knew in my heart that if someone watching a movie thinks it's love, then it's love. Mary is the little red flower on Max's hat, and Max is the cinnabar mole that Mary cannot spot. Just sauce.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Marx's body is the booklet used to identify his expression. It seems that he is ready to meet this old friend. Marx covered the roof of the room with letters from Mary for so many years. They were neat and intact and hung there, at a glance, just like the time passed quietly in front of him, and the old typewriter became forever. The symbol of their friendship is located in the sunlight of the window. At this moment Mary looked at all this and burst into tears. I think that in the process of exchanging thoughts between two people, they have already understood what love is, and the practice is greater and more memorable than the average person.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

First of all, the creation of what could have been passed off as grotesques, begin to make their ways into our souls. Both Mary and Max are lost souls who have demons. They are also optimistic, given the hands that have been dealt them. Through circumstances, they have beliefs in the realities of humanity that are so innocent. For example, where to babies come from. Mary has never really had a friend and ends up making contact with Max when she tears his name off the bottom of a telephone book page. They correspond between Australia and New York. They have been bullied and pushed around their whole lives. Max has issues with depression and self esteem. Mary has a mother from hell. Of course, these are clay characters, but when bad things happened to them, I literally wanted to cry. There is no romantic angle, only two people that need each other desperately. Much of it is so funny, but ultimately a serious take on the human condition.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Oh my precious......,"Mary and Max features two different pen-pals suffered different dysfunctions from different continents some 30 years ago, but if the idea already made you yarn, let's be honest, you should see a doctor.Just after the first viewing, I have already updated my top 5 animation movies with Mary And Max among them. The reason, it's a perfect illustration of the thousands of layers of life, keeping a high profile of those imperfections by symbolizing them but allowing the love among humans to flow to the last, warming the audiences indifferently. (Well, as long as you don't bash a film because of some improper contents for children.) Don't be freaked out by the weird art design. Actually, those sensitive ones should have already felt the underlying irony in those sad, agonized faces filling out the movie. From the carves on a mailbox to every adult alike in Mary and Max's world, ""beauty"" is but a word describing extinction. Mary's face, figure and everything alike had a deep feeling of asymmetric and depression while Max lives in a tottered balance so fragile but also so ironic, portraying a sick man in a sick world. Through their different but same pains they knew each other. And the whole experience is such an unbelievable flow of black comedy that blew Fight Club and Little Miss Sunshine away.I have to be honest, that this movie is not intended for kids and really shouldn't be promoted to anyone under 15. Yes, there are controversial contents. And if again you hated it purely because of that, I have to express my sympathy for you as you are exactly like Max or any other paranoid people. (Poor Max......) Finally, I would wish Up and this movie to contend Oscar in different years since I loved both of them.

one of the best in animations,"Mary and max is a tale about friendship that's told in a unique way. what makes this film so unique is its tone, presenting these dour and bleak situations in a up beat tone which i honestly don't think would work entirely well if it wasn't in this medium, but the animation lends itself so well to that. all the character designs are unique along with the setting, production, and the use of color and lighting which all put an emphasis on how ugly this world is, which i love. i consider that to be a commentary on just how imperfect people are which is one of themes along side loneliness and friendship, and it very much wears those themes on its sleeve and that would be one of my criticisms if it wasn't for how oddly charming it all comes together. i kinda love this film and i wish i had more like it that are as unique.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Mary & Max,"Two different people from two different countriesÂ… In your opinion, it is possible to cross their ways somewhere coincidentally? Or, another important question.Do you brave that you say everything which related to your life somebody who you did not meet before by letter? Mary Daisy Dinkle and Max Horovitz met by chance.They did not think to be each other's future. Max was alone and unable to communicate with people around. On the other hand, Mary also alone at home and school. She had an alcoholic mother and insensitive father. In my opinion, that's why Mary prefers to share her own happiness, trouble or secrets with Max. I like animation movies. A new one was added my favorites. The story is told so good that people are not bored and even if you can find the missing aspect, movie remains fully the positive aspect in mind. The part of the movie which impressed me very much is the end. Mary looked at the ceiling and saw all her letter which sends him while sitting next to Max's dead body. Do not need to see her or hear her voice for Max.She was so far away. But still he fell in love with a girl who just saw her picture. That is enough for him. If we think in terms of the Mary, knowing to be loved so much by someone must be very nice. But even though knowing it, as soon as you find that person, to lose.It is very painful. Something which thinks me throughout the whole movie is to share her own secrets somebody who did not meet before. I think, Trusting people who do not recognize should be much easier.

Resonant in its own irreverent way.,"Despite an occasionally 'mean spirit', 'Mary And Max (2009)' manages to actually be rather emotionally resonant - in its own, slightly irreverent way, of course. It's generally rough-around-the-edges but ultimately quite endearing, telling the tale of two long-distance best fiends with a heavy dose of 'edgy' humour and some moments of real darkness. It's perhaps because it's not afraid to be as serious as it is, or to present its world as harshly and as blackly comic as it wants to, that it's so successful; it creates a grounded but bleak reality filled downtrodden characters and then takes the time to show the small, yet incredibly powerful, moments of happiness they manage to find within it. The narrative is told mostly through narration - whether by Mary, Max or, well, the narrator - which creates a kind of 'storybook' feel. The lead characters almost never speak to anyone, either, which bolsters their loneliness outside of their all-important written relationship. For the most part, the picture balances its tone well enough. Sometimes, it gets a little too dark or a little too silly for its own good, however. It's aimed primarily at adults, that's for sure. Its pacing isn't quite as tight as you'd like, either. Still, the film is filled with tender, well-conceived moments and usually amounts to an engaging, entertaining time. Like I said, it's quite emotionally resonant, too. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

A Fantastically Heartwarming Story,"I went into Mary and Max with some expectations, but I never really thought about the movie until I watched it. I'm happy to say that I was unable to stop thinking about it the day after watching.The plot is pretty simple, and a little clichÃ©. That's not a bad thing, but oftentimes a clichÃ© plot is poorly carried out. Mary and Max is not one of those movies. It's very interesting, and I felt myself wanting to hear what each letter exchanged by the characters said. Which brings me to the next point...The characters are fantastic. In a movie as clearly character driven as this one, they're expected to be. Each letter shed light on the characters, from the obvious traits to the smaller, subtler hints towards who they were. And when the movie stopped reading the letters to the audience I wasn't super disappointed because I already knew the characters so well. It's not hard to believe that this was based off a true story, considering how real everything felt (despite everything being made of clay).Mary and Max is one of the few movies that has almost made me cry. By the end you really feel for the characters and understand why they feel certain ways or do certain things, and you feel along with them.The tone, lighting, and coloring are perfect. There's a reason why certain things stand out and why others don't, and it adds a really nice touch to the whole experience.Overall Mary and Max is absolutely fantastic. With fantastic characters and an interesting plot, it's definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen. Almost flawless. I think that if this movie had been live-action that it wouldn't have had nearly as much charm as it did in clay-mation. The stop motion is all fantastically smooth as well. In the end I would not hesitate to recommend Mary and Max.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Mary and Max - It's worth seeing, liked it!","Mary who is an alcoholic mother's and an insensitive father's daughter, is 8 years old in Australia. On the other hand, Max (jerry Horovitzen) who is 44 years old lives lonely in America and challenges to communicate with people or to understand the outside world (I mean, he has Asperger's Syndrome). The mutual characteristic for them is antisocial and living an depressing life. A pen friendship provides that they know each other and change their life style.First f all, this movie is definitely worth seeing. Actually,I don't like animated films so much. So before watching,I am open to prejudices. Yet, not only it just entered th IMDb top 250, but also my teacher gives advice on watching in our lesson. When I consider these,I decided to give up my bias against the animation. Fortunately, I watched because I am really influenced and love it.Please don't think this movie is for children due to being animation, o the contrary for the adults because of its topic and scenes. Although it's animation, it harbors lots of dramatic ans mournful scenes.By the way, the music of the movie is very enjoyable. It glamorizes the movie so much. While you're watching, you feel the fascination in yourself. I think, th choice of music is really eligible.In conclusion,even if not face to face,the basics of friendship can make if you want faithfully. A close friendship doesn't strike up thanks to seeing with each other every day. It is necessary to be honest and love. As you know,""having one close friend is better than one thousand of ordinary friends"". What is more, the scene I laughed very much is Max's dream about being responsible for the chocolate in the heaven; but then he remembered that he is an atheist.so, he is suddenly disappointed.:)my vote is 9!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Love letter to a friend - the best and only friend,"With the animation short ""Harvie Krumpet"" (2003) creator Adam Elliot made his points - that stopmotion isn't out, that you can make a serious, heartbreaking and at the same time hysterically funny film about Tourette's Syndrome, and that the results of such an effort are indeed Oscar worthy. - Fast forward to 2009: Do Oscar winner Elliot's established points work in a feature film as well that has been five years in the making? Yes, even more so. ""Mary and Max"", the unlikely friendship of a neglected misfit Australian eight year old girl and her middle aged pen pal from New York suffering from Asperger syndrome is definitely a highlight story-wise and animation-wise, and even excels oddball ""Harvie"" by a mile.It all starts with chocolate being sent innocently across the ocean and a child's harmless questions being answered by a total stranger who doesn't have a grip on reality himself, but tries anyway. However, as this is no Pixar or Studio Ghibli film be prepared for the dark side of things to emerge when Mary grows older, Max fatter, and the relationship becomes strained and whole existences are being threatened. Fear not however, as form and content match the development beautifully and pull you in with charm, wit and pitch-perfect musical accompaniments that add flair and pace. The juxtaposition of the two different worlds is highly effective with New York in black and white and Mary's Australia in color but toned down. The latter appears more alive, Max on the other hand always follows regular routines: his life gets turned upside down only when a letter arrives, but deaths and lottery wins count only as footnotes. Not to forget: Phillip Seymour Hoffman (as the voice of Max) gives a first rank performance with side-splitting one-liners that could be enshrined for eternity. To sum it up: Elliot's second effort is bittersweet and complex, fluctuating between light and dark humor, but hilarious all around, full with well packaged social commentary, but most of all has a lot of warmth and depth, building up to an intense unforgettable finale. ""Mary and Max"" is a clearly adult themed animation pearl, an emotional roller coaster ride. Not the typical feel good animation fare, but one that will sweep you off your feet with its very own and rather unique means.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
great flick,"Mary and Max is a suberbly crafted film released in 2009, and is written and directed by Adam Elliot. To start with this film is Austalian, but takes place in both Australia and New York New York. Next, and most importantly I loved this movie. It was poignant, deeply moving, visually stunning and made you laugh, cry, and think. What more can you ask from a film. This film is somewhat intellectual and takes on some very difficult subjects while having the look of a Wallace and Gromit cartoon. It is beautifully narated by Barry Humphries who is most famous for his Dame Edna character. It also has wonderful supporting voices from Philip Seymour Hoffman and Toni Collette. This is not a mainsteam film and if I find a following, I would hope they maintain a higher standard for their movie watching experience and seek this film out. I can rave on and on about this film, there was not one moment where I did not find myself completely enthralled.

Brilliantly Australian. Love it. Could watch it 20 times. An amazing work of art.,"It is my favorite movie. It now tops Titanic, the notebook, The color purple. And even forest hump. Even I am amazed. I love chunky wonky appearance of everything, the Australian icons in the scenes are just terrific. The hills hoist, the tire swan, the bird fly wire door. The voices could not have fitted better and the words made up for this movie have now become ours. Confuzzled, love it. This movie will appeal to all ages and all tastes. Highly recommended. Mary dinkle and max is a beautiful tragic impossible friendship, unconditional friendship, that persists for many many years. It covers many of life's touchy subjects, too many to mention, it is a true masterpiece. Nothing like I have ever seen before. My ten year old is a avid fan also. If you watch this, I'm sure you will identify either yourself or someone close to you in these characters.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Great Example of How to Make Stop Motion Film,"Review:
'Mary and Max' is a very dark movie, that shouldn't be funny, but somehow is. This creates a very unique film. 'Mary and Max' is one of my favorite animated films of all time, and an excellent example of how to make a stop motion film.The film centers around the friendship of two people, a young girl named Mary (who lives in Australia), and an old man named Max (who lives in the U.S.). And in the film communicate through letters.Let's start with the excellent animation, the clay animation is unique and nice to look at. Even if it's meant to look dark and depressing, you can't take your eyes off it. The look of the film, is truly a marvel to behold, as the darker shades of color, really contribute to the tone of the film. As it is a dark film, with many elements of comedy.Now: the characters, the two title characters of the film, are two very interesting, down to earth, and relatable people. As they are two very depressed people, who see nothing but darkness, but over the course of the film, grow a bond even though they are so far apart from each other. And learn to see each other as a light in the darkness, and just see the world in a nicer light. The only issue I have with the side characters, they are just not very well developed in my opinion. If the movie dedicated more time to these characters, I would've liked them a lot more.Arguably the most important element of a great film, the story, is executed with flying colors by this film. From the surprisingly funny comedic writing, to the still very real and mature drama of the film. And also, this film has one of my favorite movie endings, it almost brought a tear to my eye. And the film is also a very quick 90 minutes. My only issue with the story, is the over-reliance on narration. But with writing this good, I can forgive it.In conclusion, 'Mary and Max' is a film that shows animation doesn't necessarily have to be for kids. And this film is one of the best in its respectable genre of film.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
More afflictions than I needed,"I can't think of any redeeming qualities for this movie. Misled by the reviews and the absence of a rating, I watched this with my 12 year old grandson. I wish I could take it back. He might imagine that there is actually someone in the world like these characters in these situations, as the movie does not present itself as a comedy or farce, so he might take it seriously. I hope not.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Mary and Max: a not-that-sweet lollipop,"Watching this animation felt like buying a lollipop which in fact ain't full color and it tastes sweet, sour, but most bitter. But even though, i'm not disappointed at all because it tastes made me laugh while crying at the same time, but also brain-touching. Don't expect full-colors, bright, and cheerful animation as in Disney, Pixar, or Dreamworks. Throw away your expectation about beautiful and cute cartoons, like you found in Toy Story, Up, Shrek, or Ice Age. 'The weather' on this stop-motion isn't like in most cartoon with children audience. This one felt so sombre.Mary and Max are being penfriend for dozen years from different continentals, but fortunately, have the same language. Mary came from Australia and Max from US. This bestfriend united by the same fate, both of them have zero friend. It's not that weird for Max, since he's an aspie (asperger syndrome, and Mary's case caused by her extremely low self-confidence. Besides the letters-replying (and also some stuffs) for most of the movie duration between Mary and Max, watching this Australian production movie is like showered by non-pretentious smart and funny words.Well, and I'm too lazy to type more review about this movie. Just two words if you haven't watch it yet: watch it!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Impressive,"It's hard to watch this film, to witness how humans are powerless confronting their demons or fears. It's disturbing because I think it's almost impossible not to recognize some painful patterns from your own existence. Kudos to those that really are not part of this category, those hard-disciplined people.I didn't perceive the friendship of Mary and Max as strange, not for a second. It is introduced so naturally, like somehow faith found a perfect match between the absences of their lives.I loved how it's used a ""not so perfect"" animation. It emphasized the facts over the aspect. And finally I loved how the characters were built. A heartbreaking combination of innocence and weakness.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A sincere, touching and very beautiful movie that deals with heavy subjects","Mary and max is a clay animated movie intended for adults. For some this will be hard to understand because generally animated features are considered to be made for children. This is something I never quite understood well since this simply is not true. While a majority might be aimed for a younger audience there are quite a few that are meant for youth and adults or adults alone. This is important to realize since Mary and Max is an example of an animated movie that while offering laughs is dealing with very adult themes that can be very confronting. Let me first tell you that Mary and Max is a very funny film through and through. While very unrelentingly confronting you with death and depression it never skips on wit to make you laugh. The narration is brilliant as it helps to distance yourself or get involved when needed. I read somewhere that Barry Humphries' (most famous for his character Dame Edna) was found to be overly used and intrusive. Personally I think it has been key to keep things light instead of depressing. The wit and narration combo in my opinion is a genius way of telling a story filled with heavy subjects that otherwise would be hard to deal with. But next to the darker themes there is one beautiful one that most of the people will be able to appreciate and relate to. Friendship. If you have to remember one thing about a film like this then let it be the fact that here they show the beauty and value of friendship in life no matter how it is conceived and exists. Here the friendship consists of communication through letters. But is just as strong or maybe even stronger than a so called normal one. Here you get to see how much a simple and sincere letter can impact someone's life that proves to be beneficial for both. This film also shows that sometimes people react in unusual ways not because they are mean or evil but simply they view the world differently due to reasons they have no control of and don't know how to respond. I know it's hard and not always possible to have an open mind or be understanding but please do try since it does prove to be worth wile in the long run.Max and Mary is a sincere, touching and very beautiful film dealing with heavy subjects in a way I have rarely seen before. It moved me deeply and it is one that deserves all the praise that it is getting. A must watch!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
The first and only movie I legity cried while watching,"Mary and max is easily one of the best films I have ever seen. It is definitely my favorite animated film, and is probably in my top favorite 5 films of all time! I truly love it. The characters are really excellent, as is the voice acting. Philip Seymour Hoffman and Toni Collette do wonderful jobs and really embody their characters. The story is beautiful, sad, and sweet. At many points in the film I teared up; but it was the ending that truly had tears streaming down my face. Another amazing element of Mary and Max is the music. It perfectly fits the movie. I love everything about this amazing, perfect, flawless movie. Not only is it a triumph of claymation (possibly the best claymation I've ever seen) but also an amazing story that deals with just about every single human emotion. I love this movie and I can't recommend it more. Please see Mary and Max it's truly a masterpiece and one of the greatest films ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Heart Breaking,"Mary and Max is the high point of what can be achieved with stop-motion animation. It's a beautifully and hauntingly constructed portrayal of loneliness that's incredibly realized by the directors very singular vision.The film isn't an easy watch and I found myself weirdly uncomfortable with many of its very adult themes, but I couldn't take my eyes off it.A wonderful melancholic score accompanies the sharp and very knowing script. Be warned though this one isn't for the kids at least in my opinion.Mary and Max is a dark odyssey into the soul of human loneliness that isn't quickly forgotten. It's incredibly sad, quite disturbing and deeply affecting. Highly recommended for anyone looking for something a little quirky.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Adam Elliot is the one to watch out for!,"My deep appreciation for ""Memoir of a Snail"" brought me here, in search of more of what Mr. Elliot (the director) offered in that piece, and I am delighted to report that the essence is remarkably similar, if not identical.This work presents a compelling blend of dark humor and emotional depth, a combination I have seldom encountered, and I find myself admiring this amalgamation once more.I adore how the narrative, while being simple and straightforward, manages to give valuable lessons on society, companionships, our lives in general.Although the central theme revolves around the friendship between Mary and Max, but it's their candid exchanges that provide us with life lessons, complemented by the expected comedic elements that surprisingly do not detract the narrative from its main goals.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Moving and quirky adult animation movie,"A wonderful Australian independent plasticine movie that tells the story of a life-long mail relationship between an autistic old Jew Newyorker and a weird Australian girl.This is not a movie for children as it touches subjects that are complex and could be disturbing or difficult to explain to a child (alcoholism, social failure, mental disorder, bullying, death, homosexuality, suicide, etc.), the same elements that make this movie a wonder for adults. It is mostly a sad story about social maladjustment, but also the story of a long wonderful -and sometimes troublesome- friendship.The aesthetics and atmosphere of the film are wonderful, as so is the music. The main characters Max & Mary are really unforgettable and lovable, and also lovely the secondary ones. Especially funny are the animal characters, both pets and urban animals, which behave like animals but are very humorous. Moreover, there are so many little details and humorous winks to the spectator, that is just a pure joy to watch.What makes this movie so special is the story told and the selection of marginal characters, who are presented in a normal accepting way. They are ""weirdos"", unglamorous suburban people, with mental and social problems who are wonderful because they are imperfect and human. The movie is full of emotion an the viewer feels moved and connected to Mary & Max almost immediately, and feels their failures, successes and worries as if they were not plasticine puppets.Three things would have improved the film enormously. In first place, although plasticine animation and shooting is very time-consuming and hand-crafted, a little bit more of lightness in the movement of the puppets, and a little bit more of definition in their facial expressions would have improved the look and feeling of the film. In the second place, there is too much narration in second person in the film, while most of the characters' speech is very limited. Finally, and directly related to the second, is the third person narration, not only too much of it, but also done by the wrong person (Barry Humphreis) and in the wrong tone, which I consider confusing and emotionally misleading as this is not a movie targeted to children at all. It would have been great that part of the narration was actually incorporated into the animation and turned into dialogs and ""acting"" and presented in a less fable-before-bed-ish story narration.Said so, I think is a terrific animation film, whose story moved me immensely. It was a hit at Sundance.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A wonderful journey,"The details in this claymation movie are beyond outstanding. But, more importantly, the script is witty, original and moving.The 2 main characters, a lonely, young girl in Australia and a mid-40s single male in NYC suffering from Asperger's (each beautifully voiced by Tino Collette and Phillip Seymour Hoffman, respectively), begin and maintain a pen-pal relationship that is initially random and bizarre but turns into the most important friendship for these 2 people who suffer from social isolationThe ups-and-downs in 2 decades of correspondence avoids the sugar-sweet path that could have easily been followed. Instead, we watch the growth of these two people, each with flaws, learn to accept the other and themselves.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
An engrossing experience and sucks you in from the outset.,"I saw this film for the first time last week and to say the least, I was blown away. Everything from the narration to animation were excellent. The story is such an engrossing experience and sucks you in from the outset. While on the outside it comes across as a mere story of 'pen pals', it is so much more.The beauty of this film is in the questions it raises. In the movie industry, animation is often seen as something secluded for kids only, but this is no kids film. It is an utterly mature film that highlights many things that, in modern culture we are scared to talk about. This film boasts an amazing defiance against social convention and isn't scared to discuss what we are.The animation is unique in its own right and comes across as a mix between Fantastic Mr. Fox and Wallace and Gromit. Its a beautiful visual spectacular that uses colour and sound to involve the audience to an astonishing degree. I for one could not take my eyes, and ears, away.A truly unique experience.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Different, critic and funny","Mary & Max (2009) is a different kind of stop motion animation, because it's a production destined to the adult public due to some elements that are present in it. An example of these elements is the absence of color that creates a dark ambiance.The story is about a lonely and sad 8-year-old girl that lives in Australia. Her parents aren't the perfect model of ""good parents"" and she doesn't have friends. Her mother is a drunk and his father has some strange habits and this doesn't contribute to solve Mary's problems.One day Mary decided to write a letter to a random person that lives in New York City. She takes the address in a phone list and writes a letter talking about herself to a 44-year-old American man called Max J. Horowitz. Coincidentally Max is a lonely and sad person too. After this a different kind of friendship is born.The main element that differs this animation from the others is the way that it represents the reality of the characters, because there's no fantasy in this movie, only the reality. Mary & Max is the first feature film of the director Adam Elliot, an Australian director. So this production is an awesome option for those that are seeking for something different with a little of critic and fun.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"8 yr old, Mary has a pen-pal friendship with 44 yr old Max","The film is strangely, both depressing and funny. The soundtrack is very good at creating the mood the best track is Perpetuum Mobile(intro) as it uses a good mix of violin and piano to convey the mood of the movie from the instant you hit the play button... so now to the characters:- Adam Elliot's films follow a similar theme high lighting disabilities as with Harvie Krumpet (a short film about a guy who has Tourette Syndrome) and Mary and Max has a mixture of Aspergers, Agrophobia, social dysfunction, homosexuality, kleptomania and alcoholism thrown into the mix. These marginalized characters are from Adam Elliot's childhood and portrays their vulnerabilities and difficulties living life. The animation amazingly takes one week to produce two minutes of film and was shot over 57 weeks. The attention to detail is incredible and even includes a fully functioning typewriter. 2009 was a prolific year for animation films, but this film was outstanding in showing that you can have an animated film with serious subject matter.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

I plan on recommending this movie to anyone who I think will appreciate the sly combination of dark humor and uplifting central story. As a writer myself, I know how difficult it is to walk the line between humor and drama without falling to one side or the other. I can't say enough about my feelings for this film.

Illumination rather than a simple candle,"It has been widely acknowledged from the general public around the globe that what only energy brings us to move forward out of darkness and fear is love,just love. What the indication behind this turns out to be like ""There's still love and hope besides grief and greed."" However,rarely had most animations create a more insightful perspective on the former notion about the theme of ""angel and demon"". Love is never simply a recession or just a side to defeat evil, but a comprehensive feeling which includes a peaceful mind and the courage to sacrifice every tiny and selfish emotion.Mary and Max just simply creates the love and compassion naturally, not from the dull speech or some psychological skills, but from the deeply-touched eye of Mary, gazing the ceiling with countless letters. Purity and love is born like a tree without any kind of purposeful sketch. Craftsmanship and psychology can only produce a emotion in a certain situation, what makes people deeply impressed, however, is the character and mood like a pond ,bringing a eternal value which won't be faded away.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

It takes a refreshing stance on life that I have certainly not seen in other films before.The animation is beautifully characterive, and the soundtrack is stunning.

The movie I go to when I need a good cry,"Don't get me wrong, I avoid tragic movies like the plague. Nothing puts me off more than watching the ills of society in gritty detail on the silver screen. Even so, once I started watching this movie, it pulled me in like a close friend I had known for all my life, and told me to let my tears flow and be content.It's hard to explain what makes Mary and Max different from other tragedies or tragicomedies. For a start, while it is geared up visually and with a soundtrack guaranteed to generate tears, it does not milk emotions in a cheap way. The narration is delivered in simple factual sentences with some tongue-in-cheek humor. The characters are ALL complex, interesting and very human, and there is no entity that is entirely negative or a source of hate or contention. Instead, the source of the troubles of our protagonists are their own internal struggles as they stumble through life stages, trying to find happiness.I don't want to spoil what happens, because everyone should see this movie at least once.

An Intelligent Animated Feature for Adults.,"I never thought I would ever see an animated film targeted at adult audiences that wasn't juvenile and filled to the rim with nothing but shock gags and farts jokes, but this film proved me wrong.The film focuses on two central characters, as the title is so appropriately named ""Mary and Max"". These two characters were so well developed and realized, I almost felt like they were real people who lived real lives. You watch these two characters grow up over the years and you really begin to feel attached to every bit of them, as they struggle through life's ups and downs.The relationship between Mary and Max is very complex, due to the age difference and the vast distance between the characters. However this doesn't deter from the loving friendship the two pen pals share and will never make you feel uncomfortable. Every letter sent was a character study all on it's own, and really added depth to the characters that even most live-action films fail to do so.The film is very much a dark comedy, making fun of life's tragedies but at the same time still resonating with you emotionally.This film is definitely not for children for it plays with the themes of depression, mental illness, and alcoholism that are just too mature for most children to understand. It also contains some sexual references and jokes throughout the film.This film will now forever have a place in my heart, and I am going to recommend it to everyone I know. It's sad, funny, and will most likely leave an impact on you before the credits roll.This is more than likely the greatest animated film I have ever seen.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Everything we could ever hope for in a friendship.,"Not everyone can find their voice through writing, find the right rhythm or pace or just the general ideas they want to express. But when someone can write, it's often the purest form of communication. This is a film about people who can write, and write to each other, because it's their consolation and fulfilment. Mary and Max, the titular characters, two disparate figures from separate continents share and understand the world from the beginnings to ends of their pieces of paper, as it's the only way they know how. But it's not a film about writing itself; writing is the beautiful catalyst for the most beautiful friendship, a bond that binds atoms together because these characters will it, and if they will it the universe wills it too.""Mary Dinkle's eyes were the colour of muddy puddles. Her birthmark, the colour of poo."" observes the narrator in the opening lines of the film, his clear, precise voice, like that of a television presenter, perfectly capturing the tone to come. It's a simple truth, both humorous and melancholy, because in life if you have one you often have the other. These are essential elements of her, she hates them but they're fundamental to who she is. She's a lonely pre-pubescent girl in a drained, sepia Australian suburbia, an environment of grinding routine, and she is most often alone to absorb and pour over everything in her own colourful inner- life, a cauldron of innocent wonder and a quiet, growing despair, which contains ideas such beliefs such as that in Australia Babies are found in the bottom of beer mugs, and her musing over where they are found in America (she deduces that although Americans drink much Cola, Babies wouldn't be found in the cans because they'd have no means of escape) prompts her to pick at random an address in the telephone book and pose this question. She couldn't clarify this with her parents because they are not present in any sense of the word, the mother a perpetual drunk and the father an extreme recluse. This is not a decaying suburban marriage but just one of a mutual desire to be withdrawn in their own world. Or perhaps they forget the other one exists. Each person is lonely, but Mary reaches out. She doesn't expect a friendship, but serendipity grants her one, and of course she deserves it.Does this not sound immensely relatable? And thus enters Max, a lonely obese Jew living in a stark black-and-white New York City, almost a Noirish landscape. But not one of intrigue, one of melancholy, one of good and bad, black-and-white. When Max is in his apartment, indulging in his own adventurous recipes, watching his favourite television show, the world is good. Anywhere outside is bad, where the world to him seems to favour madness over operating on any logical system. It doesn't take long to see he may have Asperger's. People are immediately distant and judgemental of him (as when he is mocked for wearing a helmet) but when Mary begins to write none of this matters. Max doesn't question the fact and 8 year old is writing to him, because initially in their minds they are just following a logical and path and asking each other's questions, and then it becomes an opportunity to express all the things that have ever crossed their mind but were never able to do any more than that. Philip Seymour Hoffman is extraordinary, with his despondent, breathless Jewish cadence, and I had I gone into the film without any knowledge I wouldn't have known it was him. In fact, the reason for me watching this was as a sort of Hoffman retrospective, in light of the one year anniversary of his untimely passing, and I thought selecting a film solely of his voice-acting would display an aspect of him not yet seen, but I realised this voice is just one of his many, and every performance was some aspect, however slight, unseen, and so this is a real testament to his ability to inhabit the character, not to announce his presence but not failing to distinguish himself either.The film has very little story beyond this friendship, and the people that occupy their individual worlds are more or less just figures to aid their development in the world and to provide them material for their letters rather than being fully-fleshed characters, but that's OK, because what is given through their exchanges than more poignant and witty and abrasive, and just damn real than most films could achieve through this concept. It's always convincing, and that's down to how honestly portrayed these characters are; Max doesn't understand social conventions, and tells Mary that he once worked in a condom factory but has never tried one on, Mary describes her neighbour's fear of the outside as 'homophobia', and although her older self eventually uses the correct term, the film doesn't need to show us her learning her error, she eventually pursues the naÃ¯ve idea that she can cure Max's Asperger'sI haven't even mentioned the animation, which is a beautiful clay style in which much looks bloated and listless and melancholy but also so lovingly and meticulously crafted that it's impossible not to admire. Clay of course is so malleable that it's almost infinite in its possibilities, and the film knows this and is able to capture every passing emotion with care. Although it's animation, this is not a children's film. It's a film of retrospect, as we watch Mary grow up - and even Max too, who grows to accept his position in the world â€“ we see in her ourselves learning and travelling through life, and we hope, or at least I do, that we can remain as warm and as eternally optimistic as this film, which I think believes as much injustice and tragedy as there is, we are capable of balancing it out.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Unbearably sad and immensely funny - a human and claymation masterpiece,"A few IMDb reviewers give this wonderful claymation film by Adam Elliott the thumbs down. They must be more severely disabled by Asperger's syndrome than Max, and completely incapable of normal human responses.I don't want to seek words to describe how good 'Mary and Max' is. I don't want to think why others might object to some or all of it.From start to finish, 'Mary and Max' is marvelous. Anyone who has a heart will love it, especially anyone who has a damaged heart and can't quite fit in with the regular world.The most idiotic of the hostile reviewers are those who have a knee-jerk reaction to a pen-pal relationship between, at the start, an 8 year old Australian girl and a 40 year old American man.Most of the words are narrated brilliantly by Barry Humphries. The claymation figures are grotesque but so skilfully manipulated that they evoke sympathy rather than revulsion from the viewer. The details are witty and charming, with many liable not to be noticed at a first viewing. Only Australians (fellow nationals of Adam Elliott) are likely to be familiar with the two most frequently recurring musical themes. Not many people beyond these shores will know 'The Waltz of the Wombat'.In my IMDb reviews I normally give a plot outline, with the necessary spoiler warnings. My advice for 'Mary and Max' is to see it for yourself, without prejudice. If it leaves you unaffected, or hostile, I don't even want to start thinking about what you must be like in real life.To repeat and expand, this is a wonderful, wonderful film. It hardly hits a false note, and I'm not going to highlight the few seconds that jarred with me. After watching it, I'm still in a daze. At the halfway point I thought: this standard can't be maintained; there's no way the loose ends can be satisfactorily tied. I was wrong.I have to give up now. The immediate effects should have worn off, but I'm still overwhelmed.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Unbelievable friendship, pure love and they are in a animation movie.","Before watching it I thought that the film would be boring but it would not. It is the best animation movie I have ever watched. I frankly say that it is an excellent movie. Actually I do not like watching animation movie but this one is so different. The scenes, the art- design are so live that you can not understand that it is an animation movie or not. In the movie there are two main characters that have same attribution. Mary is an 8 year old girl living in the Melbourne. One day, she chooses a name at random in a phone book and sends off a letter asking about life on the other side of the world. The letter is received by Max, an overweight depressive in his 40's living in New York; he has the sick of Asperger syndrome. And then they started to help each other by letters. Mary is a very lonely and shy girl and her only friend is Max. She asks Max everything about life. And Max learns how to cry, laugh by help of Mary. During the movie it's by equal turns incredibly touching and laughs out loud hilarious. It is a wonderful story which rewards multiple viewings. You laugh at the characters but often feel incredibly sorry for them. I do not like bad ending so I wish the movie would have a happy end. During the film I guessed that Mary and Max would meet one day and would be very happy like a father and a girl. But I was bewildered when Mary got married. I would be happy, if it had got a happy end. And the last scene o film was really sad and tragic. Max hung all the letters from Mary his wall. It is really very romantic. You can fall in love a girl you never see, like Max. The last scene of movie gives the message that there is always pure love. The love of Max is really dramatic.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

An Australian/Animated classic,"Following on from his Oscar triumph with his 2003 Animated Short Harvie Krumpet, Australian artist/filmmaker Adam Elliot gave the world his first and to this day only feature length effort Mary and Max, a unique locally made animated affair that has managed to remain one of the most beloved films of all time across the globe.Sitting pretty in the IMDB's Top 250 films list and in no danger of losing its spot anytime soon, Mary and Max is the little film that could as Elliot and his creative team bring the story of unfortunate young Melbourne girl Mary Dinkle and her pen pal friendship with lonely obese and neurotic New Yorker Max Horovitz to life, in what is a film that may be billed as an oddball comedy (of which it frequently is) but may also surprise viewers with its honest, depressing and unfortunately observant musings on what it means to be a human.You can tell every aspect of Mary and Max's painfully precise creation has been carefully considered and pondered by Elliot and co with every single scene of this 90 minute film choc (olate) full of Australian throwbacks, side gags and stories, making Mary and Max a feast for the eyes and senses as well as a curiously deep meditation on those lost souls in our world that often find themselves misunderstood and forgotten about.In many ways nothing big happens in the story of Mary or the plight of Max but in so many ways there are big moments too as Elliot resists the urge too explore too many other characters or happenings and while there are lottery wins, unhealthy creations, blind neighbors and lots of unfortunate gold fishes at play, Elliot's tale is at its best and at its most wholesome when we are focused on nothing more than Mary and Max's strange but important friendship.Guided at all times by Barry Humphries narrator who adds context and exposition to the plights of our central duo, Toni Collette's Mary and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman's (in a role he recorded exclusively over Skype) Max may be humans with some serious cracks in their ways of life but they are wonderfully bought to fruition by Elliot and his two voice performers and they all work together with love and affection for their characters and craft and combine to give Mary and Max a sense of heart and purpose that is not only hard to find in animated films but in any films regardless of its type.It's disappointing that Elliot has yet to find himself behind the directors chair for another feature film in the many moons since Mary and Max's release as on the back of Harvie Krumpet and this well-loved feature he had a chance to become one of our most well-regarded creators with hope that he will once more bring the odd and charming to life in another offering in the near future.Final Say -A film unto its own, Mary and Max is one of the most well-respected Australian films of the modern era and for good reason as its loving staged examination of friendship and finding oneself in the world creates a film worthy of being discovered for years yet to come.4 noblets out of 5.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

A Heartfelt Connection Across Oceans: The Unlikely Bond in Mary and Max,"Mary and Max is a profound and tender stop-motion animation that proves simplicity can carry extraordinary emotional depth. Written and directed by Adam Elliot, this Australian gem explores themes of loneliness, mental health, and friendship with remarkable sensitivity, earning itself a well-deserved 9/10.The film follows Mary Daisy Dinkle, an awkward and neglected 8-year-old girl in suburban Australia, who strikes up a pen-pal relationship with Max Jerry Horowitz, a middle-aged man with Asperger's Syndrome living in New York. Their correspondence evolves over two decades, creating a bond that is both deeply personal and universally resonant.What makes Mary and Max so exceptional is its ability to navigate complex issues with a balance of humor and poignancy. The characters are deeply flawed yet profoundly human, making their journey relatable despite its eccentric premise. Max's blunt honesty and Mary's naive curiosity provide moments of genuine laughter, while the underlying struggles they face-bullying, social isolation, and self-acceptance-add layers of emotional weight.Visually, the film is a feast for the eyes. Its muted, sepia-toned palette reflects the melancholy of the characters' lives, while the intricate stop-motion craftsmanship imbues the world with texture and authenticity. The narration by Barry Humphries ties the story together with a touch of whimsy, making it feel like a modern fairy tale for adults.The brilliance of Mary and Max lies in its unapologetic honesty. It doesn't shy away from life's harsh realities but shows how connection and empathy can transcend physical distance and personal struggles. The ending, bittersweet yet deeply fulfilling, stays with the viewer long after the credits roll.If you're searching for a film that will make you laugh, cry, and reflect, Mary and Max is an unforgettable experience. It's a poignant reminder of the power of friendship and the beauty of finding someone who truly understands you, even in the most unlikely of circumstances.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

One of the best psychological films ever.,"It is a great film focused on loneliness and friendship twisted beautifully into a lot of psychological aspects of humans. Actually one of the best psychological films ever.Family-friendly; not suitable for kids due to some mild sexual material and stuff.Melancholic, cool, humanistic, dark, well-made, psychological, funny, hilarious, strong, gripping, rich, unique, eloquent, thought provoking, inspiring & memorable.Focused on two characters, Max and Mary:
Max is a Jewish atheist, lonely, stoic, logical & ex-communist with anxiety disorder, Asperger's syndrome, obesity & depression.Mary is a lonely, calm, curious & charming girl who lives with her parents and grows up progressively with the story.Adam Elliot and probably his other crew chosen monochrome look with some saturated stuff for Max's side and desaturated look for Mary's side.Adam Elliot's approach about psychology, superstition and religion was remarkable. Such stories can change lives and inspire people to live better.The balance was exceptionally awesome.Very good direction. Very good screenplay. Very good production. Very good acting.

Heartwarming to the Max,"appears on screen: ""God gives us our relatives â€“ thank God we can choose our friends"". The simple, heartfelt sentiment of a longing for meaningful friendship, understanding and an outlet to share is a huge driving force that makes Mary and Max a cinematic gem one finds hidden in the cave buried amongst heaps of awful movies â€“ a gem one only finds every so often.The Narrator (Humphries) lays it all out: Mary (Bethany Whitmore as a child, Collette as an adult) is an eight-year-old Australian girl, bullied in school, mistreated by her kleptomaniac, drunk mother and neglected by her factory-worker father. She has no friends. Max (Seymour-Hoffman) is an obese, middle-aged New Yorker who has Asperger's Syndrome. He has no friends either. When Mary finds the strange name ""M. Horowitz"" in a phone book and decides to write to him, it's the start of an unlikely friendship spanning two continents and twenty years and enduring countless hardships.Directed, written and designed by Australian animator Adam Elliot, Mary and Max may at first seem inaccessible because of its art-house sensibilities â€“ there's a misconception that claymation is only ever used to make either films for very young children, or bizarre adaptations of Kafka's Metamorphosis. The delightfully whimsical style here is very comfortable, honest and real, raw emotions balanced with an appropriate sprinkling of black humour.To get an idea for the feel of the movie, take the heartbreaking opening sequence of Pixar's Up and stretch that to 80 minutes. The movie's childlike honesty belies a large range of very real and mature themes, making this not ideal for very young children, but something that older kids will appreciate. Danny Boyle's film Millions, also about a young outcast kid making sense of life and the world at large, comes to mind.Unlike such claymation films as Henry Selick's The Nightmare Before Christmas and Coraline and Tim Burton's Corpse Bride, Mary and Max doesn't derive most of its charm from being dark and grotesque. The characters feel so real that their appearances are the only thing remotely caricature-like. Through their letters to and fro, Mary and Max work through issues such as making friends, dealing with bullying and teasing, approaching relationships and so on. Just as Max mentors Mary, so the young girl has a thing or two to teach him. The film tracks as their lives progress, Max winning the New York lottery, Mary going on to study in university and get married, all the way up until they finally meet face-to-face in New York.The film contains a heartfelt and accurate (at least compared to most movie depictions) portrayal of Asperger's Syndrome. Max decides that he likes being an ""Aspie"", that there's no point in finding a ""cure"", and that it's all about working around the anxiety attacks, sensory overload and social awkwardness that is part and parcel of the ""syndrome"". Max finds solace in order, routine and comfort foods like his invention, the chocolate hot dog. ""If only there was a mathematical equation for love,"" he sighs.One feels as much for Mary as for Max, the young girl lacking the life experience, with tragedy and heartbreak heaped onto her. From having a school bully pee on her lunch, to being unlucky in love and unable to have a good relationship with her parents, let alone any friends, it's hard not to immediately want to give the awkward bespectacled girl with the birthmark on her forehead a great big hug.I spent the whole movie fighting back tears â€“ partly because of how genuinely moving it was, but also how happy I was that here was a wonderful film that had got everything right. While charming and beautiful throughout, the movie isn't afraid to offer a real and unflinching perspective, and never once feels preachy or contrived. There are very few movies that can truly be called ""life-changing"" â€“ this is one of them.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

The talent of an 'unseen and innovative' piece of artwork,"The LumiÃ¨re brothers should be proud of Max and Mary (2009) - Top Rated Movies #179. At the end of the day, they created 'cinema' so that it develops to such a degree that it brings us masterpieces like this animation-comedy-drama.In here, observers get satisfied with three components: the art of clay animation/ Claymation (1), the 'admirable and sudden' friendship between Mary Daisy Dinkle and Max Jerry Horovitz (2), along with all unexpected and comical idiomatic expressions (3), such as ""Mary Dinkle's eyes were the colour of muddy puddles. Her birthmark, the colour of poo."" or ""Butts are bad because they wash out to sea, and fish smoke them and become nicotine-dependent"". And, in addition to this, spectators are also able to enjoy the way in which these two characters cultivate their friendship following the antiquated ""letter-box-way"", without any kind of technology. Surely, the beauty of Adam Elliot's 92 minutes comes from the latter perspective.It is intriguing to take part of the 'reading letters' connection between Australia (Mary) and the United States (Max) now that societies have changed their ways of communicating. Perhaps, if they have used Skype or WhatsApp, it would not have been as accurate as it ended being. It is undoubtedly much better the way they imagine the other with letters, pictures and sweets, than sending videos or sharing mobile calls. To put it briefly, this movie is like a book, and if it was made with the latest trends of XXI century, it was going to be like any Netflix series.However, because of the fact that each of them is located in the back of beyond, cinema-goers are under pressure all movie long. Who does not want to see these two weirdos together? It would have been great, would not it? Notwithstanding, despite their unhappy and boring lives (we all have our own problems in this busy world) they find enough time to write and share their stories. Nowadays, the world is full of 'plastic people' and one never know if it is better to share some story with a relative or acquaintance than with someone in the boonies. As it says at the end of the film, ""God gives us our relatives, thank God we can choose our friends."" (Ethel Watts Mumford), which clearly means that sometimes it is even better to choose a stranger because of all the trouble one could receive and save from a closer friend.To conclude, it should be pointed out that plenty of every-day-life personalities are shown during the movie. We all have met, or even are currently dealing with that elderly man or woman, that beggar, the presumptuous lady, the people at the bus station, the typical neighbour, and on and on. They are all pawns in our daily basis â€“ they just seem to be the responsible ones for some of our actions. Despite that, we truly need to concentrate in the ones that make us 'happy' and fulfilled, like it does Max or Mary, because we are all strange and the only thing we need is to find the ones that are ready to jump on the same train â€“ our soul mate.P.S. My rating is 10 out of 10. P.P.S. ""Scent of a Woman"" (1992) was my favourite movie. P.P.P.S. Mary and Max it is now replacing its place.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Quick Review: Mary And Max,"Mary and Max has to be one of the best claymation movies I've seen that wasn't done by a big studio. The Animation is solid, the dialog is smartly written, the drama is rather well done, (most of) the characters are likable, and the story is quite unforgettable. However, the music/soundtrack can get quite repetitive at times, and if you don't like sad movies, Mary and Max might not be for you.Overall: 9/10 Pros: +Great Story with tons of drama that is executed mostly perfect +Smart Writing +Great Characters +Excellent animationCons: -Forgettable soundtrack, with the exception of one song... that has been done time, and time again.If you like claymation movies, check out Mary and Max. However, pass on Mary and Max if you don't like emotional movies (and no, emotional isn't used at all as a subliminal message because it has the word ""emo"" in it).",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A great plot for an animated movie,"A lonely 8 year old girl from Australia, having a life of misery, chooses to send a letter to a 44 year old obese American with anxiety problems, eager to be able to socialize with someone. This way, a very long pen friendship is born that will dramatically change the lives of the two.It's an extensive drama, a story that you can hardly imagine but it's nevertheless inspired from reality. It describes how a simple letter, or succession of them can affect so much a person's life. It's a great movie accompanied by lovely music and a great narrator who's voice will make you feel special. It's sad from the beginning, but the end is the one who carries the most drama. It has some funny moments in contrast with the rest of the plot but unfortunately some boring sequences as well. It will make you think twice about the people you care, about those to whom you've been rude and even about yourself! A superb movie!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A complete and utter delight!!,"Oh, how utterly delightful!! Pen pals...hmmm, this might seem like an odd idea for an animated movie - or film in general for that matter. Yet, thanks to a brilliant script it works so well.As the film progressed - and through writing letters - we learnt more about each character, and I absolutely fell in love with the titular characters. Max is my favorite, and there were times I felt so sorry for him, but his traits were laugh out loud funny! The film features the funniest satirical humor I've seen in a while!The animation is monochromatic brown (which happens to be Mary's favorite color), accentuated only by a bright color - usually red - here and there. This is very unconventional, as most animated films are usually bright and colorful, yet here it works incredibly well and the animation is stunning!I only have praise for this film, and quite simply is one of the most adorable films I've seen. This is a feel-good movie that will have you crying with laughter. It might just be at its funniest where you least expect it! Listen closely to the dialogue; it's hilarious!!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

The Weirdest Pen Pal Story,"It's one of the funniest stopmotion movies I've ever seen. In the normal but absurd way that children see the world and autistic men.It is one of the cutest things you will ever see, with a lot of Darkness underneath if you think about it, but that's just adds to the cuteness. Just so much dark humor and it's just perfectly used.Mary and Max relationship is so beautiful, two outsiders in the own country trying to find friendship in the mail. They are both so funny weird people that it's so interesting to watch.Autism is so well portrayed in this movie. I have seen people like this. I have met people like this. I have autism myself, so I can find some of myself in him. It's just so well done the portrayal. The way he talks, the way he reasons, the way that he reacts to new stimuli, I have friends that are like him but in a less degree.It looks good. It has a strong art style with the colors and lack of Colors. And good directions with good camera angle so it's does not feels stail.My biggest problem with the movie, is the music reuse is kind of insane. I will promise you it will get on your nerves one hour in.It's such a good wholesome story that is not afraid to be completely dark. Absolute recommend.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Unusual friendship,"Ultimately, Mary and Max is about correspondence and lack of correspondence, about how our images and fantasies about others fail to match up to what they are like, and about the constitutive gaps and misfirings in any communicational practice.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Importance of friendship,"First of all, I recommend this movie very much. I liked the style of the animation, an ugly world with ugly people around, which is very appropriate with the content. I liked the comedy part, it was just enough and appropriate. I loved the drama part, which made me cry and understand the importance of friendships. It was a great movie and I think everyone must see it!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Darkly humorous yet heartwarming tale about two struggling souls,"A movie such as this one is a rare treat. A completely original - albeit inspired by the director's own life - movie from a first-time feature-length director that completely blows you away with its uniqueness, wit and charm. Mary and Max tells the story of its titular characters. Mary being a lonely Australian girl living with her two dysfunctional parents. One of them an alcoholic and the other a complete shut-in practically living in the backyard shed. One day Mary, on a childish whim, decides to write to a random American person. Except that the person on the other side decides to write back. He's Max, an obese forty-something man living alone in New York and suffering from crippling mental health problems.Sound creepy and depressing? Yeah, it does. And yet the thing is, this is one of the most heartwarming and sympathetic movies I've seen in my life. It's also one of the funniest. It is said that something cannot be funny without someone suffering. And boy is that true here. The film's humour is amazingly dark, drawing most of its laughs from the sheer dysfunctionality of its characters and their feeble attempts at improving their lot in life.And yet... yet it is never mean spirited. Mary and Max suffer, that much is true, but they very rarely let it get to them. And when they do, it's a genuinely sorrowful moment because at that point it's more than earned. And thus the movie is about living your life and finding happiness despite everything standing in your way. It's about individuality, about human worth, about friendship and the purpose of caring.It's also phenomenally well-made. It's stop-motion clay animation from start to finish with heavy emphasis being put on the use of colour, facial animation and stuff actually being there. And it looks gorgeous. A true testament to the strength of craftsmanship in this age of computer effects.Mary and Max is a true masterpiece. A film juggling both light and dark, examining both the best and worse qualities of human existence, all with a kind voice and a gentle laugh. A film no one's going to regret seeing.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Sad and Touching,"Years ago I had a chance to watch a dubbed version in Persian language. It was so touching that I watched it again the very same night.Later I watched English version too, it was great, but I liked the Persian dubbed version more. The dubbed version was so sad, probably the saddest movie I have ever seen.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Oh dear Lord, what on Earth is wrong with you.","I don't know wheteher or not I want to commit suicide right now. Not sure whether I should give it 1 star, 5 stars or 10 stars. Seems like they ticked all the boses or thought of everything that would trigger every bad reaction. . If you're stable then give this movie a shot. If you think you might have some issues -- stay the hell away from this film!!!!!",,Anonymous,Animation
"Humbly brilliant, with a sense of humor not all people would get.","Mary and Max is a surprisingly funny movie, though I would understand that some people might find its straightforward humor offensive. There may be references to ""poo"" and some dark scenes of a slightly gruesome nature, but they are merely symbols of the honesty and transparency of the natures of the main characters. The people who are offended by the movie's humor are most likely also the very ""normal"" characters who reject the strange natures of Max and Mary in the movie.It is a simple, touching story between the unusual friendship of young Mary and middle-aged Max, who in their confusion of the social taboos that bewilder them in their everyday lives, find a common solace in each others' letters. The film does not aspire to be grandiose any more than it should, which some people have mentioned they found boring. But the mood is only fitting for the message it wants to convey. Max and Mary, after all, are not the stereotypically ""exciting"" characters one would normally encounter. They are actually quite boring in the real-life standards the usual person would have. But the emphasis of the movie is how these two average, ""boring"" people could share something so special and personal that not even many ""exciting"" people experience.Overall, it is an emotionally refreshing movie, with animations that are well-done and music that is very sweet. It is not something that many people would understand because it takes a deal of empathy in understanding an introverted shy child and a lonely man with Asperger's, but those who live up to the challenge will find a rare, maybe even tearful, treat.",,Anonymous,Animation
bitter revelation,"simple story of pen friends. nothing new. all - touching. one of animation who impress for the status of revelation. about small things, ordinary people, different nuances of humor, delicate manner to present the contact and the links, the solitude and the joy to discover the other, the pain and the insignificant aspects of every day life in different light. it is a special animation. for the bitter flavor, for the oasis of optimism, for the particularities of dialogue, for the revelations about the existence of two so different, at the first sigh, worlds. in same measure, it is one of the most useful films. for the art to reflect the social crisis, the atmosphere of a period, the innocence as precious value. the delicacy of friendship. and, maybe, a nice alternative to the internet communication. it is warm and touching and impressive and seductive. it is a bitter revelation.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Claymation fantasy, long distance pen pals.","I don't recall why I looked up this particular movie, it is now 10 years old, but I found the DVD at my public library. My wife and I watched it at home.It is a fantasy story told with claymation. It is 1976 and a little girl in Australia named Mary is depressed and has no friends. One day she is in a library and decides to look into a phone book from the USA, as her mother pulls her away she accidentally tears off a section of one page. Later she notices one name in particular and in her 8-yr-old way writes him a letter.The man who gets the letter is 40-something Max, he too has no friends. He is obese, loves chocolate bar hot dogs, and sometimes little things upset him greatly. Eventually it becomes clear he has Aspergers and seldom knows how to interact with others. But he gets to his old typewriter and writes back to little Mary.Toni Collette voices the growing up Mary Daisy Dinkle and now deceased Philip Seymour Hoffman voices Max Jerry Horovitz. Both are very good, particularly so Hoffman. The story continues for at least 15 to 20 years for Mary to grow up, go to college, write a thesis on Max's affliction, and publish a book.The movie is not all fun, in fact it has some dark aspects to it, but in the end is a statement on relationships and how two strangers can often reach out to each other and something good can come of it.I enjoyed it more than I thought I would.",,Anonymous,Animation
