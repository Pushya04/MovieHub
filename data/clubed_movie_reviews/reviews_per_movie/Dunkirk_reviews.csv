Capturing the spirit,"For a teenager today, Dunkirk must seem even more distant than the Boer War did to my generation growing up just after WW2. For some, Christopher Nolan's film may be the most they will know about the event.But it's enough in some ways because even if it doesn't show everything that happened, maybe it goes as close as a film could to letting you know how it felt.""Dunkirk"" focuses on a number of characters who are inside the event, living it minute by minute.Tommy, the soldier at the centre of the story, seems at first glance to be the antithesis of the Dunkirk legend. Maybe he fits a New Millennium sensibility rather than a 1940's one, more like a contestant on ""Survivor"". He does show initiative, but a soldier who throws away his weapon then ""helps"" wounded to the rear risked a court martial in every army from the Roman Legions on. The lines of stoic soldiers waiting patiently on the beach, the enduring image of the evacuation, seem almost like a backdrop as Tommy and his mate run through them.The man who embodies the spirit to the full is Dawson, the civilian captain of the Moonstone. He is the sort of man who wins wars; the bloke who sticks to the task when others buckle under pressure; ""There's no hiding from this thing son,"" he says to an officer whose nerve has cracked, all the while steering his little boat towards Dunkirk.The scenes of aerial combat look so real it makes all other depictions pale in comparison. Peter Jackson once planned to do a remake of ""The Dam Busters"", but possibly Christopher Nolan would add another dimension to the retelling.
The brilliant special effects serve the story. Much of the panorama of Dunkirk is glimpsed almost incidentally from the cockpit of fighter planes or by men struggling in the water.There are surprises for anyone who thinks they know the story or have seen documentaries or other recreations of the event; it's very different to the crowded Dunkirk of ""Atonement"".An unsettling score helps heighten the tension in a film that has you holding your breath in scene after scene.This is a film that demands more than one viewing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
A technical masterpiece that is nearly devoid of palpable emotion and compelling characters.,"Might as well get right to it, then. At the risk of sounding like a contrarian, I did not love this film. Do I love elements of this? Yes. Is this a 5-star masterpiece? Unfortunately, no.The cinematography here at least, is masterful. Director Christopher Nolan has, without a doubt, reached the pinnacle of on-screen spectacle here. The feats of practical effects in this film are breathtaking. The casting of nearly 6,000 extras, authentic WWII vehicles, and shooting on location in Dunkirk, France contribute to a great sense of scale here. There is ongoing trend of action films in recent years of relying on CGI, and thankfully Nolan bucks that trend.Similar to War for the Planet of the Apes, much of the film plays out without much dialogue, leaning on just the score and sound design in most scenes. It almost goes without saying that Hans Zimmer delivers with another incredible score. The sound design is also extremely well crafted, which, paired with Nolan's great work behind the camera, truly transports you to the Battle of Dunkirk. The wailing of planes passing above, the drone of gunfire, and the roar of explosions all contribute to the complete immersion into the world these characters are trapped in. This results in some of the most immersive wartime action scenes since Saving Private Ryan.This film has and will continue to be compared to World War II classic Saving Private Ryan. Both films are beautifully filmed WWII period pieces with casts that deliver great performances. The similarities end there. Whereas Saving Private Ryan was engrossing as a narrative due to it's characters with depth and arcs, Dunkirk instead leans on it's subject matter and spectacle.And while the subject matter of Dunkirk is fascinating, as a film it lacks emotional firepower due to the absence of a strongly written protagonist. This is strangely uncharacteristic of a director of Nolan's caliber, especially when you recall the complex character work in his most acclaimed films: The Dark Knight, Memento, and The Prestige. Instead of focusing on a single character or single group of characters, the focus is spread across three protagonists in completely different situations. Showing the Dunkirk Evacuation through the three different perspectives of those on the beach, the sea, and the air is only an interesting proposition on paper. The narrative, due to this writing choice, is spread far too thin, with few characters getting enough screen time to develop even the mildest emotional connection.While the characters in this film aren't written to even remotely be compelling, the great work from this cast is not to be overlooked. Harry Styles, known for being a member of English boy band One Direction, is surprisingly excellent here in his acting debut. Mark Rylance, Kenneth Branagh, and Fionn Whitehead also all give standout performances despite the limited screen time they are given.I should love this film. Historical drama? WWII setting? My favorite director Christopher Nolan? Amazing cinematography? Superb performances from an ensemble cast? All of these elements made me sure I would love this going in. But, Dunkirk's lack of emotional connection severely detracts from the awe-inspiring scope and technical prowess displayed.If I reviewed based on visuals alone, this is a slam-dunk, walk-off home run of a 5-star film. While a focus on grandeur and situation over character depth and emotion may work for some (it obviously worked for 98% of critics on Rotten Tomatoes), it did not work for this critic.This is without a doubt a cinematic achievement, but without an emotional core, it's impossible for this film not to feel cold and empty. Despite being a technical masterpiece, this is Christopher Nolan's most disappointing film yet.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"A tough, tough film to watch...and an amazing film was well.","Before you decide to watch ""Dunkirk"" I have a bit of a warning. While you would expect death and blood in a war film, some of the scenes in the film are amazingly tough to watch. There's actually very little blood, but there are some drowning scenes which are intense and awful. Now I am not saying don't watch it...just be prepared.The story is a retelling of the escape of the British* from the beaches of Dunkirk. The German army was coming and the combined British and French forces were trapped with little apparent chance to escape. And, as an army of over 300,000 Brits dug in and waited, the Luftwaffe began chipping away at them....and ultimately would have killed and/or captured them all if it wasn't for a rag-tag flotilla of private boats which hastily arrived and spirited away about 80-90% of the men.By the way, early in the film you hear someone speaking to the pilot (Tom Hardy) over the radio. The voice is that of Michael Caine....an odd and brief cameo.The story is gripping, well told and brilliant. I have only one complaint, and I am surprised it made it to the film considering how amazing a director Christopher Nolan is. At one point, the scene switches between some men in a boat being attacked and a private yacht rescuing downed pilots. The scenes kept switching back and forth....but one was clearly at night and the other clearly was in daylight. This really didn't make any sense. Still, otherwise an amazing spectacle...a truly amazing war film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"A short review with a longer explanation of why its OK that this movie didn't have any ""characters""","Dunkirk is, in my opinion, yet another masterpiece from mastermind Christopher Nolan. Since everything that is brilliant about the film has already been said I will briefly write what I think of the film and also touch on a topic that some people are criticizing the movie for.The fantastically directed film is told from 3 perspectives non chronologically. It superbly tackles the narrative and the non linear story doesn't at all pull you away from the intensity of the events happening on screen that don't stop from 00:00 to the last scene. Hans Zimmer most likely gives one of the most fitting scores for a war film ever. Sometimes there is only one note playing followed by heartbeat sounds and a ticking clock while other times a massive orchestra is interpreting what is going on on screen. The movie brilliantly projects the feeling of each and every soldier on the beach to the audience. Confusion, turmoil and fear. The cinematography was breathtaking and I felt anxious throughout most of the run time. There is no lead in this film and I can't really say anyone stuck out as giving a brilliant performance because it wasn't needed and I'll explain why.The biggest criticisms of Dunkirk that I've heard of so far are that the characters are lacking in depth and that we aren't given anything to be invested in them. I feel like Nolan was trying (successfully) to make the audience care for each and every one of the men on the beach. He needed to have some form of ""main characters"" to be in the story so that we can see the events unfold from the direct perspective of all of the soldiers. Usually in war films (I'll use saving private Ryan as an example) the plot revolves around certain soldiers (like Cpt. Miller and Ryan) being in a war and doing things in the war but its still about THEM not THE WAR as much. In my opinion Dunkirk is a telling the STORY OF DUNKIRK. Not of Harry Style's character or Tom Hardy's character but of Dunkirk. What any of the ""main characters"" felt, every other soldier felt. Nolan resorted more to film-making techniques to tell the story rather than dialogue and that is why some people might have had a problem with the lack of character depth but realistically this type of terrible event wouldn't be a place for someone to ""develop"" as a character but rather a event where MEN WANTED ONLY SURVIVAL, and Nolan showed that perfectly. As for what the top review of Dunkirk on IMDb says about 'lack of emotion' in the film, I believe this to be a completely incorrect statement. Maybe he was referring to the lack of 'brotherhood amongst men' or the feeling of moral or something epic like that. Again the longing for the 'Saving Private Ryan' format of war films. What the reviewer fails to see is that realistically there was NO emotion on that beach besides fear and confusion. And I can safely say that Nolan and Zimmer and the DP all successfully gave us those feelings.9.5/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"All these bad reviews are a reflection of current media consumption trends and the attention span of the average consumer, not the movie itself","I guess I shouldn't be surprised how many people don't like this movie in an era of CGI, reboots, remakes, sequels, prequels, and generally easy to digest movies/tv shows. This is a real Christopher Nolan movie, not a Batman, but a real Christopher Nolan movie like Memento or Prestige. Watch it a few times. Pay attention to the details. Appreciate the sensory experience.Most of these bad reviews are because the person watched it once and was upset they weren't spoon fed every aspect of the characters and story. There is a ton of characterization and a great story but you have to pay attention.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"Unapologetically, I can say this is one of the best war movies ever made","If you read through the swarm of negative reviews, you might notice a common theme: boring, dull, lack of characters. It's incredibly disappointing that they seemed the miss the entire point of the film.This is not a film about heroic soldiers triumphing against all odds while blowing up Nazis with transformer-esque explosions.This is a movie about scenes, not characters. -and every scene is memorable, from the bombings to the torpedoes to the aerial dogfights. My co-worker, who is obsessed with WW2 planes, noted how incredibly perfect they got the British Supermarine Spitfire from the roar of the Rolls-Royce engine to the rattle of the components in the cabin. The accuracy and intensity of the dogfight was captured perfectly as well, mimicking the aerial maneuvers, firepower and damage in a realistic and dramatic fashion. The torpedoes noticed only moments before impact with it's slow monotonous movement sent chills of realization down my spine. Even in the beginning of the film, the way in which the Nazi leaflets were presented gave you some glimpse into the panic and anxiety felt by those soldiers.I felt the ""lack of characters"" was realistic and served the film as well. War is not about larger-than-life personalities with specialized weapons being bad-asses. It's about nameless and faceless soldiers facing an existential crisis, the possibility of randomized death, and how they can either respond with despair or hope.If you want characters you can root for and a happy ending where the bad guy in vanquished, then there are plenty of movies for you. But if you want a small glimpse into the despair, anxiety, hope, courage, and will of the British WW2 fighters then there is no better film ever made than this one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Micro as opposed to macro version of the battle,"Saw an early screening tonight in Denver.I don't know where to begin. So I will start at the weakest link. The acting. Still great, but any passable actor could have been given any of the major roles and done a great job. I know almost no more about the battle of Dunkirk after seeing the film than I did before, and I am not exactly a WWII historian. Truth be told, I learned all I know about the battle of Dunkirk from the movie poster. Does that weaken the film? Hell no, this is a film about survival. The opening scene tells it all and sets the stage as we get our first glimpse into a young soldier's need to stay alive, and his creative attempts to do so. That actor may even be considered the main character of the film. More words have been written so far in this review than he speaks. And I have no clue who the actor in that role is. It is humorous that Tom Hardy looks like Bane through most the film in the role of a pilot wearing an oxygen mask throughout. Kenneth Branagh is the only officer with any lines in the film, so that should give you an idea of the POV that we experience. We are the enlisted man trying to find a way to stay alive in a chaotic and harrowing battle. Though I believe Dunkirk will win every single technical Oscar, I would be surprised if it has any acting nominations at all.How does Nolan elevate this above other films of a similar nature? I think he says it best himself, when he describes Dunkirk as a thriller more than a war film. He pulls that off superbly.When a ship starts to take in water as numerous bullets penetrate its hull, I wanted to jump out of my seat and cover up the holes myself.The film has three separate stories that are titled Mole, Sea and Air. And we all know where Moles live. The way the narratives of the three stories unfold and how they are all tied together is what makes the film a masterpiece. Much has been said about Nolan using IMAX film cameras and how the film is enriched by this. I don't know. I doubt I saw actual film being projected at my screening. Every frame looked terrific though.So what is the most superlative aspect of the film? Gotta be the soundtrack. Hans Zimmer will win the Oscar for this without a doubt. So , so brilliant. This is not a soundtrack that I would buy at the store and play on my stereo. This is a soundtrack that weaves throughout the three narratives seamlessly and creates this phenomenal sense of tension. There are times when a two or three minute tense orchestral passage plays continuously as the story shifts from the ground to the sea then to the air and the music draws the three stories together. Zimmer's soundtrack reminds me of the way that Bernard Hermann's work was so vitally important in building suspense in most Hitchcock films. Though that description almost sells Zimmer short. His soundtrack is that good.I don't think this is a film that will retain even half of its strength in your home theater. No folks, this is a film that you cough up for an overpriced IMAX ticket and rationalize it by knowing that experiencing Dunkirk in any other fashion will just not cut it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
An absolutely outstanding depiction of a truly horrific event.,"I am always relatively confident that I'll enjoy the work of Christopher Nolan based off his pretty decent track record, however this gripping re-imagining of one of the darkest moments of World War II stands as not only some of Nolan's greatest work but one of the greatest war films I have ever experienced.Dunkirk does not necessarily tell the story of any one particular character, but rather adopts the event itself as the films vehicle, resulting in an experience which uses its characters to portray the event rather than the event to portray its characters. This is presented through scenes taking place at different stages of the evacuation across the land, air and sea, creating a distinctive setting for each, but culminating in the same final conclusion. This being said despite Dunkirk's focus not necessarily being its characters, I did not find a single character performance in this film lacking or inconsistent with the tone or setting presented technically. In particular Cillian Murphy, Mark Rylance and debut actor Fionn Whitehead gave especially memorable performances consistent with the striking spectacle Nolan presents.As is expected with Christopher Nolan's films the visual presentation in Dunkirk has few rivals, the set pieces are outstanding with the use of breathtaking establishing shots to highlight the true historical scale of the real life evacuation. Action is presented in a smooth focused manner utilizing a few precise shots rather than an explosion of two second jump cuts we have come to expect in modern day action movies. There are multiple sequences which portray the pure fear, claustrophobia and disorder present in those final weeks of the evacuation and it is this ever present tension that will keep you engaged for the entirety of the run-time.However it is the sound design which truly made this production a masterpiece for me, delivering one of the most realistic representations of the terrifying sounds of War. Gunfire had a distinctly different tone to other films, being delivered with sharp crack, explosions where accompanied by a deep base and the famous 'Jericho Trumpet' made by the Stuka's presence be constantly reminded and portrayed the sense of helplessness present at Dunkirk perfectly.This is only enhanced by Hans Zimmer's excellent soundtrack embedded across the entirety of the film. Alongside Inception, Dunkirk showcases the exceptional talent Nolan & Zimmer have for combining meaningful score with striking imagery to create a distinctive emotional response from their audience. Through the skillful incorporation of an ever presenting droning base, screeching guitar strings and ticking timepiece the continual sense of urgency and dread felt by those both on land and sea is enforced across the entire film by this excellent soundscape. As a result I highly recommend that should you be given the chance you experience Dunkirk for the first time on the big screen, as the combination of a cinema screen and encapsulating surround sound will leave you with a truly memorable experience.Even though this is a film a majority will go into undoubtedly knowing the final conclusion, Dunkirk is an experience I highly recommend everyone consider, presenting a defining moment of modern history in one of the most technically accomplished and memorably striking ways, Dunkirk will undoubtedly go down as a hallmark in film-making for many years to come.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"Maybe 7,5/10  but not more","I love Christofer Nolan. Great director. Great movies. No doubt about that. But unfortunately I think the movie was boring. It had awesome fight scenes, with different camera angles, music, costumes but it did not keep you at the edge of your seat like his other movies.Almost no dialogue. You can say that it is realistic, because it is a war scene but the viewer needs to know something about the characters in order to identify with them. I felt like I was watching on youtube different war scenes in a 2 hours movie. It did not create the suspense I was hoping.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

"Hipsterish affectation of an ""artistic"" war movie.","This movie is so paper thin I really can't write much about it. So many missed opportunities in a film about one of the most spectacular and complex battles of WWII. I can see what Nolan tried to do here, a kind of British ""Thin Red Line"" (there's even wind in the grass, lol, i kid you not), but he failed spectacularly. There are no memorable characters to be found here, and one wonders even if there are any actual characters at all. Not one, not one of them has any semblance of a character arc. Not one. Again, I see how Nolan tried to convey the impersonality of war and insignificance of the individual but he did it with such a heavy, clumsy hand, providing us with no counterpoint with which to drive the point home. It's basic screen writing stuff really. I'd expect such ineptitude from a first year film student but not from a supposed ""master of the craft"".But anyways, this could have been forgivable if the film was more about the event itself, but it fails at that too. After watching the film, you'd be given to believe that the Battle of Dunkirk was fought by three Spitfires (100 were lost over the beeches alone), 1 German heinkel, a couple of stukas, 2 destroyers or a dozen or so boats... Oh yes and maybe a few hundred men standing quietly on a beach, doing nothing except desperately trying to look morose and dejected in a faintly passive-aggressive way. It's ridiculous. We are talking about total and absolute chaos happening there, hundreds of thousands of rifles alone discarded on the beach, not to mention guns, artillery, trucks... Burning and sinking ships of all sizes all across the horizon, parts of beaches inaccessible from rotting corpses washing up with tides. This was actually way bigger than D-Day landings in terms of men and equipment stuffed in a very small patch of land. Half a million desperate men stuffed in a small town, bombarded incessantly and under constant attack from bombers. Where did all those people defecate, what did they eat ffs? I wanted to know that, really. That at least would have given some much needed humanity to the so-called-characters Nolan keeps yanking around like so much puppets. So many missed opportunities there...If Nolan wanted to do a tight little film about isolation and desperation of being on the loosing side of the war, he had plenty of other places and battles to choose from. Just ask around. Or if he simply had to insist on Dunkirk, then we should have seen this total chaos all around our protagonists, in the background at least - that would have served as a really powerful, so desperately needed counterpoint to the individual suffering and heroism.And this brings me to the final point. The movie is one tone only. A monotone repetition of sights and emotions we've seen and experienced before. No one cracks a joke. No one really breaks down. No one has an embarrassing moment. There are no ups and downs, it's just some morose faceless robots performing obvious actions leading towards a bleedingly obvious goal. One single emotional and narrative tone from the beginning to the end. The entire emotional and narrative content of the movie would have fit snugly into a 20 minute short, and that is pretty much how long it takes before you start yawning. The best thing that can be said about the movie is that individual scenes are well directed and worth experiencing. But that is the real problem here - the film is constructed as a series of impressive ""experiences"" rather than cohesive piece of drama (And this particular historical event is almost uniquely stuffed with dramatic opportunities. It's almost as if golden-age Hollywood writers wrote the script for the actual event.) In other words, it's a Dunkirk theme park rather than a movie. You take rides. And that's it. And even those become repetitive after a while.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"Christopher Nolan created an impressive blockbuster on World War 2, with the focus on survival.","The most important lesson in the history of our humanity, surpassed in genre, religion among other moral aspects, is simply the survival of the species or a human being in question. Our most basic instinct is survival and when we unite, forgetting our differences (as a group of Individuals, not nations), for the sake of our survival and our well-being, the human race shines in the most intense sense possible. The cooperation between several elements, to come out alive from a complicated situation.One scene, caught my attention when a group of Allied soldiers were surrounded in a ship and this same ship was being attacked on all sides by the German troops. One of the characters was being forced out of the ship to see if the tide sea was rising or not. Out of fear, this character did not want to leave the ship, it was when an English soldier replied: for the others to survive, one person has to die.The theme of this film is survival, especially surviving in a difficult situation, is in itself a great victoryNothing is better expressed in this film and executed in a way with as much talent as Nolan achieved in making with this film. Not only by itself, the message is passed to the audience in a clear and perfect way as is demonstrated in small scenes that help convey this message and build a fitting end to the film itself.The film goes straight to the narrative and action of the movie without losing in passing with interesting monologues, unlike Inception, a film in which Nolan himself created a character with the sole purpose of explaining the rules of this universe for the audience, this is the apex of Nolan as a Film director and he performs his work in a simple and exemplary way. So Dunkirk is his smaller commercial movie, but with the bonus without unnecessary scenes that could crumble the experience of the film.The performances are excellent and accompany the director's talents (the direction of the film itself) and the script in a cohesive, simple and direct way, highlighting Fionn Whitehead, Mark Rylance and of course the very competent Kenneth Branagh. These excellent actors help immerse the audience in the cinematographic aspect of the movie itself to make the experience as real and emotional as possible.Again, congratulations to Nolan for choosing actors relatively unknown to the general public, but outstanding in their work of acting. Instead of trying to choose famous actors (whose private lives are always in the mouths of the people and the magazines), these people are celebrities and not actors. For this reason I never managed to pass the first act of Saving Private Ryan. Spielberg made a mistake filling his film with the most popular Hollywood All Star cast of famous actors at that time (their lives were so exposed that it was hard to see those people as soldiers or survivors of WWII). At this point, Nolan fared better than Spielberg.By completing this great experience, special and sound effects are applied in an exemplary way and these same technologies make almost perfect use of the IMAX screen. The technical and aesthetic aspects are very good, as it comes this habit in this type of film with this type of budget (105 millions). The cinematography is very good (almost perfect, like in most of Nolan movies) and the camera movements are agile and very beautiful.See the aerial combat of the characters of Tom Hardy (Farrier) and Jack Lowden (Collins) in aerial planes that looked with great and amazing beauty in fighting against the planes of the Germans. A technical amazing work of Nolan and his production team. Amazing, no doubt. Especially on the IMAX screen, where the film shows all its beauty, and if there is a movie that deserves to be seen in IMAX, it is one, this new work of Christopher Nolan, no doubt. The ambitious ideas of the filmmaker and the great sequences in parallel assembly that characterize his works. Making the storytelling move to viewers in three different locations (The Mole, The Sea and The Air). In a cohesive, precise and confusing way. This film shows a great talent of Nolan, and it reaches his talent to create sequences in parallel assembly the characters of the film in a brilliant way. The soundtrack composed by the veteran Hans Zimmer is amazing, Hans in turn creates a memorable theme for the theme of World War II. Fantastic and great.The great and only problem I see that disturbs the experience of the film is limited by the PG-13 and thus limit the blood and violence, for God's sake, it is a film about a war blood and violence are common. At times it seemed like I was looking at some scenes and these same scenes seemed so artificial and displaced from the film itself, like the scene of the soldiers corpses coming to the beach, or the English troops being smashed by the sinking ship (two clear examples that PG-13 influenced negatively the movie).One problem that some people go through seeing this movie is the lack of depth in some characters, however there are characters with depth, but not the kind of depth shown through dialogues or exposition. Nolan wanted to show something bigger. And I think Nolan did it. Nolan created in this movie to show the question of survival and its consequences in the lives of the people close to war and the soldiers who were fighting in that war. He wanted to show us how and survival define us, and I think he got the message very well across this movie. Even for this, he sacrificed some dramatic depth. Depth for certain characters, however Nolan passed a larger message, which surpasses any dramatically deep element. Nolan wanted to get something bigger. And in my opinion he did it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"Virtual Experience of war, chaos, horror and hope","From a different viewpoint as this author walked down 101 floors of the South Tower on September 11. Worked for Aon and came away with not PTSD or dust-health problems (I was far uptown when the towers came down). So as I sat watching Dunkirk, the cummulative effect was to virtually relive aspects of THAT day for me. It's impossible to describe horror, fear and what it was like to BE there, or BE at Dunkirk. Many films and books (fondly MRS. MINIVER was the first). Or the heroic dogfights of BATTLE OF Britain. This one - far different. I came out of the theater feeling that I had just been through not only Dunkirk but 9-11 as well. It is THAT effective. The lack of dialogue for a good part of the film draws the viewer INTO the story as a real participant. YOU'RE THERE. Spielberg did it a few times such as the 20 minute Omaha Beach segment of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN but even that film became just a more intense version of the standard war film.Be prepared to have your life changed by this one.

"Straightforward And Gritty, But To Me It Missed The Mark Just A Bit","Director Christopher Nolan offers the viewer a pretty straightforward re-telling of the evacuation of British soldiers from the French port of Dunkirk in May of 1940, as the Germans encircled the town. The story is told from a strictly British perspective. Although we see some German planes involved in battles with RAF fighters as far as I can recall there isn't a single glimpse of a German soldier anywhere. Nolan then tells the story from three perspectives within that British perspective: on the land, on the sea and in the air. The land focuses on the solders awaiting rescue, the sea focuses mostly on the small private boats that made such a huge contribution to the effort (focusing on one boat in particular) and the air focuses on the battle by a small number of RAF pilots to protect their compatriots beneath against German planes. That structure was a bit confusing at first (especially as it was captioned on screen) but the story makes sense and that odd narrative structure is only a brief distraction.There's not really a main character involved in this. The point seems to have been to portray the breadth of the Dunkirk evacuation at the expense of character depth. There's also no one moment that seems truly central, which means that the movie strikes you in the end of not really having built up to anything (aside from the actual evacuation, which admittedly is the most important thing.) But in some respects that made this movie seem at times less of a drama and more of a docu-drama if that makes any sense. The story-telling was a little bit lacking. I did appreciate that while the heroism of the British soldiers was front and centre, there was no shying away from a few more negative portrayals - shell-shocked soldiers, soldiers who just didn't want to fight anymore, soldiers who wouldn't even help their French allies. In that sense, this had a somewhat gritty feel, as befits a war movie.It's not a bad movie. To me, it just missed the mark a little bit in terms of what I was expecting.

An exquisite film.,"Awards will follow.How often can any of us say that a film lives with us for days, I've not been able to add that tag to anything I've seen in years. Within the first few moments of this film I knew this was going to be such a film. Most of us will know the incredible Dunkirk story, the fear many would have had I think would have been that the story was sensationalised, or lacking the real essence. All you can say is Christopher Nolan has once again shown his genius, this film is a masterpiece. You have no choice but to feel raw emotion as you watch, feelings of despair, hope, anger, fear, terror, you will feel exhausted having watched this film.The acting is impeccable, every single member of the cast performs to an incredible standard (maybe Harry Styles's character will irritate one or two,) Mark Rylance is utterly sensational, as is Kenneth Branagh, the scene where his character looks up and sees the fishing boats arrive is one of the most moving in the filmThe camera-work is astonishing, as is the music, which for me was one of the most powerful elements of the film, it built tension to enormous degrees.There is a realism in this film which I find quite incredible, at times it's so difficult to watch, it brought elements to life I hadn't even thought of.

Just Never Grabbed Me,"I would concur with many that the film was overhyped. Nevertheless, to give something as breathtaking in its cinematic efforts a one or two is ridiculous. I guess people who are into war film are not unlike the fanboys in the Marvel world. This is an intense film. I'll admit that if I had to depend on it to explain the actual events of the Dunkirk rescue, I would say it was lacking. It's no ""Tora Tora Tora"" or ""The Longest Day"" which depict the breadth of the subject of war. It focuses more on fragile individuals who are more realistic. One reviewer referred to two of the men as cowards, doing whatever they could to stay alive. As if those who were trapped by the Germans wouldn't do whatever they could to stay alive. Yes, there is a bit of tackiness. These are fictional characters. There's lots of heroism to go around. There is cowardice. This is war and war is not desirable.

Utterly underwhelming as a piece of storytelling and a piece of entertainment,"I cannot tell you how disappointed I was with this film, being a fan of about everything Christopher Nolan does.There were 2 ways the story of Dunkirk could be told:1.An epic which showed broadly the scale of the operation, the death toll and the effect on the war.2. Follow a group of characters and experience the story through their eyes as they go through it all.It attempts the latter and falls short in a big way. Paper thin characters across the board left me completely disinterested in the story. Even Tom Hardy failed to evoke an emotion. What were his character traits? I couldn't name one except the obvious bravery.The effects are seamless, I will give it that, but the quantities of everything are somewhat baffling. I think I saw less than 10 aircraft in the whole movie, yet dive bombing is largely the focus of the film. Did they run out of budget?I think I watched a different film to the other reviewers.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Put Down the Kool-Aid,"Given the outright gushing of critics in praising this film, I was quite surprised to discover Dunkirk to be not only not deserving of such praise, but even worse, to be a cacophony of minimalist nonsense, topped off by one of the most ridiculous film climaxes in recent memory (more on that later). ""Possibly the best war film of all time?"" Not quite, I could name dozens better. In fact I struggle to think of many that are worse than this. My goodness, where to begin...First I do not understand where the $150 million budget was spent. The actual story of the Dunkirk evacuation involved - literally - hundreds of thousands of men, and hundreds of boats and planes. In this film, we see....a few hundred men? 30 boats? Something like six planes? Where is the grand scale that a story like Dunkirk deserves, or really, demands? There was no grand scale. That is a heinous omission and oversight and ultimately fails to tell the story of Dunkirk as it should be told. And if you don't want to use CGI to achieve that scale, that's fine, but then either expand the real numbers of extras and props so it replicates what Dunkirk was actually like, or, don't do the film. A few soldiers standing around on the beach looks incredibly silly when the characters say on more than one occasion that there are over 300,000 men there. Where are they? We never saw them. Ludicrous.Similarly, we see a few boats here and there, and a few planes. This does not come close to approximating the flotilla of ships, boats and other watercraft used - in reality over 800. It's hard to appreciate what a tremendous achievement the Dunkirk evacuation was - ultimately, the aim of this film I suspect - when we never actually see that achievement occur. We see a few boats and few planes. Literally a drop in the bucket of what Dunkirk was. Yet at the conclusion, as the men are disembarking, back safe in England, we are supposed to be swept up in a swelling feeling of appreciation for something that we never actually witness. Very bizarre.The soundtrack, if you can call it that, was an escalating collection of random and intrusive blaring instruments that can be best described as 'noise.' I have no idea what the goal was there. Perhaps it was an attempt to convey what one might feel, the intense experience one might have, if he or she was in a war-time situation like this. Perhaps. A professional critic called it 'bombastic' and that's probably being generous. I am not lying when I tell you I had to take an Advil when I got back from the theater, thanks to the crazily escalating noise that overwhelms the latter part of the film. Yikes.As for the climax, the scene of a Spitfire seemingly free of the laws of physics and gravity is bereft of all logic, and was such an eye-rolling piece of nonsense, no amount of criticism on my part can do it justice. Let's just say planes cannot keep flying indefinitely, much less maneuver and successfully engage other aircraft, when that plane has run out of fuel. The film deserves to be panned for this ridiculous scene alone.This is not a great war film, it's not even a good war film. It is not typical or traditional story-telling, I will give it that. There are stretches of this film that lack dialogue and there is zero character development. While different, that's hardly unique (it's been done before). Perhaps some critics haven't understood that 'different' does not automatically translate to 'good' or 'great' - sometimes, it does not.Put down the Kool-Aid. As my brother said to me when we walked out of the theater last night, ""Assuming I would like this, I thought I would go see this again over the weekend. Not only am I not doing that now, I won't even bother watching this once it's on cable or Netflix."" True that, bro. 5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
An emotional trip back in time.,"Ever since I was a child, I always felt attracted to history and specially to World War II, which is why I was on he first line to see this movie once it opened on my local cinema.After seen the movie, I have to tell that somehow Dunkirk felt different from all the other movies I have seen related to WWII. It might be the non linear narrative, or the fact that the movie depicts the struggle of more than 300k young soldiers trying to save their lives and by doing so becoming seating ducks to the German army.Even if this event can not be consider a battle victory, because they were fleeing away from he front. It is one of the most inspiring moments of WWII for the English people, were they realized that the impossible can be done and from that moment on, things started to change at least on the psyche of the common people and specially the soldiers.War movies based on real events, are always brutal and they usually leave you with harsh feelings and empathy thoughts about how it really was to be in the character shoes. A must see movie, Mr. Nolan did it again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

A Tense Film That Is Hardly the Average Summer Blockbuster,"Dunkirk marks Christopher Nolan's return to cinema and it is as bombastic as one would hope. Featuring a fractured sense of story telling, a shockingly great performance from Harry Styles and some of the most breathtaking cinematography I've ever witnessed, Dunkirk is without a doubt one of the most solid summer blockbusters in recent memory. Despite all that is perfect with the film, it does suffer from some glaring storytelling issues that, while many may enjoy, I found to be unnecessarily tedious.While many of you will probably hate on me for saying this, I simply have to say it: Christopher Nolan is overrated. There is no other way about it. The man has given us classics but flawed classics, at best. However, Dunkirk is a perfect response to my feelings towards Nolan. The film is extremely fast paced which is something that plagued Nolan since Batman Begins. Here, he is restrained and it pays off quite beautifully especially when you factor in the brilliance that is Hoyte Van Hoytema's outstanding cinematography. The film is big and Hoytema's determination is shown through every frame. He is dedicated to capturing beauty and here is no different. Hoytema serves as a very suitable replacement for Wally Pfister.The film, while being 106 minutes long and probably Nolan's most accessible feature to date, also is very scarce when it comes to dialog and general character development. There are very few characters here that will have you standing and cheering for. I mean, you're going to cheer at moments in the film. It is geared to do just that. But it won't have you gravitating towards Styles, Rylance, Hardy or Murphy. Quite frankly, they all have (with the exception of Styles) minimal screen time. Those looking for a Tom Hardy war movie better think again. This isn't about one soldier, it is about all of the soldiers. No one is more important than the other.Overall, Dunkirk is an exceptional addition to Nolan's impressive filmography. Crafting a unique war film that doesn't rely on overtly patriotic moments to move it forward is hard yet Nolan makes it seem effortless. The film relies on the courage and sheer will power of the human soul and that is something only the rarest of war films can do. Despite some wonky story telling, Dunkirk is nonetheless exhilarating and should absolutely be seen on the big screen.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
A good watch but not true to Dunkirk,"After many great reviews I decided I would go and watch this on the big screen for the atmosphere and in that at lease I have to say it was great. But and it is a big but, for a story I left feeling let down. This is no saving private Ryan or stunning epic as the critics would suggest.I am no history buff and I am from the other side of the world but even I know the story of Dunkirk and this just didn't live up the epic nature of the true story.The characters don't do the story justice, the timelines are blurred and the epic nature is missing. There are some great visual scenes and a few uplifting moments but it just didn't feel tied together.My rating is probably a bit harsh but I just don't rate this a one of the great efforts of story telling. If you didn't know anything of the actual events at Dunkirk this would leave you having missed the epic nature of what was achieved with 700 private boats over 8 days back in 1940.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

Visual and sound masterpiece,"For the naysayers on the depth of the story, the whole point of the movie is so that you can have an immersed experience in the battle scenes told from multiple perspectives.This movie is truly a visual and sound combination masterpiece. In short, it is a masterpiece that brings out the experience.The movie doesn't contain a lot of the dialogues but shows you scenes of realistic battle experiences which allows the movie-goers to taste the experience of the Dunkirk Evacuation.Furthermore, because of Nolan's usage of real world objects such as the real Dunkirk beach, real destroyers, real boats, and real planes, the movie is second to none in terms of its graph effects. Nothing like those cheap CGI-generated movies.In addition, with the combination of sharp sound of planes accentuated by the dark and ominous music composed by Zimmer, this movie is a master piece that shifts one from situation to situation, watching events unfold from multiple perspectives.In addition, without the dialogue, the movie also doesn't lend itself to propaganda. Nothing like the intertwined love story of the Pearl Harbor. In addition, even though it was told from the British side and even though the cast and the movie producers are all British and Irish, the movie is surprisingly unbiased depicting the competency of both German and British soldiers of the time.Due to these reasons, I'd strongly recommend anyone to watch the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Bad Movie. All are paid reviews.,"Let me tell you the truth. This is not a good movie. I really don't know how and why this movie got good Ratings.

This movie could have been much much better if they didn't try to show this in Christopher Nolan Style. In whole movies there is just one thing, They just keep adding new Background music, keep it increasing to make us feel tension.No any story, no character development, no any explanation. Nothing. Just weird things keeps going everywhere.

Very Powerful...,"Christopher Nolan's newest film Dunkirk is a psychologically harrowing war film about one of the terrifying events occurred in history.While it may not be one of his best films, it still is a profound, powerful war film that truly honors the fact based story and event. Nolan crafts this film as if we, the audience is one of the frightened soldiers attended at the tragic yet distressing event that plays at the big screen extensively realistic. Dunkirk does the best job at satisfyingly delivering the frighteningly realistic portrayal of war and the evacuation in the outlook of the soldiers who were desperate at reaching home. What makes Dunkirk one of the best war films and eminently realistic are the production designs which has a usage of substantial boats, planes etc, the impressive performances and the top- notch sound design.Most films especially superhero action flick consistently include large reliance on CGI. It has become the crucial trend in the film industry. Nevertheless, Dunkirk has none of that. It uses practical effects, real-life locations, and substantive components. As a result, when boats sink or planes blow-up, it makes these additionally terrifying and hand-gripping. Dunkirk has some of the best aerial dogfights ever put to screen.Unlike the typical war films, Dunkirk isn't about sympathetic characters whom we know about their history or the amazing, drastic action sequences. This film mainly focuses on the evacuation and the survival throughout these drastically harsh conditions that are far from survival. It shows three directions which are the beach, standpoints at the boats, and the air. These three viewpoints intertwined concentratedly expressing the chances of survival of the 400,000 soldiers stuck at Dunkirk. The sound design was terrifyingly perfect embodying the gunshots, airplanes, and the crashes more resonant and an enhanced viewing experience that was memorable.All of the actors are great. Nolan used plentiful of young actors as the frightened soldiers. The main standouts were Tom Hardy (Farrier), Kenneth Branagh (Commander Bolton) and Mark Rylance (Mr. Dawson). All of these characters appear as the central focuses at the beach, the air, and the boats as they balance these stories. Mr. Dawson appears as one of the civilian vessels marching to help the soldiers. Additionally, Harry Styles (Alex) had an impactful presence along with Fionn Whitehead (Tommy).Overall, Dunkirk is an emotionally impactful and powerful war film about heroism, survival and a deep message that evacuation can be the victory along the supports of civilians. Nolan crafts this film thoroughly realistic, gritty and brutal for a PG-13 rated film. While the characters may not be the strongest, this is about war, the horror of the moment.Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
One more great piece of Nolan,"I'm not fan of movies about war at all, but some days ago I was impressed by The Prestige and wanted to see more Nolan.There are no gory fights or something that will affectedly play on your emotions. However, it held me in suspense the whole screening. Lack of tough story-line did not let me get bored.The story tells us about thousands deadlocked people. So much as wanting back to home, some afraid of conviction and milksop mark.It is not focused on one main person. We can see the situation from different angels, and I liked each.Also, tired of variegated films, my eyes enjoyed color grading and great acting of the cast that surprised me.I like all about this movie, it literally stroke a chord with me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
excellent,"The movie directed by Christopher Nolan and produced by his wife Emma Thomas is extremely well directed. Dunkirk is all about WW2 between may and June , 1940. Excellent Cinematography. Thousands and thousands of soldiers on land, boat at sea and airplanes in air are fascinating to watch. It is amazing how camera-work was perfect . All actors did their part well. All the land events details took place in a week , the ones at sea in a day and all aircraft details in an hour. The scene where aircraft lands on water and is on fire is exquisite.

The British soldiers who fought their way out of France deserve a better movie than this one -- Not Recommended,"Twenty excellent movies could have been made about Dunkirk in WWII. This movie, however, is not excellent; it's not even very good. Two major reasons why:(1) For the important roles of British soldiers, men who in reality fought their way out of France, sacrificing many in combat and enduring tremendous privation, injury, terror, and hardship, the director chose to focus on soldiers who think only of their own survival--certainly there were some men like that in WWII, but it is simply a waste of wonderful and compelling raw material to produce this movie out of all the possible scenarios the director could have chosen.(2) This movie skimped terribly on sets. It was embarrassing to watch a few hundred men on the beach, one or two Royal Navy ships in the water, two British planes in the air, and a handful of civilian boats. This movie does not give an accurate picture of the beaches or the mole.This movie simply does not do justice to the hell on earth that was Dunkirk. I have to wonder why they bothered. I had looked forward to this movie and was very disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Solid war film,"This was not my favorite Christopher Nolan film (that honor goes to Interstellar), but it was a solid movie nonetheless. The movie has a very tense and raw feel to it that made my adrenaline rush throughout. The dialogue is far and few between and there are 3 plots that are intertwined – the land, the sea, and the air. The most entertaining to me was the air. At the end of the movie, I felt the underlying theme that Nolan was portraying was that of ""sacrifice,"" and how heroism (and cowardice) can come out even in the best of us in times of struggle and hopelessness. Hans Zimmer produced a wonderful score we have become accustomed to. He utilized the ""shepherd's tone"" perfectly to build up the gravity of each scene when appropriate. Christopher Nolan once again shows his versatility and ambition in taking on a challenging genre and does an excellent job of formulating a cinematic experience to his own style and pace.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
No soul and void of compelling characters,"I had very high expectations for Christopher Nolan's latest offering as I'm a big fan of his previous work but Dunkirk is the first of his films I really don't care for. For pros I would say the cinematography, sound mixing and soundtrack are excellent but Dunkirk was missing the most important elements for any film; Characters and a story!!I was blown away by the opening scene and thought this would be another masterstroke by Nolan but there are so many problems with it. Apart from the lack of any interesting characters, the script feels so aimless at times and while watching the film I felt like someone was constantly pressing stop and rewinding. I also had a problem with the dialogue. The lines between the characters were very rigid and did not move the plot along. There was very little emotion in Dunkirk and while I did like the soundtrack I thought too much emphasis was placed on trying to convey tension through the music, be it the ticking of the clock or harsh synths building to a crescendo in the background. The strangest thing and most disappointing was that the film feels like it is building to something bigger the whole time like a grand finale but it never arrived.I had no problem with the fact that the story was non-linear but it doesn't matter what pattern the story is laid out in if there are no people at the centre of the story. I really don't understand how the ratings are so high so far because it doesn't deserve the plaudits it's receiving. I expect the rave reviews to continue as film critics don't seem to be able to judge a film for themselves these days.Very disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Fails to capture the grand scale and drama of what happened,"This movie should've been called ""What happened to a handful of men at Dunkirk"" and be labelled a documentary at best and History Channel would've made a much better documentary of it. I guess they tried to go down to a up close view to intensify but it just falls short. It's too slow to captivate, there's too few things happening considered the grand scale of the Dunkirk operations. It feels like a few hundred men were trapped on a beach and a dozen boats that came to rescue them. I can not even begin to describe how disappointed I am in this production, the only relieving factor was it not being longer than 1h 39m otherwise my head would've imploded.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

"Dunkirk"" is the Nolan movie that has touched me the most","Ahh... Nolan. Who doesn't love Christopher Nolan, eh? One of the most acclaimed directors working today, a cinematic genius behind modern classics such as ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy, ""The Prestige"", ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar""... Well, I hate to be a party pooper (as always), but I have never shared the mad love every other movie fan I know has to share for him. I mean, his works are a'ight, but I never found them to be as great as everybody else seemed to think. I guess I liked early Nolan the best – ""Memento"" and especially ""Insomnia"" –, when he was more interested in characters and building suspense than just creating the biggest baddest epics available. Of course, Nolan is good at creating suspense and orchestrating action setpieces, but even his best works ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"" have suffered from being overlong and pompous. Not to mention his third and last Batman which felt like a big pompous piece of crap. Having written all that, I liked ""Dunkirk"" a lot. It's not only one of the finest movies of 2017 (so far), one of the most thoughtful war dramas I've seen, and also Nolan's best yet. Although if you go to cinema expecting his usual, you may well leave disappointed, because this epic World War II tale is quite unlike anything we have come to associate him with. After all these years, it must be supremely difficult to create a war drama with something fresh to show or say. But Nolan is not afraid of challenges, and he has managed to pull off a movie which is both epic and intimate, artsy and mainstream- friendly, adrenaline-filled and deep at the same time. It's what the movie lovers always wait for but rarely get: a thinking man's blockbuster. ""Dunkirk"" shows the experience of war from the another angle rarely seen or thought of, at least in movies. It's about human frailty, loneliness, isolation and enduring the limbo between chaos and salvation that war is made of. Of course, there's also enough explosions and eye-candy, but the whole thing is rather artsy in a good way. Not much dialogue or clearly defined events too, just people waiting (because there's nothing else left for them to do) and trying to survive. There is not even a single clearly-defined central character, although there are several main story lines to follow, sometimes not in chronological form. The story is about thousands of Allied troops surrounded by enemy forces, trapped on the beach and waiting for rescuing. We have some well-known actors here, such as Tom Hardy, Kenneth Branagh and Cillian Murphy, but it's not really an actor's movie (ie, meant to let somebody shine) but fitting everything into a carefully crafted cinematic mosaic. Speaking about war part, I especially loved the flight and air battle scenes. The immediacy, the sound effects. Also the fact that they were often made from pilot's viewpoints, so it feels more realistic. The pilot shoots and we see target plane catching fire only after a while, for example. All in all, Dunkirk"" is the Nolan movie that has touched me the most. It's about real things, emotions and experiences, and the action is thrillng. Another beautiful achievement for one of the most liked and successful auteurs working in mainstream cinema today. Watched it in IMAX which probably add something to the experience, at least from technical standpoint. But it's surely a good looking and sounding movie on any screen or setup, methinks.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Retreat for Victory,"Remember the opening scenes in Spielberg's SAVING PRIVATE RYAN? The Normandy beach landings in June 1944. Explosions on the beach, bullets zipping through the guys in the sea. DUNKIRK offers the same visceral experience of combat, only it lasts for an hour and three quarters. There are a few moments of calm between battles and bombardments, but these are always the preamble to the next grim phase of the conflict.Christopher Nolan has directed some weird movies (MEMENTO, INCEPTION, the DARK KNIGHT Batman trilogy). His only 'weirdness' here is to take three separate time frames – a week for the men on the beach, one day for the flotilla of small craft setting out to rescue them and one hour for the Spitfire pilots fighting the German bombers – and meld them into a fairly seamless narrative that condenses the drama into a solid 90 minutes of nerve-shredding tension. The scenes onboard a sinking mine-sweeper are among the most harrowing depictions of the total horror of war I've seen.There are panoramic CGI shots to show the sheer size of the retreating army (400,000) but the script focuses on one soldier fighting to survive the day (Fionn Whitehead), one fishing boat captain (Mark Rylance) and one RAF pilot (Tom Hardy): these three are used to bring home to us that each of the soldiers and their rescuers had a backstory – a home, a family, a life – that they were laying on the line for their country, their king and their fellow men. A spot-the-celebrity element includes cameo appearances from Harry Styles, Michael Biehl and others whom I failed to identify. Kenneth Branagh and James D'Arcy play naval officers who occasionally veer close to the officers parodied in OH WHAT A LOVEY WAR! – I hope this was intended.DUNKIRK joins the 'pantheon' of all-time great war movies and will surely win awards next winter. I was misty-eyed through much of it – and not just because my dad was one of the soldiers who went to Belgium and didn't come back (I was two years old). There's a temptation to see the 'strategic retreat' from the French coast in 1940 as an awful defeat, when in fact – as this version makes clear – many of the 300,000-plus men who were brought safely home to England returned to Normandy in 1944 to begin the destruction of Hitler's military machine.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Overrated and factually disrespectful,"Some spectacular scenes but overall sloppy and at times annoyingduring the Dunkirk battle , RAF LOST about 90 planes and the Germans almost 400.

All we had was a couple of hundred either lining up on the beach or ducking for cover from the occasional (previously mentioned 10) German planes-other than opening scene , NO land battles. In reality , Dunkirk town was bombed by Germans with 1000 civilian casualtiesTom Hardy runs out of fuel yet not only glides for ages but even manages to shoot another plane down !what was the point in casting Tom Hardy?

Tea and Jam Sandwiches - The Dunkirk Spirit,"I am Dunkirk crazy. I have seen it twice, including the world premier release at 7:15am, where I got a free Dunkirk t-shirt as a first showing promotion for IMAX.The first two viewings were due to booking a later showing which had a relatively poorer seat near the front, so I booked the early morning one with a better seat as I was d e s p e r a t e to see it ASAP.I now have tickets to see it twice more, again on IMAX 70 I just love it so much. So thrilling, so visceral.I was crying, cheering, proud, anxious, relieved: the whole gamut of emotions. I needed oxygen.The splendid soundtrack was almost Metallica on speed with a syncopy similar to a heart rate beating faster and faster. My pulse was off the stratosphere.I did feel a bit nauseous at the hand-held camera jogging along with the guys running across the beach, and although I dare say it is a clever technique and quite deliberate, some of the out-of-focus shots of background forces personnel were annoying.Harry Styles cuts a convincing figure as a young soldier although Fionn Whitehead (pronounced: 'Finn', apparently) steals the show with his serious expression and the guy in the boat in the red jumper, Peter, 'the Captain's son', played by Tom Glynn- Carney, is just so polite, handsome and British, I wanted to hug him - I have a crush! - and his dad, a stubborn irascible Welshman is brilliant with his quiet deadpan determination.It's amazing to discover that this is a 'first movie' for Fionn Whitehead and Tom Glynn-Carney, as well as Harry Styles. What great casting. Fionn comes across as a young glowering Tom Courtney, Harry, a rebellious James Dean/Mick Jagger type and Tom an affable Cliff Richard (as in Summer Holiday).The upper-class airman on the boat sounds like an American trying to put on a posh British accent. It is, in fact, Cillian Murphy, who I found out later, hails from Ireland. It was the way he said, 'Yacht', that gave it away.It was obvious Harry Styles is not RADA trained as his diction is poor and I struggled to understand what he was saying, although I got it (well, almost all of it) the second time round. He over-acted as well, but being a good actor comes with time.The soundtrack goes right through you, you really have to see it at volume 11 with the screen in your face.It is worth the extra five pounds or so to see it on IMAX, so I urge you to see it before it's too late and all you have is the DVD download or the edited TV film with commercial breaks.Take an afternoon or morning off work - the evening sessions are all sold out - and just go see. Even if you have to sit in the front row at the end, beg steal or borrow and see it well.I love this film with all my heart.

Watch the 1959 film for a better understanding of the event,"In 1990 I attended the 50th anniversary celebration of the event.We were fortunate to have veterans in our group who had been at Dunkirk.We went onto the beach and they recounted their experiences.None of them would appear to be similar to those shown in the film.I have to say that till I read some of the reviews that I realised that the action is non linear and some is repeated.Maybe that explains why the Spitfires kept on firing when in fact they only had 9 seconds worth of ammunition.In any event there were few RAD planes at Dunkirk as they were being withdrawn to England.Then we have the small boats.It seems to have been overlooked that they were originally sent over to ferry troops from shore to navy ships.It was only later in the evacuation that the boats ferried troops back direct to England.No French troops are shown on the beaches.In conclusion the film is overblown,noisy and inaccurate.So loud I had to take my hearing aids out of my ears.

A Masterclass in Tension and Atmosphere,"The film brilliantly captures the immediacy of war through its unique, non-linear narrative structure, focusing on the land, sea, and air. With top-notch cinematography and sound design, it provides an intensely immersive experience. A constant ticking in the background score heightens the tension, underscoring the ceaseless race against time. While the film may lack traditional character development, it prioritises the collective human experience over individual stories. Dialogue is sparingly used, allowing powerful visuals to convey the narrative. The performances are understated yet potent, perfectly in tune with the film's overarching tone. Its complex storytelling structure adds additional layers of tension, which unfurl only in the film's final moments. Overall, it's an unconventional, technically superb work that challenges the norms of its genre, leaving the audience at the edge of their seats.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Masterful cinematography,"Nolan's craftsmanship is outstanding. However, movie lacks captivating story and connection with characters. There are only few moments. Other wise, it just seemed like most expensive reenactment for documentary movie. It certainly wasn't what I am looking in fictional movies (you all do understand that this was fiction? Based on true story, yet fictional. Dunkirk happened, yet not like in this movie. It was a lot more messier and bloodier. In the end this seemed like big budget fan film for one WW2 battle). Tom Hardy's performance was very Bane-ish (after watching the movie you'll know what I mean), so if he wasn't pushed on by studio, just because movie needed big name to be in this big budget movie, then Nolan made mistake by casting him. Would be better with someone with no name (at least no name at the moment). Must admit that even I didn't like movie story wise, I admired cinematography. All shots and effects were outstanding, I wish there would be more movies like this every year. It was so nice to enjoy those practical effects. If there was CGI (there definitely was CGI in the movie), it wasn't obvious. Overall, movie felt original and fresh. It was great attempt from Nolan. Can't wait for his next movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"emotionless, dull, tedious and frankly poor on every level","Not being a Christopher Nolan slappie, I was able to judge this effort all on its own merit. Watching what hits the screen plays out like a tedious and poorly constructed cable documentary. Honestly, there is literally not one ounce of character development or establishment at all. It's just a dry depiction of three round robin events that cascades from one harrowing circumstance to the next. one revolving around a fighter pilot, another around a foot soldier and his French imposter hanger-on trying to survive and the other about an elder statesmen boat owner and his efforts to aid the cause. The only one that is even remotely interesting involves the boat owner, his son and poor lil' George. In fact, the only character name given as to remember it was poor sad lil' George. I didn't make it to the final credits but I wonder if the rest of the cast of characters was simply titled ""nameless soldier""? Having no depth means limited emotional impact and that does a disservice to the real life heroes this movie tries to honor. What alleviates the shear dullness of what is depicted often comes in the form of a racing soundtrack. It's as if the frantic music is your cue on how to react because it's hard to tell by just watching the visuals. The movie itself is all one grim repetitive note. After a while, the grinding soundtrack does start to annoy and pushes towards headache inducing territory. Is that some kind of sloppy film making trick? Trick the audience in to feeling uneasy using other senses rather than simply writing an impactful story? It IS dull and it can hardly be called an actual movie given how it's structured but it's not offensively bad and does its job showing the grim events of Dunkirk.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"""Wars are not won by evacuation.""","Just by its opening scene, Dunkirk is already an extraordinary Nolan film. Dunkirk follows allied soldiers as they are surrounded by the German Army. That's all I'll say. You can watch the film and find out more. But really matters is that it's a Christoper Nolan film. He's a master of film and he really delivers his best.What strikes me about Dunkirk is its non-linear storytelling. There are three perspectives. The mole, the air, the sea. That's truly unique because instead of just focusing on the soldiers, Nolan decides to focus on the people too. Harry Styles was really good in this movie. He has a great performance and I hope he acts in more movies. What's also interesting is that this film is focused on suspense than dialogue. The entire film feels like the final battle of a larger film. The dogfights in the Air are so intense and well done, probably due to the practical effects they used. It's well-paced considering its 106 minutes, which is pretty short for Nolan's typical runtime. The only issue I have with this film is that we don't get enough character development. We know Harry Styles became a soldier, but how? But other than that, this film is perfect. It's pure Nolan, I should say.Overall, Dunkirk is another home run for Nolan himself. Everything's perfect. Hans Zimmer's music, the suspense, the action. It's just that we want more screen time for the characters. But hey, this sure doesn't disappoint.Tenet Letterboxd review comes out tomorrow, and the video review comes Friday! I have seen the film last night and I can't wait to share my thoughts!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Survival is enough,"There are not many lines in this movie. There are only the desire of characters and the choice of characters under desire. The movie retains enough suspense from beginning to end. Everyone is struggling to survive and wants to go home. When defeat is inevitable, survival is the biggest victory. Nolan did not capture the greatness and magnificence of war, only fear, death and despair. So from Nolan's perspective, all a director can do is bring the audience back to the battlefield at that time, feel what characters feel, and fear what characters fear. But in the end, people still have hope for human nature.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
A Strange Mixture of Emotion and Noise,"As the daughter of a man who fought in WW2, together with all other male relatives in our family, I was anxious to see this film which should have been both an emotional and educational experience. Sadly for us it was a disappointment and left us wondering exactly why the film is called ""Dunkirk"".There are good performances and some emotional scenes, particularly at the beginning of the film. But the time line was so confusing and the beach was so empty considering that there were well over 300,000 men awaiting evacuation. And where were the 800+ small boats which sailed back and forward over a period of 8 days and, together with the larger British destroyers and merchant ships, saved almost 340,000 soldiers. We saw endless air battles which were beautifully filmed but weren't exciting or effective.Finally the music - Hans Zimmer is a wonderful composer of film music and his creation for this film was effective. But why so loud and so much? It was almost impossible to hear some of the text and I'm astonished that a director of the caliber of Nolan thought that this would add to the tension. Sometimes silence says far more than the constant background of very loud music.I presume that many of these things won't bother a younger audience but I believe that the story of Dunkirk deserved to be more accurate. The most annoying thing was the fact that in the brief introduction to the film, where there is an explanation as to the situation of the trapped soldiers, the enemy surrounding the soldiers is not named - they are just 'the enemy'. What happened to naming them as the German Army or the Nazi Army?",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"Good, But Lacking Many Things","It was an entertaining movie overall, and had an interesting plot. However, the narration was a little confusing because they didn't elaborate on the characters at all, so it was difficult to recognize who was who (especially with the matching uniforms and mud) I wish that the would have gone more in depth into the characters, since they never give any info on the ""main characters"" - all we know is their name (barely) and their face and their nationality. But it's a good movie to watch if you're looking for an intriguing war movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
I think everyone giving this a good review is a sheep....,"Bad. Saving Private Ryan, filmed 20 years ago, blows this out of the water. Someone said there is no character development to make this about all men and women on the beach/boats - what all 100 of them or so? At no point was there an exploration as to the size of the disaster, at no point do you feel any connection to any of the men or women. Of course every history buff like me will watch the film.Is it the next SPR - no,no,no. Will you want to watch it again. No chance. Buy it on blue, no. Watch on Netflix, I'm sure there will be something better when the time comes, like, well, anything you haven't already seen.I was actually bored of the stale ""dramatic"" long scene shots of actors either looking to the sky or looking to the ground. Its a very boring film in my opinion, but then I am a fan of SPR, BOB, The PAcific, Battle of Britain, Battle of the Buldge - you know, good films/series.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Really Great,"Dunkirk is probably the greatest war film ever made, perhaps after Full Metal Jacket. It's very dark and atmospheric. It's slow in a good way. It just pushes forward in a great, engaging fashion.The actors are all good. It's very serious. Harry Styles is good in it too.Highly recommended, though perhaps not for some8 stars",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Dunkirk was a decent movie that showed what happened to the British on the beaches.,"I liked Dunkirk pretty well. It's a great showing of what happened on the beaches of Dunkirk and how the boats came to take the soldiers home. I liked all the actors and scenes they chose for this movie. The plane fighting and overall looks of the movie were good. I wish there was a little more action in the movie but obviously it's based on the real thing so they can't just add more. This movie is good for the people who like historical movies and want to learn more about the events that took place on Dunkirk beach in France during the second world war. This movie is great in all aspects including the story telling, screenplay, overall effects, and acting.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"Not a movie, but an experience","Christopher Nolan has a unique style of story telling. Right from the first scene of the movie you are engaged for a complete almost 2 hours. This is a must watch in IMAX to experience it better.The movie is shown from Army Airforce & Navy perspective where all 3 forces came together to rescue 400,000 members.Dunkirk will be compared from other WWII movies like Saving Private Ryan but then too this is a unique drama war scene intense thriller. 90% of movie has a very intense background score (Another brilliant work from Hans Zimmer).The movie is too loud. Whenever Christopher Nolan & Hans Zimmer comes together they make sure to make some intense background which is engaging & at the same time its thrilling.Be it Dark Knight or Intersteller. The film shows technically a defeat but this film doesn't include any heroism of a single character also. This is a story of survival.This is a story of evacuation.The film is neither too short nor too long but it just gives you a perfect dose of a intensity,drama,& war.A very mature cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
The Next Masterful Movie by Christopher Nolan,"Christopher Nolan is a wonderful director and all his movies have either been good or amazing so far in his career and Dunkirk is no different. Dunkirk is an amazing theater experience and it should definitely be watched in the theater if possible. The sound was perfection throughout the entire movie, from the minute the movie starts you feel the intensity starts to rise and it doesn't stop for the movies relative short running time for being a Christopher Nolan movie of merely 106 minutes.The set-up of the story not being told in a lineal way and instead in three different parts that intertwines with each other is a genius move by Nolan. These sort of things is where Nolan can really shine in his story telling abilities. A lot of the main actors have almost zero credits in their filmography but with Nolan's directing they seem to act as naturally as they possibly could. The absolute standout of the movie has to be Tom Hardy's performances, what that man can do with only his eyes is astonishing. For the major part of the movie, almost his entire face except for eyes is covered but he stills achieve some great acting and show emotion through out the movie. His character Farrier is involved in one of the most gorgeous shot i have even seen in a movie, it's so peaceful but still in the middle of the war.This truly is a war movie and some scenes were horrifying to witness. It might be a war movie but it's just as much a survival movie. The middle part dragged at some places but the beginning and especially the last 30 minutes were truly amazingly done. The chemistry between the father Mr. Dawson (Mark Rylance) and his son Peter (Tom Glynn- Carney) was very well done and their story caught and few bumps on the road but they managed to convey so much emotions with so few words. That goes for the entire movie, not that much speaking with dialogue but instead with what's going on around these characters and with great cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema. Christopher Nolan did it again, he created a really good movie.Score: 9/10 (Amazing)www.filmtvnow.wordpress.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Almost cinematic perfection,"First off, it's great to be able to write a review and not be afraid of spoilers. Unless you have never opened a history book in your life, most will know how the story ends. The tag-line for Dunkirk is ""the event that shaped our world"". I'd like to think of it as ""the film that changed cinema - again!"" Too bold a claim? Read on.My first introduction to Christopher Nolan's work was 2000's Memento which also introduced Guy Pearce to the big screen as he leapt from Ramsey Street in Neighbours (playing Mike Young for four years) to Hollywood. Memento is a film that had an instant impact on me. At the time I was not sure what I had just seen and it is a film I return to at least once a year and find something fresh in it.The Noughties say Nolan immersed in the DC world with Batman Begins, The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises. 2010 saw Nolan revisiting his fascination with time and our perception of time in Inception. It played with our perceptions of reality, time, asking what is it to dream, what is it to be awake and are we a dream within a dream, borrowing an idea from Edgar Allen Poe.Fast forward to 2017 and we arrive at Dunkirk. Before I discuss the plot or the performance, let's talk technical. Nolan filmed Dunkirk in IMAX with an aspect ratio of 1:1 and that is how one should view this film if possible. Not all of us can access an IMAX theatre. I saw it projected in 1.666:1 in my local multiplex so I feel I lost some of the visual, visceral aspects that the director intended. Getting an IMAX camera into the cockpit of a Submarine Spitfire could not have been an easy feat! Despite the technical wizardry on display, Nolan manages to tell a series of personal stories using vignettes.Dunkirk is a sombre film. This is no celebration of life. Nolan tells the story of the evacuation of 400,000 service men from the beaches of Dunkirk, France in WWII by pleasure craft from the south coast of the UK. We get the perspective of the Spitfire pilot, the service men on the ground, the Admiral in charge of the investigation. Yet amongst all of these personal stories there is tragedy. We see the desperation of the men trying to get home and sneaking onto ships. We see the despair of a serviceman take off his helmet and rifle and walking into the sea while his comrades sit and watch, each as helpless as the other.It is a huge credit to Nolan that while he paints this enormous palette of images, he can focus tightly on the smallest aspect of humanity.Nolan also revisits his favourite topic of time. Dunkirk, while being told through vignettes, splits up the story-telling into one hour, one day and one week. He then proceeds to rearrange the sequence of events into a non-linear act of story-telling. This has huge echoes of Memento and Inception and at this stage is almost a trademark of Nolan's. Personally, I think the style will divide audiences who prefer linear story-telling. However Nolan firmly believes that audiences are smart enough to figure it out on their own. They don't need reams of exposition to understand what is happening. I respect Nolan for that. To be honest I was almost half-way through the film before I noted the time-leaps he was making, back and forth. It is a style that allows him to tell the same story from multiple perspectives. I love it!Nolan has assembled a stellar cast including Kenneth Branagh, Tom Hardy, Mark Rylance, Cillian Murphy, relative new-comer Fionn Whitehead, not to mention One Direction's Harry Styles as Alex.  Most characters only get first names and some get none. Cillian Murphy is ""the Shivering Soldier"" - it doesn't get more stripped-back than that. All performances are excellent. Character development is pretty much non- existent. It is not needed as motivation is obvious.Let's talk about the soundtrack, provided by Hans Zimmer. He has provided the soundtrack for a good many Nolan films with Dunkirk their latest collaboration. Zimmer's syncopated style provides a stunning addition to Nolan's story-telling. There is not a note out of place. This is what soundtracks should be. Is Dunkirk the greatest film of the 21st century, probably not but Hans Zimmer's score certainly is. A masterpiece.I was left wanting more and wanting to see it again in IMAX. My recommendation is to go see it on the biggest, loudest screen you can find. Size matters. So too does the sound system.For me, it's a 4.5 out of 5 - almost perfection.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
A Decent Sunday Afternoon Movie Best Watched At Home.,"Firstly, i want to say i enjoyed the film, nothing amazing like the critics and Christopher Nolan fans have made out but i think he achieved what he set out to do, with all the parameters he set himself regards to the differences with actual Dunkirk history and the filmmaking style he wanted to use.It certainly isn't one of the greatest war films ever made, far from it but it is a decent experiment in filmmaking, if your into that kind of thing.Me and my friend both thought it was like a good film you watch at home on a Sunday afternoon. And having watched it on the big screen i would say that thats the best way to fully enjoy it too, at home, which i would rather have seen it at. You'll understand when you see it, its just one of those films.If you watch this in Imax like i did, make sure you take a tissue because the sound becomes unbearably loud after a little while and you may need to plug your ears up, especially when the aircraft segments start and with the bigger explosions abit later on. Even with tissues in ears its pretty loud too but its nicely bearable.So if you do go and watch it at the cinema then i wholeheartedly recommend watching it in the standard 2D screens, mainly because of the unbearably loud volume and bassy sounds in Imax, mixed with the other film soundtrack noises makes everything sound muffled. And also because it isn't such the big visual spectacle as they've lead us to believe. Nolans previous films and those of say Ridley Scott or Peter Jackson have given more scope and reason to watch their films in an Imax screen.Overall though, i found the film enjoyable, JUST above average. It plods along nicely for a 95 minute feature, with 10 minutes of end credits also. There isn't a dull moment in this from my perspective. Nolan does make you feel sorry for the characters he wants you to feel sorry for, but for a war film it isn't a greatly emotional one. I don't understand why its been given such high ratings as the visuals, sound, story, character development and overall feel don't warrant such grand praise. I can understand why half the audience have really disliked it for the above reasons also, as there was no storyline and there's barely a character for the audience to attach themselves to. Plus there's a lot of difference in regards to the sheer numbers of aircraft's, boats and people not present here. I did feel the grandness of the peril these boys were actually in really missing because of this scaling down from Nolan, which was his conscious choice to leave out. I have to admit that adding CGI here and there really would have given this moment of history a more realistic vision of it's devastating scale.I expected to see really amazing choreographed air combat sequences too but they were just OK, they did the job but nothing spectacular or exciting. There have been way better and breathtaking aircraft combat scenes from most other films, war or sci-fi!If you didn't know Christopher Nolan's intentions in his film as i've briefly alluded to above and are expecting to see an epic masterpiece of a war movie in the vein of films by directors like Stanley Kubrick, Michael Cimino, Brian De Palma, Oliver Stone, Ridley Scott, Francis Ford Coppola, Steven Spielberg or Mel Gibson, where the visuals mesh breathtakingly with story, characters and emotions then you may be disappointed with Dunkirk. Dunkirk feels more like a brief and confined moment of an evacuation, with small scale pockets of peril at its heart, and knowing that will help you appreciate this better, hopefully, but by how much i don't know, for me its a 6/10, just above average.It's definitely not on the scale the critics and fanboys have sold it on, for a general audience! Even though i enjoyed it i still don't see how such high ratings are being thrown at this. And its a shame the film doesn't convey the epic grand scale feeling of terror that history has told us.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Dunkirk is a emphatic war film with great visuals.,Dunkirk is a captivating and completely immersive from start to end. Out of any of the movies that I have seen this year this movie really peaked my interest because of the unique choices made by the production team (eg; hiring actors that are essentially no names). This film has a great visual style that is intense yet methodical which is complemented very well by the masterful directing by Christopher Nolan. In conclusion Dunkirk is an experience like no other movie that has come out this year so far. Highly recommend it to any type of audience.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"Instantly forgettable, yet of such a sad historical event.","Definitely cold and empty, no character development, and so why have movie stars.Not in the same league as Saving Private Ryan, or Hacksaw Ridge, as it didn't really feel like a movie. More like a fly on the wall, with a lot of apparent continuity errors, from grey sky to suddenly blue, and then back to blue again.The movie felt rushed, trying to set scale yet overlooking story, and characters.I am not sure of the target audience, but had I not spent the price of a movie ticket, and been watching on TV, I would have turned it off after 20 minutes.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
A Visual Masterpiece with a Timely Topic about British Pride,"Dunkirk offers the most intense, beach set cinematic experience since the iconic film Jaws. In this new adaptation of such a strong battle, Christopher Nolan's talent as director and writer shines through, creating a visual masterpiece that leaves you mesmerized.The battle of Dunkirk was a short one, May 26 to June 4, 1940. Despite its minimal timeframe, it was deadly. WWII Allied soldiers were hiding, surrounded on all sides by the German Army and had to be evacuated on the beaches of Dunkirk, by way of an operation famously known as Operation Dynamo. On the ground, British Army Privates Tommy (Fionn Whitehead) and Alex (Harry Styles) are two of the men desperately fighting and struggling to remain alive and safely evacuate the beach, by whatever means available. Across the ocean, local sailors Mr. Dawson (Mark Rylance) and his son Peter (Toms Carney) had been recruited by the Navy to help with the evacuation. From yet another perspective, members of the Royal Air Force including Farrier (Tom Hardy) attempt to shoot down the German bombers, in order to help the stranded troops evacuate the beach and ocean safely.Let's talk about the production of the film. The cinematography, as expected from talented director and writer Christopher Nolan, is groundbreaking. Congratulations to Hoyte van Hoyterman for creating a visual masterpiece. Everything looks incredibly realistic and breathtaking, keeping you on your toes throughout the film. The scene that is the most memorable to me, is when one of the Air Force pilots soar through the sunset sky as the troops cheer in victory. I assure you that it will give you goosebumps and make you teary-eyed.The sound effects and the music by Hans Zimmer make the movie that much more tangible. The bombing begins from the very start of the film, preparing you for an emotional roller-coaster. They are so loud that it sounds as if they're coming from the back of the theater. If you listen closely, there's a ticking clock throughout the entire film, (minus the ending, which I will keep under wraps for you to discover) hidden within each song, creating increased tension and suspense. By the end of the film, I was already down to the nub of my fingertips, so prepare to be antsy!Harry Styles' performance is quite impressive, particularly since he is a known as a singer, not an actor. It is refreshing to see his excellent performance her, as he is the one with the most lines and delivers them eloquently, equal to an experienced actor. Cillian Murphy and Tom Hardy also delivered remarkable performances. Dunkirk relies heavily on emotions since it barely has any dialogue, so it is important to have the story delivered by the visuals and the acting, which they achieved flawlessly.Dunkirk is rated PG-13 for intense war experiences and some language. Because of the stunning cinematography and story line, I rate Dunkirk 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 to 18. Go check it out, whether you are a history buff or not, this film will remind you how history affects us.Reviewed by Michelle C., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
The Citizens Mobilize,"Dunkirk played a small part of that classic from the World War II years Mrs. Miniver. If you remember Walter Pidgeon took his small craft out and said he would be returning the next day. You then see his boat joining other small craft and then there's an armada of them heading down the Thames and out to sea. They were heading for Dunkirk and were going right up to the beaches where the large naval vessels couldn't go and taking several hundred thousand British soldiers and a few French who later became the basis for the Free French army headed by Charles DeGaulle.There's's mention here of Winston Churchill and Sir Bertram Ramsey whom I believe was First Sea Lord. The only criticism I have of Dunkirk is that I would like to have had some scenes with the top decision makers as we saw in such films as Patton, MacArthur, The Longest Day, the Battle Of Britain, and others. Especially in The Longest Day we saw the ordinary soldiers and their story mixed with the brass and the critical decisions they were making.On the plus side Dunkirk is a film wonderfully cast with several poignant stories about what was being done and the sacrifices made. My favorite is that of young Barry Keoghan all of 17 who comes on the small craft of Tom Rylance and his son Tom Glynn-Carney just to be part of a great adventure. His performance will bring a few tears to the eye. Of all in the film I hope young Mr. Keoghan will get some notice for a Supporting Actor Oscar.No doubt Dunkirk is in line for some technical awards as well in addition to the big one. With 10 now in the race for Best Picture I have no doubt that Dunkirk will be one of the ten.I've always loved the story of Dunkirk and how that island nation put aside its differences among the subjects and worked together to get that army off the beach. Make no mistake this was citizen mobilization at its finest. No matter what your views were unless you were an out and out Nazi sympathizer you knew what getting those troops home meant.Nothing less than the fate of civilization itself.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Made Me  Proud To Be British,"Christopher Nolan ? Someone is rather over-hyped in my opinion. He's a director who often reverts to gimmicks in order to sell a movie. Woul MOMENTO have worked in a completely linear structure ? Would INCEPTION have worked without the groundbreaking special effects . Would THE DARK KNIGHT trilogy have worked without the ready made audience for a BATMAN reboot ? To be fair at least with a Nolan movie the film sells itself and with DUNKIRK there's always the problem that a film like this is going flop big time due to the fact that it involves a military defeat of sorts which is box office poison along with the fact that British stiff upper lips don't translate very well to an international audience. In other words I didn't have exceptional hopes for DUNKIRK but even I have to admit this film really delivers and it's all down to the directorIf you've seen the trailers you know you're going to be watching cinematic spectacle and that's what you're getting . What the trailers don't convey is the oppressive and hypnotic soundtrack by Hans Zimmer which will grab you from the first scene. It's intrusive for sure and crushing but adds to the tension. Make no mistake this is a masterwork in tension . The fractured storyline concerns itself with three distinct sections . One involves the dilemma of the aptly named British soldier Tommy , one involves a RAF fighter patrol over the channel and the final storyline involves a civilian boating expedition to the Dunkirk beaches . These story lines are developed and edited superbly . One storyline is structured so ends on a cliffhanger cut to another storyline ending to a cliffhanger then cut to the dilemma being resolved but is really a case of out of the frying pan in to the fireWhat also makes DUNKIRK noticeable and sets it apart from other recent war films is the lack of star power . Yeah okay we've got familiar faces like Hardy , Rylance , Murphy and Brannagh but it's the unknowns and up and coming actors like Whitehead , Barnard and Lowdon who carry the film and helps you buy in to the real life situations these characters are experiencing. It's refreshing that we don't get to see a name actor like Pitt or Cruise turn up to save the day complete with colonial accent . Despite the heart stopping tension and carnage constantly grinding the audience down there's also a distinct lack of gore and ""war porn"" which is also refreshingOne biting criticism the film seems guilty of is that it's somewhat cold and aloof with a lack of backstory to the characters lack development. I can understand these points but as I said this film is all about heart pounding tension. One also concludes that there's expressionistic elements in that the characters are shocked by what looks like nihilistic inevitable defeat and this is conveyed to the audience Imagine if Spielberg had directed it where sentimental clichés are to the fore , some soldier pulling out a photograph of his pregnant wife saying how much he loves her and the audience knowing there and then he's not going to make it the end credits. Here however you're thrown in to the cockpit of Collin's Spitfire , of Mr Dawson's small boat or being stuck in a sinking ship with TommyIf there's one thing I regret after seeing this film it's that I didn't watch it in a proper IMAX cinema. I was left gasping at some of the scenes thinking ""How could this scene be possibly be better ?"" but a couple of days later after I've calmed down I do think not watching it on a proper IMAX screen has been a major mistake and I hope anyone reading this doesn't make the same mistake because DUNKIRK mixes spectacle with distressing personal dilemmas. Some people class the real life evacuation of Dunkirk as a defeat for the allies while other like myself class it as a ""Victory grabbed from the jaws of defeat"". Regardless of this opinion DUNKIRK is a victory of filmmaking . Filmmaking that made me bloody proud to be British",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Virtual reality sans the bane of headsets,"Christopher Nolan. A captivating storyteller. Dunkirk, his brainchild, is the exaltation of directorial passion.Dunkirk is a poem. It has no heroics, no drama, no emotional flashbacks, even, no words for the most part, yet, immensely succeeds in conveying the entirety of it's message towards the end, to the already visually spellbound audience.When you watch Dunkirk, you are not a third person. You are the wounded soldier, you are the killing one too. You are the rescuer, you are the pilot in the spitfire. You are at war within yourself, torn between the happenings that occurred during the World War's infamous evacuation.Adding to the visual treat it is, the sound shall have no less of a mention either. There has not been a better score for a war movie to date. The simple sound has regained the throne it's once lost to the digital/techno music. The mood, context and above everything, what comes next has been so craftily elevated with the score, thanks to Mr. Zimmer.Right from the opening shot, you are there. You hear the battle as a soldier does. You endure the explosions just as they do.No movie-goer is eligible to critique this work of mastered art.One can however, only enjoy the experience.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
One of the most disastrous events in British wartime history depicted in a less than triumphant but hardly disastrous film,"Christopher Nolan has always struck me as a very talented film-maker, and most of his films are ones that have impressed me a lot. Even weaker efforts, where his ambition can get in the way, have a good deal to admire. His films are all impeccably crafted technically, and often entertaining and thought-provoking, also knowing how to get good performances out of talented casts.'Dunkirk' had me interested in it from the get go. Not just because Nolan was the director, though he is to me one of the ""appreciated"" directors than a personal favourite, and, while all his films range from decent to outstanding, again from personal opinion only 'Memento' is a film without faults, so like him and his films but don't consider them the best thing since sliced bread. There was also the involvement of Hans Zimmer, who has penned some great scores (both in his collaborations with Nolan, being a regular, and elsewhere) and a cast that includes Mark Rylance, Kenneth Branagh, Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy. Plus 'Dunkirk' was based off one of the most disastrous events in British wartime history, actually cited by Winston Churchill as ""a colossal military disaster"".Seeing 'Dunkirk', after hearing a lot of acclaim but also a lot of divisive opinions on both sides, there was a lot to admire about 'Dunkirk' but, although it is a visual, technical, audio and directorial masterpiece, it is not the triumph of film-making it could have been. As far as Nolan's films go for me it's a lesser effort, meaning often impressive but flawed where ambition gets in the way of execution, feel exactly the same way about 'Interstellar' which has similar strengths and flaws to 'Dunkirk'. Personally do feel strongly that regardless of how disappointing it would have been to others it is a long way from a 1/10 film, even if the film didn't do much for me it would have gotten a 4 at least from me.Let's start with the strengths first. First off, 'Dunkirk' looks amazing, so far being one of the best-looking films of the year. Very evocatively designed, atmospherically lit and the cinematography is dazzling with some grit but also some audaciousness. Nolan's direction is often superb, especially in the very visceral spectacle, and on an audio level it is just as big a triumph. The sound is constant but didn't bother me, coming from somebody who can have hyper-sensitive hearing but is used to loud noises and high volume (necessary for the experience) when going to the cinema. If anything it added to the authenticity.Hans Zimmer's score has garnered a lot of praise, acclaimed from most in part, but has had some dissenting opinions. Count me in as someone who loved it, there is an ominous quality but also a pathos and rousing bombast that enhances the pulsating heart-beat.The action is often enthralling, and there is some nerve-shredding tension and some heart-wrenching emotional pathos (like in Cillian Murphy's performance). Loved the performances as well, the best coming from a quietly dignified and understated Mark Rylance who can say little and still speak volumes with just a small gesture, his eyes and his facial expressions. Kenneth Branagh's role is not a large one but he does make much of it. Nolan regulars Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy command the screen effortlessly, Murphy's shell-shocked soldier in particular is genuinely moving. Was absolutely shocked in a good way at how good Fionn Whitehead's and Harry Styles (on paper an insane casting choice) feature film debuts were.On the other hand, what makes 'Dunkirk' less than triumphant is that the characterisation, writing and story are on the messy side. Didn't mind the minimal dialogue and understood completely why it was done, did mind that the characters were underdeveloped and severely lacking in depth, one never gets to know them which is a shame because the acting is so good.'Dunkirk' has been criticised for being emotionally cold and not getting enough into the horrors of war. Do agree with those criticisms actually. There are times actually where both actually come through, there is tension and suspense, there are some harrowing moments and some poignant ones, but we don't want moments, we want consistency. 'Dunkirk' is not horrifying or gut-wrenching enough (for war films it is fairly tame) and does lack consistent emotional investment.Nolan could have done more with the historical side of things, it is a good thing that a good deal of people here have knowledge of the event but it can't be assumed that everybody knows about it or all the facts, nobody expects a history lesson but there was a missed opportunity in this regard. While being a technical and visual masterpiece, some of the editing is chaotic in places, as an epileptic it was just about bearable but still felt too much even for what it was trying to do. Lastly, while having a non-linear structure is not a bad thing (Nolan did it with 'Memento' and masterfully) how the three stories were told did get confused at times and it was hard keeping up with the constant back and forth.So overall, less than triumphant but hardly disastrous. Often impressive but problematic. 6.5-7/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
The agonizing war of Nolan,"Agonizing, claustrophobic, oppressive, sweeping and sonorous, these are the verbs we can use to compose Nolan's new film, which this time stands out by the technique and not by the script, ""dunkirk"" is a film that invites the viewer to Sit in the armchair and sodomy in the best sense of the word, because you suffer, drown and fight along with the characters, ""dunkirk"" is a survival film, barely have hand-to-hand or shots, or even dialogues, That we have here is the purest survival instinct alienated to a setting and a wonderful sound mixing and editing. We have a script that is characterized by three nuclei that unite around a goal, rescue and assist the French and English soldiers trapped in Dunkirk beach, the script contains few dialogues and little character construction, and leaves the viewer more distracted completely Lost, but those who pay attention will be amazed by the almost orchestral narrative that Nolan builds. The script tells the story of the rescue of the British and French soldiers following three points, by the sea, where tells the story of a civilian who provides his boat to help rescue, in an area, where tells the story of three pilots responsible To give air protection to the soldiers trapped on the beach, and by land, where it shows the anguish of the young soldiers struggling to survive. ""Dunkirk"" does not soften, and makes the viewer feel the horror of war in its strongest fullness, we have no moral lesson or a message to convey, we have only horror and despair. Raríssimas times a film stands out for its mix and sound editing, but Dunkirk is a film that shouts ""ME WATCH IN A CINEMA, AND OF PREFERENCE, IN THE IMAX"" because its sound quality is something inexplicable, extremely terrifying, of jumping in the chair And bite your nails, to bend down along with the soldiers and hold your breath to keep from drowning, aligned to that we have a dizzying trail, we have a trail that draws attention and is always present, and a more fleeting that dictates the rhythm of Film, we have a ""TIC, TIC, ICT, TIC"" all the time, that sound, it is our heartbeats, that tightens and loosens according to the tension of the scene, this is wonderful and a great intelligence, To this sound and he dictates not only the film as our anguish, it was a play of master the introduction of this simple element that can go unnoticed by many, we also have to mention the great assembly of the film, which alienates the three nuclei perfectly The bluish photograph that shows us an extremely tropical and beautiful climate, as opposed to the terror shown on the scene, and last, but not least, the art direction, which performs its role with mastery, showing all the details, clothes , Accessories, boats, airplanes, is beautiful to see. Nolan has a giant budget for his films, and could bring practically the actors he wanted, since it was the money, he still has a name, but no, we have not one actor in the movie to put on the giant poster, our biggest name here is Mark Rylance, winner of an Oscar for best supporting actor, and of course, Fionn Whitehead, better known by his band than as an actor, nonetheless, all the actors are well in the movie and they fulfill their parents, and that goes yet another idea of As the war was made by anonymous in the midst of the multitude. Nolan is one of the most talked about names in the industry in the last few years, some love him, others hate him, I particularly think he's overrated, but I like all his movies, especially ""Dunkirk"". Even complex time, makes quality films that arrive and are recognized by the great public, so if the only options are to love or hate it, I get to love, but with reservations. ""Dunkirk"" is an interesting film that is sure to take a lot of editing and sound mixing and maybe a few more technical Oscars, but it's not going to happen, it's still a great movie that's worth the ticket.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Lacks an emotional core,"In Mrs Miniver the film had a propaganda even jingoistic elements that inhabited its story and characters.Dunkirk is a technical masterpiece but the story lacks an emotional core despite having excellent actors such as Tom Hardy, Kenneth Branagh and Mark Rylance. At one point I thought where is Hardy?The film is set in a nonlinear fashion and unlike Saving Private Ryan, director Christopher Nolan has eschewed blood and gore.Set in 1940 thousands of Allied soldiers have retreated to Dunkirk waiting to be picked up and sailed back to Britain. We focus on Tommy, a young soldier who has survived a German ambush. He meets another young soldier called Gibson on the beach, who is burying a dead body and says little. They try to make their way onto a ship by acting as stretcher bearers and taking a wounded man aboard a hospital ship. We see these two young men just wanting to survive and each time they meet with some unforeseen event.Dunkirk shows the evacuation from land, sea, and air. Rylance plays a small boat fisherman who along with his son and another young boy are sailing to Dunkirk to pick up survivors. They have already picked one up along the way who is heavily shell shocked. Yet his story is hampered by an appalling side plot of a young man injured and wanting his old school to know that he did something important.As the film has little dialogue, Nolan wants to create atmosphere and suspense through its visuals and music. In that sense it only partly succeeds because the film lacks dramatic impact.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"Tense and engaging, but paper-thin and doesn't really do the scale of reality justice","I heard many good things about this film, and was looking forward to seeing it - although I had heard mostly things about the technical delivery rather than character, history, etc. From the start this is true, and I might as well get it out and say it - I don't think this film deserves to be as highly rated as it is. However, to say the positives about it; it is impressive in terms of how it is put together - if it is computer generated then I could not see it. Dog fights, huge crowd scenes, explosions, shots inside sinking ships - all of it is immersive and convincing in how it looks and sounds. As almost every scene is one of build-up or delivery, the film manages to have this engaging tenseness which is sustained through a consistent throbbing soundtrack. As a technical package, it is a great piece of construction.More than that though, it is not. I echo the complaints that there are no characters to speak of - only some recognizable faces that we are therefore meant to connect to. This is understandable in such a big film, but it is not like the film did not include soapy character moments (such as the additional boy on the boat heading out), so it is not like it is above them; but when it tries they don't really work. In terms of engagement, it is just the soundtrack and the tension that did it for me - there is nothing to the heart of it. This doesn't just mean ""tearful death scenes"" but rather the film didn't deliver the scale of the Dunkirk rescue, the tragedy of the losses etc. By keeping it really focused and limited to a few planes and boats, Nolan is able to keep the film tight, but the price paid is that there is not an understanding of how big this was, nor a sense of pride and history by the end.For what it does well, Dunkirk is worth watching. However it is surprising in how limited a lot of it is in terms of reaching the audience, engaging it with something more than surface, and ultimately moving us with the weight of history; it doesn't really do any of this.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Spellbindingly British.,From my seat on the back row I could see the majority of the audience were middle aged and elderly. All seats were occupied; a full house.From beginning to end there was complete silence and nobody went to the toilets... amazing! I imagine people were remembering fathers and uncles just like I was.At the end everyone sat there as the credits rolled then quietly exited the auditorium. I felt that had I clapped there would have been a roar of patriotic applause.Thank you Christopher Nolan.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
A stunning blend of cinematic perfection and enthralling action,"Dunkirk is an experience not to be missed. State of the art cinematography sees a welcome exchange for enthralling camera work, soundtracks and composure over bloody combat, resulting in a quintessential portrayal of the Dunkirk evacuation.The plot, despite being gripping, is not the films strongest point. The films intention is to provide an accurate and stunning representation of the Dunkirk evacuation which the film was ever so successful at. Prepare to be taken back by tense aerial battles over millions of kilometers of vast, unforgiving ocean and experience the hopes of 400,000 soldiers rise and fall as each ship comes and goes, taking the lucky and leaving the rest to wait in fear. Unrivaled visual effects pose the relentless German forces as a greater threat then ever as you cling to your seat every time an enemy aircraft swoops in dropping fatal bombs and unceasing machine gun fire. Enemy threat will always be in the back the of your mind, allowing the film to be a never ending climax, providing every scene with captivating tension.Be sure to watch this masterpiece in a cinema to experience the intended impacts of Dunkirk's splendid audio and visual effects which are best enjoyed by surround sound and large screens rather than on your laptop screen while sitting on the couch.The film is complemented by terrific acting across the entire set with Harry Styles commendable acting debut adding a special kind of novelty to the film.I would highly recommend Dunkirk to any and all history buffs, anyone seeking accurate depiction of the Dunkirk evacuation or anyone who appreciates quality cinematography and an altogether brilliant movie experience.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

A masterpiece,"I'm currently re-reading Hugh Sebag-Montefiore's ""Dunkirk"" (which is a fantastic book by the way and highly recommended for anyone who wishes to have a micro- or macroscopic view on the topic) and based on that source the movie is not always historically accurate. On top of that there are some events that seem too fantastic just based on common sense. This was my first impression.Having now seen the movie twice, I forgot and forgave the inaccuracies, went with the flow, and I think the movie is a masterpiece. It is a collage of events from the viewpoint of individuals who in fact lose all traits of individuality when facing the monstrous war. The movie looks beautiful, the soundtrack is revolutionary and the way the different moments in time are sequenced is ingenious and impressionistic. Chapeau!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Good Film but Disappointing at the same time in many ways,"Just watched the movie on 70mm film and the image quality was exceptional. For the most part it was an enjoyable and entertaining history film about survival during war. It had some great suspense and thriller elements to it. In fact some of the sequences were very Hitchcockian in nature that they reminded me of Hitchcock's Foreign Correspondent. If i had to categorize this movie i would say it's an Action-Thriller that takes place during war.My first problem was the Sound & Music. Both were too loud, annoying, distracting, and monotonous that several people got up and left. I almost did. It's the same problem that the dark knight rises suffered from. They mixed the sound so high to make the action and explosions appear grand but it fails since the visuals don't work. There's only one director who can direct great action and explosions and make it look grand and epic that i almost believe its a work of art, which in a way it is. That director is none other than Michael ""Bad Boys"" Bay.Second problem i had with the movie was too many cuts to secondary characters that i didn't care about. Not to mention i barely cared about any of them since I never got to know them. They should have stuck with just three stories: the pilot, the father and son, and the two soldiers trying to survive. Period. I don't care about the generals, random soldiers, or Cillian Murphy's character either.Third problem i had with the movie was it didn't have a grand scale or scope the way it was advertised. The film tries hard to want to be epic but fails. On the posters it states that over 400,000 men were trapped but in the movie i didn't see that at all. Honestly, it was more like 2,000, then there was like two planes in the sky and a half a dozen boats. Really? That's what you called grand? If you enjoy a historical Action-Thriller that's full of suspense then definitely check it out. Bring some ear plugs if you can.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"Realistic, but boring","In this movie, you are a fly on the wall watching scenarios from various soldiers and civilians during the battle of Dunkirk.You don't get to know the characters therefore care very little of what will happened to them. It's portrayed quite realistically. The flight sequences are the best one, but they are not long sadly and quite far in between.Everything looks authentic. Could not tell where it was used CGI. Recommended to war buffs and history freaks. If you want an exciting and good story, look elsewhere.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
It made me feel like I was in the moment,"Every time Christopher Nolan makes a film, I get excited. He is a filmmaker who has made countless classics and possesses a lot of creativity. It's interesting to see him make a war film like Dunkirk and after watching it, I wish I witnessed it in a cinema.Dunkirk recounts the extraordinary event where soldiers from Britain, France and Belgium are trying to get evacuated from Dunkirk whilst being surrounded by the Germans.If there's one thing you can be sure of when going into a Nolan film is that the film is going to be a cinematic experience. I really regret missing Dunkirk at the cinemas and watching it in IMAX because this film is a technical achievement. I love Nolan's usage of practical effects in all of his movies. It shows how much he cares about realism in his films. Dunkirk uses real boats, real planes and thousands of extras to make this event look as authentic as possible. I couldn't stop marvelling at how amazing this film looked. The camerawork was absolutely incredible. There are a lot of beautiful shots and it wasn't too shaky.The sound design and sound editing were fantastic. The spitfire scenes looked so real and the sound they made whilst firing didn't seem unrealistic at all. The editing is very tight. This is one of Nolan's shorter films but that's not a bad thing because it doesn't waste time or overstay its welcome. Right from the beginning you are in the moment and doesn't give you any time to breathe until the end. Hans Zimmer gives us another impactful score that heightens the tension during every scene.A major complaint will be the lack of character. This film follows three different perspectives of the event but there isn't anyone you feel a personal connection with. That is the only flaw I can pick out. I would have loved to connect with someone particularly but it's important to remember that Dunkirk is about the event and not the people. During an event like this, it wouldn't feel right for characters to talk about themselves or their family since their main priority is surviving. I feel all the actors involved conveyed the intensity of the situation and fear of survival through their expressions.Dunkirk was a riveting experience. It's a humongous spectacle that's makes you feel like you're there with the rest of the soldiers. It's a film that intense all the way through and another successful triumph for Christopher Nolan.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Awful,"Worst war film in a long time. What this movie had to do with Dunkirk is a mystery to me. It was basically a series of battles ranging from air battles to sea battles to shore battles. It could have been titled anything for all it had to do with Dunkirk. Dunkirk was just a convenient background for your typical war movie. Also, how come it was nighttime in Dunkirk when it was daytime in the channel? And how was the dead stick spitfire able to fly for what seemed like an hour before landing? The dialog was almost incoherent o many occasions. Don't waste your money on this dud.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Dunkirk is a five star triumph,"Christopher Nolan delivers a monumental, stunning war movie, full of suspense and quiet performances. The best war movies in history, including Saving Private Ryan and Hacksaw Ridge, have also placed viewers in the centre of battle. Nolan has not reinvented that immersive approach, but he comes close to perfecting it.It's a frightening, thrilling opening, but the thing that strikes you is the sound. At certain points, the musical noise engulfs everything, even the dialogue.The opening scenes visually invite us, the viewers, into the movie. Several soldiers, their backs to the camera, walk down an empty street in the French town of Dunkirk. Nolan leaves a space between them where we, the viewers, can fit, as if we're following them along the street. Seeing the film on a large screen makes it especially easy to glide into its world.Nolan's film focuses initially on one young man running from a flurry of bullets through the deserted streets at the beginning of the film. Running from sudden gunfire, the young soldier, Tommy (Fionn Whitehead), arrives at the beach, which is crowded with troops waiting to climb onto too-few ships. From there, Nolan quickly establishes three different story lines and timeframes that are gracefully interspersed throughout the movie.Tommy, innocent and fearful, meets a French soldier, and they desperately carry an injured man on a stretcher toward the shore. Theirs is not a noble act. They are pretending to be medics in the hope of getting on a ship and saving themselves, which instantly sets Dunkirk apart from simpler, hero-driven war movies.Mark Rylance is the very heart of Christopher Nolan's brilliantly directed war movie, Dunkirk. Rylance plays a civilian who navigates his small boat across the Channel, hoping to ferry stranded British soldiers back home. Rylance's character, Mr Dawson, is part of the day- long sea action, in which hundreds of small boats are called on to help.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

A story that many of us have forgotten in the form of a movie that none of us will ever forget.,"Dunkirk was one of the best films of the year, if not the decade. Its unique way of storytelling and emotional score provided one of the best films that Nolan has directed to date, and is an amazing masterpiece in modern film. Although its unique way of storytelling might turn some people away, it left me with my jaw on the ground and tears in my eyes. Nolan's direction in visuals have progressed beyond that of Interstellar, and proved to be one of the most visually stunning pieces of film in a long time. With all that in mind, I had the easy task of rating this film, which won itself The Golden V, as Dunkirk received ""Straight V's"" on theVade Review Bar or a 10 out of 10. Nolan continues his streak of memorable films by providing us with a story that many of us have forgotten in the form of a movie that none of us will ever forget.Read more at theVade.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

Could have been better,"As other reviews here describe in great depth, Nolan has successfully implemented the best of visuals and sound effects. However, the hype created by trailers falls pretty short of describing a genuinely intense and desperate evacuation that took place during the whole battle.At first, the trailers looked as if the Commonwealth Army fought a desperate retreat to 'home'; however, what we see are repetitive scenes that of a handful of Stuka divers getting destroyed by a group of just three RAF fighters, only one of which keeps on the skies while the other two survive on the same escape boat.Its not the setting or the diversion of the director's traditional way of telling one of history's most important events as an all out war (like what one could remember from The Enemy at the Gates or Saving Private Ryan), but the lack of depth in showing the true nature of that hasty evacuation that took place when news had spread that German forces from all sides would be surrounding the allied landing within hours. What we see instead is anonymous soldiers simply changing boats from ships and vice versa, and finally reach 'home sweet home' without really showing much of the real blood that was spilled in order to protect those who were to be evacuated. So, although the movie launches off nicely, it goes monotone within 45 minutes.I wish Nolan had shown the French lines that there were holding their ground from the Germans and relate all that with the evacuation that was taking place. Its just too plain.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Nolan deserves an Academy Award for Best Director,"There is a folklore saying that every movie made by Christopher Nolan should win him an Oscar Best Director. But in reality this is not the case. In fact, Nolan is yet to receive an Oscar nomination for directing. To tell the truth, the Academy were seldom, if not never, in favor of a thriller, a sci-fi, or a superhero movie. Even great names like Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, or Ridley Scott were unable to break this unwritten rule.However, war films are different. Steven Spielberg's two Best Director awards are accomplished through movies both set in World War II. The Vietnam War Trilogy of Oliver Stone twice win him the Oscar. Obviously, Dunkirk is among the greatest war films of all time,and is absolutely no worse than names like Platoon, Born on the Fourth of July, Schindler's List, or Saving Private Ryan.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
A Masterpiece of Epic Minimalism,"I wouldn't have thought you could make a minimalist epic. But that's exactly what Christopher Nolan did. I never would have thought it possible to make a suspense thriller out of events that everyone already knows the ending of. But he did that too. He's stripped away every unnecessary element; every subplot and war movie cliché until all that remains is the desperate men on and above the beach and an ever growing sense of tension. And it is magnificent.It begins with brief narration, then volleys of gunfire from unseen assailants at frightened men running through the streets. This will set the tone for what's to come. Although dogfights and scenes of bombing and shelling are frequent, we rarely see more than a glimpse of the Germans. Instead we're given a growing and almost palpable feeling of dread; the knowledge that the enemy is massed just beyond the horizon and that time is running out.With every near miss, and with each ship sunk or plane shot down the suspense grows. And no sooner is one disaster averted than another threat looms. We know from history class that most of the army will get home alive, but we don't know if the men we're following will be among them. The effect is almost like High Noon or Gravity in that the viewer is constantly kept on the edge of their seat, awaiting what comes next.Though we see thousands of men and dozens of ships in some shots, most of the movie is almost intimate in its focus. Most scenes follow handfuls of men on the beach, a trio of fighter pilots circling over Dunkirk, and the crew of small civilian boat. We share their desperation and determination, their hope and fear. We see the bravery and sacrifice of ordinary men in extraordinary circumstances, and the cowardice and paranoia of men who have been through too much. Though we never learn their backstories or -with one exception- their names, their actions and their expressions tell us enough.The film's visual aesthetic is as minimalist as its narrative. Long shots of sea, sky, and beach abound, with a single boat or airplane to remind us there's a war going on. Even when the camera takes in the whole port and the thousands waiting on the beach, it only reinforces how stranded and exposed they are. Even the explosions are fairly restrained.The editing deftly adds to the suspense with frequent cuts between groups of protagonists during their tensest moments. There's even a bit of nonlinear storytelling, a la Tarantino. At times the film jumps back and forth between day and night scenes, and certain events are seen from characters' points of view half an hour or more apart. It can get a bit confusing at times, but it keeps things interesting and reminds us that the different actors are experiencing the same events in very different ways.Though very different from the grandeur of Saving Private Ryan or the sweeping scale of Patton, Dunkirk easily belongs in the same class as those masterpieces. It's another hit in Nolan's unbroken string of home runs, and proof that you really can do more with less.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
outstanding presentation of this historic event,"There are, I think by design, no standout stars in this movie. The star is the event. The only detraction and it is a minor one for me. Is that it took me a little while at my age to catch on that there were multiple parallel time lines. Once I realized that, it was much nicer for me to follow. I usually don't like IMAX all that much, the sound is usually over powering and I usually wind up too close to the screen. However, this time the theater resisted cranking up the sound and the photography was stupendous in IMAX. This easily matched the intensity of Saving Private Ryan but it lasted much longer.

"Good subject idea, really mediocre result","It is worth a look. The subject had all sorts of potential. The production and photography is generally well done.Unfortunately, it just really doesn't work. It apparently attempted to isolate on a couple individual story lines, but the characters are for the most part very poorly developed.Mark Rylance/Mr. Dawson/Father/Boat Captain was pretty much the only character that was developed enough to hold any interest. Tip for Producers/Directors: If you get Kenneth Branagh for your movie, use him one hell of a lot more and better than they did in ""Dunkirk.""No one else was developed enough to be of any real interest.Furthermore, I didn't think the movie did a very good job of showing either how desperate the situation was for the soldiers stranded there or the magnitude and difficulty of the evacuation. Near the end, it is like a ""oh yeah, here comes the Cavalry"" with some rote shots of some smaller vessels coming to evacuate.Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I was distinctly dissatisfied with this movie. Not a horrible movie, but definitely one I found disappointing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"Relentless, realistic, unforgettable","I'm a huge Nolan fan. Almost all of his films are in the IMDb top 250 and deservedly so if you ask me. Dunkirk lives up to his high standards but it's different from anything he's done before, including the fact that it's based on real events (during World War II no less).It's a pure movie. It captures events as accurately as possible with little artistic ""interpretation"". The enemy acts like the shark in Jaws or the Joker in The Dark Knight, they appear at any time, without a face, and cause havoc, fear and destruction. The planes in particular are terrifying as they scream from afar and get 10 times louder when they pass overhead, dropping bombs or strafing along the way. The soldiers drop in anticipation. Most of them get back up once it's gone. Also, it captures the loudness of the bullets and explosions in a way that I think hasn't been done before. It's in-your-face from the beginning.Many films try to affect us by having characters *emote* and tell us their thoughts and feelings. Nolan understands that evoking emotions is really about creating striking images and situations with characters we can relate to. No-one screams out ""NOOOO!"" or sobs as a friend says their last words. It's like classical music in its restraint. The movie is emotion-less in a way but I found it powerful and moving. I don't need ""sad music"" and melodramatic acting to tell me to cry. Simply understanding what is happening and why, how it relates to world history and what I might do in such a situation is enough. We feel the continually alternating terror and relief of the characters all the way along.There is little if any CGI in the movie (I can't tell because all of it looks completely real). It's depressing the extent to which movies depend on CGI these days. It frequently doesn't look real at all and can take you right out of a movie (the Justice League trailer shown before Dunkirk was a good example of this). As a result, Dunkirk looks spectacular.The music makes use of ticks (from Nolan's personal watch), constantly reminding us of the scarcity of time and the impending doom surrounding the soldiers. Like the opening of The Dark Knight, there's a lot of string ostinati, gradually building tension as the events unfold and lives are on the line.The movie is made up of three main aspects/locations which unfold in parallel but on different timescales: land (a week), sea (a day) and air (an hour). Nolan has done this several times now. In Inception, dream layers occur at different paces from each-other and reality. In Interstellar, time dilation causes great discrepancies in the passage of time between characters. Memento is made of two main story-lines (one going forwards and one backwards) which eventually meet. Many of the climaxes in his Batman trilogy involve multiple events occurring in parallel. Dunkirk similarly cuts between multiple lines but it is easy to follow and it helps build suspense and connect the parts of the story.There is little dialogue. And that's appropriate, there isn't much to talk about. Characters exchange looks and that's all they need. They're alive. The stranger next to them may as well function as their best mate for now but who knows what will transpire.Dunkirk is a profound experience. It doesn't try to be beautiful or sad or triumphant but just real. And yet, I think it's all of those things. It's thought-provoking and haunting.

good movie but way over-hyped,"When a director as renowned for his storytelling and directional ability like Nolan makes a movie everyone expects nothing but gold.Dunkrik is good movie and has some great parts to it. however i really do not understand why people are considering it in par his other movies like the prestige or the dark knight trilogy let alone inception.The story is seriously lacklustre and while has a really good starting and parts in between; it left me with a sense of more to be desired. the acting is very mediocre....and when it all does come together the only thing which holds it by the end is the amazing score by Zimmer.it lacks the meat, sauce and is dry in the core. the same scenes of the bombers dropping bombs on destroyers are played over and over again like clockwork.I hope people do not go with a real high expectation because if you are nolan fan or of good war movies like the thin red line, Saving private ryan or band of brothers you will be disappointed",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

To Put It Short and Sweet -- Go See Dunkirk on the Biggest Screen You Can Find,"If you love war movies, Dunkirk is surely one not to be missed. It's quite likely going to be an instant classic in the ranks of Platoon, Saving Private Ryan, and - most recently - Hacksaw Ridge. It will loose something if you try to watch it at home, no matter the quality of your home system. It's one of those films that really needs the big screen -- the bigger the better -- and best sound system you can find.With that said, the movie does have some flaws. Most of which I will give a pass and write it off as ""artistic,"" and Christopher Nolan has earned that right. As I discuss the flaws, please understand that I really enjoyed the movie and strongly recommend it. Most of it was very well done. If I was to be petty and pick out what I think some others might not like, I would say most movies have a heavier, more distinctive plot. A beginning, introducing and developing the characters and setting up the plot; a middle, setting up the conflict the main characters will spend the movie solving; an end, where the main characters solve the conflict. If you need such a movie, then Dunkirk may not be for you, because the plot was not that clear. This was more like showing the audience an event than telling them a story -- An event that was hard, yet entertaining, to watch.The movie does have characters and somewhat of a plot, but they are not distinctive nor defined. The characters kind of run together and the plot is a bit unclear. The same scene unfolds slowly from three different points of view. From the view of an infantry group -- who are all basically the same height and build, same haircut and hair color, same uniform and mission. This is why they are difficult to tell apart when they are all running from some sort of peril during their screen time. Another points of view come from characters on a small boat and again in small planes and their characters are more distinctive, but never really developed either, because the plot is not really defined. Everyone just wants to survive and spends the whole movie trying to do so.And that is the basic plot -- Survival. Everyone is trying to survive this long war scene. The whole movie takes place in, what seems like, one afternoon. But, somehow, that plot works. It was obviously not written or directed to be a typical story in a typical movie. It's the same tense war scene shot from the perspective of three different groups of people, with no single, distinctive, main character, plot or point... And it worked perfectly.The scenes are shot so beautifully, that when you are with the infantry group, you feel like you were down in the dirt with them and want to dodging bullets. When the perspective would change, you got to see the same scene again, but from the air and the pilots' point of view and it felt like you were sitting in the tiny plane with them. When you watched the same scene from the boat crew's point of view, you could almost feel the boat shaking and the smell the sea salt. The shots are exquisite and details are fully thought out. You can hear the sand falling around your head, the gun chambers rattling the airplane and it seems you can reach below and touch the white caps of the ocean.The only real flaw for me was the story was not clearly set up. Unless you had prior knowledge of Dunkirk and it's history, you would have to have an explanation. I'll give a short explanation with no movie spoilers: The English went to help the French when Germany invaded during WWII. Germany was too strong and not only pushed the French to the coast, but the English right along with them. The Germans changed their strategy from fighting the French/English by shooting one bullet at a time to coming in from the sea with planes and bombing the troops at the beach, on piers and on boats -- intending to kill many more in one attempt, in hopes that they didn't go back to England and regroup. The movie quickly moves to the beach in the beginning and you or only given a quick blip of how they all really got there. For that, I gave it 9 out of 10. That is not giving away the movie -- There is so much more to this.The direction is great, the acting was on par and the special effects were seamless. If you are not a war movie fan, this will not change your mind, but Dunkirk will likely be around come awards season, and rightfully so.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Astounding,"It's not often that I leave the cinema with my hands literally shaking but I will argue that Dunkirk is one of the best films I have ever experienced. The feeling of anxiety and agonising tension throughout the film creates the most electric atmosphere of being completely absorbed in the events of the film. This is however, a film that won't work at a home viewing. The IMAX experience is amazing and this is a film so obviously created with the cinematic experience and it shines through making difficult to recreate the same feeling in the average living room. This aside, I feel that Dunkirk is possibly one of the best cinematic experiences of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
An Engaging Experience,"Dunkirk engages the audience from the first scene. The soldiers of the British army are being directed by their comrades to the beach at Dunkirk. Thousands of soldiers are lining up with great dignity to patiently await their rescue. Churchill has requisitioned civilian boats to pick them up.So, you ask with great anxiety about the result of the herculean effort to rescue and deliver the soldiers to Britain, did Harry Styles survive to the end of the movie? My answer is: go and see.The visual display,the persistent and exciting percussion of the musical score, the booming zooms of the aircraft, bombs, gun fire, and other sounds of war immediately brought me to the beach at Dunkirk while my gut rumbled and vibrated in my seat. I became a soldier on that beach, a Spitfire pilot, and an officer of the Royal British Army.I felt excitement, desperation, patience, forgiveness, sacrifice, empathy, the thrill of the rescue effort, and the possible consequential joy of being able to go home.This movie is an artistically delivered rendition of what it means to be a soldier, a sailor, and an officer. Will you be rescued? Will the support of the Royal Air Force be enough to get you off that beach and back into your family kitchen at home?I urge you to experience what I felt in watching Dunkirk. It's a movie that dramatically emphasizes the importance of persistence, strategy, and humanity in the war against impossibility. Ten fingers.﻿",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Do not buy the hype,"It is a bad sign if a movie tries to inject suspense with an overwhelming soundtrack. It means a weak script or weak acting performances. A lot of money was clearly spent here but the end result (the emotion level you receive) is only a bit more than average. While the structure of the script / editing is sort of original, the story itself and the characters are so so. It all feels a bit flat and cannot compare to war movie masterpieces such as Saving Private Ryan or Come and See which have seriously dramatic scenes, acting and emotions.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Dunkirk,Nolan's best films The Three Perspective Choice was a fine choice with very good acting and great music,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Looks like a war epic on a budget,"OK, a couple of pointers. If you can't stand films with basically no dialogue, give this one a miss. The story is told basically in a documentary style and for the first 10 minutes there is no real dialog. It does look like the story of a wet weekend in Margate where the territorial army was on a drill. This was supposed to be a massive evacuation of men. There were men everywhere. Even although this is shot in very nice wide format, it fails to convey the shear human scale of the evacuation. One of the other intersecting stories is supposed to be the RAF out on patrol giving cover to the troops on the beach. Unfortunately I think there are actually only 3 spitfires still flying in the world. And It looks like they are in this film. So unfortunately it just looks like the might of the RAF was 3 spitfires that were just on patrol. I think the director tries to make us believe that there were more, like a squadron of them, but it just looks like the same 3 planes. So when they are having a dog fight, unfortunately that's all you are thinking 'didn't that plane just get shot down? I'm sure that's the same plane, why is it still flying..' The rest of it is alright, there are some good scenes and then there are some where you are just scratching your head. The 1958 version with old Sir John 'rugged face' Mills and dikkie Attenbourough is much better, and gives a much better account of the scale of the amount of men trapped on the beach. But then again that was shot just after the war and they had plenty of old tanks, boats and aircraft to blow up.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Only gets two stars because...,"...it isn't Nolan's worst film.Where to begin? This was an all-star crew of filmmakers - cinematographer, vfx producer, sound designers and mixers, composer, producers, and yet somehow Nolan managed to undermine them all.I think the intent was to show the human side of the event by giving us, I suppose, three vignettes of individual stories. And at that it (sort of) works. It's at least a good idea for a film, even if it's completely botched by cinematography that spends more time being artistic than serving the story.Music is a powerful part of cinema and it's very apparent here because the score is literally the only thing that stirred any emotion in me at any point - when it wasn't making my entire body physically hurt. Maybe that was the point? To emulate the stress of actually being in combat? If so it's well executed.The actors did their very best to make you care about them but they're fighting the script every step of the way. They're given nothing to work with: at no point is a first name revealed, nor are we given any solid reason to care about any of them, no relatable moments; unless I suppose you've had a head injury, been shot or bombed, or swam the English Channel.The lack of dialog and overabundance of score combined with the lack of plot, almost non-linear narrative, and dependence on pretty cinematography make the whole thing feel more like an art film. Which is nice but if you want to make experimental cinema don't call it Dunkirk and sell it as a war film.Nolan has in the past given us excellent sound design, brilliant mixing, a good score, great dialog, and cinematography that doesn't get in the way of the story - sometimes more than one at a time. This film fails on almost every point.It could have been worse though. It could have been Interstellar - a film with its head so far up its own a#! that it's nearly unwatchable even once.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
A Psychological War Film,"Dunkirk is the story of the allied troops who were stranded on the beaches of Dunkirk and surrounded by German soldiers as they try to survive and escape, meanwhile volunteers sail their boats out to save the soldiers, meanwhile fighter planes attempt to defend the soldiers on the beach from German bombers.Typical to Christopher Nolan, this movie is fantastic. Nolan directs the crap out of it. Not only is his camera-work fantastic, but the scenery he captures is beautiful. They manage to really nail the tone, with it being a little claustrophobic despite the location being a massive beach. The characters are stuck and there is absolutely no way for them to escape. Right from the opening scene, Nolan nails the tone and realism of the film.On top of that, Hans Zimmer's score is far from only being the icing on the cake. In truth, the music proves to be something of a major character, assisting in the carrying of the rest of the cast through this horrible event. The music perfectly suits every situation, and whether or not you feel for the characters, the music makes sure you at least feel a little tense.Speaking of the characters, there really aren't any. Sure, there are like 300,000 soldiers on the beach, yet we still feel for them. The main character has maybe four lines in the movie, yet the reason why he's so good along with the rest of the characters is because the movie sets up this horrible situation and instead of filling the movie with gratuitous war violence, a lot of it is psychological. When a character is desperately trying to escape from drowning you definitely feel for them. I don't know about you, but I don't want to drown. And even without speaking, the characters make decisions and do things that are completely logical and understandable. There are no dumb people in this movie, and as a result they prove to be very human. There is so much humanity in these characters, so it's very easy to relate to them in some way.Part of why the characters are so humane, however, is because of the acting. From the big names like Tom Hardy and Kenneth Branagh, to the first-timers like Fionn Whitehead, there is not a single bad, or even average, performance in this movie. The lead, Whitehead, is absolutely outstanding in his first full-length film role, pulling off a very human performance simply by the way he moves, acts, and reacts. My personal favorite, however, was Cillian Murphy. He plays a shell-shocked soldier and absolutely nails it for the short amount of time he spends on screen. His character holds so much depth and intrigue, I looked forward to every moment he spent on screen.The movie feels real too. The gunshots sound real, and the way the action scenes are shot are in-the-moment and authentic. When Hardy flies his plane and attempts to shoot down others, it's not epic. It's not really even that fast-paced. It's honestly just kind of tedious and frustrating, watching him carefully line up his shot before shooting. And again, the claustrophobia is very real. We get plenty of in-the-cockpit shots that show just how incredibly uncomfortable it would've been in that plane. Again, it's very real and no matter how 'weak' the characters are I felt for each one. And there's so little hope in this movie. Characters end up in terrible situations and don't always get saved last minute. Things happen that would happen in real life but in a conventional movie? No way. Just when you think the movie may be divulging to conventionalism it throws a grenade at your face and you remember that this is real.Towards the end of the movie it felt a little over-dramatic. The music, the narration, the way it was shot. Of course then I remembered that this was a dramatic event. What happened was not pretentious, it was a big deal. Deciding to use a dramatic filming style at the end made sense.If I can find one problem with this movie, it's that at times it felt a little slow. Not that it wasn't interesting, the movie is fantastic at showing the audience what happened without making it long and boring, but it does slow down from time to time. Certain moments may feel a little out of place, but in terms of the plot still make sense.Overall Dunkirk is fantastic. Just about everything works, and you should absolutely go see it. From the music to the directing to the acting, it's great. Go see it. It's worth your money.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Don't miss this one,"So far, over 80% of the people who have rated this movie have given it and 8, 9 or 10. Deservedly so. This is an excellent movie that successfully shows first hand and close up what Dunkirk must have been like for those on the ground, in the air and on the sea.I don't want to gush too much about it, but the realism and cinematographic artistry are superb. This is a story of survival, after all, but it is a story that is so well told that it feels like time travel. I've seen so many movies about the 2nd WW during my life that I tend to avoid them now. But this one is different. It worked for me from beginning to end.I'm glad I saw this movie in an IMAX theatre with a great sound system because it really enhanced the experience. The sounds were visceral, more so than in any movie I've ever been in. So this is what it feels like to have a bullet crack near your head. Or to be strafed. Or to be be in an aeriel dogfight. Or to drown. (Some of the negative reviewers found this too loud, too realistic perhaps. So be warned.)Nolan has somehow captured the strange mix of selflessness and selfishness, cowardice and heroism, depersonalisation and intensive personal narrative that the military and war can bring out. Some reviewers have commented that there wasn't enough character development, but to me that lack of personalisation reflects what being in the military and a huge operation like this feels like.I felt the desperation and hopelessness. The sense of being trapped. The terror of being shot at. I was moved by the ending. Some reviewers are saying the film lacked emotion, but I didn't feel that. My friend says he wasn't moved at all though. Did these negative critics want more emotion from the soldiers? Screaming? Weeping? I don't think that would have been realistic.This movie wasn't too bloody at all, although I don't think I've ever felt more strongly the waste of war. It's too easy in these war movies to demonise the enemy and emphasise the bloodiness -- but Nolan did none of that. He didn't show the enemy or the carnage at all really. What he did show was the desperation and fear.This movie had a few minor issues, but I'll see it a second time before reporting on them in more detail. Right now, I'll just mention a few: Nolan didn't use CGI. I was surprised that there weren't more on the beach. Is this really what hundreds of thousands of men look like? I'm not sure this movie depicts accurately what it was like for so many to be trapped on that beach. Is this what 700 civilian boats look like? Why were there only a handful of aircraft in the air? Maybe CGI would have worked better here. I sometimes had a hard time telling who was who. I would have liked to have walked away from this moving knowing why Dunkirk occurred. What happened to the 100,000 or so who were taken prisoner?This movie puts action fans in the same theatre as old fogeys. That alone is a major accomplishment. You have to hand it to Nolan. He almost casually and unnecessarily turned from his usual fare to focus on an historical war drama. The result is a compelling, excellent movie. Imagine if all these superhero directors did this.It is interesting that the world continues to make and watch movies about this war, even though the greatest generation has all but died out. This is a war we will never forget, even as those who lived it are no longer around to describe it to us. From now on, every generation will tell this story in its own way.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Dunkirk - Nolan's Memento to Cherish,"Christopher Nolan is the blockbuster director with the Midas touch – but it is not all about the money. Behind a powerhouse visual style, lies a writer of substance, a skilled craftsman who knows how to build a film from its beginning, middle and end and stuff it with tortured souls, each on his or her hero's journey, with labyrinthine twists and decoys enough to put an audience of Black Watch renegades through their paces.He has managed to take dollar-raking staples like Batman, and convince change averse nervous twitching studio heads that the Dark Knight needs to be dark and the fumbling penguin needs to be the tortured soul the subject of all our affections even if he is a mass murdering git. He did it and the coffers inflated like popcorn – who knew that inverting the norm could be attractive? But doing all that with the futuristic effects bloated blockbusters like Man of Steel or Interstellar is one thing - taking on the gritty and emotionally delicate subject of a war event that is as critical to British history and identity as the tower of London is another.Yet, once again Nolan has proved that no holy grail is holy enough to remain immune from his dismemberment. But, if something has to be torn asunder and reconstructed – then Nolan has quite firmly established himself as the man of the moment and with the visually stunning and narrative hall-marked DUNKIRK, we have another Nolan game changer.Jettisoning standard linear narrative ritual in favor of the iconic leaping and rebounding story line of his classic Memento, Nolan goes even one further abandoning the venerated three act play. In a most astounding narrative leap Nolan's Dunkirk casts off the 'WHY?'. It is an act of pure cinematic genius whose absence plays startlingly into his denouement of the infamous British forces rescue from the beaches of Northern France in the last week of May 1940. Many recent reviewers and critics have lamented the absence of a historical explanation as to why the events that were taking place were not fully extrapolated. But they have missed the point entirely. Nolan's approach was clearly to use his visual genius to saturate the viewer in the experience – the central character of the film is in fact the event – viscerally portrayed in vibrant immersive 70mm. The why of the event is not developed because the purpose of the exposition is to leave the viewer with a much bigger why they themselves most formulate having being fed into the action – it is not why Dunkirk – but why war?Nolan has managed to do what few great war films - despite their aspirations - have failed to do – he has succeed in documenting an event that crushes the viewer with the irrationality, the savagery and inhumanity of it all and yet plants the seed of a hope that humanity is moving in the right direction – all without any character for the viewer to cling to. Even ""Tommy"", a representative ""Tommy"" played by Fionn Whitehead – is underdeveloped so as to avoid the audience pinning its affections too tightly on any one role – that was never the intention. Where Full Metal Jacket, Saving Private Ryan, the Thin Red Line, Platoon, Born on the Fourth of July all railed against the savagery of war, the hook for the viewer was being dragged into a deep personal emotional attachment to a character whose fate punched the audience. Not so DUNKIRK. It is incidents within the event which hurt and the cumulative emotional response is much broader and much more impactful. For this reason alone it is hard not to begin to consider DUNKIRK as one of the very all-time war films. But there are other reasons.Recounted through three perspectives, air, land and sea, unfolding across different time perspectives, with each one ultimately narrowing down to a single colliding event, Nolan ties the viewer into an authentic confusion of time, space , event and order – hallmarks of a conflict experience in which the semblance of command structures is subverted by the urgency of the predicament. It is only the representatives of the homeland – personified by the brilliant Mark Rylance in the company of Barry Keoghan and Tom Glynn-Carney – sailing with clear instructions and purpose, who represent the calm of normality – even when hit by tragedy. Outside that small oasis of hope, the desperation and claustrophobia of conflict is most brilliantly exposed through the cockpit firefights between the Spitfire squadrons and the Henkel escorted Luftwaffe attacks – making for some of the best aerial war sequences in decades. And although at times, the visuals are the stuff of small boys war stories – there is nothing trivial or scout in Nolan's treatment. In two very particular sequences he exposes us to the delicacy of heroism and the sometimes heroism in ordinariness. The aerial combat scenes stake on a particular significance when one realises the intensity and precarious nature of those sorties – a microcosm of the tremendous hazards of conflict, where the enemy is not just the enemy but the way circumstance leans.DUNKIRK inspires a reflection on the immense courage that all those men and women showed, not just in that event – but in the wider war which raged on for years after - at incredible human cost but, in the end, for a prize that many of us have, all too sadly, forgotten. We need to be grateful to great artists like Christopher Nolan for treating this subject with the respect and brilliance it merited. We need to be reminded of the huge victory that was ultimately the prize of Dunkirk and what that means today. We need to be mindful of the men and women who fought that war, those who have passed on - but also those who are with us yet.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

Dunkirk will age really badly.,"Dunkirk is Christopher Nolan out of depth and in uncharted waters. It's a movie that wants very hard to be great. Where characters talk in monosyllables and look meaningfully at each other or in the distance expecting the viewer to be with them in their moment. Going by the majority of the reviews, this British war survival story has been bought by a lot. I was sitting in the theater waiting for that moment of redemption in the movie that never really came. Critics, it seems have seen the movie and adapted their tastes to like it and find deeper meaning (as critics often do) in perhaps the most straightforward story line made interesting only because of the non-linear editing tropes which Nolan otherwise uses well in his other movies to some purpose. Here it becomes too much of a gimmick and some extremely non moving and non interesting events are made to seem more than what they are. What remains of Dunkirk is an aural and visual spectacle that falls squarely flat by the time the last of the British is rescued. The movie has multiple endings and at such a short run time, the ending can't come fast enough. Nolan has admittedly taken off from multiple movies before he made Dunkirk and his effort is different in the way it has such less impact even after bombarding the viewer with bullets, bombs and an overpowering Hans Zimmer soundtrack.Hoyte Van Hoytema is a brilliant cinematographer. The Spitfire is a brilliant machine (as mentioned by Nolan in many interviews and expressed by one of the characters in the movie.) The aerial photography is like no other you may have seen. But all of this amounts to nothing. The spitfire maybe a brilliant machine and Hoytema may have taken brilliant shots but the story line flounders away in the air somewhere. Tom Hardy can't see the plane clearly and after the 10th shot of the same plane meandering here and there you realize the war can be really tedious and boring without that pounding Hans Zimmer soundtrack at the background. Thanks Christopher Nolan for putting me right in the middle of the war with such lovely heart pounding score, because frankly the screenplay isn't your best bet here and you know it.I'll go on here and speculate now because I'm a fan of the man and want to. The man who doesn't seem to falter even when he makes a movie like The Dark Knight Rises as he infuses a lot of commentary and brilliance in the weakest of plots. Christopher Nolan has a very visible Stanley Kubrick hangover. He has a picture of Kubrick's chair in his office, he swears by Kubrick's brilliance and if you try and see there are quite a few similarities in the filmography of the British compatriots (Dunkirk being his Paths of Glory). Wanting to be the greatest and most complete filmmaker is the noblest of ambitions but wanting to be like someone else may not be. Before Dunkirk, he was a man who would blow your minds off with a plot twister like Memento or The Prestige, a mind bender like Inception or Following or his villains would have the most memorable roles like The Joker. Dunkirk is Nolan's 'war movie'. Every great director generally ends up making one and wants to make the greatest one. (No one comes close to the Thin Red Line and Apocalypse Now yet, IMO) Dunkirk makes me believe in Christopher Nolan the human director. This guy wanted to make his war movie and when I see it, this was a movie the world would be better off without. In these times of war and international strife, the movie shows you some of the horrors of the war while squarely glamorizing many aspects of it (""The Spitfire with the Rolls Royce engine is the greatest machine ever built."" Says the old guy to his Son in the movie.) I have read many Nolan interviews to find out what this important artist who wields great artistic influence the World over, thinks about what's happening in the World. His world views are unfortunately not much available in the interviews and going by Dunkirk, a patriotism filled British epic lauded by all the British and the colonial powers the world over, it's quite unfortunate that this is the movie we have to live with as the Best reviewed movie of the year. One watch is enough to tell you the movie is average at best and I can't make myself believe it's greater than it really is when it's squarely a technical achievement.Christopher Nolan is at the zenith right now as Dunkirk becomes his best reviewed film and may of course get an Oscar or two thanks to the technical brilliance. It remains his most manipulative and weakest story. A very flimsy plot made watchable thanks to the score and the camera.Dunkirk would age really badly and few years from now, may not even be considered in his best movies.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

Gripping  or  silly  !! I can't decide,"I cannot make up my mind on this one. I loved the complexity of the three time strands. I liked the pacing and the use of music to create the threatening atmosphere.In principle the idea is neat - there are so many men on the beach that giving a few of them a starring role and back story serves to understate the sheer mass of human suffering and terror being experienced during Dunkirk by everyone there, so the ensemble cast idea is a good one.In reality though everyone has a back story and the film tradition of picking one or two of those out and providing more rounded characters works well in those circumstances because the audience can empathise, as it is, here we have an ensemble caste with a couple of not very well picked out individual characters that is hard to care too much about.The film is a kind of half way house - a bit of a war movie, with a few superheros. You can tell it is made by someone more used to the fantasy figure genre. The characters that have been picked out behaving like comic book heroes in terms of the scrapes they get into and how they get out of them, with true Hollywood cliff hanging moments.The movie is also curiously ""unviolent"" as it made for audience under 12. the beach scenes severely understate the brutality of the situation and the horror of war. The explosions were rather anodyne - Bodies being blown up on beaches but no discernible injuries afterwards.I also thought the scenes on the beach looked rather sparse - for what was supposed to be 300,000 men.Showing this from the perspective of the men on the beach without actually seeing the enemy works well but the actual terror of being on the beach does not come across that well especially when the beaches are both so empty and so orderly.The ending is weak and very ""Hollywood "" unrealistic and happens abruptly - almost as if the money ran outThere are a few "" laugh out loud "" moments from a British sceptic - where someone gets saved at the final moment - true typical Hollywood super hero stuff - not really fitting for a war movie - where such moments probably didn't happen- people just died.The story ark in the boat probably works best, but that is because it reverts to the tradition of finding characters one can empathise with, though even here rather too comic book for my tastes.Overall I enjoyed the movie and I found it absorbing, but I don't think its a war masterpiece.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
A movie that's worthy of a great war movie.,"After Interstellar came out to mixed reaction by the public, it was time for Nolan to direct a movie based on a real life rescue operation during World War II. The movie, called Dunkirk, is about that famous rescue of englishmen from the beaches of that town in France and the liberties it took for them to survive the ordeal. If you see this in the theater, be prepared to wear some earplugs if you're hard of hearing cause this film's sound mix is loud. Not only that, but the sheer aspect of this movie combined with the action scenes might give you seizures!!! There's hardly any acting in this movie just mostly lots of action scenes involving planes, ships, and ground attacks. The music is intense, and the visual effects are practical compared with CGI. If you see one war movie this year, then make it Dunkirk.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

Strong work from a director at the top of his craft.,"Dunkirk is tense, sparse, and unsettling. Nolan makes many interesting choices, starting with the 1 week/1 day/1 hour non-sequential action structure, which is effective and yet disorienting. He creates a film about the fate of hundreds of thousands of men, crowded into a small pocket of land and into tightly-packed ships, that feels open, empty, and nearly deserted. Similarly, a film that conveys a constant sense of danger and dread features actors who remain withdrawn and almost unresponsive in nearly every scene. Mark Rylance unsurprisingly provides a standout performance; Hans Zimmer's score is unsettling and dangerous in perfect parallel with the on screen action, and Hoyte Van Hoytema's cinematography is spare, beautiful, and evocative. Creating such a beautiful yet unsentimental war film is a bold move, and personally I felt a bit less invested in its arc than I might have expected. In this it's almost a counter-argument to Saving Private Ryan. But while I can't say that I fell in love with the film, I definitely recognize the mastery of craft and art, all in service to the director's vision. It's impressive and makes for a quite worthy film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Ups and downs: Dunkirk,"""The Battle of retreating, Who won? I duh no""
Ups....
The movie uses more of a ""show don't tell"" style of flim, which is unique for most movies, since most movies use characters to explain most things. The pacing is good... There are not a lot of dramatic scenes, which I think helps the movie alot... The movie takes place during the battle of Dunkirk, which is what most ww2 movies don't even acknowledge, most ww2 movies took place in d-day.Downs.....
I feel like some parts where Over exaggerated...
Didn't like the 3 main protagonists,the movie would have been better if it just stuck to one...Good movie 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"Dunkirk is a cinematic masterpiece, a thrilling ride of suspension, one of Nolan's finest works - My Ultimate Review","Christopher Nolan's ""Dunkirk"" is a war film which places realism above dramatizing, you see, the realism of the film was even acknowledged by Dunkirk veterans. Overall, the representation of the historical evacuation are realistic. I love this film and how cinematic it is, how easy it is to immerse yourself in the evacuation and the war. There's a great cast, most well known actors and some unknown, but the thing is. The characters in this film is an after thought, in a way, as the real character of the film is the evacuation and everything that happened on that day. It was a historic moment for the British, thus I think Nolan was right in structuring the film from the point of view of the characters, intending to use visuals rather than dialogue and backstory. With the way he choose to tell the story, we get to follow three perspectives, each who were important to the evacuation.Land (one week of action), Sea (one day of action) and Air (one hour of action).Allied soldiers from Belgium, the British Commonwealth and Empire, and France are surrounded by the German Army and evacuated during a fierce battle in World War II.Dunkirk is written, directed and produced by Christopher Nolan. With an ensemble cast including Fionn Whitehead, Tom Glynn-Carney, Jack Lowden, Harry Styles in his film debut, Aneurin Barnard, James D'Arcy, Barry Keoghan, Kenneth Branagh, Cillian Murphy, Mark Rylance and Tom Hardy. I won't go deep into the acting of this film, the only thing you need to know is how every performance is perfect in how they capture the horrors of war. In land, sea and air. But what I will go into is the cinematography and how Christopher Nolan choose to create this cinematic masterpiece. Using little dialogue and instead cinematography and music to tell the story, but also to create suspension and tension, which are two things I think the film has from its beginning to its end. If you know Christopher Nolan, you know how he loves IMAX cameras, and he uses them in such smart ways in this film. His and Hoyte van Hoytema's work are felt deeply in every scene, I think the cinematography is perfect. The film looks amazing, mostly because how real it is, how they used extensive practical effects. It employed thousands of extras as well as historic boats from the evacuation, and period aeroplanes.Some critics called ""Dunkirk"" one of Nolan's best work, also one of the greatest war films. I agree fully with one of the greatest war films but not the finest film of his. Christopher Nolan has a filmography with only good movies in my opinion, though I have this high on my list of his best work, it isn't the best in my opinion. Dunkirk received a ton of praise and was a box office success. The sound design and musical score is a reason of why it got so much praise, it actually won an Oscar for Best Sound Editing and Best Sound Mixing, also for Best Film Editing. The film received various accolades other than those, including eight nominations at the Oscars: Best Picture and Best Director (Nolan's first directing Oscar nomination) were two of those nominations. The screenplay is fantastic, as it says so much thanks to the way Christopher Nolan interrupted it and the visual storytelling, instead of using a ton of words to tell the story.Rewatching this film on a bigger television and a better sound system, I appreciated it much much more. Christopher Nolan knows how to create a cinematic masterpiece. He does it again and again. This film, Dunkirk, will be one of those films many will go back to, for the experience it has to offer. A thrilling ride with suspension and pure cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

Batman Soundtrack in a WWII Film?,"After seeing previews showing authentic WWII aircraft, I thought ""Wow,"" and couldn't wait to see this in our IMAX. While the visuals were indeed superb, I found the ""Batman"" like dramatic soundtrack intended to ramp up the viewers anxiety levels during intense battle scenes overwhelming. This effect was used throughout the movie and in my opinion was completely unnecessary and became progressively annoying as the movie played on. Frankly, I think the action sequences were sufficiently thrilling alone, where including an instrumental soundtrack only served to distract the viewer from any sense of the realism portrayed on screen. It's unfortunate that Christopher Nolan choose to portray this event in a ""Batman"" like dramatic setting.I did feel the movie was entertaining, but not nearly the caliber of a ""Saving Private Ryan"" quality as I was hoping for. There are several stories playing out, leaving insufficient time for character development to the extent needed to make you really care about anyone in particular. There were also a couple of action sequences that strained credibility if you are a WWII realist, but fortunately not so many that it came off as a ""Rambo"" type film.I think most will enjoy it as an above average WWII offering with great visuals. With a few tweaks, it could have been much better though.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

Dunkirk,"A crispy clean, thunder sounding of a war movie. It made me almost regret not watching it in theaters. The blu-ray of this movie made my tv sound like a home theater system. Dunkirk tells the story from three different points of view. A gaunty British soldier, a civilian rescue boat, and a fighter pilot. The thing that makes it unique is that each point of view is different lengths of time. They are a week, a day, and an hour respectfully. I was initially confused about the length for each viewpoint. But I realized that it is like having a race between a turtle, a runner, and a car. The car is the farthest, the runner is closer, and the turtle is the closest. The thing is that they each start at the same time and finish at the same time. And each situation and viewpoint intertwine with each other. The editing for that must have been a challenge and hats off to the editor. Other than the excellence of a technical cinematic experience, the film didn't do much for me. I didn't feel any real dread or tension during the times when it should have, some scenes went too much longer than they should have but the big thing was the rating. For me, there is always a ""what if?"" aspect to war movies, especially WWII movies, that are PG-13. As if the director is not willing to make it as realistic as possible (I should look into why Chris Nolan didn't do that. Maybe the battle of Dunkirk wasn't that bloody and I'm just a bloodthirsty kind of guy). But that really did take away the validity for me. There are bombs and bullets going off and the soldiers appear unscathed. There is no sense of consequence, just bleakness. The sense of life comes from the excellent sound, as if you are actually part of the group ducking away from the fighter jets that come across every once in awhile to take out the troops.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Very good,"For the first time basing his film on real facts, English filmmaker Christopher Nolan goes back to basics. Choose land, sea and air as scenarios of your history, exchange digital for film, in this case, 65 mm (and IMAX), snub 3D and use minimal digital effects to compose the realistic show of Dunkirk , a film that recovers a tragic but also edifying episode from the beginning of World War II.Between May and June 1940, just a few months after Nazi troops began to invade Europe, they had cornered some 400,000 Allied soldiers, many of them British, on the beach in Dunkirk, northern France. On the one hand, the Nazis were solidly armed, on the other, the sea. The chance of maritime rescue was systematically decimated by the precise attacks of German submarines and planes. Everything seemed lost and England was on the verge of becoming the next target to fall into Hitler's hands.Using, once again, the partnership with the Swiss director of photography Hoyten van Hoytema (who accompanied him in Interstellar science fiction), Nolan creates for the spectator the feeling of being inside the events, as if he were one of the soldiers cornered on the beach, one of the fighter pilots, one of the passengers on the rescue boats. And he does so using a script, also of his own, in which the dialogues are minimal and the visual and auditory power is increased to the maximum from an obsession with details that, for a long time, is the hallmark of the director's style of Amnesia and The Origin. Thus, textures, details of faces and clothes, sounds, from the smallest to the most loud, are valued, and a grandiloquent soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, materializing the whirlwind of those who were in those extreme situations.The mastery of Nolan's direction, once again, is in control of time, making simultaneous actions that unfold at different rhythms. On the beach, where the Allied troops are stationed, the facts extended for a week. At sea, cluttered with hundreds of British civilian boats that attended the patriotic summons to help the surrounded countrymen one day. And in the air, the battle of the British Spitfire fighters against enemy planes that decimated theirs on land and at sea did not last more than an hour. The feat is achieved through a precisely coordinated montage, the work of editor Lee Smith, Nolan's partner in his Batman trilogy.
With this surgical support in technique, the film never runs the risk of becoming cold because it materializes its dilemmas on the skin of some chosen characters, such as soldier Tommy (Fionn Whitehead), a skinny boy who we see escaping from some of the excruciating situations in history , alongside the silent Gibson (Aneurin Barnard) and the impetuous Alex (the singer Harry Styles, former member of the band One Direction).In a small civilian boat that comes to the rescue of the soldiers, it is impossible not to hope for the luck of its commander, Mr. Dawson (the impeccable Mark Rylance), his son Peter (Tom Glynn-Carney) and the boy George (Barry Keoghan), who keep their balance until they collect the first soldier from the sea (Cillian Murphy). In the air, pilots Collins (Jack Lowden) and Farrier (Tom Hardy) take turns chasing Nazi planes. On the beach, Commander Bolton (Kenneth Branagh) and Colonel Winnant (James D'Arcy) struggle with difficult decisions about what is projected as an immense military disaster.What matters, after all, to Nolan is what was made of this impasse in terms of injecting energy into British morale, which looked bleak at that time of the war, when the Nazis seemed unbeatable. As everyone saw later, they were not. And the more than 300,000 soldiers removed from Dunkirk by the collective work of hundreds of isolated individuals, civilians, men, women, old people, young people, had their chance to participate in the battles against fascism, which at that time were just beginning.Nominated for eight Oscars, the film won three, all in the technical category: sound editing, sound mixing and editing.Film seen on October 19, 2020.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

The inconceivable-ness of 400,000 human beings ACTUALLY having experienced that, unbelievable.Instead of character development, we are thrown straight into the action and see countless young soldiers doing everything in their power to just survive, and I think that suits this movie better.

With a lack of character development Nolan manages to make the cinematography the star,"Christopher Nolan is a great filmmaker that is undoubtable to me. He had accomplished many amazing feats and this film is no different than those. However what his past films did have that this one lacks is a really care for the characters involved and what was going on in it. This film is lacking in that aspect and instead the camera angles and the overall feel of the film is what makes you care more than the characters themselves do.I came out this film feeling a intense claustrophobic feeling throughout. There are many small areas that characters are in and the action feels so intense and it does this without any blood or gore. Instead it is all about the camera movement that makes you want to puke,tense up, and get scared for sheer life. Nolan uses the characters to put you inside the action and make you feel like you are there even if your not.It is a amazing work of art and powerful as well.

Efficiently emphasizes the horror but also beauty of war in its simplicity and elegance.,"Tick-tack. Simplicity is key. Lives on its production. Beautiful colour and cinematography. The story isn't groundbreaking. Shows the reality and true nature of the soldiers, captures the feeling of being in the center of combat. Flawless acting and great directing. In some way perfect.

Nail biting stuff,"I see the review trolls are at it again. Statements like ""Soul-less. Confused. Loud. Disappointing."" with a rating of 2/10 are actually ironic, because, that is a very accurate depiction of war. Soul-less. Confused. Loud and disappointing. There are no winners. Everybody who complains about this movie being boring and tedious has no clue about war. A lot of war is sitting around and waiting wondering what the enemy is up to, or hoping you will make the next day, which can be boring and tedious but also soul killing. I really enjoyed every aspect of this film and was invested in the characters and their survival all the way. The sound editing and Zimmer's music was also phenomenal and I was on the edge of my seat from start to finish. It was way more realistic and historically accurate than many other movies. I'd say it's an accurate depiction of war. The writer and director set out to tell the story out of the perspective of those who were trapped on the shores of Dunkirk and who escaped to tell the tale, and I can honestly say, he did a good job of it. I have never seen war first hand, but have some close relatives and friends that have seen and lived through it. Those include the Angolan war in South West Africa, as well as civil war in Northern Uganda and Southern Sudan. I have heard many first hand accounts of war, and have also seen the effect of war on people's personalities, bodies and on nature and cities up close. It's not the ""sexy"" version Hollywood has sold to us many times. It's really terrible. I can imagine after you've killed so many times, and you have seen so many people killed and mutilated around you, there are not much emotion left. The way those characters in the movie were depicted, I feel is very accurate. Everybody just keeps going. Some commit suicide. One person I knew, who died several years ago as an old man, was actually in Pearl Harbor shoveling coals on a ship because he was too young to fight. He survived the ordeal because some guy offered him a plank that kept him afloat when their ship was sunk in the harbor. He even named his son as a result of this. He did not talk much about the war, but sometimes when I drank coffee with him, he would speak about things he did and saw. He was also a POW in Japan where him and his mates were tortured. Among things, he managed to escaped by strangling his captor and torturer with bare hands. War had a permanent effect on him and his family. His daughter has told me many times, how he used to wake up screaming at night. That is war for you, and that's what is depicted in this film. I live by the ocean, am involved in maritime sea rescue and also have aviation experience. This film ticks all the boxes for me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Nolan delivers the most beautiful war film in decades,"Christopher Nolan who might be the most consistently celebrated director who makes both art and money has delivered a masterpiece. Nolan has envisaged the disaster at Dunkirk as a window on the experience of war. This is not a classic war film. With sparse dialogue, even less blood and no Germans, Nolan has given a prism which explores the battle through the lens of a thriller. Throwing away all the usual tropes the viewer is put into the film from the first scene and then spends 108 minutes surviving. The director most often compared to Nolan is Kubrick and here we can see an echo of ""Paths of Glory"", Kubrick's second and famously anti-war film set in the trenches of the Great War. Nolan takes a wide angle, a cold eye and sets it to form a triptych: three stories unfold and converge. One from the air, the sea in the form of the Home Fleet and finally from the land with the soldiers trapped on the beach. There is no overarching narrative or rhetorical flourishes but just the image and soon a magical thing occurs. The sheer humanity of the events takes your stomach and grips it as tightly as any thriller has and does not let go till the film is over. Nolan is helped immensely on all fronts. The score by Hans Zimmer is always reminding you of time. Time spent in the wrong direction can be fatal, even looking at the sun can be the difference as you hear the notes of a watch ticking away. The film is absolutely glorious. I mean arguably the most beautiful war film since ""Apocalypse Now"" and Hoyte Van Hoytema (who worked on ""Interstellar"") has created the best aerial combat I have ever seen. I am not sure how it could have been filmed. The entire vista looks real, the battleships are British and there is nary a CGI effect though the one downside is you never get the impression that there are hundreds of thousands trapped there. This is the best sound effect editing I have ever heard. These are craftsmen at the zenith of their art. The cast is impressive. Totally British as insisted by Nolan, the ensemble includes Kenneth Branagh, Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy and Mark Rylance. Fionn Whitehead is a newcomer and the closest to an audience surrogate but even there it is only because we meet him in the first scene. Everyone is strong but it is Rylance who steals the film. His nobleness in impossible times serves as a sharp contrast to modern views on duty and sacrifice. Nolan has delivered a piece of art which is hard to review. Like all great art there is a visceral experience required. There is little sentimentality and it invokes intimacy despite being on a huge canvas. It is the work of someone at their peak.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
What could have been one of the best war films in history is mired in a hash of plots and subplots with little to root for.,"Dunkirk-A Review.Dunkirk is wonderful to look at, however, it is at once too much and too little. There are too many cuts and too many subplots that it is easy to lose interest in what is happening. The cuts come quickly, which works with the air and action scenes, but holding longer on some shots would have allowed us to more deeply feel the gravity of the events.Inevitably, I found myself comparing Dunkirk to other WWII films. It holds up well, with two notable exceptions. First, the intensity and close contact action is not as impactful as the opening to ""Saving Private Ryan."" However, the tension throughout the entirety of ""Dunkirk"" surpasses ""Ryan,"" which moves aimlessly at times. I also think of the remarkable ""Das Boot"", a film that made many sympathize, me included, with Nazis in a submarine. The tension in that German classic is at a level that ""Dunkirk"" doesn't match, and ""Das Boot"" never relents until the ending.Moreover, in ""Das Boot"", we get to know the captain well, how he cares about each man in his command and we see his fear. That makes the film more interesting for us. There is one setting in Das Boot, a submarine, and that's all. The film's limited scope increases the tension and our attachment to each character.What was also lacking in the film was a sense of the war in general. Das Boot was able to show us the futility of war and how the leaders in Germany made huge strategic mistakes. Little of that comes across in Dunkirk.Dunkirk shows a great rescue but ignores the fact that this operation was only required because the Allies underestimated Germany's forces and were outflanked by the Nazi advance when the Allies failed to anticipate a German Blitz through the Ardennes. The military strategists were so inept that the whole British army almost went balls up during the retreat.Not all the subplots in Dunkirk work well. A subplot involving a volunteer civilian ship-mate, George, is awkward and unnecessary. Certainly, Nolan wants us to empathize with all the British citizens who aided in the rescue. He also wants us to understand the ""shell shock"" (PTSD) that the soldiers went through. Both the bravery of the volunteers and suffering of the soldiers was clear throughout the film and a tacked on, haphazard conflict on a civilian boat was not well thought out. The scene is an insipid distraction from the core of the film. However, the depictions of shell shock in general were realistic and impactful.There was also a scene featuring a beached vessel that added nothing to the story but another subplot to distract us from more interesting characters and plot lines. In this way, the film is reminiscent of disaster films from the 70s where each character faces life and death challenges and we briefly see what happens to each one of them. But we don't need to see what happens to every character and every way the soldiers were stranded. All the plots and actions leave us too scattered to deeply care about any of them.The acting was surprisingly flat with two exceptions: Mark Rylance as a private ship captain Mr. Dawson and Tom Glynn-Carney who plays his son Peter. More about their story and bravery and less about the tacked on George would have improved this film.Kenneth Branagh as Commander Bolton is a waste of talent here. His dialogue is a clumsy attempt to explain the gravity of the situation, but it added little that the battle footage didn't already show us. Moreover, Branagh's stares into space did nothing for the film. But he does look good in that uniform.Hans Zimmer's soundtrack is overwrought and melodramatic, much like John Williams score for Schindler's list, Zimmer wants to make sure we FEEL things. More subtlety would have served this film well. And the unnecessary discordant drones and grinding sounds added to some of the battle scenes were annoying and distracting. The sounds of war: the machines, the engines, the bombs, the bullets, are compelling enough. There was no need to embellish them. I would suggest that Mr. Zimmer stick to standard action films like ""Inception"" as I have suggested that Williams stick to films like ""Jaws"" and ""Star Wars."" Serious dramas demand less bravado and more nuance.Though the story is bloated with characters and subplots, there were some great directorial choices in ""Dunkirk."" First, the lack of machoism is refreshing. While there is a lot of posturing and anger in the film, what clearly comes across is that many of the soldiers were rightfully scared and enduring as best they could. There were no John Wayne characters on the beaches, or in this case Benjamin Cumberbatch, proclaiming that the British were going to punch the Nazi's in the nose.Another good directorial choice is not stereotyping the Germans as 'evil.' Certainly, the Nazi leadership was a humanity hating force of slaughter, but the film focused of the heroic British, French and other allies.The cinematography is excellent and the cameras were masterfully placed in the film. An award for cinematography could be granted Hoyte Van Hoytema for degree of difficulty alone.Rating: Matinée. What could have been one of the best war films in history is mired in a hash of plots and subplots with little to root for. Still, seeing it in 70 mm is a treat worth the viewing.Peace, Tex Shelters",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
The Best War Movie That I Have Watched Since Saving Private Ryan. My Personal Best Movie Of This Year,"My Personal Rating 8/10Short Review -Dunkirk is a war film that shows us how terrifying being stuck in a war can be. instead of focus on character's development like most war films do, christopher nolan did not included many talkings because of he wants to show us that in a middle of a war we cannot just sit and talk about the character's back story instead we jumped into their situation and now watch them how to survive and endure being in that situation. that i understand that's the main difference between this film and the considered best war film ""Saving Private ryan"" the atmosphere and soundtrack of this film is so superb that it gives us chills the feel of fear of war, the trauma it caused. that's what i exactly felt watching this. horror is not the right term for this film it shows us how terrifying a war can be.Impressions -Dunkirk is an excellent film. what i love more about this film is the cinematography beautiful shots from the aerial combat the special non cgi effects the atmosphere. the soundtrack the plot did not mattered that much and in my opinion not that special but the way this film's message to us. telling us of the story is the superb. giving us the message by feeling it through soundtrack and seeing it on character's reaction being on that situation. amazing film. my personal best movie of this year hands down. and i will definitely gonna watch this film again.Downsides - Dunkirk is not a film about a war hero. Dunkirk is not a film for everyone especially people who only cares about characters. Dunkirk's intention of just jumping in to the situation might not suit everyone. it did to me. but i'm seeing some people that are not satisfied with it. just like what i said above this film's intention is different than other war films do and in my opinion that makes it unique and love it even more.Pros:Great CinematographyGreat Sound DesignRealistic DogFightRealistic Sound EffectsNo CGIThe Tension And Fear While You Watch This Film Especially On IMAXThe Timeline Between The Land, Sea, And Air.Very Immersive AmosphereCons:There is No Unique Story About CharactersThis Movie Did Not Even Had Any Memorable Dramatic MomentsNot For Everyone Especially If You Like Story.Rating On Each AspectStory: 6/10

A Nolan Masterpiece!!,"Although Momento which starred Guy Pearce isn't Nolan's best film but Inception, Interstellar, and Dark Knight have done more justice to his filmography than the first film. Christopher Nolan is known to be a magician to Hollywood which starts from the commendable cinematography to the scintillating editing and to its labyrinth screenplay.Over the last decade, Nolan hasn't failed in any of these aspects and kept all his films on a consistent flow.Dunkirk was something I was looking forward to especially the beautiful IMAX trailer they put up together.So the movie is about what happens in WW2 in 1940 where Germany invades France trapping military troops on the Dunkirk beach. But with the help of British forces and French forces, how they manage to get more than 300,000 soldiers evacuated and back home is basically what this film is about.Quite frankly, this film was a phenomenon. How Nolan manages to present the Dunkirk evacuation in the film will keep you to the edge of your seat. The screenplay is very gripping and has that historical feel once you watch the film.The acting is your ticket to a good money spender.Fionn Whitehead's debut is everyone's treat. His role as the British pilot was fabulous and his nuanced performance is a must watch.Harry Styles acting quite surprised me. I always thought of him as a music lover by but he is getting better and better. He was so self-balanced that he is ready to hit it big in Hollywood.Cillian Murphy surely had that scarecrow mentality which is not bad thing but his role as the soldier was something similar and not different but he was good but could've minority been better.Hans Zimmer is a must when it comes to orchestrated composition. The ticking score was something perfect and how it was composed in the film. The score for the tide and how it was depicted during the evacuation was great.The cinematography was beautiful especially shooting it in an IMAX format which makes it more eye opening for the audience even surprisingly on how it was edited.Please watch this in IMAX!!4.5/5- Nolan can only satisfy a good weekend!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

I wish we had more time to focus on singular subjects to understand the depth of the war, i couldnt find myself feeling the character or i didnt feel aroused by the cormadery that is presented in the film, I am Nolan and this film for me is too much of Nolan's bad qualities and too little of his good.

The immersive 'experience' of war that highlights human insignificance,"Dunkirk tells the well known British story of the decisive WWII battle held at Dunkirk, ""The Miracle of Dunkirk."" Dunkirk is a brilliant atmospheric drama/thriller, it serves brilliantly as to tell the story of a historical event from multiple perspectives through immersing audiences in the midst of the battle and the intensity of the atmosphere.Dunkirk made the stylistic choice to not let audiences get attached to any one character and truly is highlighting the horrors and struggles of the event itself. It focuses on the situation rather than the characters as most war film does, as a result we never get much backstory on any characters and many characters can be confusing to follow and connect with. However as I said this is a stylistic choice not a production flaw and it is a decision that I liked. I liked that Christopher Nolan chose a less conventional route to tell a war story and I think that this is a very interesting way of depicting an event that for the participants must seem extremely dire and helpless.Tom Hardy once again does an amazing job despite once again having half his face covered, yet he still manages to do such an amazing work with his eyes alone. Other than Hardy, Harry Style's acting debut also delivered well and I am looking forward to any of his future works.In fact it seems like a direct personal comment from Nolan to the audience of the true atrocities and horrors of war, by not highlighting the story behind these individuals they seem to lose significance and character almost as if they never existed, now this is a powerful statement in contrary to the clichéd war film trope that depict things like, valorous men charging into battle, widows and children receiving the country's honors, men sharing stories in the thick of battle. No, Nolan chose not to glorify war by showing us what great characters these people are but chooses to throw out the stone cold truth of the insignificance of men in the thick of war and under the mercy of fighter planes. In fact it is even highlighted at one point that prime minister Winston Churchill demands a certain amount of men to return as if they were just statistics and figures, this is a film that doesn't shy away from the political truths of war and serves to caution and remind us of the horrors of war, a reminder to audiences to get their head out of some sort of a dramatised glorified depiction of war.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"""Dunkirk"" is an innovative, well-crafted, engrossing and enjoyable film.","The World War II battle and evacuation portrayed in director Christopher Nolan's ""Dunkirk"" (PG-13, 1:46) involved no American troops, but had a big impact on the U.S. role – a full year and a half before it (officially) joined the fight. As the Nazi blitzkrieg swept through France, Belgium and the Netherlands in May of 1940, the armies of those countries, and their ally Great Britain, were pushed westward until they were trapped in the area around Dunkirk, France (near the Belgian border), with nowhere to go but into the English Channel. Nearly 400,000 of them.Nolan's trademark creativity led him to write and direct this film as a triptych, telling three related stories which took different periods of time to unfold, but showing them running concurrently throughout the film. A slate on the screen introduces each narrative (and the amount of time that it represents) from the first shot of each: ""1. The Mole | One Week"" (a mole being a pier-like, but solid breakwater built out from the beach); ""2. The Sea | One Day""; ""3. The Air | One Hour"". Once each of those printed designations fades from the screen, the movie moves back and forth between stories.On the beach, close to 400,000 men awaited their fate, whether it be rescue or annihilation. The German Army (which is barely shown and referred to only as ""the enemy"") has the British, French, Belgian and Dutch troops surrounded on three sides, with the channel blocking their escape on the fourth. The Germans seem content, at least for the moment, to keep the troops bottled up on the beach and pick them off from the air with strafing missions and bomb the ships and boats attempting rescue. Among those struggling to survive on the beach are Tommy (Fionn Whitehead), a British soldier who barely escapes unseen German rifles to make it to the mole, Gibson (Aneurin Barnard), a mysterious soldier with whom Tommy teams up and Alex (Harry Styles), another soldier whom they end up saving from a sinking ship and with whom they explore various opportunities to save themselves. When one of their plans goes awry, they end up overhearing a conversation in which a British naval commander (a composite character played by Kenneth Branagh) discusses with other officers how dire the situation is.On the sea, the British ships aren't up to the task of a rescue operation under these conditions. The Admiralty is unwilling to send over more than one large ship at a time for fear of losing ships that may be desperately needed for a last-ditch defense of the British Isles against an expected German invasion. Many of the smaller ships and boats that do arrive to assist with the rescue find themselves unable to navigate the shallow waters at Dunkirk, and only a few of them can even get close enough to load men who have walked out onto the mole. The attempted solution is for British naval officers on the English side of the channel to commandeer just about anything that floats to make the crossing to either bring soldiers back or ferry them from the shore out to the larger ships. Some boat owners take up the challenge personally out of a sense of duty and compassion. One of those is a mariner named Dawson (Oscar winner Mark Rylance), who brings along his teenage son (Tom Glynn-Carney) and his son's friend, George (Barry Keoghan). Their first encounter with someone who needs rescuing is a downed pilot (Cillian Murphy) who is on the verge of an emotional breakdown and becomes a danger to the mission.In the air, a squadron of three RAF pilots (including Tom Hardy and Jack Lowden) patrol the skies for Luftwaffe planes and, when they find them, try to shoot them down to keep them from shooting the soldiers on the beach or bombing the ships and boats trying to rescue them. They doggedly and heroically pursue their mission, in spite of the unpredictability and danger of the Luftwaffe planes, very limited (dwindling) fuel supplies and the loss of comrades. As this and the other two narratives develop, the movie interweaves all three stories and brings each to logical, but fairly unpredictable conclusions.""Dunkirk"" is an innovative, well-crafted and enjoyable film. Nolan (best known for his ""Dark Knight"" trilogy, ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"") effectively joins his three differently-paced narratives (although the back-and-forth between day and night in the beach scenes can be a little disorienting). His script contains a relatively small amount of dialog, instead building suspense by concentrating on the details of what's happening and showing all of it through the eyes of his actors. He chose to cast (mostly) unknown actors in order to focus on the characters' personal stories and he conducted an exhaustive casting process to make sure his approach would bear fruit. (And it did, even with the casting of One Direction singer Harry Styles in his first film role.) Nolan also shot using creative and evocative camera angles, he favored practical effects (rather than an overuse of green-screen technology) for his crowd scenes and action sequences and put a lot of effort into shooting with authentic period planes, ships and boats, some of which participated in the Dunkirk evacuation in 1940. Oh, and Hans Zimmer's original score (complete with a synthesized version of Nolan's own pocket watch ticking away the time) stands out. In short, Christopher Nolan has dramatized a vital, but under-appreciated chapter of World War II history in a style that is all his own and has made a film that should appeal to Movie Fans of all styles. The little that it lacks in excitement, back story and narrative cohesion as compared to more traditional war films, it mostly makes up for in artistic and entertainment value.

"A visual,immersive and emotional experience not to be missed","Don't listen to the people who are kinda overwhelmed by the huge wave of positive response and feel the need to nitpick this movie.This movie is like Radiohead's Kid A,where we finally see Nolan come into his own.A war movie with a concept that is mostly original which is absolutely rare in this modern day and age of movies.Every one is saying how this movie lacks emotion,when i was in the theater, a lot of people were in tears including me.Even if you do not like this movie,this is a visual experience like no other.But i agree,if you do a little bit of research about the battle and the importance of it beforehand,this movie will make you think about it for days and days.This movie puts you in the soldier's places,immerses you and horrifies you.This movie also shows you what sacrifice the soldiers made for you and me.This movie also reflects life itself kinda.This is a must see,no questions asked.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"This movie is not really a movie, it is art, and this review will treat it as such.","First of all this movie is not really an entertainment product. Therefore what you know about film is now invalid. In order to truly understand this film you must expect it to be nothing like a movie you know. If you do not, you will not be able to see this film for what it really is, let go of prejudice and comparisons, because they don't apply.Step 2: Due to cultural heritage of movies, letting go can be tricky, especially if you are a younger viewer, whose knowledge about movies is based on the MCU. This is because of dialogue and especially the kind of dialogue you are used to in movies where people die and baddies are really powerful. You will not find any dialogue to paint the background of any character. It is widely understood that a character must be specially known in order to care about him or her. However, there is no point in making a flat generic cliché story to really understand that this character is really important, if you actually don't have unimportant people to begin with. Caring about a few people out of 400000 is actually if you think about it a little messed up. We humans are equally important when it comes to our lives. Usually promoting one soldier in a war movie and defining bad people is done through cannon fodder stand ins and mass murder on gigantic scale, or just crucifying key people. However, if you see things from a more sane perspective, all lives matter, and if you were one of them you might find that desperation makes you think about yourself as more important. Once you find something different that is then a reason why. If 400000 soldiers are desperate, and one need to go for the pack to survive what would you do were you one of them?Step 3 - watch the movie: There are no soap opera scenes, you will experience that bullets are terrifying. But most importantly look not to dialogue but to actions and situation to understand what is going on, where do they look what are their motives behind this and that action, and finally listen to the environment. They say that an image says more than a thousand words, or as Batman would put it: It's not who I am underneath, but my actions that defines me. This is a movie where you are meant to feel and observe the full experience. Because this war movie is as real as they get. Forget about faces and look at them as anyone even yourself, understand that who Harry Styles and Tom Hardy are really don't matter. The point is exactly that you shouldn't be able to tell, as they are not meant to be important, they are all just people fighting for their lives. England already lost the battle, they need their soldiers home if they are to not lose the war too! Each soldier want to be the one who survives, thus important characters ruins the plot; anarchy. This movie is really a window into the past, and one which quite accurately actually show what happened. Which is truly astonishing and terrifying.Before concluding, we must understand that time in this movie plays a central part, as the noose tightens, so does the 3 time-lines, which get more and more intertwined, this means more and more cuts, because each time line has a different time span. These cuts are made with care and the music gets more and more intense as we go, it really is something you won't appreciate fully until you have left the cinema! This movie also looks beautiful, but it has to be authentic if you are to believe you are there. It is very rare I sit in a cinema and actually get physically engaged, I don't really recall that happening, not even with cheap jump scares. This movie is psychologically really heavy on a subconscious level, and you really should think about pg-13 if your children are not mentally strong, but it takes an intelligent and adult mind to also truly grasp the horrors fully, war crimes are being committed and they are not imprinted in your subconscious disbelief that these things actually happened in real life, but the true horror is that they did. Acknowledging the care and effort the director put in this movie is the only fair thing to do... you may not like what you see for entertainment, but that's not really the point either! This is art, a TRUE master piece. This is something else, which is what in my eyes is the best movie ever made, outstanding and incomparable. It is like saying that Mona Lisa is better than the statue of David, it doesn't really make sense. You may like the painting more than the statue, but that doesn't mean that the statue is better. What makes this movie better than any other movie to me, is that the director cared and broke all rules, because he followed his own. This movie might not be for you, but if people don't feel connected to the horrors of this movie, they simply didn't know how to appreciate it. Thus the two opinions on this movie are those who didn't get the point and people who don't like what it is, and then those who loved it and can appreciate it for what it is, however there are most definitely those who think any movie by Christopher Nolan is a master piece, and I don't think they are honest to them selves. Dunkirk is a master piece, and thus by definition and its own rules it can only be 10/10... but a thing of which there are only one, it's both the best and the worst.

"Good movie, but wasted opportunity","I had high hopes for this movie, but was ultimately left a little disappointed.Everyone knows the Dunkirk story, and how the steely determination of a nation helped rescue hundreds of thousands of stranded soldiers from the beaches of France. As Churchill noted, it was a miraculous escape, but wars aren't won with evacuations.Anyhow, the movie was well acted, and well-enough made, but it felt as though they didn't really convey the true scale of the evacuation. Some 800 boats were used to transfer more than 300,000 soldiers from France to the U.K., so surely the English Channel should've been filled with boats. The movie just seemed to focus on a few boats, and a few soldiers, and it didn't do a particularly great job of illustrating the true scale of the evacuation. It was almost as though they were trying to save money by not having to recreate the scene.One thing I did like though was that there didn't seem to be a ""star"" of the movie. There were many well-known faces, including Kenneth Branagh, Cilian Murphy, Harry Styles (who was actually not bad) and others. But they all had relatively small parts, and clearly weren't brought in to ""Hollywood-ize"" the movie, which was a good thing. It wanted to focus on the story rather than the famous names playing the roles.Ultimately though, the story was a little disjointed, and it could've been told much better. I can't quite fathom why this has an 8+ rating on IMDB, it's more of a 6.8 IMHO.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Christopher Nolan created a masterpiece once again,"Christopher Nolan's World War II epic ""Dunkirk"" showcases the best and worst of the director's tendencies. The best win out and the worst recede in memory when you think back on the experience-provided that you want to remember ""Dunkirk,"" a movie that's supposed to be grueling and succeeds. Less of a war film and more of a disaster (or survival) picture, it's an ensemble work that chronicles the evacuation of British soldiers who got trapped in the harbor and on the beaches of Dunkirk, France, in late May and early June of 1940, with the Germans, who had driven Allied forces practically out to sea, closing in for one last sweep. And if you see the movie in one of the handful of theaters showing it in 70mm IMAX format, the experience will feel even more constricting and oppressive because of the image's unusual shape. It's close to the old-fashioned ""Academy"" ratio common to films made in cinema's early decades: squarish, tall instead of wide. That means that when you're in the cockpit of a fighter diving towards the water, or running behind an infantryman dodging German snipers, the idea of ""tunnel vision,"" a phrase spoken by many a catastrophe survivor, comes to life onscreen. The film has its share of stumbling blocks. One is the persistent anonymity of the characters; just because a gambit is a conscious part of the film's design doesn't mean it always works, and there are moments you may wonder whether treating supporting players as something other than glorified cannon fodder might have resulted in a film as emotionally powerful as it is viscerally overwhelming. Another miscalculation is the score, by Hans Zimmer, a Jungian din of booming drums, bum-vibrating synth chords, and cawing string effects that loses much of its power by refusing to shut up, even when silence or ambient war noise might have been just as effective, or more so. The overuse of Zimmer's music has been an issue throughout Nolan's career, but here may become an object of debate. The situations and images are so vivid that the score often seems to be trying to rescue a film that doesn't need its help.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Respectful disagreement,"I respectfully disagree; did this movie lack intensity? Watching war films without feeling the visceral horror and tension of battle is truly underwhelming. ""Saving Private Ryan"" immerses you in World War 2 with bullets whizzing by, explosions ripping through, and bodies trembling, evoking spine-chilling shivers. However, ""Dunkirk"" appears orderly and sanitized, lacking that crucial sense of raw tension.I struggled to connect with any of the characters, as they seemed devoid of heroism and depth, leaving me with the impression of mere character actors.The cinematography stood out as a strong point.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Dunkirk is Okay but Underwhelming,"Dunkirk is the latest film by Christopher Nolan. As usual people are praising his film as a masterpiece. I'm a fan of Nolan so I wanted to love this film like everyone else. However, I have to be honest; this is one of his weaker films, in my opinion. I'm not the biggest fan of war movies, so that doesn't help either. I would put this over The Prestige and The Dark Knight Rises, but every other film he's made I think is better. I would even put Interstellar over this. I'm not the biggest fan of war films, so that doesn't help either. Though, this is certainly not the best war movie I've seen either. The film isn't bad, but it's painfully average.The plot is very simple. The Germans have pushed the British and the French back to the beaches of Dunkirk. Military vessels and plains are in short supply so civilian boats are mobilized to rescue the stranded troops on the beach. The rest of the film is the soldiers surviving on the beach as the civilian vessels make their way there.The film does some things well. From a technical aspect Dunkirk is amazing. The film looks great, and the effects are amazing, as one would expect from a Nolan film. It has the typical gray, bleak look to it, like in most Nolan movies, but it fit the tone of the film and gave it a good atmosphere. The music also fit very well.The action scenes are alright for what they are. This is not action-heavy war movie, but a survival war picture. Do not expect wall-to-wall action in that sense. I also like how the Germans are never seen throughout the flick, but there presence is still heavily felt. The few fight scenes we do get are okay at best. Some of the action gets confusion, and becomes difficult to tell who is fighting who.The issue with this movie is that it gets dull. This is one of Nolan's shorter films, at two hours, yet you can still feel the length at times. Some scenes feel unnecessary or are dragged out for too long.The characters are also dull. That's the film's main problem is that all of the characters are boring. The acting is fine, but the characters they are not that interesting; none of them. Cillian Murphy, a great actor, is wasted in this role. It's not that I hated any of the characters, but I wasn't invested in any of them either.That's a problem, because characters are essential getting invested in a story. If you have good characters the viewers are on that journey with them and feel what they feel. Since I wasn't invested in the characters the film did not hit nearly as hard with me as it should have. The message of Dunkirk is the same as any war film. It wants to convey to the audience how terrible war is. However, there are so many war movies that do this better because they have a better cast that resonates with you.Overall, Dunkirk is a mixed bag. It's an okay movie that's worth one watch. However, there are better war films, and certainly better Christopher Nolan movies, out there.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
A classical and finest masterpiece completely memorable,"This is no doubt the finest masterpiece that has been created since Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan and the best movie that Christopher Nolan had ever created.As he had done a good direction on his previous acclaimed works such as the Dark Knight trilogy, Inception, and Interstellar; Christopher Nolan has finally made a finest craft that will remembered as a finest classic in the years to come. As memorable as it is, Hans Zimmer's musical score is completely bombastic and full of suspense that connects to the story.Even the performances of the cast are great, plus the non-linear narrative is also excellent reminding on how this technique that was used on Pulp Fiction can make this movie awesome.The story above all that talks on survival, tension, and the spirit of humanity gradually makes this movie completely spectacular and amazing!Definitely calling as an Academy Award winning film for Best Picture!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Nolan's new Masterpiece to behold,"Dunkirk or also known as Dunkerque is a true-story of teamwork, heroism and humanity which took place during the World War II. British soldiers are surrounded on all sides by Germans as are French soldiers. The film focuses mainly on British soldiers, and the presence of French soldiers as war- allies is addressed as well.Before watching it, I already was super-hyped for it, it was after all my most anticipated film of the year along with Call Me by Your Name, and Oh My God, it did not disappoint. What an incredible movie, it is not just my favorite movie of 2017 by far so far, but also my favorite Nolan film.Nolan's new masterpiece, instant-classic, film-treasure or whatever one wants to address it like, is an incredible achievement not just only for directing, but most of all an achievement for technical aspects of cinema. Every sound detail, the score (I'll get to that later), cinematography, editing, sound editing and of course the directing by one and only Christopher Nolan were perfection to witness. I don't know if Dunkirk will win Best Picture but Nolan will win the Best Director Oscar, I wasn't this impressed by directors work this decade, not even by Birdman, Gravity, The Revenant, La La Land and they all won Best Director.The story, the story is real, it happened. Would you believe it could've happened if it wasn't a proved true story, would you think it can only be fiction? Probably not. Just try to imagine it: Dunkirk a Film by Christopher Nolan When 400,000 soldiers couldn't get home; Home came for them. And after you watched the movie. Two scenes in particular were so scary to imagine being real but how many soldiers died that way in WWII? Countless. And also there is character development and you really feel for them, especially George, Peter and Mr. Dawson, but still none of the characters are going to be iconic like Oscar Schindler is, because, again the story doesn't center around one, ultimate hero.So many things I love about the film, the only criticism of the movie was that there's no character development. It was so smart of Nolan to not give one of the characters a girlfriend he loves so much and he probably knows he will never see her again but he has to serve his country. The film starts at the event, the evacuation at the mole took a whole week, it took civilians one day to come to Dunkirk and the air force fought for an hour. Why adding an irreverent story for just one character when the whole point of Dunkirk wasn't just about one person? I did like every performance by every actor, it doesn't have a lead character as all of those soldiers that got saved, the civilians that helped, and the air-force were all heroes; Churchill too.The three actors I think are really stand-outs for me at least are Mark Rylance, Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy, but of course, everyone does a great job. Mark Rylance is the only Oscar winning actor in the movie, and although he won the Oscar for being quiet he proves those who thought he didn't show anything besides a quiet character, well he can yell. And Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy are such a professionals. Tom's just great in everything and he owns every scene he's in, and Cillian is one of the most underrated actors of today. And I saved my favorite part for last: Hans freaking Zimmer's score is eye-opening, the best score he's ever done by far and Supermarine is one of the best pieces of music ever. While I was going home, I still felt like I heard the music, every sound I heard I tried to make Supermarine of it, and I still feel like I hear it. An unforgettable experience.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"Staggering cinema.  Not ""getting it"" is very much on you...","It' s 1940, 400,000 allied troops are cornered and cut off on the beaches of Dunkirk; with the enemy closing in, and no cover or defence, they await annihilation or a miracle. We experience the moment as the characters do, without unnecessary exposition or dialogue! This proves quite the departure for Nolan; there is a lot here that owes more to silent cinema than anything else, but his images often say all that needs to be said.An opening frame invites us to join a group of soldiers. Next, the loudest onslaught of gunfire kicks the film into another gear. We are given as much pause for thought as the soldiers we follow. We run with Tommy, played here by a Fionn Whitehead, and like him, we are aware of comrades falling dead next to us, but it is all panic and no time; we will lament their loss later. Set to the ticking of a watch, we feel Tommy's heart pounding with ours, and we know the tone for this audacious movie has been set.We see the event from different perspectives and from within different time frames. Right now, not many directors can build momentum like Nolan. The jumping to and from different characters' point of view, the corkscrewing impression of the editing, events echoed and mirrored by Hans Zimmer's Shepherd's Tones and persistent, all enveloping score, acting at times more like sound design than music; it all results in a constant rise in tension, to the point of almost being exhaustive.This said, the editing also serves another purpose. The ""Miracle of Dunkirk"" is a grand story, with every soldier, every pilot, and every civilian having their own point of view. Nolan wants us to build up an overall picture of the event purely through subjective experience, so of course we spend a tiring week with the terrified boys. Of course we spend a desperate day with a fisherman as he and his familial crew sail their way into action. Lastly, given the fuel constraints of the RAF, whose decisions had to be immediate and impulsive, always a choice between defending the beach or getting home, why would we spend any more that an edge-of-your-seat, quickly-cut hour in the cockpit of a Spitfire, as they do their duty and enter into dogfights to keep the German aircraft at bay? Each timeline is contracted or dilated to give everybody equal measure and importance, whilst staying true to and very much in their situation. Yes, this means we're kept on our toes; we have moments of confusion as timelines cross over and we see the same thing happening from another point of view, but as we head into the finale, as well as the aforementioned tension and release (which is just exciting cinema), we also get to see how, despite very different perspectives, everyone was working together, and how sacrifice and struggle for duty were par for the course for all involved, whether other people knew it or not. It is important that we the audience recognise this bigger picture, and as everything clicks together in an emotive final convergence of efforts, we not only see the justification for the techniques adopted, but struggle to imagine the story told another way. That is, at least, without going down a standard route, with objective storytelling employed.A proper review not being complete without comment on the elephant in the room, it must be said that Harry Styles does not stand out like the proverbial sore thumb at all. Frankly, he carries his scenes with aplomb, and surely, following the Heath Ledger lesson, and now this, it is time we learned that, maybe, Christopher Nolan just knows what he's doing better that we do? As to the other big names, there are moments from that remain with me so long after having seen it: Kenneth Brannagh and Mark Rylance can say so much with so little, their faces and gestures doing the heavy lifting to deliver a lot of the human emotion, and it would appear Tom Hardy has Oscar-worthy eyes! You need see nothing more through the course of his drama to have a complete sense of the type of man his Farrier is. We talk about great acting and achieving realism through imagination, but with the knowledge that Nolan actually took everyone to Dunkirk, sank real ships, sailed real ships, flew real Spitfires overhead, employed real explosions on the beach, and even rejected green screen and CGI in favour of cardboard cut-outs, it seems imagination wasn't too necessary for these already consummate actors.Nolan's principle fan base will be well prepared for what they get; but with his insistence on holding back from the audience any perspective not afforded his characters, ala 'Memento', some knowledge of the ""Miracle Of Dunkirk"" might put the more casual viewer in better stead. Regardless of which camp you fall into, or indeed of whether or not the movie does it for you, certain things are for sure: With no melodrama or cheese, and no superfluous fluff or emotional subterfuge, 'Dunkirk' is a purely experiential movie, a technical marvel of a war film unlike any other I can name. It also stands as a beacon in Nolan's career, characterised by his desire to cultivate an audience willing to keep up with him. And perhaps most importantly, this is a key moment in world history that is often overlooked; a disaster averted which, had it not been, would have seen the history books written very differently. That this event has been marshalled by a confident and sincere director, who has surely by now cemented his name alongside those of his own heroes, is reason enough to see 'Dunkirk'.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Breathtaking,"The time spent in the cinema flew by in a second. I really did not expect much, and honestly went to see the movie because I wanted to learn more about that event. But....as I said, it was breathtaking. The event itself is horrible and shocking....but the way Nolan saw it gave me chills. The camera, the sounds, music, great performance from actors...and not made in the shape of Hollywood blockbuster is the reason why I recommend it to all who want to see a great movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"A Visual Marvel, Minus Soul!","Written, Co-Produced and Directed by Christopher Nolan. 'Dunkirk' is a magnificent technical achievement, that is a feast for the eyes. Nolan, a master in his craft, sadly fails as a Writer, delivering a War Epic that's ambitious & huge in scale, but also soulless. Its definitely a well-made film, but not in the level of how a Nolan motion-picture generally is.'Dunkirk' Synopsis: Allied soldiers from Belgium, the British Empire and France are surrounded by the German army and evacuated during a fierce battle in World War II.'Dunkirk' puts 3 different time-lines together & jumbles them into a king-sized narrative. The film begins with a flourishing impact, showing us how the soldiers are in constant havoc. What follows is how survival is at stake & how the carnage of war can damage those who go at the battlefield to protect their nation. Nolan handsomely mounts a visually staggering war epic, that doesn't have a single frame that lacks ambition or genuine skill. The war depicted here in 'Dunkirk' is intense & hardcore, that's sure to leave you disturbed.BUT, 'Dunkirk' lacks a cohesive Screenplay. Nolan's Screenplay is packed with intensity, but is too busy to make us feel for its heroic characters. Seen from three perspectives, 'Dunkirk' has too many characters, but not for one, do you feel for. And that's indeed disappointing, considering this is a film about War Heroes. Nolan crowds the film with three perspectives, but forgets too give its characters depth. And that's certainly unacceptable from a guy like Nolan. Nolan made Superhero films that were more about the heroes without the capes, and delivered an affecting family-drama while indulging in the Sci-Fi zone last time, but in 'Dunkirk' there is not a single character that you'll remember or even, feel for, despite their heroic courage. Nolan's Writing is a letdown & comes up as a minus.Nolan's Direction is marvelous. He's a master at his craft & the atmosphere he sets in here, is simply terrific. How I wish his Writing was as strong as his Direction. Hans Zimmer's Score is magnificent & turns 'Dunkirk' into a heart-pounding experience. Hoyte van Hoytema's Cinematography is astounding. The lens-man has filmed each & every frame, with flawlessness. Lee Smith's Editing is razor-crisp. Art & Costume Design are fantastic. The Choerography of the War-Sequences, are tremendous. As mentioned earlier, 'Dunkirk' is a remarkable technical achievement.Talking of performances, its only Tom Hardy as Farrier, a Royal Air Force pilot & the Legendary Kenneth Branagh as Commander Bolton, the pier-master during the evacuation, who stand out.On the whole, 'Dunkirk' is certainly a well-made film with plus points, but the lack of depth in its characters, are hard to ignore. Its a crushing disappointment.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
This is a great war film because of the things it didn't do.,"Dunkirk was literally my third war movie at the cinema in a roll. It started with War for the Planet of the Apes, which was one of the most evocative and unsettling human war films I have seen. It was followed by a Japanese anime, In This Corner of the World, an exquisite time-capsule of a movie, which showed me a new way the harrowing story of Hiroshima could be told. Then there was Dunkirk and what a film this is. I can't remember the last time I sat in stunned silence as the end-credits rolled, my mind awashed with the feeling that I have touched greatness. This is not just an excellent film, it is a great war film and it is great because of the things it didn't do.A word search of ""dunkirk"" in IMDb threw up 19 entries! (N-n-n-nineteen in the metallic voice of Paul Hardcastle's 19 😬) I had no idea the evacuation of Dunkirk became the inspiration of so many films and documentaries. First up, Christopher Nolan didn't need to serve up a history lesson again. A few simple opening sentences give context and we are thrown into the deep end. Dunkirk is about men trying to survive into the next hour with the onslaught of danger coming from every conceivable angle, plain and simple. It is how Nolan goes about showcasing it that is sheer masterclass.When was the last time you saw a war film without someone screaming jingoistic slogans in your face or not seeing a scene of a conflicted protagonist trying to justify the reason for war? When was the last time you not see scenes of carnage and human viscera? When was the last time you not see the face of the enemy in a fire-fight? These are practically the foundation of which the war genre is built on, but Dunkirk never treads the path of familiarity. Heck! It doesn't even have a single drop of blood (the bloodied bandage on the wounded soldier is not counted 😊). But yet the tension is so nerve-wrecking, the fear so real that I gripped the armrests for dear life and I thought I forget to breathe for over an hour.The dialogue is so spare and functional, it might as well have been a silent film with sound effects, but yet my entire being was transfixed on the big screen, ogling at the spellbinding vistas of war from the land, air and sea. The characters, what characters, are nameless, but yet their fear is so palpable they are instantly relatable. The heroics of ordinary folks is monumental but never felt emotionally manipulative. The cinematography is astonishing, recreating the combat of WWII so marvellously. I felt like I was running with the hapless soldiers or trapped in a God forsaken place praying for deliverance.Hans Zimmer's music score is an interesting detour from the usual soundtracks of blockbusters. It has no recognisable melody or an infectious refrain that will cement itself into your consciousness. It is largely monochromatic, like a few repetitive notes linked together, but by golly it worked. This is a score that makes absolute no sense when you play on your hi-fi system, but together with what transpires on screen the music feels larger than life, building that suspense to a mind-blowing crescendo. IMHO the music and the action share a symbiotic relationship, each element helping the other to create the biggest impact. On its own it wouldn't have worked as well, but together, it is a masterpiece.There are some superb films I have seen this year, but so far there is only one great film – Dunkirk. Throw away all you think you know about war films and immerse yourself in the biggest possible screen (that would be the IMAX and it is worth every cent) and feel the crushing blow of grim defeat. Next year's Oscars may be far away, but I am willing to bet my bottom dollar that the Academy will remember this big time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Certainly the worst movie of Nolan!!,"First of all I admit that I am probably the biggest fan of Nolan and a true admirer of him.His past few films are like Bible to me. However being a true movie buff, I must say that this is not the best of Nolan. Neither this is will come in the top 5 war movie movie list. Nolan's specialty is building characters, great dialogues,thrills, engaging climax etc. I am sorry to say that all these are missing here. You do not feel for any of the characters in the movie. My verdict is this that this is the worst movie from Christopher Nolan( I am really sorry to say this!!))",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"Forgettable, Dull and Absolutely Overrated","""Dunkirk"" is a forgettable and dull war film absolutely overrated in IMDb. There is no character development and the viewer does not care for anybody who lives or dies. The shallow screenplay is awful and the Batle of Dunkirk is limited to the evacuation of the Allied soldiers, most of them British, that stay in lines on the beach or on a dock attacked and slaughtered by the German airplanes. The plot focuses basically in three simultaneous storylines: the first based on an old man with two teenagers in a boat trying to rescue soldiers; the second on a Spitfire pilot that crashes his airplane on the water and is rescued by the old man; and the third on a Navy Commander in charge of the attempt of evacuating the soldiers. Better of watching again a classic war movie than spending 1h 46 min watching his terrible film by the usually overrated Christopher Nolan. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): ""Dunkirk""",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"Dunkirk (2017, Chris Nolan)","I got to see this film in the IMAX theatre which is really by far the best way as unlike most other films that use IMAX cameras to heighten portions of the presentation, this one is almost all in the larger IMAX format with only a few dialogue scenes reverting back to the more traditional widescreen format. This is the story of allied soldiers from Belgium, the British Empire and France who are surrounded by the German army and evacuated during a fierce battle in World War II.The story is told from several points of view and it chops rapidly between them at a break-neck speed. I think Chris Nolan has taken on board some of the criticisms of past films for over waffling and un- needed length as this one is edited tight as a drum. Some may say there are not enough character moments but I feel there were enough to tell the story effectively.My grandfather was captured in this region during this time and was a prisoner of war for the remainder of the campaign. It is not lost on me what kind of hell these men went through and this film delivers that feeling. The score is amazing as was the sound design and I will be expecting Oscar nominations for both. I will reserve judgement till i see how it fairs on the home format without the IMAX treatment on whether it is Nolan's best film to date but it might bloody well be. 8/10",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
An innovative thrilling masterpiece!!,"This movie is yet another masterpiece from Christopher Nolan.The storytelling is extremely innovative and interesting where the story of the evacuation has been told from there perspectives-land,air and water to give a detailed experience of the evacuation.Coming to the technical aspect of the movie,it is a complete unrivaled,moving and a near perfect experience.Every technical aspect has been brilliantly addressed.The score and cinematography is completely astounding.Its a must watch in IMAX where one can appreciate and feel the technical brilliance of the movie.Some reviewers may complain about the handling of individual characters,however since the movie is a portrayal of overall survival during the evacuation rather than a personal experience and point of view during the event,it really doesn't matters.The best point about the movie is that its so thrilling and well paced it keeps a viewer at an arm's length throughout the short running time leaving him/her completely satisfied.On short note it is one of the best war movie ever made and Nolan's best work since Inception.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Nolan is the man!,"The great auteur Christopher Nolan has just orchestrated his most mature and visceral picture in his esteemed career. I am referring to the true World War II story ""Dunkirk"". It is based during the early part of the war when French and British allies where stuck in the Dunkirk beach as they are attacked by the German nemesis. British civilians with their ferry boats put on their heroic hats and went on a mission to save the British soldiers. Nolan integrates the viewer right into the dungeons of ""Dunkirk""; either by sea, land, and air. The narrative is presented into these three segments; sea in a day, land in a week, and air in an hour. And they come all together masterfully due to Nolan's firepower. ""Dunkirk"" is Nolan's show. I have never seen a war movie depicted in a fashion where one never sees the enemies and there is such little bloodshed, but works so astoundingly. It is mostly a profound evacuation picture. Now there are actors here that due solid work; Mark Rylance as the civilian seaman, Cillian Murphy as a rescued pilot, Tom Hardy as an air force pilot; and also some young actors that really pulled their acting landing in Fionn Whithead, Damien Bonnard, and Harry Styles; yes I went that direction, that Harry Styles. Hans Zimmer's score is riveting and propels the movie in a very gripping manner. The cinematography, art direction, and production design all allied to perfection. But I go back to Nolan, because this was Nolan's land. And if Sir Nolan does not get nominated for a Best Director Oscar, I will be have to be evacuated from watching next year's Academy Awards. ""Dunkirk"" is the best film I have seen so far in 2017. ***** Excellent",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Revisiting DUNKIRK,"British director Christopher Nolan is known for being an individualist when it comes to the films he does. Although he is known for doing ""commercial"" films like BATMAN BEGINS, THE DARK KNIGHT, and THE DARK KNIGHT RISES, many others have seen a more complex side to Mr. Nolan with such psychological thrillers as 2000's MEMENTO; 2002's INSOMNIA; and 2010's INCEPTION, as well as his 2014 science fiction epic INTERSTELLAR (a film to be placed up there with 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY). Now, in 2017, he tackles the dark subject of the early part of World War II in DUNKIRK.The film essentially ties five different plot lines into the evacuation of French, Dutch, and British soldiers from the French city of Dunkirk in the late spring of 1940 as the German army is about to sweep in and annihilate them. This includes, among other things, British civilians evacuating as many soldiers as they can on the dangerous English Channel crossing, including one portrayed in usual brilliant low-key style by Mark Rylance. Apart from the appearances of Rylance; Kenneth Branagh as an English commander; and Harry Styles as one of the British soldiers caught up in the horror of this battle, most of the actors are young and anonymous types convincingly portraying average people caught up in an apocalypse that threatens to engulf not only England and Europe, but the entire human race. In an era where linear spectacle is the order of the day, Nolan does just the opposite, intertwining several different strands into one complete film, with a maximum amount of visual spectacle, but also putting this battle into focus in a mere hour and fifty minutes. While Nolan doesn't go into the graphic horror of the opening D-Day invasion of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, he nevertheless makes the tension palpable the entire time.Nolan wisely doesn't explain all that much, which is what any good filmmaker, especially if he has written and directed the film (as is the case here), should do. This is what makes DUNKIRK a compelling film, and a sure contender for one of the best films of 2017.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Over Hyped,There's no doubt the quality of the production and filming is there and the budget allowed for this movie to be high level but somehow it still fell short. You're unable to connect with any characters and are just thrown into the action as things happen and it's not easy to stay on top of. I understand it's based on real life events and it's implied that we should know the story line but regardless there was a disconnect between the movie and it's audience that should have been addressed.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
An attack on your senses,"Back in high school i wrote an essay on what happened at Dunkirk. And i was especially intrigued by Hitlers major blunder to not attack the beach with his tanks. If he had done so, the outcome of world war 2 could have been very different. It was one of the biggest mistakes Hitler ever made, and we should probably be quite happy about that.When i heard Nolan was going to make a movie about this, i was afraid he would paint the wrong picture and not tell the entire story. Nolan is good at bringing in nuances in his films, but i was still afraid he might forget about the French and the Belgians. And focus entirely on the British.Turns out, this movie is not at all what i expected. This is not the kind of movie you go see to get a history lesson. Nolan does not go into specifics on what led up to this point in history, and the movie has no character buildup. The movie starts where many other films ends their second act, right in the middle of the action. What this movie does is to focus on the share terror of war, and we see it from the viewpoint of the trapped soldiers on the beach of Dunkirk. Awaiting their fate, totally surrounded, hundreds of thousands of them.The movie tells three main stories. One on land, one at sea, and one in the air. And it jumps forward and back in time, so you feel you lose total control. And that is exactly what this movie needs, this is all about not being in control. German planes do regular sweeps, dropping bombs on the beaches. Planes and u-boats bombing and torpedoing the English warships. And the allied soldiers just standing there, with nowhere to run, they are basically just target practice for the planes. Who will survive? What would you do to try and survive? How would the consequences of your actions afflict you and your fellow soldiers?All these questions are at the very core of the film, it is all about survival in the darkest of times, and the movie is carried by Hans Zimmer's hypnotizing score which feels like a psychotic hymn that drills into your subconscious and attack your senses with brute force. It is accompanied with ear deafening sound effects that pound your ears until you feel very unsettled. The imagery presented here are outstanding, with lots of wide open shots in insane resolution. Never have i felt a movie so claustrophobic, using so many wide and open shots. This movie is indeed best viewed on a huge cinema screen.War is hell, war is chaos, and rarely has it been displayed better than in this film. Nolan has again showed that he can master almost any type of storytelling, and this time he even wrote the script himself. There are times in the film it feels like it might get a bit too sentimental, or that the film overly focuses on a few things that i feel i didn't need to be told again and again. But not before i start to get those feelings, it drags me back in with yet another pounding action scene.This is like nothing i have ever seen before. It is a war movie told in an unusual way. The movie doesn't have much dialogue, most of this movie is expressed through the eyes of the characters. And the terror in those eyes when the German bombers comes diving down for another sweep, making the most terrifying screaming noise, speaks louder than words. There aren't really any main movie stars in this film, it's the event itself, and the terror of war that is the primary character. And with the great cinematography, the loud sound effects, the pulsing music score, and the intense battle sequences, you feel like you are right there, on that beach. And that is probably the last place you would ever want to be. It is an intense thriller packed with suspense from the very first frame to the last, it never let's go.This will be a strong contender for many movie awards this year, and it's one of Nolan's best movies so far. That is saying something indeed, the man has a habit of making quite good films.Highly recommended",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
A (too) quiet tale from WWII,"To cut to the chase, this movie is entirely forgettable. I feel that there's a huge bias towards loving Nolan's films among critics, as he's deemed the best of the best, and as such, reviewers will, subconsciously maybe, adapt their opinions to suit this fact. It has happened before: Which movie was best, The Dark knight, or the Dark knight Rises? Correct, The Dark Knight. Yet, when TDKR arrived, it was so hyped that an explosion of unfounded positive reviews spewed everywhere. It was definitely a good movie. But it was also NOT near as good as The Dark knight, a fact most have come to realize in the following years.I have loved basically all of Nolan's movies. This time though, a yawn too many escaped my mouth, and not from a lack of sleep. The movie has great acting, although it is quite simple to be fair. Not a lot of emotion or character development is present, so it would be hard to judge talent based on performances of this film. The thing that keeps the movie fairly enjoyable is it's awesome visuals and musical scores. You are not in doubt you are watching a Nolan film; the editing, lighting, and audio track is an art in itself.Unfortunately, these positive aspects are not able to compensate for the almost complete lack of storytelling and excitement throughout the movie. The brief scenes of suspense and action are quickly watered out by long sections of mundane actions by the characters. There is no palpable red line throughout, keeping the baseline interest in the movie at quite a low level. No real story is told, it's more of a depiction of a historical event.I believe the creation of this movie is an attempt to show how young, inexperienced, and human the soldiers of WWII really were. It wants to portray bravery and weakness of civilians and soldiers alike. It does succeed, but if only the movie was not so dull in doing so. Most of Nolan's movies I've watched at least two times, but I don't think I will revisit this one.People have compared this film to Saving Private Ryan and other WWII all-time greats, which in my mind is utter crazy talk. Watch Dunkirk and Saving Private Ryan back to back, and if you still hold the same opinion, I promise you we will never agree on anything. This movie's IMDb score, along with the Dark Knight Rises', are, in my opinion, inflated to proportions that do not match their quality.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Christopher Nolan's most visceral film till date,"Disclaimer: Being a lifelong Christopher Nolan fan the review may seem biased to many, but Dunkirk is in so many ways not a typical Christopher Nolan movie.A few words about the screening: It was 6.45 PM midweek on a Wednesday, booked tickets for the first Australian public screening of Dunkirk in its 70 mm glory. Imax Melbourne went to the extent of reinstalling their 1570 film projectors to project this movie as was intended by Nolan. Dunkirk would be screened in both the 1570 film format and its upgraded Dual 4K Digital Laser systems for the weeks to come.Christopher Nolan has been making movies mostly centered on the science fiction genre. That is not necessarily a bad thing. The Dark Knight Trilogy, Interstellar and Inception are all deeply steeped in the genre and could be easily classified as Sci-Fi Action films, but very well made Sci-Fi Action films, some of the best in the genre it is created in. Whereas Memento, Prestige, Insomnia and Following could be roughly put into the Mystery genre. All nine films had something in common, the scripts were based out of works of fiction if not original fictional screenplays. Realism is not a genre Nolan operated in. Neither did he make a movie based on war. Operating in a similar genre throughout their whole career is not a trait of a director striving to be one of the greatest in his generation. Nolan tries to become one of the best in his generation with Dunkirk with one of the most realistic war films ever produced.Dunkirk is a film about the epic struggle of 400,000 British troops trapped in the shores of Dunkirk as a result of a military disaster, probably one of the worst military disasters of all time. With the German troops closing in on them the only way they could save themselves is to somehow cross the narrow English Channel and reach home. As easy as this sounds the reality of the situation prevented the troops from getting home easily. The shallow shores of the beach prevented big ships to land and rescue the troops and the strong tides prevented small boats to be paddled. Nolan decided to narrate the story from three different perspectives inter-cut into each other- land, sea and air. Each perspective spans out over different time periods, the Land narrative plays out over a week, the sea over a day and the air only an hour. As usual with his films Nolan employs non-Linear narrative to tell his story. Editor Lee Smith plays a very important part in cutting between the three narratives to provide a crisp and expectedly perplexing view toward the story. Match cuts are used expertly to bring a visual coherence between the three perspectives. Nolan and Smith is successfully able to provide different vantage points to the same events taking place in the movie making the experience complete. Dialog is sparse in the movie, and character development very thin. The script is only half the size of his previous films like The Dark Knight which were all heavy on character development and narrative momentum mostly built through dialog. This was done by Nolan advertently as he didn't want the characters to be at the center of the action, he wanted the viewer to be. He also wanted to tell the story by what's happening on the screen rather than what was spoken. The same reason made him cast actors who are not famous faces with the exception of Tom Hardy (who had his face covered like he has for most of his films) and Cillian Murphy who played the character of a scared pilot afraid to go back to Dunkirk. He didn't want the audience to relate to the actors as heroes, just feel the experiences they are having being part of this incredible situation. The objective was to provide a visceral experience to the audience which can only be experienced to its intended extent in a theater. The bullets fired feels it's fired at you and you can smell the sea in the drowning scenes. The tension in the film is gripping. Nolan decided to cut the movie around the 100 minute mark because beyond that it would have been impossible to hold the almost Hitchcockian suspense. Hans Zimmer was masterful as always and played a massive part in adding to the visceral experience, the sound of the ticking clock (synthesized by Hans from a recording of one of Nolan's own watches) plays a very important part in the visceral experience. Van Hoytema shoots this mostly using 70mm IMAX cameras, I could only imagine how difficult it would have been for him to shoot using such a mammoth camera from such difficult vantage points. His wide angle shots are expansive and helps provide the scale of despair we were looking at.Nolan and his production team delivers and hits the ball out of the park with Dunkirk. People walking into the theater expecting a Dark Knight or even an Interstellar may be disappointed as he shifts his genre and objective with this production. Although Guardian's Andrew Pulver's comparison to Kubrick may be a bit premature, but he is definitely on the right trajectory to becoming one of this generation's greatest.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Horrific event without horror,"First and foremost, Dunkirk is PG-13 movie. There's almost no blood, sweat and real war horrors in it. What we're basically seeing is a sort of a documentary. Dunkirk's primary goal is making you aware of in how difficult situation British and French soldiers were.That means that there's little dialogue in the movie. No personal story is embedded in it. But what is really strange is that there is not so much action neither. Action is distributed throughout the movie and always comes as a climax to previous developments. That's why you can hear silent but noticeable ""tika-taka"" sound throughout almost the entire movie.Secondly, Dunkirk is a very tense and loud experience. Story itself never rushes but steadily grows until it bursts. I believe emphasizing that effect is the reason why Nolan decided to tell the story in a non-linear fashion from three different perspectives; that way he can constantly keep you on the edge of your seat. If that weren't so, Dunkirk would frankly be a boring movie.All in all, if you're tired of violence, superficiality and too much talking but love tense story-line, Dunkrik is spot on. As for the war movie veterans: you may find it a bit unconvincing. It's still worth giving it a shot.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"Bad movie that is emotional-less, heartless and stale.","Dunkirk is a glorified History Chanel documentary. The movie is emotional- less, heartless and stale. Anyone saying otherwise is a Nolan slappie that would rave about him filming dogs pooping in a yard.The movie starts and throws you right in to dreary action. From there the entire run time is spent in jarring fashion that's meant to simulate being in an actual battle or being attacked. What it fails to do is be an actual film or tell any kind of tale. It's a two hour long dragout scene and not an actual movie. There is no real act structure so you can't even call the third act a failure.This thing shouldn't even be labeled a movie, just a two hour visual experiment on par with a Transformers level ""story"" or VR experimental cinema.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Credible WWII Movie Inevitably Laced with Computer Effects,"Good WWII movie, admitting early on that historical accuracy is not its intention, and told in Quentin Tarantino fashion, flashing back and forward between incidents involving army, navy and air forces trying to flee Dunkirk (France), or help others make their way back to the UK.According to Commander Bolton (played by Branagh), 400,000 men were on beaches of Dunkirk awaiting removal, and supposedly only about 10% of those men would get out of France - or so were Winston Churchill's calculations because the overriding priority was to use all resources to protect UK territory.Direction is sound, photography competent (though computer effects are obvious), and acting is in such small patches by so many people that no one really stands out, with the possible exceptions of Mark Rylance, who embodies the famous courage of common British people as he takes his small yacht to Dunkirk and rescues British forces stranded at sea along the way; and Tom Hardy, who gets the plum part of the Spitfire pilot shooting the hell out of Messerschmidts and Heynckels.It is refreshing to see a movie about Brits played by Brits, no Americans about, which is historically accurate as the USA pursued its isolationist policy at the time.It is also credible that, at the beginning of the movie, the Brits should want their countrymen to travel first out of France and leave the French to their fate. It is not so credible that, by the end of the movie, Commander Bolton should say that he wants to stay behind to help the French get out, nor do I imagine the Admiralty agreeing to such a senior officer staying potentially within grasp of the enemy just to help the ""frogs."" It is an unfortunately overly sentimental touch that - in my humble opinion - smacks of Brexit apology.In fact, what happened was that Churchill ordered the destruction of the French Navy's fleet, then the world's largest, so it would not fall into German hands and be used against Great Britain -- and many of the French ships were sunk with French servicemen inside. So much for helping the ""frogs""...Perhaps that is why Nolan is not interested in historical accuracy about the events at Dunkirk.All told, it is a film well worth watching that pays deserved homage to the British people's courage, intelligence, resourcefulness, firmness of purpose, and capacity to find the silver lining in the direst of situations.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Suspenseful and riveting,"Nolan doesn't approach Dunkirk like other war movies. There are no scenes of dialogue where the characters are humanised, nor any visceral scenes of battle to hammer in how hellish war is.Instead, the implication of horror and sparse dialogue, coupled with Hans Zimmer's excellent soundtrack, creates a tense atmosphere where time feels like it's running out. Though the characters don't say much, we relate to them in fear, and action.As expected, there are neat little details in every character's action that makes them unique. This movie is definitely worth a watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

I had high hopes, being that the event was so incredible.

Not a Nolan fan but this was monumental,"I was quite uncertain about Dunkirk, I strongly disliked Nolan's last two films and the one before that felt a bit too inspired from Satoshi Kon's Paprika to really have an identity of it's own like his Insomnia, again not an original work. Nolan has been a director who has been out of form for nearly ten years in my opinion however with this one, Nolan has again become one of the directors to look out for. This is indeed worth the hype, the best war film in years. A technical masterpiece worthy of the IMAX experience. What really surprised me about the film is that dialogues are kept to a minimum and Nolan is always a dialogue heavy director, first 15-20 minutes or so just have a handful of lines, it's all about the environment and the atmosphere, which was very refreshing, I have always criticized his films for having more to say and less to show but he makes amends here. Nolan does add his own signature to the film by mixing the timelines of multiple story characters but it's done to a minimum so that isn't gimmicky and doesn't overstay it's welcome. However it's more of a technically flawless masterpiece of a war film (Saving Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down etc.) rather than an emotional or character driven one (Apocalypse Now, Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, The Thin Red Line) which is fine, I wouldn't necessarily rate the latter group higher than the former, I do like the latter more but each group has it's appeal and I enjoy both. In the acting department everyone gets the job done but I wouldn't single out anyone as giving a standout performance, Mark Rylance almost gets there though, he is the audience's character, the heart of the film, the common man. This is as much as Hans Zimmer's film like it's Christopher Nolan's, so much so I wish there was lesser usage of background music in it which is almost present in every scene, background music doesn't necessarily enhance the atmosphere of gun shots, shells and bomber planes flying, was sometimes being a distraction and breaking the immersion. All in all these are minor nitpicks of an otherwise an excellent film. Nolan's finally back on track after nearly ten years and this is his best in my opinion replacing his previous best Memento.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Another boring cliché Hollywood epic war drama.,"The plot was chaotic, fast running, scenes jumped from site to site - I assume the director tried to give the viewers the chaotic atmosphere of war but at the end it was another missed war drama with nothing to remember off. 20 years ago there was order in the plots, as the time of the movie passed the plot progressed, there was actually discussion between the characters, and the players actually played their roll , now days only special effects and occasionally a discussion between the characters with characteristic dull drama chats.

Every silence in the film is so distressing and real. This movie has a wonderful picture, which on the big screen looks great.

Sigh...disappointed yet again.,"Remember that scene where the boat sank? Or the other boat sank? Or the the one? Or the other one? Thank God, a director who uses practical effects! Too bad I didn't know any of the characters on the boats, nor was Nolan's ADHD plagued camera able to focus on a scene long enough for me to concentrate or care before another quick cutaway.Also Kenneth Branagh staring at the sky with a horrified look upon his face. Powerful stuff the first time. Not so powerful the second time. Okay, why is he doing it a third time? A fourth time? Now this is getting comical.I demand subtitles on all future Nolan movies. I could probably understand 20% of the dialogue, if that.I'm pretty sure they're using Hans Zimmerman's score on the next season of 24. Maybe that'll save the show, or at least fool you again into thinking you're watching something epic and suspenseful.I miss the guy who directed Memento, the Prestige, Batman Begins and the Dark Knight. Nolan's last movies may appeal to you die-hard fans, but his best work is in the past.Before you dismiss me, ask yourself honestly if, when this movie is released on DVD, you're going to prefer watching this to the aforementioned Nolan films.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Not what I expected,"I can't understand how it can get 8.4 rating. Technically great, I mean, high level images and direction.

Tight and rich cinematic experience,"If I look at it in story perspective may not be the best of Nolan's filmography. There are other movies like Inception and Dark Knight series. If I look at it in war films - it is not the best of war films. Still I prefer other movies like Saving Private Ryan or Apocalypse Now and others.Dunkirk is a cinema that needs to be experienced like your have never before. Spectacular Sound Design, Amazing music by Hans Zimmer (I am his fan for Inception's Time Soundtrack), Tom Hardy's brilliance that you can see in his eyes, you can't see editing - that's how good Lee Smith is.. that's what I experienced watching Dunkirk.Less duration with rich visuals is a huge advantage to keep the audience hooked till the last shot. But still I am moving towards the sound of this film. Right from the time you hear the first gun shot - till the end of the movie it's mainly based on sound design.

"This Generations ""Saving Private Ryan""","Sometimes when I anticipate a film for so long, all the way through its production from the time it is announced it's almost an odd feeling when i finally sit down in the theatre and watch it for the first time, But unlike in the past this film did not disappoint me in the slightest, not only did it live up to my, honesty unreasonably high expeditions, it exceeded all of them by being something I never expected.The structure of the film was something I wasn't sure would work, having three perspectives all in different times could have been rather jarring and incomprehensible but it wasn't, it only helped to add to the scale and stakes of this whole event and not only how important it was that it succeeded but also just how difficult victory was going to be to achieve.This film doesn't put much effort into developing its characters, usually that would bother me but here it didn't. I got the impression that this film wasn't about the characters or the actors playing them but instead about the situation they were in. I didn't have any issuer getting behind any of her because the importance of this operations success was so well established it was clear how important it was for them to survive and get home.While Dunkirk is most definitely not a performance piece all the actors are great in this film. Mark Rylance, Kenneth Branagh and Cillian Murphy are probably the stand outs but the new comers do deserved credit, they don't have much dialogue but they but still perfectly convey they're need to survive.Christopher Nolan has been one of my favourite directors of all time for so long and I knew he was going to do magnificent things with this movie and he did not disappoint. He did some of his best work ever here. He kept such a consistent pace from the opening scene he puts you right into the situation and doesn't let up by constantly showing chaos and destruction all within camera with no cgi or green screen making it feel all the more real. The aerial dogfight sequences were incredible, nothing about them felt fake, they felt real, intense and confined and because of them only lasting one hour of time they never let up.As much as this film showed a lot of death and insurmountable odds it also has such a great message about hope and what people can truly accomplish when they band together which gives this film a much needed heart instead of it just being a non-stop thrill ride.Dunkirk is a cinematic masterpiece, it lived up to everyone of my incredibly high expectations and exceeded them giving me one of the most unique war films ever made. Everything from a technical, performance and writing standpoint was done perfectly to the pout where this film felt more like an experience and less like a viewing.10/10-A+ (Incredible)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Even professional critics have been blinded,"We all know how good Christopher Nolan is, but this time he failed. How critics can overlook this is beyond me because it is not subjective. Objectively the film is missing essential tools of storytelling that are established for hundreds of years. Everyone who actually learned script writing would tell you the same.The movie is lacking two major things: 1. characters 2. conflict1. The movie has NO characters. I don't mean thin ones I mean NO characters. We never even get names of the main protagonists. We get no backstory, no mannerisms, nothing. Another review said the film concentrates on the ""event"" Dunkirk rather than characters and on other filmmaking techniques. Even if that is the case and a conscious choice by Nolan you can't do that and expect people to be invested in your movie. It is like saying ""a film needed no story, visuals where more important"". You can't just ignore essential elements like story or characters.2. The movie has no conflict. And I don't mean conflict as in allies against Germany which by the way is also not really there because you never really get to see the enemy in form of a person. I mean conflict in dialog. There is almost no dialog in the movie therefore no conflicting views that make interesting dialog which is mind boggling since Nolan is usually very good in exact that field.Since there are no characters in the movie just faces you never get invested. Nolan has been criticized in the past for his films being cold. This is the coldest one. That being said I am sure next time he will deliver again but I guarantee that in 10 years this is the movie from Nolan nobody will remember, because there is just nothing memorable in it. Even if you are that gifted you can't just ignore basic storytelling foundations.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
A bold attempt on conventional storytelling.. Defines its own genre,"Is it possible for a movie with no clear plot line or any character development to keep its viewer fully occupied and focused? Nolan made it happen with this magnificent display of cinematic mastery.The movie presents itself as a simple series of events seen through the eyes of various unnamed characters, you will not require any information or background story about them, the powerful illustration of the events that they are going through is a sufficient introduction to these tormented soldiers.Nolan emphasized those very trivial details of a story that are often ignored due to them being overshadowed by the main storyline, but in this movie, they are the storyline, they connect beautifully through the eyes of those unknown characters, as every event might seem insignificant when you compare it to the war itself, but in the eyes of those soldiers those horrific moments will leave an eternal scar on them.These moments or mini-scenes are shared by all the characters in the movie as you will experience every one of those breathtaking moments multiple times from multiple perspectives, each perspective is a totally different experience filled with its highs, lows and twists.The scenes are presented in an unusual way, the timeline is a barrage of events with different time stamps, some preceded other scenes while some were happening at the exact same time as many of the following senes but from a different angle, Nolan showed us that tilting the camera in another direction can show us a totally different story than what's happening on the other side of the camera.This masterpiece of a movie just raised the bar for all filmmakers, how Nolan captured a simple escape scene in the most breathtaking and thought-provoking way is a cinematic triumph that will be praised for generations to come.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Good movie but lacks grandiosity,"I have been transfixed with the story of Dunkirk since I was a young adult. More than a third of a million soldiers were stuck on a beach. What will happen to them? This movie tells the story in vignettes. What it is lacking is that it does not show the grandiosity of what was on the beaches. There was over a third of a million men, not a battalion or two. That is like the entire population of New Orleans being on one beach at one time. The immensity of the task at hand is what makes the real Dunkirk story so compelling. Christopher Nolan missed it. It was still a good movie, but that flaw was a disappointment.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

A disappointing example of bad pacing,"I would never had thought that Christopher Nolan, the man that created some of my most beloved films as a young cinema goer, would film such an unusually bad paced film and I'm starting to think that all the fuzz about it comes from the natural instinct of patriotism it evokes rather than actual technical prowess. Sure, the film is beautifully shot, but it's a shallow beauty. There are so many films that show the horror of war and coming to face one's own mortality to the point of giving anything to ""go back home"": ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Full Metal Jacket"" come to mind. Both films are wisely divided into tense and relaxing scenes, so that the tension is shared by the public when it comes on screen. In ""Dunkirk"", the whole movie is a tension scene, which completely cancels any reason to feel tension after the first few dangerous situations our heroes find themselves in. And let's talk about these ""heroes"". It rarely happened to me to find a movie so crowded with useless talent: none of the characters mean anything to the overall story, they are sketches of the valiant, the mean, the wise, etc. and we have no time whatsoever to indulge in more intimate moments with them. This was definitely a conscious decision by Nolan, so that he could convey the feeling of telling the story of all 400.000 men and not only Harry Styles's, but if I don't feel anything for the few we actually get to know, then all 400.000 are misrepresented. Not to mention the only relevant death (which I won't spoil): it clearly just happens for some emotive involvement between such arid scenes, but it looks so artificial, so useless and stupid that it really makes you chuckle. One of the worst aspects of the film is the music, by Hans Zimmer. I would say by previous Hans Zimmer tunes, considering how any part of this score could have come from ""The Dark Knight"" or ""Inception"" and no-one would've noticed. Apart from its repetitiveness from other films, it's repetitive in itself: just like the endless action and danger, Zimmer's music is always tense, always on a high-alert tone, resulting in pure nothingness. Last, the week/day/hour narrative device. Nolan clearly needed something original to tell such an ultimately dull story so he and his team conceived this utterly useless idea. Throughout the film there is not a single time I thought ""Wow, now I see why he organized the story this way!"" and that is because it serves no purpose other than to give the feeling of an edgy, nolanesque feature. For reference, consider ""Memento"", Nolan's debut; there the complex narrative pattern makes complete sense and is functional -nay, essential- to the end result of the story. In ""Dunkirk"" this temporal distortion is completely useless: the film could've followed a more regular pattern without suffering anything on the narrative side.I consider this the worst film Nolan has ever made, and I feel very disappointed knowing his potential.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Harrowing,"Several times during the show I thought it was all over. I felt like I would drown or get shot out of the air and had to cover up as enemy planes strafed the rotting piers and the beach. That's the feeling director Christopher Nolan has created throughout ""Dunkirk"", one of the most exciting war movies ever made. He sustains the mood for the entire picture, together with the drone of planes and ack-ack fire of machine guns and at the end you feel almost shell-shocked - or at least have ringing in your ears.Very odd, though, is the feeling that you have stumbled into the midst of an evacuation, which is pretty much the case. There is no beginning to the film to speak of, just thousands of troops assembled on the beach. Same at the end; you know the end to the war wasn't in sight for five more years. Christopher Nolan has made here the perfect war movie and is a must-see for WWII buffs as well as movie fans.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Dunkirk (2017),"When I saw the IMAX feature clip for this film before watching Rogue One back in December, I just knew I had to watch this film in IMAX. Christopher Nolan is probably the most successful modern day director going today. He was able to establish a niche early on, then came out with a very well received comic book trilogy. He was audacious to go for a sci-fi film that turned out to be quite grand. Here, he took a shot at a war film and I think he has done very well.Dunkirk is told in three phases. On the land, in the sea, and in the air. Each section is connected but the duration of time of each segment differs. The week we see on land involves a young Englishman trying to survive while along the way meeting two fellow young soldiers and being sunk by enemy German fire. The sea portion takes place in a day and involves a civilian boat that is run by a father and son and their attempts to rescue as many soldiers as they can from Dunkirk. The air portion lasts only an hour and follows a fighter pilot and his attempt to take down enemy planes while trying to ration the fuel in his engine.Time is definitely a construct that connects each section in a non linear method. You can literally hear the ticking of a clock in the score, and its persistent. Speaking of the score, Mr Hans Zimmer has outdone himself. The score is ever present and it carries on nearly throughout the entire film. It never lets up and is at times majestic, tense, and absolute momentum building madness. The jarring sounds (especially in IMAX) is phenomenal. IMAX was able to heighten the experience. Every loud gun sounding off and every roaring plane is so precise, loud, and absolutely brings you into the world of the film.The script and dialogue is kept light and its so great that way. There isn't a whole lot of dialogue and there doesn't need to be in this type of war film. Nolan isn't exactly trying to build the strongest of characters. The film is really a cinematic experience. The long shots are beautiful. There is heavy use of practical effects and virtually no CGI. It feels so authentic, and Nolan masters the art of cinema here. The film introduces a few fresh faces and includes some familiar ones, even those who have worked with Nolan in the past. Also Harry Styles (who was surprisingly quite good).I think this film ranks quite highly in Nolan's work. I may need to give it a rewatch to see exactly where it does. I can see why people won't enjoy it because its so different than what Nolan has done in the best. I for one, love the direction he is going in now. He's become a bold and ambitious filmmaker doing what he thinks is write and not really pandering with this one. Its got to be one of the best war films of all time already. Definitely up to par with expectations.8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"""There's no hiding from this, son. We have a job to do.""","Set in 1940, the story revives around a port called Dunkirk where approximately 400,000 soldiers of allied forces got stuck with no available escapes through the mainland and stay in the hope of a miracle of their survival by a probable evacuation. Director depicted the story from three different perspectives with three different time horizons that intersect each other eventually!Dunkirk merely a character driven film with their heroic tales as it never explains the background of any of its characters that much on how, why and from where they got stuck in a French port and their purposes rather portrays the fact of the survival of those 400,000 soldiers from their counterpart by the only means of evacuation.Nolan's Dunkirk remains as a visual treat with the best cinematographic experience and splendid sound design till date! It feels like you are in the actual situation!The movie hardly has any dialogues and might be the only of its genre where the background score never stops breathing and keeps the audience gripped in it spontaneously! It acts like the heart which keeps it alive.It's not an ordinary film that you watched and understood on a first go with the perplexed time horizons involved but the storytelling is pretty straightforward this time unlike Nolan's other films like Memento, Inception or Interstellar lately.Forget everything and stop expecting any of that sorts, if you have already watched Schindler's list, The pianist, Downfall, Saving Private Ryan or even recent release Hacksaw Ridge. Dunkirk hardly belongs to that genre. It's not a typical war film rather a survival film with almost no bloodshed!!!Director Christopher Nolan crafted the thought of making Dunkirk almost 25 years back. It's his most ambitious project till date and an apparent research paper with pure depiction of a wartime situation without revealing the plot!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Nolanesque War Movie...very good,"""Wars are not won by evacuations..."" Words spoken by Churchill after the events depicted in Christopher Nolan's latest film DUNKIRK. Yet, Nolan chooses this backdrop to deliver a war movie that is as immersive as the D-Day landing in Saving Private Ryan. But the similarities end there.Nolan uses three different vantage points each with a different time-line: The Mole, the rock wall protecting the harbor, over a full week; the Air over the course of only an hour; and the Sea over a full day. All this is presented with typeface near the beginning of the film to help orient the viewer to what's being shown.What is unique is that Nolan uses non-linear storytelling. By doing so, we become immersed in the events as though we are each of the characters. Similar to Memento or Interstellar, Nolan again shows confidence in the audience and we are rewarded for it. We won't find long lines of exposition to explain things. Neither does he ask for our emotions in conventional ways. Rather by utilizing visual angles, intense sound, and non-verbal cues, he urges us to become immersed in the story with these soldiers, pilots and merchant marines and day fisherman bringing home across the channel. In only one instance did I sense Nolan obviously building a crescendo of emotions at the events on the screen. Despite this, there is much to appreciate in this film.Where many war movies generally depict impressive battlefield or theater heroism against great odds usually resulting in rescue or victory. Nolan delivers a more poignant look inside war from what Churchill also called a ""colossal military disaster."" Because of its unique look at war, it is definitely worth a look.B+",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Left wanting.,"I came out of Dunkirk thinking it was OK. I was just pretty happy it was over really. I sure would have liked a whole lot more character development. A big dash of story line would have been helpful. Dialog might have been nice. I remember thinking about ten minutes in, oh no, Nolan has gone off the deep end here with some kind of overly artistic self gratifying film. I kept hoping for about the next ten minutes that it would stop, that it was just his opening to a meaningful story about the brave successful rescue of an army that would live to later see victory.It didn't stop though. It went on and on and on and on. I suggest Schindler's List, Das Boot, Letters from Iwo Jima, A Bridge Over River Kwai, The Great Escape, Patton, Sophie's Choice, or a whole bunch of other films that just escape me right now, if you wan't to see great films, with characters and story line that draw you in, and help you loose yourself in a meaningful story about a particular experience of one of the endless number of difficult experiences which that terrible war produced. This film is distracting, at times confusing, underdeveloped, and a rather poor story teller. It's not all bad and certainly did have its moments, but ultimately did not deliver nearly what so many other films about WWII have so eloquently accomplished.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Anonymity of principal cast honors anonymous heroes,"The story of this massive evacuation of British and French troops back across the English Channel in 1940 has been depicted several times before, but never so intriguingly or compellingly. Writer/director Christopher Nolan pulled off what seems to be oxymoronic in crafting a powerfully understated presentation of such a famous event. The preceding military action in France was a disaster, but rescuing most of the 400,000 soldiers pinned down by all branches of the German forces allowed England to keep Hitler on the Continent until the rest of the Allies would become fully armed and engaged.Most war films focus on one or more heroes, played by stars and familiar character actors, with relatively predictable story arcs. The 1958 account of this historic achievement starred John Mills and Richard Attenborough; in 2004, Benedict Cumberbatch and Timothy Dalton headlined. This time, Kenneth Branagh is the biggest ""name"", but his role is marginal. Instead, we switch among several story lines of anonymous soldiers, sailors, pilots and civilians, with few of them even being given names. We also see their fears, moments of cowardice or selfishness along with their heroism. By not knowing who is who (and, typically, who we figure will either save the day, die tragically, or both, based on decades of cinematic convention) we feel the utter randomness of which imperiled character will live or die, and whether it will happen on shore or during evacuation.British pride over the event comes largely from the way innumerable civilian boat owners, with vessels of all types and sizes, bravely responded to the call to help its over-matched Navy by crossing the channel to carry as many lads back as they could hold... if they survived the threats from enemy U-boats, bombers and fighter jets. For the troops, reaching one of the boats proved to be far from an assurance of safe passage.Nolan delivers all the sound and fury of being among their ranks, sustaining nearly two hours of the intense fear, chaos and frustrations that the actual figures must have experienced. It's among the closest approximations I can recall of the masterful D-Day landing sequence at the beginning of Saving Private Ryan. We see many fatalities from many causes, but without the explicit display of bloodshed that an R- rated production would have contained. We didn't need it to get the layers of emotional impact in that ordeal from all perspectives. The jumps from one mini-arena to another, and even repeating certain sequences from different character perspectives adds to that sense of no one in position to deduce what action or location will be safest for themselves or their comrades.The experience is grueling for the audience, and honors the soldiers most by putting us in their actual, not idealized or glorified, boots. This Dunkirk marks quite an achievement for all its creators and cast.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Jetlag,"The Dunkirk evacuation can be seen as three distinct elements working to accomplish this overall goal. The mole, where thousands of soldiers were for a week trying to survive and escape their hopeless situation. The sea, where civilians spent a day sailing their boats to transport the troops. And the air, where spitfire planes could last for an hour before refueling. All have stories worth telling. And as three separate episodes of a mini-series, it could work. Instead, they're mercilessly inter-cut, with this confusing time-line preventing the otherwise willing and game audience from becoming properly engaged with what we're seeing. It works as a series of tiny moments of humanity. Not as a whole.The entirety of this is using the snowball effect previously used well by Nolan in his third acts. This could become exhausting. However, there's time to breathe. Small victories that are celebrated(with whatever tea is available at the time. Not even kidding). There are no leads, merely characters that have more screen-time than others. No development, no one to get into? I disagree. They're all relate-able, trying to make it past the day. Or even just the second. This is tense, and you're never truly safe. It moves briskly, without rushing. This *is* indeed very loud, and those with genuinely sensitive ears may have to wait for the home release, despite that they'll lose out.I recommend this to any fan of Nolan. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

Dunkirk - a lesson in empathy,"Just a few thoughts after seeing the movie (spoiler free):This movie is an important one. It achieves something that not a lot of war movies can. Which is staying objective and not using (or exploiting) the perils and real suffering of men fighting in war for the mere sake of dramatization. Dunkirk is based on historical events. It should not be expected to please or entertain. Think about it: Why would you look at something like war and use it for entertainment? That is just wrong. I read a lot of reviews by people who criticized the film due to its lack of 'characters'. Well, this movie has actual humans. Are they telling me they can only feel something when they can identify with a character? If they know their backstory and if they are portrayed in a sympathetic way? ""There was no emotion in the film?"" ""It wasn't romanticized?"" Well, then maybe that is a problem with the viewer and not the film (there is always Pearl Harbor.. :v). And for the record, my initial reaction was also one of being a bit underwhelmed, maybe mostly because I expected something different, a narrative type of movie. I was waiting for some gripping storyline, action sequences and fleshed out characters etc, too. (And I will always love Saving Private Ryan) After the film ended my wife quickly said that it is her favourite Nolan film which then made me think twice about it. This film requires the viewer to have true empathy. To feel for another human being that you don't know and might not have anything in common with. It teaches us what actual unbiased empathy is. If you tell a war movie in a subjective way and create favorable and unfavorable characters you're mostly creating division. Why is one soldier's death more tragic than another?I appreciated that the Germans were 'faceless'. They were the enemy in this case, yes. But they weren't painted in an exaggerated, Hollywood-style demeaning way so as to create animosity towards them. The viewer isn't made to feel hatred. The Germans were simply the historical opposing faction.This objectivity is nicely reflected in the outstanding cinematography which used many wide shots and aerial establishing shots to show the global action. It focused more on the group, and not so much the individual. It also beautifully showed their movement in a given space. This objectivity demonstrates why Dunkirk wasn't really about individual people or characters, but the bigger group, the bigger picture, as seen in a historical context. (Oh, and dat 70mm film, mmmhh) If you look at the events of Dunkirk and what meaning they had for the outcome of WWII and maybe even history, it becomes more clear to choose an objective lens to portray these events in an unbiased way and from an elevated viewpoint. You are literally seeing history unfold from afar. I had one gripe with the film, which was the constant soundtrack playing. There were no moments of silence but that's just a personal nitpick. This is the type of movie they will probably show in history class and should. -Some real cinematic piece of art.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Live the Experience of a Real War... oh so human,"What has to be considered as one of the greatest films of all time, and a must see. Oh so human, running the whole gamut of human frailties, strengths and weaknesses, with great acting throughout, and Nolan as the new David Lean? This is a must at Oscar time, especially for the cinematography.A genuinely real experience and snapshot of nine days, not just British. Where 192,226 British and 139,000 French soldiers – 331,226 in all – were rescued by the 700 little ships (British, Dutch and Belgium) and around 220 warships. On a personal note pity Nolan did not get hold of the PS Medway Queen. Which my father was evacuated from Dunkirk on, he would never talk about his Dunkirk experience.Minor continuity error, the scene with Harry Stiles (good acting by the way) and others sitting on the beach.

we need more star-directors like Christopher Nolan,"From a point-of-view of an inveterate pacifist, any war film shouldn't be bothered to watch, whether it wields its anti-war flag or not, because it is either flogging a dead horse or being brazenly repugnant. But when one is made by Christopher Nolan, there is no excuse for a film buff to dodge from facing the man-made atrocity dutifully affixed with adequate dosage of individual heroism gleaming as the silver lining (SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is a clear forefather), and this is DUNKIRK.Without any question, Mr. Nolan envisions and executes an immersive experience for pampering audience to vicariously partake in the action, its triptych structural arrangement from land, sea, and air with different temporalities starts as a tad discombobulating, but before long would we be utterly blown away by the sheer mastery of its grand-scale imagery and sonic accompaniment, in particular that muffled ticking sound blanketing the infantry pawns as they are continuously besieged by aerial attack, torpedo charge and stray bullets, our protagonist on the land is the Private Tommy, played by a young Tom Courtenay ringer, the rookie Fionn Whitehead, who has no intention to be heroic at any rate when the priority is simply to stay alive. He is first paired with Gibson (Barnard), so as to take a chance of getting on board of a departing warship along with those who are injured, which doesn't work. After biding their time hidden themselves under the mole, they finally land on their feet on another ship, surprisingly, Gibson chooses to stay away from his fellow compatriots, a decision which prompts his life-saving conduct when the ship is sinking underwater, among whom he saves are Peter and Alex (Styles), but the real reason behind that decision will boomerang later, which the ingrate Alex should partially answer for. Here Nolan's script pluckily wrestles with the shadowy underside of the internecine conflicts among the Allies, when nationality hogging the precedence over individual lives. And it is interesting to divine why Nolan doesn't swap the upshots of Alex and Gibson if he really wants to state a point.On the sea, the evacuation aided by boats of civilians brings to the fore of an ordinary family's selfless deeds in a perilous situation, Mark Rylance superbly plays Mr. Dawson, a seafarer who has already lost a son to the war and volunteers to the rescue mission with another son Peter (Glynn- Carney) and a young helper George (Keoghan) in his own boat, en route, they successfully come to aid to a soldier on the flotsam (Murphy, in his best shell-shocked form) and a British pilot (Lowden) almost trapped to death in the cockpit before sailing near Dunkirk, but one might feel a bit disappointed that even Nolan has to predictably yield to the last-second-succor schtick in his own script. The Dawson's involvement also poignantly brings home to us the inconvenient truth: being heroic also entails that one must pay its price, however unpleasant it is. In the firmament, British Supermarine Spitfires (although riddled with malfunctions) engage in dogfight with German bombers, they are the guardian angels of those defenseless earth-bound foot soldiers and unwieldy vessels, Tom Hardy, as one of the pilots, is the ultimate hero specimen, laconic, unfazed and cool-headed, a sublimed understated performance.DUNKIRK's robust box-office revenue bears witness to a reassuring fact that a director's name can still usurp bankability from film stars (whose power is actually dwindling significantly into the 21st century), because auteurism shouldn't only to be ensconced on the art house sphere, it should be the new norm if our film industry needs to prosper, we need more star-directors like Christopher Nolan and maybe this time, Academy members can finally cave in.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Nolan's War Epic,"War is Hell! That infamous phrase isn't necessarily the first thing you think when watching Chris Nolan's masterful World War 2 epic Dunkirk. Nolan isn't really interested here in the gratuitous and awful nature of war( Hacksaw Ridge take note) but instead relies on cinematic, visual storytelling in its purest form to bring home a more melancholic, elegiac tone. It still has shocks and suspense and although minimalist in certain scenes(the faceless enemy, the stripped back approach to explosions) its scale is huge. Nolan is almost a contradiction...he seems to blend an artistic, philosophical approach with a more bombastic and populist edge to wonderful fruition.The characters in this movie are vaguely drawn but much like Mad Max Fury Road its all about the mannerisms, the looks that people give each other to convey emotions. Everyone is superb in this, even dare I say it, that young upstart from One Direction(that's one hell of an agent) but its Tom Hardy's spitfire pilot that bears the brunt of the emotional heft and has, by the last few scenes, become an integral part of the story( giving away no major spoilers). And this is an actor who's wearing a mask for almost the entirety of the movie.Nolan has often been accused of a cold, clinical approach that disrupts the flow of his technical achievements to become something greater. Personally its far from the truth..Inception and Interstellar both contained father issues that were touching and tender and stayed the right side of tender and sentimental and even Insomnia had a very poetic underpinning with that mournful bittersweet ending. Although Dunkirk does perhaps tip near to that theory ironically, its within its last half hour that theory can be well and truly put to bed. Its simply stunning cinema thematically and structurally bringing about Nolans fetish for fiddling with time periods melding together cohesively.There may well be the whiff of commercialism especially regarding the 12a certificate but this is more like those war films from the 50s and 60s that were not very violent and were more about grace and determination and spirit of soldiers in a seemingly hopeless scenario. Nolan knows how to create cinematic magic in a world which has become obsessed with cgi and over the top action set pieces and that in itself deserves recognition. The mainstream crowd are not all stupid.(take note Bay)Dunkirk is intimate and tense with another superb Zimmer score(only once is it too overbearing) and many may want their War films dished up with blood n guts and profanity attached. But Dunkirk isn't about War or a particular genre..its a showcase for Nolan and how he now has a legacy behind him that the likes of Spielberg and Kubrick once knew. In Nolan we trust.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
I wanted more,I really wanted to like this more. I find the story itself fascinating. Evacuating hundreds of thousands using practically anything that would float across the english channel is pretty remarkable. What was less remarkable was the movie itself. I didn't find myself becoming attached to the main characters. I felt myself wishing the focus would switch to some of the background characters who looked like they had more interesting stories to tell.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Stunning masterclass in filmmaking.,"I've been looking forward to this film for what seems like an eternity and usually - when that's the case - I tend to end up nit-picking and getting frustrated with the finished product. A film that promises more than it can deliver. Thankfully, this is not the case with ""Dunkirk"" and Christopher Nolan reminds us, again, why he is one of the most important film directors of the now.From the opening scenes, this film is tense. The story follows three situations: a young soldier trying to get away from Dunkirk, the fighter planes sent to try and keep the troops on the beach safe and one of the ""civilian"" ships that crossed the channel to try and bring the troops back. Each little story being tense in their own right and telling their own story. Not a single frame wasted in this beautifully shot film. Dialogue is minimum but Hans Zimmer score stops there from being completely silent. A score which doesn't really let up for the 1:46 minute running time. A running time, again, which is nigh on perfect. Too long and you'll be bored. There is no padding here. The story tells what needs to be told.Even Harry Styles didn't do the bad job people thought of him. Sure, he's not going to be an award winning actor any time soon but - for what he had to do in this film - he played the part well; as did the rest of the cast. Mark Rylance as the father setting sail from England to help those he can, with his son. Tom Hardy the fighter pilot... Hardy doing a great performance considering, for pretty much the whole film, we only see his eyes through his goggles. The emotion and intensity burning through just his eyes is immense. That being said, there are a lot of names in this film (Hardy, Rylance, Brannagh....) but no actor is bigger than the film. They all play their part and none of them distract from the story.I was excited to watch this film. I'm more excited to see it again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Just one word. SPECTACULAR.,"I went to see the movie last night and didn't want to have my hopes and expectations high, I usually do that, if I wait for a movie to come out for over a year, so I am not completely overpowered by the hype of seeing the movie finally. From a start, in second or third minute of the movie I had tears in my eyes. It may have many reasons, why. But even the start made me feel like, its gonna be good. And as it starts, the movie is packed, Christopher won't let you take a deep breathe, there isn't a single boring scene. You will be constantly on edge, and even though I know the whole story, I know a lot about WWII, i still hoped everyone included in the movie will survive. Also seeing how important the boats were, when I confused-donated last year to get one back to museum, it just made me really happy seeing how even a slight help can mean the world. Fionn was realistic, easy to believe and easy to love and support and cheer for him not to die. Harry Styles did a spectacular job, knowing that guy for about 5-6 years from the medias and the ex boy band, he outdone himself. He did everything so right and everything seemed so real. Cillian Murphy did amazing job, I truly could feel his emotions trough the screen and it just proved me he is one of the greatest actor of this age. Also, Tom Hardy, doing as much as he could till the end. If you are emotional about what happened in the war, you will definitely will be happy about how this movie was filmed, how great it was and how every character was real enough for you to tear once or twice. I am actually going to see that movie again tonight, and probably will later than on DVD, just because it became my favorite movie, replacing Gone Girl and American Sniper quite easily. Definitely recommend.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
The realism of Dunkirk....,"Last weekend we went to the cinema to see the movie Dunkirk. Our expectations were high because of many positive stories of people who already seen this movie. However, we were somehow disappointed after we saw this movie.In my honest opinion this movie does not tell the true story of what really happened at Dunkirk and what really went on with all the men desperitaly trying to leave France.Some scenes played next to each other but in a different time level. This made the movie difficult to follow. Also a plane without fuel which was able to stay mid-air for a considerable amount of time able to shoot enemy planes down, was so un-realistic.At least it was a movie where blood wasn't spilled as there was hardly any blood visible. Even though the bombs went down on thousands of soldiers, no blood or any lost parts of bodies were seen.Too bad that Dunkirk is not shown as it really was, however it is a good thing that events like Dunkirk are recorded. So people get a fairly good idea how WWII started.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Did I watch a different movie?,"This review contains no spoilers because there's nothing to spoil.
Nothing happens in this movie except unnecessarily loud scenes and people splashing around in water. Nobody talks! We are introduced to about 6 main characters with no backstory and very little dialogue, I couldn't even tell you anyone's name. The movie is a complete bore fest and the only reason I didn't fall asleep is because of how loud it is. It leaves me wondering if I watched a different movie or is this just another example of people liking what they're told to like? 1 out of 10 because you can't give any less than that or it would be minus 10",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Other war movies get rickity wrecked!!!,"Great war movie, was blown away (no pun intended)! Get ready for an action packed adventure that tells a story of a war, a war where battles are fought and innocent men are killed. There's also a medic at some stage in the movie but I wont spoil it and tell you when.

A movie about war that does not have war heroes,"I watched several war movies in the past years, and I always enjoyed the most the fighting scene, the rapid movement or the story regarding the event, the planning of the mission,action. What I loved in this movie is that it doesn't tell you a story as if you were a far away spectator, it takes you from your sit and puts you straight on that shore and tells you: ""This is war, now we are going to experience it together"". I felt the stress the private felt while trying to escape in every possible way, I felt the lack of oxygen in the underwater scenes, I felt the heaviness of the silence in the infinite seconds of waiting. Generally war movies, always try to draw a line between good and evil, underling who is the friend and who is the enemy; what I felt during this movie is that, more than trying to create two different groups, from the very beginning what is pictured is the human nature in the war zone: surviving instinct. There are a few scene where it does not matter on which side they were, the only thing that matter was: ""Mors tua vita mea"", another detail that add truth and authenticity to the story. Another thing that this movie has is, at least for me, being unpredictable. I didn't know, or catch, the destiny of the characters, until the end, until the very last scene I didn't know what was going to happen to every single character of the story.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
The big picture on a personal level.,"All British people know the story of Dunkirk, but few other nationalities may. A written prologue of what happened and why might be useful for other nations. Also, what happened to all the French? It tries to encompass the entire event by telling the story on the land, on the sea, and in the air. All the actors are superb. The sets are amazing. I felt dirty, wet and cold after watching it. As a movie it cannot be faulted, but it is not enough of a documentary for those who don't know the story. Also, I understand that 100s of small boats took part, but only a few are shown. The Spitfires are the real stars of this film. Aerial dogfights have not been seen (outside of star wars) for decades. The Music is annoying and distracts from the 70mm visual action on beaches and in the air. Do see it in 70mm. Take a blanket and a cup of tea.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"Focussing on the event, not on the characters, with a couple of problems","We get to see the Dunkirk evacuation from land, air and sea, without getting too attached to any of the characters, which worked fine for me.A WEEK: The land guys are a bunch of soldiers trying repeatedly to get on a boat to England, but ending in worst trouble every time. Some claustrophobic moments in sinking ships are quite uncomfortable. The evacuation lasted a week so we get the feeling of a long wait.ONE DAY: On the sea, we follow the story of one of the many civilians who helped carrying soldiers back to England with their own boats. The two-way journey lasted one day, so the experience was different.ONE HOUR: The RAF pilots add more seasickness opportunities, with their daring manoeuvres to protect their stranded comrades. Their tanks could support one hour of flight, and this is the third, different view point.For the above mentioned reasons, the plot is not edited in chronological order, which was slightly annoying, but there was enough tension to keep the story going without a dull moment. If you like character-driven stories you will not like this, but I appreciated the lack of personal stories and the focus on the general, dismal feeling of defeat.Two small problems: the beach was too quiet, with relatively few soldiers waiting for a ride home. Over 300.000 soldiers were evacuated from Dunkirk, but we see at most a few hundreds waiting on the beach. Finally, the soundtrack was overbearing. It is clear it was a dramatic event without the need to have it hammered home with the hyper- dramatic, anxiety-inducing music.PS I know Nolan did not want to use CGI, but in this case some extra men on the beach would have added realism, rather than the opposite...",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
About as epic as a cup of tea and a digestive.,"How on earth did Nolan spend upwards of $150,000,000 on this film. The BBC could have knocked this one out on twelve shillings and sixpence. There is no dramatic scale to the rescue, you are left with the impression that a few people had nothing to do on a Saturday afternoon and took a quick trip to France for some duty free and maybe pick up a few stray soldiers. Nolan has taken his collection of tools and tricks from Interstellar and recast them into war film. Epic it is not, a tribute to the thousands of men and women that risked their lives to save the British Army from Germany, it is not.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Nolan delivers yet again,"Christopher Nolan is a director who doesn't really do things by halves, so when it was announced that his latest film would be a war film, the levels of anticipation I had for it went through the roof. He's directed some of my favourite films so to see Nolan make a war film for the first time, particularly about something like Dunkirk, was always going to be one of my most anticipated films of the year.As 400,000 men wait to be evacuated from Dunkirk beach with the enemy closing in, Dunkirk follows the efforts of men on land, at sea and in the air who fought so bravely to make it possible for them to return home to Britain.Desperation runs rife during war and Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk doesn't waste any of its runtime is depicting just how desperate a situation it was as men waited to be taken home, not knowing when the enemy would strike next. Nolan's boldest decision in Dunkirk is to not show one German soldier throughout and it really adds to the film's intensity, the fear of the men trapped on the beach fully embedding itself in the audience's mind as a result.The narrative choice was one that surprised me but, while it took me a few minutes to work out exactly how it was panning out, it's a choice that makes Dunkirk unlike any war film I've ever seen. The three narrative threads the film follows take place over different time periods however, Nolan ensures they come together rather magnificently, intercutting between each narrative seamlessly thanks to Lee Smith's sharp editing.Nolan has formed some incredible collaborative partnerships throughout his career, most notably with Hans Zimmer who has scored a number of his films. Zimmer really feels as if he tries to outdo his previous works each and every time, which is only a good thing for us, and his work on Dunkirk is up there with his finest to date. The inclusion of the ticking clock superbly fitting in with the theme of time and emphasising the desperation of the situation.A relatively shorter collaborative partnership in comparison is that between Nolan cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema, who first worked with Nolan on Interstellar. Just like Interstellar, van Hoytema's breathtaking visuals fit with Nolan's narrative superbly well, accentuating the scale of the operation at Dunkirk even in such a close-knit narrative.Coming to the performances, Nolan's Dunkirk features an ensemble cast who all impress despite having to work with very little character development. People may find it hard to connect with the film as a result however, I felt for these characters as much as I have in films with well-rounded characters so the lack of character development didn't really hinder my experience. It was a real pleasure to watch actors like Tom Hardy and Kenneth Branagh bring their usual qualities to a film but it was even better to see acting newcomers in Fionn Whitehead and Harry Styles, yes Harry Styles, make their mark in Nolan's film.Myself and other film fans may sound like broken records when describing each new Nolan film as a masterpiece however, when the man keeps on making the films he does, it's certainly justified. More so because Dunkirk is exactly that, a masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Sobering and captivating,"28 July 2017 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Dunkirk. This is a name everyone has heard of, how the allied troops were forced north onto the beaches and how a grand flotilla of small boats went and rescued them, but how many people have really sat down and thought about what actually happened. Films often romanticise war, and it's not always their fault, stories transferred to the big screen often make heroes where there are none and hide true heroes in the background. That is not the case with this film......Christopher Nolan has written and produced a masterpiece. The raw edgy style of cinematography draws you in from the very beginning and you feel yourself running alongside these soldiers, sitting in the back seat of the spitfire willing the bullets to find their mark, and on board the small vessels urging their engines to go faster and get the job done. The film is full of heroes, not just the pilots or the skippers, but every single fighting man, played by actors representing real people, in a very real and terrible situation. I thought the way the film jumped between the three main parts of the story was captivating, I found myself getting immersed in each bit, not wanting to leave but eager to jump to the next part to see how that group of people were faring. There was very little in the way of blood flying around, but that in no way lessened the impact of the horror of war, and the desperation these men must have felt as they tried again and again to get off the beach and head for home. There were no fanfares, no trumpets, just a quiet satisfaction of job done and a sadness for all those who didn't survive. An excellent job from Christopher Nolan.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
A little overrated,"This is Nolan's first movie on an historical event. It's OK, but overrated by Nolan lovers I guess.

Nolan Could Film Himself Taking a Poop And People Would Think It's a Masterpiece,"I'm giving this film a 6/10 because that's honestly what it deserves. When voting officially opened for this movie here on IMDb, it was at a 9.8/10. Are you kidding me? I'm sorry but I'm not going to be one of those people who just worships the ground Nolan walks on. I'm dead serious when I say Nolan could film himself taking a dump and people would rave about it.This movie is decent. It's better than your average war movie. A six out of ten is an appropriate rating for this film. The acting is good, which the film heavily relies on since there isn't a ton of dialogue. This is also probably Nolan's shortest film, which is also nice since he doesn't make you sit there and subject you to all sorts of his self-proclaimed ""mind-f***s"" and twists that he tries to throw at you. This movie doesn't try to out-think itself, which is fitting since a war movie doesn't need to be like that.All in all, it does what a war movie should do. Is it worthy of its current rating of 9/10 on IMDb? Absolutely not. Is it better than average? Yes.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Something Different From Nolan: A New Kind Of War Film,"Until this point, film director and all-around mastermind Christopher Nolan has made epic character films. Memento, The Prestige, Inception, Interstellar...that were all epic in terms of character arc or story. Heck, Nolan even created the grittiest, true-to-real life Batman the world has seen to this point.With ""Dunkirk"", however, Nolan really goes back to his film roots: that of a cinematographer. He's no stranger to widely professing that the love of film, camera, and shot construction are what appeal to him most about film-making. While he usually has at least a hand in his films' screenplays, it is generally assumed that brother Jonathan (now of ""Westworld"" fame) does most of the heavy lifting in that department. Flying solo (w/o Jonathan) on ""Dunkirk"", it is clear that Christopher means for this new film to almost completely be told in a visual fashion. Whether that style appeals to you will determine your overall enjoyment of the experience.For a basic plot summary, ""Dunkirk"" tells the story of the famous 1940 WW2 scenario in which thousands of Allied soldiers are trapped on the beach at Dunkirk waiting for evacuation. The film tells this story of survival via three different lenses and time frames:-The Mole (land): Two young soldiers, Tommy (Fionn Whitehead) & Gibson (Aneurin Barnard), meet up on the Dunkirk beach and make an unspoken pact to find a way to escape onto one of the rescue boats. In their efforts, they run up against a number of obstacles, along the way picking up another friend, Alex (Harry Styles), in which to abscond with.Paralleling the escape attempts of the young soldiers are a number of conversations between military officers Commander Bolton (Kenneth Branagh) and Colonel Winnant (James D'Arcy), effectively framing how mammoth of an evacuation effort will be needed to not still be trapped like sitting ducks when the enemy arrives.-The Sea: Boats from the British mainland (just 30 miles or so from Dunkirk) are being commandeered to help with the rescue effort, but Mr. Dawson (Mary Rylance) sets out with no military presence on his boat. Joining him are son Peter (Tom Glynn-Carney) and the son's friend George (Barry Keoghan). Along the way, the yacht picks up a shell-shocked soldier (played by Cillian Murphy), who's express consent is to never return to Dunkirk again.-The Air: Patrolling the skies above the entire operation are Spitfighter pilots Farrier (Tom Hardy) & Collins (Jack Lowden), who must manage their fuel reserves, navigation techniques, and firepower to provide as much help as possible to ground/sea troops.In stark contrast to Nolan's previous efforts, ""Dunkirk"" is not a character piece, nor is it reliant whatsoever on narrative twists or epiphanies. Instead, ""Dunkirk"" is almost purely visual. Long stretches go by with almost no dialogue at all, and no backstory is given on any characters besides what is being viewed on-screen in the moment.""Dunkirk"" is also a very interesting sort of war movie in that it has almost no distinguishable ""message"" to it. It takes the event of the Dunkirk evacuation (one which must resonate deeply with Nolan, an Englishman himself) and portrays it via a visual medium. This is the furthest thing from a propaganda war picture. and also contains none of the overt violence of, say, ""Saving Private Ryan"". One almost has to re-train oneself to watch/appreciate a war movie like this one, since most of war cinema is more blustery and chest-pounding.For me, then, the 7-star rating comes because I so enjoy character-driven films (or ones that feature intriguing narratives) that this one set me aback a bit. I wasn't expecting this approach. Perhaps it will grow on me as I learn to appreciate the subtleties to Nolan's craft, but for now I'll peg it at a ""solid 7"".That being said, there is no doubt that ""Dunkirk"" is an excellent film for what Christopher Nolan set out to accomplish with it. It features perhaps the best cinematography one will ever see on the big screen, and it is never ""boring"", in the sense that something interest is always happening on-screen (even despite, or perhaps because of, the lack of dialogue or character-building).While ""Dunkirk"" certainly will fall short when compared to Nolan's other more epic, sprawling masterpieces, it never was meant to be looked at in that way in the first place. This is Nolan taking a bit of a step back (at least in terms of writing) to expertly direct/craft a passion project. Viewed from that perspective, there is still much to enjoy and appreciate. I would highly recommend (almost command!) one to see this film in the IMAX format, as the video and sound are such important components of the overall experience.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Emotional and technical brilliance,"Thank you, Nolan, for being the saviour of my blockbuster movie summer.

During the 107 minutes of running time, I was glued to screen. Nolan and his cast and crew delivers one of the tightest war thrillers ever to screened to this date.

This movie(except maybe insomnia) follows a rather straightforward story line, thought he does play with perspectives that intertwine and overlap in time(his trademark non linear storytelling) amplifying the intensity with each passing minute.Hats of to Chris.

Dunkirk gets top marks all around.,"An outstanding 10 out of 10 are the only numbers I've calculated.Christopher Nolan has now solidified his name forever when it comes to naming who had the Midas touch in film making for the last decade+.Behold the assault on your senses...all of them.Dunkirk, from the very start straps you in, forces you to take a deep breath and then grabs those senses and never let them go for the better part of an hour and 35 mins.The sense of urgency you get begins immediately. The visuals are breathtaking. The audio effects immensely impressive. It chases you left and right, from the bottom and from above. You'll tilt your head during some of the flying scenes. That's a rather a neat trick without 3D/VR. 65mm really shines here, filming at its finest I'd say (the whole movie is shot entirely in 65mm and boy does it look fantastic, a true work of art). To get that feeling and the 'I was in awe' cinematography and sound experience you should...no, need to watch this film in a 4K/Dolby Atmos equipped theater or if available in your area, IMAX 70mm. Nothing else will cut it and nothing else will immerse your senses, nothing. Dunkirk will for sure be the showcase Demo Disc for home theater retailers and those wanting to test their Atmos or DTS:X setups. It needs to be said again, this film has some of the most incredible sounds and cinematography ever captured thus far. Making it a sure contender for an Oscar win or 2. Best Picture of the year so far for me. It could very well sweep the Academy Awards in 2018 in at least 3 categories.Hans Zimmer, make way for another Oscar on that shelf. With the masterful crescendo scoring, no one else in the business could have brought my senses to the climax that I experienced. Take a bow and know your legacy and film contributions can never be questioned and hardly replicated today by others, period.From the start, I felt as if I was being pursued by Jaws! I felt like I was drowning at one point. I felt like I was flying and in an aerial dogfight the next. Incredible combination all around, gentlemen. Incredible.The acting is certainly beyond reproach, no question. Skilled directing and producing are a must, but the efforts Nolan and Co put into this film could have been lost if the actors didn't bring their full potential, to convey the desperate situation these men and women found themselves in, waiting to be rescued, all hope just about lost, spirits broken and home yearning.

A Beautifully yet weak film.,"Before I bash the film, I should at least praise it. The film like every Nolan film looks beautiful. The cinematography alone can keep you engaged. Also the crew did a nice job creating the look of WW2. I also like the non-main character way of telling a story a little bit because it feels like your in an actual battle where your focusing on multiple peoples lives instead of just one. The acting was also on point from all of the cast as usual in a Nolan film.Now the bad. From the start of it, the film assumes you know who the combatants were at Dunkirk, when it was, and also where it was. There isn't even any slang by the British like ""Hun"" or ""Jerry"" to identify the enemy. Were just supposed to know. Also back to the main character problem, although it's good from a war perspective, for the audience perspective, it just seems a very artsy move, which it is. We have no band of character to latch onto. Also the ""why"" problem. There is no mention of why they are at the beach, why there is a German advance.

Survival is Victory,"This review of Dunkirk is spoiler free***** (5/5)CHRISTOPHER NOLAN HAS shown time and time again that he is no stranger to massive box-office breaking productions which come with genre busting techniques, he's done magic in The Prestige, he's done superhero in The Dark Knight Trilogy, to a mind-bending dream world in Inception and finally he's done Matthew McConauhey being sucked into a black hole in Interstellar. His latest is essentially his The Longest Day having trying his hand at a war drama, although it is in fact his shortest film since his 2002 remake of Insomnia standing at only 106 minutes it's an epic feat showing that he doesn't need length. In fact, throughout it's entirety it's one big battle in a slight deviation from that first thirty minute opening of Saving Private Ryan or the big battle towards the end of Hacksaw Ridge no, Nolan kick starts this with the action and refuses to let up.Dunkirk is intense, set in May 1940 on the beaches of Dunkirk, France 400,000 allied soldiers with teams of French, Canadian and British soldiers are evacuating the battle in a desperate attempt to get home, instead during their fight for survival home comes to them. During this evacuation there are several destroyers, medical ships lead by Kenneth Branagh's naval captain, all while in the midst of German fighters trying to gun them down. There are spitfire's that fly through in protection for the allies flown by a team of pilots led by Tom Hardy's hot-headed pilot Farrier, in the water, Mark Rylance's Man on the Boat is heading towards the war in an attempt to pick up soldiers. A powerful introduction to an intense war drama which is incredibly by Nolan on his IMAX camera, along with the beautiful cinematography and Hans Zimmer's eerily incredible score and it's brilliant. Every scene is handled perfectly nothing feels out of place from the fighter jet's gunfire, through the incredible heroics of Rylance, to the rough waters below Nolan's camera weavers through these intense dramatic moments smoothly not avoiding any detail and it's wonderful.Where the action is its strongest is in the skies. The allied soldiers are constantly bombarded by German fire, there are allied planes flying in from every corner in a desperate attempt to gun them down. Yesteryear's audience would've settled at watching digital laser dogfights in Star Wars but today we get bullets flying, planes dropping and smoke engulfing the screen and it's brilliant. In addition, unlike any other war film Nolan doesn't linger on the violence of war he doesn't refrain his camera to piles of bodies with there intestines hanging out, or having missing limbs, no here he finds a new path for his focus; the psychosis of it all, the pain of being shot or nearly drowning, the torment of constant gunfire, and the fear of having shell shock a message which Cillian Murphy fantastically conveys. The performances are excellent too, though there is limited dialogue Nolan handles his actors brilliantly teetering through several different perspectives, there's one on the docks, on the planes and on the ground with the youngsters.However, despite having the star power of his older cast their characterization is sadly limited to their jobs Murphy is just a whining soldier, Rylance is the man on a boat, Branagh is just the naval captain and Hardy is the pilot there's no other characterization that goes beyond that. It's the newcomers who are the real stars led by Fionn Whitehead's Tommy who leads the team of young survivors to rescue, they're put through a string of dramatic moments they are shot at, they are drowned and they are forced to make sacrifices to save themselves. Their performances excel Whitehead is brilliantly quiet he is teamed up with Alex (Styles) who mostly seems disappointed that he didn't fight for his country. The two work together to save themselves and their teammates. Still, despite the slight drop in the older characters, Dunkirk is an excellent piece of filmmaking which excels in brilliant cinematography, a fantastic score, shining camera angles and brilliant performances this is easily Nolan's best film since Inception and it could just be the best film of 2017.VERDICT: Nolan's latest is an intense war drama which holds no bars to the torture of those men and ultimately pays off in style as an excellent lesson in history.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Re-writing History,"The cinematography and direction of this movie is excellent and for that reason at least it is worth viewing.However my understanding of the real events of Dunkirk and the truth about it was that it represented a retreat and a disaster.Yet the film puts a positive ""spin"" on what really happened.Furthermore: there are many people in the world who are unaware of the history of the real Dunkirk and for much of this picture the events come across-to me at least- as muddled and confused.For the above and other reasons the best I can do is 6 and a half which after anxious consideration I round down to:6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Nope,"Too loud, too disjointed, too much Kenneth Branagh staring meaningfully into the distance. There seemed to be many scenes that would not be reasonable, starting with two soldiers encountering each other in an isolated location: they would not silently go about their business without confirming each other's identity. I thought I saw a spitfire that had run out of fuel first fly right-to-left, then left-to-right to land on a beach in front of the Germans, descending in daylight and landing in darkness. There was so much confusion as to what was being shown, and such loud ""music"" that it was difficult to follow the story. The critics seem to love this movie. I don't know why.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Major Disappointment,"Been looking forward to Dunkirk to come out forever (since there were trailers for months). Love this director and his other works. What a disappointment in so many ways. Without dropping a spoiler, the story telling has a complex structure. If you don't understand it, the rest of the movie is mostly confusing. I felt kind of dumb when my friend explained it to me after the movie. He's an expert in military history and it took him half the film to figure it out.I also love Hans Zimmer and can listen to hours of his work (and do). This score could leave one with PTSD. Rather than let the story induce an emotional response, the music is overbearing, telling us what to feel. Personally I got that this was a tense situation, and I didn't need fingers on the chalkboard music to tell me that.Then there's the characters. It is sometimes impossible to distinguish one British soldier from another (apparently, they were all the same height with the same hair color and same haircut). For me the only compelling part of the story was that of a family on one of the civilian rescue boats. Excellent acting and story telling there. However, Kenneth Branagh, another favorite, either forgot what a brilliant actor he is, or was extremely limited by the script and director. His primary job seemed to be standing in one spot,looking well dressed, with no emotion, and appearing nothing like his dirty, desperate, exhausted, hungry and thirsty soldiers.There is some good in the movie especially the photography. But, I can't remember when I have been so disappointed by a film. I seem to be in the minority here. But, please, please don't give Best Picture to this movie.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Dunkirk is the most realistic war-movie ever made.A Christopher Nolan's Masterpiece (Which is quite common to him).,"Dunkirk (2017): Christopher Nolan is one of the greatest director of this generation who can handle several complexity themes and can make them commercially successful.Christopher Nolan is the name that makes the internet generation of movie lovers go nuts. He is worshiped by them. Seven of his nine movies feature on IMDb top 250. Five of his movies have earned more than $500 million at the international box office. One would assume that such fame must be a blessing for Nolan. And blessing it is, but it also comes with massive burden of expectations.He never disappoints and after a sci-fi masterpiece Interstellar,Nolan made this war masterpiece Dunkirk.All the early reviews already showed that Dunkirk is another masterpiece from Nolan.Plot: The story of Dunkirk is well known. During the early stages of World War II, Allied soldiers from Britain, Belgium and France are surrounded by the German Army on the beaches of Dunkirk, France. In one of the single largest operation of its kind, commonly known as the Miracle of Dunkirk, around 400,000 soldiers were evacuated.My Review: Nolan is infamous for his non-linearity screenplays.His Inception,Interstellar,Memento all are mind-bending screenplays.But when he took up the project of Dunkirk,all the fans of his got disappointed.But surprisingly,Nolan even molded this war film into non-linear screenplay. Each of the stories occur in different timelines and then merge together in an explosive and breathtaking finale.Each and every scene in this movie is an art of realistic suspense.There are lot of tense moments all over the movie.Nolan successfully made us feel the agony of war in all the possible ways.Be it infantry,air force or sea..it is a true horror. You will feel your pulse racing every single moment of the film. In ways more than one, 'Dunkirk' works more like a thriller than an action drama.'Dunkirk' won't be the film it is without the cinematography of Hoyte van Hoytema and the score of Hans Zimmer. The visuals of the film are just extraordinary, be it the wide shots of the beach or underwater sequences. Hoytema does his career best work here after Interstellar.Hans Zimmer's score is inspiring Even beyond the visuals and the score, the film is a technical marvel. I expect the film to sweep all the technical categories at the Oscars, from editing to sound design. I won't be surprised if Nolan himself walks away with the first Oscar of his career.Last but not least.Nolan made me cry in the climax sequences.He once again brilliantly made audience get tears with his heart-warming climax.SO,Dunkirk is the most realistic war-movie ever made.A Christopher Nolan's Masterpiece (Which is quite common to him).My rating 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"One of, if not the best Nolan films yet","Dunkirk is more than a simple summer blockbuster. It is a thriller with masterful directing, execution, and music. It is a work of art.Let's start with the practical effects. There isn't any CGI used in the film. All the planes, boats, and explosions are real. It adds to the authenticity. Hearing the Stukas as they bombed the troops on the beach was terrifying and made you wonder what exactly it felt like to be on the beaches of Dunkirk in May 1940. The spitfires and ME109 German fighters were amazing too.The Stukas are never seen from an aerial view as well, just from ground, really selling the dread and fear people felt when they heard its infamous whine as it swooped down. That was captured perfectly in this movie. The aerial combat looks very good, and is done with real planes. It is amazing.There isn't a lot of dialogue in this film and there isn't a central character to develop. That may be a bad thing to some, but I don't mind it. It is telling the story of the battle rather than a person's story during the battle, and I like that.All three phases of the battle, air, seas, and land are shown and three different groups of characters are portrayed. It does a great job jumping from phase to phase.This movie looks incredible. The sets are all practical, the explosions are real, and the performances are great.Hans Zimmer made a great score that builds intensity, adding a ticking clock to the pieces to build suspense. This movie is suspenseful and a thriller meant to show the terrors of war, rather than the horrors (not the same thing). Every moment had me on the edge of my seat. It was intense.The film is only one hour and forty seven minutes, which is quite short for a Nolan film, but it feels longer because of the constant action and suspense.Dunkirk should be considered for movie of the year. It is one of Nolan's best films. He can do no wrong it seems.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Worthy Every minute of your time,"Story telling:This movie is one original and unique experiment on how best an ordinary story can be told in a very very intriguing non linear way.It is the same known story from the history books, told from three different points of view, spread across three different time duration, moving at a three different paces on three different elements , intervening with other time lines finally converging to one breathtaking climax.First is from the POV of the soldiers, on the ground, spread across a week, gloomy dull sky, with constant fear on their faces. Second is from the POV of the civilians with boats, on the water, spread across a day, with sacrifice for home as the emotion. Third is from the POV of the royal air force, in the air , spread across an hour, blue sky and bravery against all odds. All the major incidents in the story line are shown from all three perspectives and edited in such a brilliant way that one has to put their brains to work on to know if they have already seen that from a different perspective. Every time, something is assumed, Nolan comes back with a surprise in a different time line only to remind you that this is his movie!How is it different?It is not a conventional story. It does not start with an innocent young lad, volunteering, bidding adieu to worried family and loved ones, fighting in the combat zone, coming back victorious with head held high to the fluttering flag.Its not about damn characters and there are none(spoiler: there is no Batman and Robin too). Its just about the war. Its just about the action. No god damn lines to put on your bedroom posters.Overall - worthy of the money you spend on expensive ticket at IMAX with Dolby Atmos surround sound. Only boring part is when they paused in the middle to sell popcorn.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Not Tied Together Well,"The camera work and the acting were spot on great. The music was superb. But, the film did not offer any historical references. How did the army become pinned down? Why was the army stuck at that particular location? Where were their enemies? There was no mention of the three day pause enacted by the Wehrmacht which enabled the Allied forces to escape. Where was the Luftwaffe? A few planes were in the film but no real numbers. So many unanswered questions. This could have been another Patton but better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Entirely enthralled.,"Going into Dunkirk I had no expectations, only because I saw the trailer once and moved past it. It was a friend who got me to go.The beginning held little dialogue, which turned out to set the tone perfectly, causing me to become immediately immersed into a war torn world (WWII). There was a small bit of reading and as an English junkie, or so I like to call myself, that had me stumped on whether or not it was correct grammar. In the end, it was correct. Other than that, the movie was well paced, full of action, and created a connection with all of its characters. The revisited story made for a movie that will not easily be forgotten in my mind.Also, Harry Styles played his role incredibly well. I was impressed overall.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Tries too hard to be Relevant,"Dunkirk has very weakly written script , it relies a lot on Visual effects and sounds especially . Story tries to hard to make sense , frankly speaking there is no story . It is like a documentary of enacting escape from Dunkirk , that's all . I think people are over rating it because of Nolan . I would have preferred any Jonathan Nolan script over this Christopher Nolan written Dunkirk . I would rate this movie 6/10 . That's my personal opinion .",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

Nolan does it again.,"Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk has been perhaps one of the year's most awaited movies, quite rare for a war film. The man has been behind some of the best movies of the 2000s and 2010s, such as Memento, The Dark Knight Trilogy, The Prestige, Inception and Interstellar.So how does Dunkirk fare against his other works?Quite well, actually. Dunkirk is an amazing movie, and you can really tell Nolan put loads of effort into it (the film was a passion project of his, apparently). The guy certainly knows how to direct a film, deftly weaving through multiple plot lines. It's a visual achievement: The film looks gorgeous, even in the digital screening I was subjected to. I can only imagine how incredible the IMAX 70mm version was. And yes, the film is rated PG-13, meaning there's not as much blood and gore as an R-rated movie like Saving Private Ryan. But the way this film is shot, it doesn't need it. The blood and gore may be an added bonus at best, or a gratuitous distraction at worst.The same can be said for the swearing: Of course, there is the usual PG-13 swearing (and even 2 f-bombs) but nowhere near the level of, again, Saving Private Ryan. But the way the dialogue is written, you probably wouldn't notice. Speaking of dialogue, there's not that much in it. This is a departure from Nolan's usually verbose scripts. He often lets the cinematography and sound design do the story telling.Speaking of sound design, there is some incredible work here. It is quite realistic, making the experience more immersive and terrifying; I can see an Oscar nomination in this area. The score is also insane: Thunderous and tense, this one is probably one of Hans Zimmer's best works, and that is saying something. He is one of the greatest composers working in the film industry.So, tight direction, beautiful cinematography, smart dialogue, incredible sound design and a fittingly intense score - why did I still give this movie an 8/10?Unfortunately, the shallow characterization is more than a small handicap to the experience. Nolan did this on purpose, but this is one of his decisions that, in my humble opinion, backfired. None of the characters are given any substantial character arcs; we don't even catch the names of a few (which sadly include the lead of the movie). This makes it difficult to latch on to the characters and care about why they're fighting. The closest we ever come to any character fleshing-out is Mark Rylance's Mr. Dawson, and even that isn't much. It's an unfortunate choice, and prevents this movie from being the ""masterpiece"" it probably could have been.Overall, though, I was really impressed with Dunkirk, and I'm really excited to see what Nolan does next.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
A near perfect look into the mindset of a soldier in the midst of wartime chaos,"Dunkirk is a war film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight Trilogy, Inception, The Prestige). Based on the real-life Dunkirk evacuation of World War II, the film further proves that Nolan is one of the best living directors and cements his legacy as a brilliant, unique filmmaker.In 1940, over 400,000 allied British and French troops stationed on the beaches of Dunkirk in France find themselves surrounded by German troops. With the enemy closing in fast, the allied troops desperately try to find ways to escape across the English Channel to the safety of the British mainland.Despite its limited dialogue, the film offers a near perfect look into the mindset of a soldier in the midst of the wartime chaos. Not since Saving Private Ryan has a film so effectively pulled this off. The unnaturally loud and piercing sound of bullets and gunfire evoke feelings of fear and panic in the viewer, giving off the impression that they too are on the battlefield. The audience is given real sense of a race against time (time being a recurring theme in several Christopher Nolan's films) thanks in part to Hans Zimmer's fantastic, yet, minimalist score. There's not a single moment in this film that does not elicit suspense or tension in the viewer. Christopher Nolan's creative use of cinematography perfectly showcases the desperation of the soldiers in their need to escape. Overall, I consider Dunkirk not only among the director's all time best films, but one of the best war films period.I rate it a very high 9.5/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Christopher Nolan has done it again!,"Christopher Nolan has had a marvelous run as a director, especially in the last 10 years. He has been able to adapt his grandiose style into a variety of genres such as the superhero genre (The Dark Knight Trilogy), sci-fi (Interstellar), and ""thiller"" (Inception). With his latest movie he has decided to adapt the infamous ""disaster of Dunkirk"" to the big screen and here, we have another fantastic film to add to his already impressive filmography. Nolan manages to make an emotionally grueling war movie that frankly does not feature any of the genre clichés one might expect. It is solely about the event which means Nolan refrains from ever giving the viewer a moment to breath. Without giving too much away the structure of the storytelling the movie provides is probably its strongest element, that will keep you buried in the films grasp. As well as Hans Zimmer subtle yet effective score which, just like the movie, almost never lets up. The technical aspect of the movie is perfection, everything from the sound design, the cinematography, etc. Nolan once again brings us a technically beautiful film. One small thing to keep in mind is that this more of a suspense movie then it is a war movie but that did not bother me, it is just worth noting. Regardless, this is a fantastic movie that will most definitely be defined as a classic. BR",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
DUNKIRK is a Good Movie,"For me the true focus of DUNKIRK ought to be about the English people who risked all to get their troops off the beach. The scared young soldiers seemed to dominate more than stories of their brave elders who rescued them. The flying scenes and British pilots were magnificent, and especially the courage and valor of the older man and his son to the rescue in their boat. A good movie!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
A Triptych of Colors & Zimmer's Score Not Enough To Compensate for Nolan's Artsy Excess,"This is one of those films where a lot of nothing happens. Not exactly nothing, but there is a focus on the mundane, if that can be said in regards to anything during wartime. This is not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, I can name several films, especially international ones, in which this is the exact reason I love it. It did not really work in this film, though.The Good: * The best thing about this film is Hans Zimmer. Aside from the music, constant clock ticking creates the almost claustrophobic and every present fear in the film (Zimmer actually used a pocket watch belonging to Nolan). With very little dialogue, Zimmer's score is its own character. * Along with the score, the cinematography was gorgeous. Wide angle shots of the beach, dark colors, the mise en scène. The film was actually divided into three segmented colors; sky blue, dark blue, and orange, referring to the triptych plot of air, sea, and land, respectively. (Note: Continuing his advocacy for film over digital formats, Christopher Nolan chose to shoot the movie in a combination of 15/70mm IMAX film and Super Panavision 65mm film in order to achieve the maximum possible image quality. After The Master (2012) and The Hateful Eight (2015), Dunkirk (2017) was the third wide release motion picture of the current decade to be primarily shot and shown theatrically in 70mm. I was fortunate enough to see this version.)These two things set the tone and mode for the entire film.They made the film.The Bad: * I hate to admit that I was greatly disappointed. Nothing happened. It was depressing and depressing and sometimes that is a good thing. This is war, after all. There are other ways films that do this, but Nolan screws this up by trying to interweave all the stories. * Nolan always has admirable concepts, in theory. Lamentably, he then makes the mistake of being excessive with the special effects + unnecessary fancy tricks. His splicing of three different timelines and stories not only made watching it a little confusing, but killed the connections I could have felt with any characters.The film is told from three points of view: on the beach with the infantry, the evacuation by the navy (showing how civilians came to the rescue), and in the air. Speaking about the narrative structure in Premiere magazine, Christopher Nolan stated: ""For the soldiers who embarked in the conflict, the events took place on different temporalities. On land, some stayed one week stuck on the beach. On the water, the events lasted a maximum day; and if you were flying to Dunkirk, the British spitfires would carry an hour of fuel. To mingle these different versions of history, one had to mix the temporal strata. Hence the complicated structure; even if the story is very simple. Do not repeat it to the studio: it will be my most experimental film.""Although I have always and still do love Nolan's work, I refuse to play the cognitive dissonance game to convince myself that I loved this film for its artistic examinations of the desolation of war.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Dunkirk is an Intense and Memorable War Movie About Courage Against Insurmountable Odds,"*Minor Spoilers Ahead* I would normally do a plot summary but the movie Dunkirk is so focused on telling the story of this escape in a unique way that even giving you anything but the bare bones information feels like giving away too much. If you know your history, the evacuation of Dunkirk took place over approximately a week from May 27, 1940- June 4, 1940 where Allied troops (predominately British and French) were forced out onto the beaches of Dunkirk by the German army. With so many soldiers in one place and with the Allies lacking clear evacuation plan, it made them easy targets for the German air force and navy. The lives of over 300,000 soldiers hung in the balance. This movie primarily centres around soldier Tommy (Fionn Whitehead), mariner Mr. Dawson (Mark Rylance) and pilot Farrier (Tom Hardy) and their heroic efforts in this conflict.A lot of Dunkirk will take your breath away. The best parts of Dunkirk are white-knuckle tense and I found myself breathing heavier and trying to turn away from the screen. The movie envelops you and puts you right in these soldiers' inevitable doom. This movie wants to place you in the middle of the action and they accomplish that on every level. There are scenes of soldiers drowning or being burned alive that are just gut-wrenching. I've seen some war movies feature similar scenes but I think that Dunkirk might have performed them best.There is so much in Dunkirk to be appreciated and Christopher Nolan's commitment to practical effects and filming things in a unique and interesting way are chief among them. The action here is mind-blowing but it feels grounded and that makes it more effective. Nolan could have rested on his laurels and just turned anything out but it feels like he took this story to heart and was committed to bring an understanding to the world of how important this event was in British military history.Dunkirk takes a surprising turn in that there aren't a lot of big name actors despite it being a Christopher Nolan project. That isn't to say the acting is lacklustre, the cast does their job admirably. Instead of relying on the material, they have to let you know through their body language and their expressions. Tom Hardy is his normal excellent self, he can convey more with just his eyes than some actors can in their whole bodies. Mark Rylance also does good work, he's good at being reserved yet he can really get you to feel. Kenneth Branagh also fares well, he's a veteran and he does his job capably. Fionn Whitehead is excellent for a relative newcomer. There are many more actors and I didn't find a weak performance among the cast.I do have some small complaints about the movie. The first is that even though the movie does detail the timelines of the main characters, things can become confusing when the stories interweave with each other. Second, it can be hard to distinguish who lives and who dies because you don't have any personal knowledge about who each actor is playing. The characters blend together at times and there were a couple of emotional deaths that I couldn't figure out who didn't make it until I could determine it from a process of elimination. My biggest complaint is that the beginning and the end of the movie drag a little bit. I feel like that even though this is a fairly short movie, they pad certain things out or the movie falls in love with its cinematography (which as mentioned above is phenomenal) and forgets to tighten things up. I also found the score a little overbearing early in the movie but that concern faded away as the sound editing and the haunting musical choices are excellent at producing horror and nail-biting suspense are great on the whole.If you think about high points and low points, Dunkirk's highs place it an elite category of war movie. The look, the action and the fascinating story can stack up against the best of the best. My low points weren't wrecking the movie for me but it did take me out of it here and there. I'm so glad I got to see Dunkirk on the big screen though, even if I was a couple of weeks late. It's a movie to be seen in the nicest theatre you have around to fully appreciate it. I applaud Christopher Nolan for taking on this story and even though this isn't my favourite movie of the year or even my favourite war movie, it is a valuable piece of cinema in its own right. If you can, I definitely recommend you check it out on the big screen if you can.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
A visually stunning film bogged down by a lack of compelling characters,"This film was one of my most anticipated movies of 2017, and directed by one of my favorite directors, but honestly, I was kind of let down. Technically speaking, this film is a masterpiece. The cinematography is absolutely stunning and each scene is full of suspense. However, there is one big flaw that I can not overlook. The film is practically devoid of a single compelling character, and is forced to lean more on its spectacle and action. And even the action can get a little tiring, specifically the air battles, where by the third downed plane, it just starts to feel repetitive. Overall, the film looks exactly like what you'd expect a film directed by Christopher Nolan to look like, but without an emotional core, I can't help but be disappointed by it. Is it a good film? I'd say yes. But is it a film on the level of Full Metal Jacket or Saving Private Ryan? I'd have to disagree on that.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Very Powerful...,"Christopher Nolan's newest film Dunkirk is a psychologically harrowing war film about one of the terrifying events occurred in history.While it may not be one of his best films, it still is a profound, powerful war film that truly honors the fact based story and event. Nolan crafts this film as if we, the audience is one of the frightened soldiers attended at the tragic yet distressing event that plays at the big screen extensively realistic. Dunkirk does the best job at satisfyingly delivering the frighteningly realistic portrayal of war and the evacuation in the outlook of the soldiers who were desperate at reaching home. What makes Dunkirk one of the best war films and eminently realistic are the production designs which has a usage of substantial boats, planes etc, the impressive performances and the top- notch sound design.Most films especially superhero or blockbuster action flicks consistently include large reliance on CGI. It has become the crucial trend in the film industry. Nevertheless, Dunkirk has none of that. It uses practical effects, real-life locations, and substantive components. As a result, when boats sink or planes blow-up, it makes these additionally terrifying and hand-gripping. Dunkirk has some of the best aerial dogfights ever put to screen.Unlike the typical war films, Dunkirk isn't about sympathetic characters whom we know about their history or the amazing, drastic action sequences. This film mainly focuses on the evacuation and the survival throughout these drastically harsh conditions that are far from survival. It shows three directions which are the beach, standpoints at the boats, and the air. These three viewpoints intertwined concentratedly expressing the chances of survival of the 400,000 soldiers stuck at Dunkirk. The sound design was terrifyingly perfect embodying the gunshots, airplanes, and the crashes more resonant and an enhanced viewing experience that was memorable.All of the actors are great. Nolan used plentiful of young actors as the frightened soldiers. The main standouts were Tom Hardy (Farrier), Kenneth Branagh (Commander Bolton) and Mark Rylance (Mr. Dawson). All of these characters appear as the central focuses at the beach, the air, and the boats as they balance these stories. Mr. Dawson appears as one of the civilian vessels marching to help the soldiers. Additionally, Harry Styles (Alex) had an impactful presence along with Fionn Whitehead (Tommy).Overall, Dunkirk is an emotionally impactful and powerful war film about heroism, survival and a deep message that evacuation can be the victory along the supports of civilians. Nolan crafts this film thoroughly realistic, gritty and brutal for a PG-13 rated film. While the characters may not be the strongest, this is about war, the horror of the moment.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Dunkirk Doesn't Disappoint,"Dunkirk is not a history, at least not in any remotely traditional sense of the genre. The intention of the film is not to educate on the events on that French beach that dreary week, day, and hour. Rather, Nolan used what happened at Dunkirk, a very real part of history, as the foundation for building what is a visceral and ultra-realistic war experience. As only Nolan can do, he turns a smart, if ordinary, concept (a film about Dunkirk) into an ingenious and wholly unique film (an uncomfortable, horrifying, and realistic wartime experience). This is a film that is no fun to watch, as it shouldn't be because war is the worst kind of human evil. Christopher Nolan tries to capture that reality and does so with more gusto than any filmmaker before him. And in that pursuit, his war picture stands alone even among the most insightful war movies. He shakes us to the core, terrifies us, and leaves us traumatized afterward. This was his intention from the start; don't mistake that for bad filmmaking.Dunkirk works because the history of it, the reality that these sorts of events actually happened to real human beings and aren't just inventions of imagination, immediately gets our attention. While we know deep down that none of these particular characters are real, we are convinced that they certainly could have been and the actions depicted on the screen were likely the same of many hundreds of men on that beach. In a sense, these virtually nameless and unexplored characters serve as the embodiment of all those men – human beings just trying to survive another day. We know nothing of their lives outside that beach, but it doesn't matter. Only survival matters.The actors turn in solid performances. This is a film designed to do a specific purpose and it is not to showcase the actors. These actors do their part in making the experience come to life. Hans Zimmer turns in another powerful score. While it falls short of his work on Interstellar and Inception, it should rightly earn him some recognition come award season. There is not one single flaw to be found in this movie. As is usually the case with Nolan, he does all the heavy lifting and everyone else does their part to finish the job. While the second, third, and fourth viewing will prove if this is his best work for me, the talk of Dunkirk being Nolan's masterpiece is not unfounded. This is a great film; there is no doubt about that.It should be said that this is a movie that is very uncomfortable at times. The sound engulfs everything. Occasionally, dialogue is missed because there is so much background noise. However, war is not comfortable so it is natural that a war movie wouldn't be either. It is in these details that Nolan perfects the experience of a war film like no other. If you are looking for a nice evening at the movies, this is not for you. This is an intense, loud, and overall unpleasant movie. Yet, it is beautiful and moving, powerful in its stroke. This is a movie worth watching – not for entertainment but for experience.From the very first moment, Nolan tries to convince us that what we are watching is not only a true story, but might very well be the actual footage of those fateful days at Dunkirk. And, from the first moment, we believe him. We are engulfed by the deafening sound of planes flying overhead and jolted by the bullets ripping by; we scream in horror as men drown in front us; and we feel hopeless as struggle after struggle continues to leave thousands of men stranded as the enemy closes in. This must be real. No other film experience in my life has so deeply and palpably made me feel as if I am living the same reality as the characters on the screen. I left the theater feeling as if I was leaving Dunkirk myself – just surviving to fight another day.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Film that needs to be seen on the big screen.,"Dunkirk was an absolutely beautiful masterpiece that needs to be watched on the big screen to get the full effect. The visual and sounds of the film make the second world war more real than it ever could be.Watching the film, I could not take my eyes of the screen as it felt like I was there in Dunkirk.I enjoyed the layout of the film and how it showed every persons story at the beach and how it effected the air force, navy, commanders, people on the beach and those travelling to fight. The war was shown in the best way I have ever seen.Watching this film, I never heard soo many people start crying as the ending was soo good and showed how Britain fought and survived the war.

Mr. Nolan? Thank You!,"Dunkirk. I have never heard of the events of those fateful days during WWII. Thank you Mr. Nolan for bringing this incredible human story to life. And you pulled it off by peeling back the fluff most movies have nowadays to keep us focused. No obvious special effects (if there were, I didn't catch them), no over-the-top explosions or a silly love story to pull our heart strings. No, you managed to keep me enthralled for 106 minutes by keeping things simple, and transporting me to the Port of Dunkirk. In your typical style, you did get me to the edge of my seat. I genuinely, on an emotional level, felt what our protagonists were going through. I was cold, thirsty and feared for my life every time I heard those engines. Thank you Mr. Nolan, for showing me that heroes have always existed, there is hope for humanity, and good will always conquer evil.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
An intense and terrifying IMAX experience unlike any other.,"The latest film by Christopher Nolan takes a substantially different approach to how the audience experiences another real-life based war event from our history. Make no mistake of it, this isn't a by the numbers war epic with character arcs and dramatic dialogue. Nolan utilizes the spectacle of practical effects, core-shattering sound design, and genuine shock and terror of survival in war to deliver an intense 1 hour and 47 minute roller coaster. It was bold, different, and frankly terrifying.The film presents three different perspectives: beach, sea, and air to immerse the viewer into the various and thrilling aspects of the events of Dunkirk. Each perspective gives an interesting context to how the events unfolded and at first, it was difficult to grasp the timeline and when things were happening in relation to each other. However around halfway through the picture, the pieces fell together naturally and made a cohesive movie; surprisingly without too much effort from the audience to ""figure out"" (which one can come to expect when watching a Nolan film).During the presentation, a genius element to the film became quite clear which felt consistent with the actual event. While the characters got no back story and the protagonist/antagonist relationship was essentially nonexistent, the intention and execution of why Dunkirk was made the way it was became clear. During these events, no one had time to become personal with anyone or care where they were from. They didn't want to talk, relax, connect, or continue fighting. They wanted one thing: survival. They wanted to go home and not experience this anymore. So does the audience feel the same way. As precisely effective as the experience was, I wanted to leave. I became so blown away by the reality of what I was watching that I was begging the film to end. Moments made me feel sick to my stomach (and definitely done so deliberately by the extraordinary filmmakers). The audience will ""survive"" this experience of Dunkirk and it's difficult to say it's enjoyable but assuredly one of the most unforgettable experiences in a theater.Pacing was perfect. The score was thrilling and constant like a ticking time bomb that won't stop. Acting was decent but nothing that stands out. Technically, it's the marvel of the year that can't be missed (especially in IMAX). Having earned the title of ""masterpiece"" it's difficult to see myself watching this again and even rushing others to go see it. It's something you can't quite be prepared for and maybe something that's difficult to make it through. I'm amazed at the cinematic ability Christopher Nolan has at showing us how when a master can understand the rules of movies so perfectly, he can break all of them to mold and change the medium of filmmaking to something we can't expect.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Dunkirk managed to keep me up during its runtime but not enough for me to completely understand it,"After seeing this on IMAX with my movie-theatre working friend and reading many comments on Facebook of which many of them expressed confusion of what was going on in the movie, I have to admit I had the same feeling while watching it with my just-mentioned friend. I also fell asleep at parts of the film though the loud sound effects kept me from staying asleep during most of it. In summary, there were some exciting scenes but I didn't get the characterizations that were depicted as clearly as I would have liked. So that's a partial recommendation for Dunkirk.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Another Nolan masterpiece!,"The cinematography, the scenarios... everything about this movie is epic and outstanding! Christopher Nolan is no doubt the best director of our times.

Dunkirk Gets Lost on the Beaches,"There's no denying director Christopher Nolan has pretty much been crowned the torch-bearer for smart, contemporary, mainstream entertainment ever since The Dark Knight (2008). The fact that he backs up his visionary works with intelligently written screenplays and analog bonafides - such as real special-effects and shooting on film, only further engenders him to the minds of film aficionados. There's no denying he's one of us - a filmic omnivore and true believer in the power of the form who not only adores the trappings of his craft but is willing to subject his carefully crafted stories to obsession, scrutiny, and obsessive scrutiny a la constant fan theories.Thus saying Nolan's newest movie Dunkirk isn't all that and a bag of potato chips, actually hurts to say. Whatever misgivings anyone has had about Nolan - his characters lack emotion, his stories too heady, his pacing, so syncopated as to be robotic, have all come home to roost in this one. What's more, you can add loud, fractured, disorienting and at only 102 minutes, overlong to the list of complaints.Of course that may be part of the point. The evacuation of Dunkirk was, no doubt a fractured, loud and disorienting event for the over 450,000 soldiers who experienced it. The movie, re-cobbles the harrowing World War II military disaster from perspectives of land, sea and air; attempting to give the audience a fuller picture. The film opens with a nameless British soldier lining up on the beaches hoping for deliverance (Whitehead). We then jump to RAF pilots (Hardy and Lowden) providing what little air cover they can before tossing our hat in with Mark Rylance and his conscripted fishing trawler. In between these interweaving stories, we're reminded of the stakes by Commander Bolton (Branagh) who's exposition feels more like a godsend than a clunky add on.Yet even then Dunkirk can't help but feel like an ordeal. The non-linear storytelling (not just told from varying perspectives but also out of sequence) does little to immerse the audience into the film's claustrophobic settings. It doesn't draw attention or make comment like Rashomon (1950). It doesn't create the illusion of omniscience like in The Thin Red Line (1998). And it certainly doesn't get into the head space of the characters like in Slaughterhouse-Five (1972). It winds up forcing the viewer to continually update their context, using brainpower to figure out the time of day instead of caring about whether Tom Hardy is going to win his dogfight.Dunkirk does has a well received cousin in the form of A Bridge Too Far (1977), which similarly used fluid story dynamics and a large ensemble cast. In that regard Dunkirk improves on that formula by using mostly no-name and workmanlike character actors to do most of the heavy lifting. Yet A Bridge Too Far actually reached its climax. It did so through anticipation and dramatic irony. Dunkirk on the other hand starts at level eleven and stays there.This is turning into a much more negative review than is warranted. Dunkirk is still, for all its faults, a worthwhile movie. There are some masterful shots in this film, the immediacy of the situation is always clear and present and the utility of the IMAX format is on full display. If you don't believe me you can take the word of Christopher Nolan himself. Also while the score by Hans Zimmer is likely to be polarizing to some, I for one found it aptly encompassed what the movie was trying to achieve (even if it is too much of a good thing).Additionally the muted work of Fionn Whitehead, Aneurin Barnard, Cillian Murphy and the rest of the petrified soldiers is just excellent. With precious little dialogue and even less to differentiate themselves, these soldiers brilliantly capture the primal desperation and numbing exhaustion of the situation. Let it be said that out of all the sleek, heretofore unnecessary movie magic that Nolan employs, what saves this picture are the anonymous faces of horror who live or die based almost entirely on circumstance.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

A masterpiece.,"It's INCREDIBLE! But some people are blind and deaf... physically and emotionally too it seems.It used barely any CGI, and it wasn't a standard mainstream Americanized action-packed movie with clichéd characters. It didn't need any elaborate dialogues or ""heroes"". Nolan conveyed the emotions through classic cinematography (i.e. real planes, real people, real boats, and real locations i.e. no green screens) and through a haunting score (music track) by Hans Zimmer. It's a masterpiece. It's more about humanity and our struggle to survive. War isn't ""fun"" as some films portray it to be... War is about survival, death, sacrifice, betrayal and being in the present moment at all times.I was blown away.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Nolans best yet,"I am not who normally worships at the feet of Cristopher Nolan, and I had my doubts when I heard he was making a war epic about one the most critical moments of WW2. In reality Dunkirk was a humiliating defeat for the British armed forces and Nolan really only scratches the surface of what happened. For once we are spared the mass use of CGI instead we see the story through the eyes of three individuals involved in this epic battle. A soldier stuck on the beach,the captain of one of small boats and an RAF pilot. Nolan cleverly moves from each character to character until there paths cross in one way or another. The action is relentless from start to finish and the Spitfire Luftwaffe dog fights are simply breathtaking. Hans Zimmers superb score adds to what is a visual feast. By the end if your British there will be a lump in your throat maybe a tear in your eye. Was Dunkirk a humiliating defeat? Well the history books may have us believe that but By the end of this movie it felt like a glorious victory!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
good education for the folks a generation removed from history,"Just got back from seeing Dunkirk. 5 out of 5 is my rating. I have a special affinity for WW2 flicks, and this one kept me engaged and the music and sound gave it a dimensional feel without the aid of matrix floating and blowing up space ships. To top it off, it had my favorite actor Kenneth Branagh who I have been following since 1983 and his career with the Royal Academy and his early Shakespeare offerings, and even before his marriage to Emma Thompson. Was surprised to see him since I had not read up on the movie before I saw it with the Mom. Since I loosely follow the WW2 string of battles this one will leave those who have no knowledge of the a fore mentioned, at least engaged and not wanting to go to the bathroom. The movie combines 3 stories that intertwine at the end. Mark Rylance is a pleasant surprise, if you are familiar with his work in Bridge of Spies. Good film to educate teens on what happened with the era of their Great Grandparents. Recommend. Be sure to see on the biggest screen and sound system possible.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

"Worth seeing, but not Nolans Masterpiece","Dunkirk review spoiler free unless you know how history turns out lol. First impressions: sound effects are loud, makes me feel like I'm in a war, music from Zimmer is great and at times I felt like it sounded very Similar to interstellar soundtrack. The pacing is pretty quick through the whole movie and it does jump back in forth between characters (air, sea, beach, civilian boat). You get a blend of thriller/war feel as each character life is constantly put in danger. This is NOT saving private Ryan or band of brothers. The violence as intense at all; their are lots of explosions, bombs, dog fights, sinking ships, and chaotic swimming; but you won't see men bleeding out on the beach or picking up body parts. This movie is very much focused on the navy and air aspect of the Battle of Dunkirk. Hardly any land gunfights at all. You won't see men storming bunkers or fighting house to house. Favorite character was the old man boat captain. Hardy does well but has a face mask on most of the time (doesn't sound like Bane think god). Harry Stiles actually did well and is placed as a Everyman character that just wants to get home. Interstellar, The Dark Knight and Inception are better movies than this one IMO but you can definitely tell this has Nolans fingerprints all over it. Overall 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"Visually stunning, but emotionally unsatisfying","At the risk of sounding like a fanatic, Christopher Nolan is undoubtedly the only one we can trust to save original, franchise- less cinema from extinction. His willingness to create wholly original spectacle, mayhem grounded in reality, crafted with skill, sensitivity, and a deep, but mellow Tarantino-esque affection for the freedom of the silver screen renders him the most admirable big- budget blockbuster director working today.Which is why it's such a goddam shame that his biggest films aren't that great.Dunkirk recounts the story of the Dunkirk evacuation, probably the most celebrated event of the entire second World War. Hundreds of thousands of British soldiers found themselves pushed back by German forces to the beaches of Dunkirk, so close to Britain that they could see it. Stranded between hell and high water, the British soldiers seemingly had no choice but to wait for the Nazis to pick them off, one by one. In desperation, the British military commandeered everything that could float, from fishing boats to pleasure yachts. And with these small boats, around three hundred thousand British soldiers were saved, at least until they returned to battle. It remains an impressive story even now, not as a military victory, but as a wonderful example of human action, much like the Berlin Airlift of 1948. It can't exactly be labelled as a humanitarian effort, but the fact that so many lives were saved makes it very tempting.The film tells this story through a tense narrative divided in three: land, sea, and sky. One narrative follows a young British soldier as he attempts to escape the beach, another follows one civilian's attempt to help evacuate, and the third follows an air force pilot as he battles the German airforce above the waves. While this division of narrative allows for more of a story to be told, it ultimately reduces the effect of the film. We are told all three stories at the same time, Nolan cutting from one to the other in a choppy manner, not giving any one story the opportunity to form any sort of emotional resonance or any one character enough screen time for us to develop sympathy for them. The result is a curiously thin experience, curious because each story is rousing enough, but together and at the same time, they become weak. While Interstellar wallowed in maudlin nonsense, Dunkirk finds itself on the opposite side of the spectrum: virtually devoid of feeling.All that being said, the film is nothing to sneer at. The plane scenes, while occasionally disorienting, are very thrilling, Hoytema more than pulling his weight in that department. The soundtrack, which ticks like a time bomb throughout the entire film, provides the film with a wonderful intensity that kept me engaged and excited. And whatever fears you may have about this PG-13 war film not accurately depicting war in all its horror and brutality, let them rest. Nolan doesn't shy away from the peril of the circumstances, one particularly frightening scene of soldiers burning to death in the middle of the ocean making this clear. However much Nolan was wooed away from the human side of storytelling by the technical aspect of the entire thing, it's always fun -- and terrifying -- to see a great director at work.As far as acting goes, Hardy and Murphy perform as expected. But of all people, Harry Styles brings it to the table with surprising gusto, outperforming veteran thespians like Branagh and almost even Rylance. It's worth noting that he has no formal training as an actor. However, the drawback of his performance is that he emerges as the only truly compelling character in the entire film. Everyone else, perhaps excluding Murphy's character, is boring, existing as only a ragdoll for all the spectacle and fury to toss about.Dunkirk isn't a bad film. It's a good, maybe even a great film, turned into somewhat of a mess by non-linearity. There are rousing bits, moments of peril, and a few that are undeniably beautiful. Watching the film and taking into account certain strokes of creative genius, you'll know that you're in the hands of a great director.However, you're not in the hands of a great writer, and that perhaps makes all the difference.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"Forget the message, only enjoy the show","That's not the greatest war film ever, if you only consider the message, the topic. It remains very classical, American, patriotic and so on. I guess Nolan did not really care about this line, he only used it to support the rest, I mean the astounding, mind blowing show that glues you to your seat. SAVING PRIVATE RYAN was a real mile stone in the war film history; I mean there was a before and an after PRIVATE RYAN, concerning the graphic violence, not the rest, of course. This Nolan's movie is the same, it will remain another mile stone in the war film history. You have to see it yourself to perfectly understand what I mean. I don't remember any war feature like this one, technically I mean. And I want to add something else. The editing, the story telling reminds me some dramas and film noirs, showing different characters whose fates finally collide. I have rarely, if not never, seen such schemes in war movies.This is a must see, for visual reasons, and certainly not ideological. That's why I prefer CROSS OF IRON, which, I admit, was totally different from this one. The purpose was simply not the same. The Peckinpah's film was an anti war feature, the best ever. This one uses the war to show some new technical stuff. Forget the message. You have already seen it thousands times before.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"""We shall defend our Island whatever the cost may be""","An absolute masterful achievement in filmmaking from a cinematic and technical standpoint.Nolan once again hits another homerun this time telling a powerful story from a significant moment in WWII history. With terrific acting, tremendous writing, amazing cinematography this film was beautiful on the big screen in IMAX and on my 75"" 4k screen. Also the god composer of Hollywood Hans Zimmer delivers with an amazing original score that is both suspenseful and thrilling. My only regret is I never viewed this beautiful film in 70mm IMAX that I'm sure Nolan intended this film to be viewed in.What makes this film reach tremendous heights is the historical significance that is being portrayed on screen in spectacular fashion. This film doesn't pull its punches which makes the emotional impact just as powerful as the historical significance. Churchill's speech being read by Tommy (Fionn Whitehead) brings the film to a strong conclusion that always leaves me in tears.Brought to life by Nolan's amazing directorial vision and storytelling makes this a strong and powerful WWII film right up there with the likes of Saving Private Ryan and Hacksaw Ridge.Next up and last in Nolan marathon Tenet -IMDb: 10/10

One Of The Most Underrated Films Of All Time,"I rewatched this movie a few days ago. Not enough people consider this movie great and it should be considered great. The biggest criticisms this movie faces is the lack of characterization and emotional attachment and the score (oddly enough considering it's Hans zimmer). But this movie isn't supposed to be about a character. It's about an event, it's about what happened at Dunkirk. And Nolan executes that excellently. And honestly, there may be no emotional attachment to the main characters, but there is so much more to their characterization than you might think when you analyze the dialogue and the blocking. The way he is able to create the amount of suspense and tension throughout the whole duration of the film is amazing. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. And as for the score, it isn't supposed to be something that is super musical or catchy, it's supposed to make you feel the tension and sort of fearful in the moment and it absolutely delivers that. So people went into this movie thinking it was going to be one thing and when they came out of the theater with another, they were left disappointed cause it didn't meet their expectations. And how can anyone not notice the absolutely beautiful cinematography???

Suffocating Terror,"Try to forget the politics surrounding the causes of the Dunkirk massacre, and for pity's sake do not pass comment on 'famous' actors in it. This is hell on earth in this great film, far better than the 1958 version, and the terrible onslaught of terror in the face of death and mutilation is unrelenting, and yes every victim of war in this film is a hero but not as patriotism would have us believe. The underwater sequences of death and struggle are horrible to watch. And there are scenes that are far from being heroic, like the persecution of a French ally on a boat full of Englishmen, and he is referred to as the 'frog' and I literally felt sick. There is little dialogue and it is a non-linear narrative. It had to be, The ending struggled a little for me once the 'rescued' come back, and I was supposed to be moved by Churchill's speech read out by a returning soldier on a train. I do not think the rising Elgar theme helped either at the end. A deserved 10 with reservations.

Good but could have been better,"Went to see this yesterday, since my uncle was at Dunkirk and there is an apocryphal story about him and a bike which I hoped might just be featured (it wasn't of course). Unfortunately, being the age I am, I will automatically compare this film with the 1958 version, rightly or wrongly. That version of course has character story lines whereas the 2017 version doesn't. I was impressed by Nolan's use of extras rather than cgi, but I have to say that the beach looks more crowded and chaotic in the earlier film which of course would also be using extras. It has been mentioned ad nauseum that the differing time windows for the three parts of the story cause confusion and this has to be admitted. I lost count of the number of aircraft shot down, only to realise belatedly, I was watching the same scene in a different time slot. Regarding the aircraft, again commendable that Nolan used real planes, and everybody loves to see a Spitfire in the air but, we needed more of them. Couldn't he have pinched some footage from the Battle of Britain, or even resorted to the dreaded cgi? Having said that, Tom Hardy helped us all realise just how difficult it was to get an enemy aircraft in your sights and then how much effort it took to actually shoot it down. However, the explosive sound effects were awesome. When the Stuka bombs hit the beach, I felt the explosions coming towards me rattling the rows of cinema seats. Similarly, the firing of the anti-aircraft gun from the ship made me feel as if I was next to it on deck! I also felt in the initial scenes on The Mole, the soldiers looked too clean and not like they'd just been chased halfway across France but, this was rectified in the end when they were boarding ships looking like scarecrows. Others have mentioned that the Nazis are in short supply. A shot of a couple of German panzers and troop-carrying lorries advancing down a French country lane would surely have added to the air of menace and desperation. But, in the end, I'll admit to having an enjoyable afternoon watching this film; and my eyes did prickle a bit when the little boats appeared on the horizon.

impressive manifesto,"The first temptation is to define it as a masterpiece. But it is not the most inspired word. It is a Christopher Nolan film.precise in each detail.

A form of alternative, wise alternative, to classic manner to present the war. As a convincing, terrible, heroic lesson of history. As a huge show about values and sacrifice and right decisions.

Tensely gripping but hard on the ears,"There is much to like in this film, particularly if you like to be held in continuous tension for the better part of two hours. The screenplay interweaves 4-5 different story lines, all happening somewhat simultaneously but presented in not-always-chronological fashion. It's sometimes disconcerting, but there are many moments where you get to view an event from two or three different perspectives, which is very creative and adds interest. The narrative is of course harrowing, but you see it not so much through the eyes of a few individuals, but of the collective whole. In other words, the story doesn't dwell very much on any particular soldier or airman, and the ones depicted pretty soon all blur into one.The one exception is the Mark Rylance character, the boat owner who takes his sons into a war zone and thereby saves a couple dozen lives. His selfless courage and dedication to his mission is memorable, though I found his stoicism in the face of personal loss and tragedy almost too much to believe.The movie does an incredible job at immersing you in the battle scene, the confusion and madness and chaos. The air-to-air dogfights were easily the best I've ever seen; just the footage of the Spitfires, Bf-109s, and He 111 were worth the price of admission.However, there were some serious flaws. Most notably, one's ears are continually assaulted by super-loud noise. Perhaps this was an attempt to be realistic, but it went overboard. Every explosion, every round hitting a metal hull is over-amplified and painfully loud. Even scenes where ordnance is not being detonated come off as too loud, and I found that I could understand only a small fraction of the dialogue. Fortunately there isn't much dialogue and it's not very important, but it's still annoying.The story line is also fragmented and disjoint, with too many things going on at once. If they had stuck to fewer story lines, focused on a few of the men more closely, then I might have been more drawn to their fate. In the end, when the survivors reach England, I felt elation because of national pride and all that, but not because Private so-and-so made it home alive, since I knew nothing about him or what he was coming back to.Finally, I wish some aspects of the high-level strategic planning had been depicted. Who decided to requisition the little boats, when, how did they implement that plan, what sort of political dramas were played out among the Admiralty and the Government? This would have added historical depth and relevance.PS: upon a second viewing, the film got a WHOLE lot better. Definitely need to see this twice.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
This movie could have waited for Red Box,"I had been waiting to see ""Dunkirk"" for months & planned on seeing it on 21 July, the opening night. Rarely does Hollywood put out a movie that I'm willing to see right away, but ""Dunkirk"" looked like a fantastic movie.What a letdown; I was so disappointed. The trailers made it look so exciting. I mean, how could it be otherwise? The Battle of Dunkirk was perfect movie material: in the spring of 1940, over 300,000 British & French soldiers were trapped on the beaches around Dunkirk, making them sitting ducks for the Germans. The British military called for civilians w/boats to sail across the English Channel to Dunkirk to pick up as many men as possible & bring them to larger ships, as the larger ships could not make it to the beach- -and they succeeded. Surely an event worthy of a movie on a grand scale.Unfortunately, the trailers showed the best parts of the movie; everything else was a letdown. Not a lot of dialogue (which could barely be heard above the background noise) and little to no character development, which I consider essential to any movie. I swear Kenneth Branagh--one of the best actors in the world--did not have more than a few lines. Neither did Cillian Murphy or Tom Hardy, both great actors. Only Mark Rylance had a decent speaking part. There was not an opportunity to get to know the characters in the movie, what kind of men they were or personalities they had, what they might be thinking or feeling in their horrendous situation. Nolan never gives you a chance because it's the focus of the movie seems to be everything but the characters themselves.And the film was disjointed & lacked continuity. Of course all aspects of the battle had to be shown: from the air, from the sea, from the land, so jumping from Mark Rylance in his boat to Tom Hardy in his fighter/bomber and Fionn Whitehead on the beach was necessary. BUT you couldn't always tell when anything was happening. At one point it was nighttime at Dunkirk; you could see the fires & the lights on the beach. Then you'd see Tom Hardy in his plane or Mark Rylance on his boat--in broad daylight. Why? What time of the day was it? I thought it was night. If it's nighttime on Dunkirk then it's nighttime in the air & on the Channel, but we never see that. The events seemed out of order.Chris Nolan is a good director, but he could have done so much more. There should have been more character development so you could get to know these men better & empathize w/them & their situation, thereby becoming more involved in the movie. But he did not do that.My mom had wanted to see this movie (she's almost 80 & hasn't been to a movie in years). I told her to wait until it comes to Red Box and watch it. I mean, it's not a bad movie; just not as good as it should have been. It's not so much a war movie as it is Chris Nolan's version of a war movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"Dunkirk may be the best, most enthralling war movie ever filmed, and might be Nolan's best film","Dunkirk is one of the best films I've ever seen, and is probably the best war movie ever filmed.

Good but over-hyped,I write this review when this movie has a high rating making it the greatest movie of all time I think for the most part this is Nolan fan boys and fan girls it really isn't that great.To me a war movie should invoke a huge emotional response. It should bring you to tears and have you leaving the cinema thinking wow I hope I never have to be put in that position. The great war movies of the past have invoked that response from me. Even Hacksaw Ridge from last year I felt so much emotions watching it. I didn't get that with this movie at all.This movie is so beautiful shot it is truly amazing but it has little else on offer. I found the British accents hard to understand at time like I needed subtitles. I get it is a British movie so this isn't really a complaint but it did lessen it's appeal to me. I also found the directing to at times feel messy. All the interweaving stories made it hard to really get into the movie.I really feel this movie is overrated it is not a bad movie but Nolan really is not as good as people make out he is. This is a bit over-hyped and not even the best movie this year let alone of all time.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"excellent cinematography, riveting story-line and appropriate music","Quite a few of the professional film critics use the word 'immersion' meaning engrossed; absorbed completely when reviewing this movie. That's exactly what happened to me. One hour 46 minutes later, I came up for air.It's important to remember, though, that the director covers events three times: on the land; on the sea; and in the air.The action is often repeated. We see some episodes from the air, then from the viewpoint of those in the rescue boats, and sometimes, through the eyes of those on the land. If you're not aware of this before you see the movie, the continuity could be confusing.Excellent cinematography, riveting story-line; and appropriate music.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
An unforgettable experience.,"This is not a film. This is not a story. This is an experience. See this film at your loudest, largest theater. Nolan's next masterpiece immerses you into an intense war-zone experience with incredible visuals and directing. Unlike most conventional films, Dunkirk does not focus on the characters and their backstory, it has no time for that. War has no time for that. Instead it focuses on one thing and one thing only; escape. Every moment of this experience has you on the edge of your seat, cringing, biting your nails, all because of the intensity of the score alone. I enjoyed every single second of Dunkirk because it forced me to. There was no part I found boring. I truly felt that I was trying to escape from Dunkirk myself. I can't say that about any other film I've seen.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

From the dull screen play to the lack of any act structure it's a boring, aggravating mess. How is this getting such good reviews.

Limited in scope,"A big project. It has scale and intensity.Dunkirk is now a mythical moment in history. The film is a welcome reminder of the tragedy of WW2 as ordinary men are crushed by the weapons of modern warfare.There is much horror. Screaming men on fire in a flaming ocean. Soldiers burrowing for cover against aerial attacks. Trapped soldiers going down with the ship.On the other hand, there isn't much gore or body parts.Shown from the shifting POV of infantry men, pilots and sailors. We get a view from the ground/sea, then the same scene viewed from the air.What are the film's weak points?It provides a narrow claustrophobic view of the beach operations. There is no appreciation of the terrible tactical decisions made by the commander of the BEF.He made the unilateral decision to abandon the fight without proper preparations for the evacuation or rearguard protection.There is no insight into the triumphant Germans, or the plight of the French civilians. Insufficient tribute to the terrible losses suffered by the Little Ships of the evacuation.As the events cover less than a week, there isn't time for character development. Does not have the same impact as The Bridge over The River Kwai.Bottom Line: Interesting but not memorable. Recommended for those who like immersion, without getting their feet wet.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
A Masterful Technical Achievement. Can't say the same Storytelling-wise.,"Christopher Nolan's newest film ""Dunkirk"" tells the true story of the evacuation at the titular location where allied forces were miraculously shipped across the British channel by civilian boats. Christopher Nolan does what he does best and puts the viewer right in the dead center of this significant battle of WWII. The result is an immersive, realistic, and intense experience that better give Christopher Nolan his first Oscar nomination for Best Director. However, the film did not meet the hype (at least my own personal hype being my most anticipated film of the year) with its unnecessary non-linear storytelling, emotional detachment, and pretentious cumpulsion for uniqueness.""Dunkirk"" started out with a very jumpy bang. Christopher Nolan throws the audience right into the action and never lets up with the thought of an imminent attack lurking at any moment. The opening scenes are cinema at its most grandeur. The usage of practical effects for the ships, planes, buildings, soldiers, and locations are outstanding and say a lot about Christopher Nolan's dedication for telling realistic stories. The strafing runs and dog fighting scenes are directed to perfection and for a split second make you forget you are watching a movie. ""Dunkirk"" is undeniably gorgeous that'll definitively win Oscars for its craft.""Dunkirk"" may be a winner on a technical scale but a movie needs a little more to be a truly remarkable film. A common complaint about the film is a lack of character development. Going in, I knew this would be a more visceral film with little dialogue where the emotional core banks on common human empathy. Christopher Nolan wanted to focus on the event of Dunkirk, not the characters, but it is hard to feel for these people especially when you don't even know their names. Frequent Nolan collaborator, Hans Zimmer, provided the score, and he delivers with pieces ranging from gut-wrenchingly intense (Supermarine) to searingly hopeful (Variation 15). A misstep the film took was overplaying Zimmer's score which ended up toning down the actual sounds of bombardment. I even had trouble hearing some of the dialogue (upon first viewing) resulting in a lot of confusion on what was happening when there were dialogue driven scenes. I couldn't even judge the acting because half the things people said didn't register, but at least everyone looked the part.Christopher Nolan structured the film with three different perspectives -- land, air, and sea -- all interweaving at a critical point. Some perspectives last longer than others (an hour, a day, a week) and Nolan jumps around between perspectives without any indication where the viewer is at in time. Some may think this is a clever and unique way to tell the story but it just killed some of the tension when you see the same scene for a third time, or when something is about to climax and it just cuts away. Nolan overcomplicates a quite simple story. He tries too hard to be unique when certain conventionalities would have been more effective like making his film R-rated for maximum realism and intensity.Given the potential, mastery, and high expectations, ""Dunkirk"" is a bit disappointing. It's a sensation for the eyes and ears but it leaves your brain in a knot further causing a blockade to the heart. It's a film that in order to fully appreciate, must be viewed on the big screen. For all of ""Dunkirk's"" flaws, it's still one of the best theatrical movies ever made, and can't be missed in theaters. 7.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"Nolan recreates the terror of Dunkirk which is cruel , ticking clock, relentless but real. Its a Horror movie , the horror of war.","A portrayal of a hopeless situation which turns out to be such an visceral experience that starts from the first frame till the end credits. Its a war movie unlike any other war movie by many terms. Sure there is despair , anger , pain , fear and most importantly terror filled in the entire movie. But the movie never ever lets you sit and catch your breath and relax till the next heart pounding scene comes as the entire movie is a non stop thrill ride, nor it fills you up with hope of a victory but it states that sometimes avoiding annihilation is a triumph. This is movie is somehow not about war its about the terror of war, the horrific outcome and the unforgiving-unjust nature of the war.Christopher Nolan in his 10th film achieves a sense of fear among viewers that lasts even after the movie has ended. There are no consoling conversations between soldiers nor any personal choices or family details , but what there is , is the only instinct that anyone on earth is born with, Survival. Movie doesn't waste time in developing characters and motivational dialogues as no one in that situation will actually do that. Sure the lack of deep characters can be a sore thumb for many but that's the point of the movie , its about the situation and the event not about characters. You still root for these guys and feel sad when they die in horror, without knowing their names, and that's the beauty of the cinema that Nolan has created.Then there is the genius of the storytelling via distinctive vantage points. All in different timelines and without spoiling it i would tell you to read the minimal text very carefully when these are introduced for the first time very early in the film. That just adds layers to the story telling which will definitely be appreciated more on a second viewing. I rather not tell you about the cast than just that its filled with award winners and future award winners. Without having much to do verbally they have conveyed many things through their actions and large portion of the credit goes to the direction.Christopher Nolan has brought freshness to an era and genre of film making that has been a choice of directors since almost last 80 years. A war movie without many war scenes, one which during the entire length of the movie has not shown the opposition once , as in you definitely see enemy bullets flying , bombs jumping , aircrafts piercing air but not a single German face up until the last minute of the movie, still you are in dead fear of the situation and terrorized by the opposition like the Britishers and french are as if you were there. This is mostly achieved by the beautiful practical visuals effects from Hoyte Van Hoytema and an superbly original and chilling score by Hans Zimmer. When you go in a war movie you feel what can a world war II movie bring to the table that's fresh, still while exiting you are left with an experience none like any other in this category.Its a must watch for any war movie fans or any movie fans , don't expect a one to one gun-fight here rather than its a survival movie in which the hell is cut loose and you have no where to go other than to be with them , feel with them, fear with them....9.5 /10 AMAZing",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Decent but expected more from Nolan,"Christopher Nolan is one of my favorite directors and easily a very talented one. I had high expectations when I heard he was making his war movie and taking on a significant Battle during the war. Many great directors like Spielberg have sought to make great war movies and now Nolan was adding this to his resume, I was excited.Dunkirk had a great start but that's where it ends. The film was somewhat disjointed and did not flow too well. The film was ambitious and looked at the Battle from different views but sadly this did not seem linear and while viewers could get the idea of the battle a number of unnecessary and even confusing scenes distorted the overall premise. As in real life the majority and most of the focus should have been on Dunkirk and the rescue effort but instead we had other scenes from Tom Hardy and an unwanted cameo from Harry Stiles that did not add value to this film. The acting was also sub par, we didn't see any breakthrough performances to carry the film.Overall a decent film with great cinematography but the exciting trailer, subject content and Nolan's involvement did not make this a great film. This was my honest take on this film, I see people are acting like sheep and giving high ratings. This is nowhere near the masterpieces Nolan has made like the Dark Knight Trilogy or Inception but its not too bad.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"An all new cinematic experience, delivered by none other than Nolan","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningFor his latest big budget, big spectacle cinematic experience, Christopher Nolan has taken his first foray into the world of a war film, rather than the sci-fi/fantasy flicks he's been known for in recent years. And yet, in his desperate quest to push the boundaries of conventional filmmaking, on this occasion he's produced a film that doesn't actually have any discernible plot to speak of, and is based entirely around the plight of a situation a group of disparate men from different sides of the Allied front during the titular battle. This is a film based entirely in the unfolding moment of the here and now, and his distinctive style has never been more tightly stamped on anything he's made. It may leave some wondering if he was the right director for the project, and how it could have panned out in the hands of someone with a more traditional approach to a war film, say, Steven Spielberg with Saving Private Ryan, but this only serves to highlight how this is an all new filmic experience in its own right.We open in a scene completely drowned of any dialogue, completely soaked up in atmosphere, punctuated by a harsh, drained camera lens and reinforced by a typically heavy score from long time Nolan collaborator Hans Zimmer. The immediacy of the moment is captured quite magically, in spite of the lack of superficial things, and the feeling of being an average soldier in the middle of the unfolding fear and madness is feels as real as you can imagine. In focusing on being in the moment, and not on the characters as individuals, yes, Nolan does drown out some sense of character development and emotional investment, but this is further evidence of the films experimental style, asking you to be moved by the immediate plight of the protagonists, rather than the inner battles each respective person is fighting.Once again, an all star cast has been rounded up, including former One Direction star Harry Styles, as well as the likes of Tom Hardy, Kenneth Branagh and Mark Rylance, although in roles that don't mark any of them down in any individual way. Later on in the film, Nolan also unleashes some of the most breath-taking cinematography he's ever delivered us, over the seas and over the cliffs, almost as magical and majestical as flying over these places for real (but under different circumstances.) In spite of the minimal characterization, there's still a genuine sense of peril and tension of characters during danger sequences, in tightly confined quarters and with time racing against the affected party.Nolan is a director who refuses to do things by half, or in a way that an audience expects or can even comprehend, and while it may overwhelm many, it can be beautifully appreciated by those who look beyond the surface, and absorb a new filmic style. *****",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
A little too overrated considering,"I'm a huge fan of Christopher Nolan, and Interstellar is one of my all- time favorite films. Although he chose a different and refreshing direction for this film, it wasn't my cup of tea. The cinematography and directing and score were all perfect 10's, but the screenplay and writing lacked what I was craving... something/someone to route for - not the entire film. Yes, I wanted a hero and a villain to hate an cheer for, not a documentary. Nevertheless, very enjoyable. Would I see it again? Probably not, and if so, only for the stunning visuals. It's a 7/10 from me",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"One of the most complete, well-crafted films ever created.","There was not a second of this film that seemed unnecessary or out of place. I have no idea how Christopher Nolan has managed to create such a seamless film, but in my eyes ""Dunkirk"" is cinematic perfection. In watching ""Dunkirk"", you experience the hopelessness of being one of the hundreds of thousands of British soldiers trapped on the wrong side of the Channel. The cinematography is the best of any Nolan film; the colours are vivid yet muted, and the shots are packed with emotion. This is a phrase tossed around often, but Nolan does a superb job of humanizing war; ""Dunkirk"" is filled with unimaginable acts of heroism, yet there is not a moment that feels detached from reality. In perhaps his greatest triumph, the horror of the Second World War is meaningfully illustrated without the crutches of gore and excessive brutality. Just see this film.

The film was woeful. I have never been so detached from the characters in a film ever. I'm thinking the entire script would be lucky to fill more than a page. Not to mention the action. We have around 400,000 men needing evacuation. But it looked like a couple of thousand. There was no scale. The action was damn stupid from start to finish. Did they hire an expert? Hell no. I'm an ex soldier and that is not how any of that action sounds. Not to mention the cruddy no stakes PG 13 action. Did a main character just die? No idea. The editing was so terrible.

A Terrific War Piece For the Ages,"Dunkirk is a masterfully shot film with brilliant stunts and superb acting. The only possible aspect lacking in the film was the characters and their development, however this film didn't choose to focus mainly on the characters but rather to focus on the events that they went through. The dogfights and ship scenes fully immersed the audience into the action. Throughout the film, Christopher Nolan, decided to intersperse the three perspectives to then be able to link all of the events together. The inclusion of each perspective including 'The Mole', 'The Sea' and 'The Air' added to the suspense as we can see how the struggles through one section may affect the other perspectives.Christopher Nolan, once again, produced an outstanding film, that details the events of Dunkirk. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
A revolution of the war genre,"Christopher Nolan never disappoints. He is such an visionary director who is now giving the war genre a revelation with this interconnecting war action drama. Visually the film is more than stunning and satisfies all the needs you have for such a movie. Tremendous in every way: Cinematography, editing and visual effects. The sound is pitch perfect and will sure score at the Oscars. The only little flaw I had with the film is that the screenplay wasn't exactly awesome, it was good, no question, but I missed some deeper looks at the characters and that's the only big thing that differs from ""Saving Private Ryan"". While we had a good look at the characters of Mark Rylance and Fionn Whitehead who both played their roles magnetically. I missed more background of Tom Hardy, Kenneth Branagh and Cillian Murphy. Don't get me wrong, those performances were as good as they could be with the material they could work with but especially with Hardy's character it surely had improved the film and make it a pure masterpiece. But it is still a fantastic film, a great entry and the filmography of Christopher Nolan and a defying film of its genre. And it is a film that reminds me once again why cinema still overcomes screening because that film delivers its great impact on the silver screen.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"Engrossing, immersive war drama","May/June 1940. 400,000 British soldiers are holed up in the French port town of Dunkirk. The only way out is via sea, and the Germans have air superiority, bombing the British soldiers and ships without much opposition. The situation looks dire and, in desperation, Britain sends civilian boats to try to evacuate the beleaguered forces. This is that story, seen through the eyes of a soldier amongst those trapped forces, two RAF fighter pilots and a group of civilians on their boat, part of the evacuation fleet.Engrossing, immersive war drama. Hooks you from the word go and keeps you hanging on to the very end. Great action scenes with stunning visual and sound effects - very realistic. The sound of the Stukas diving is chilling.Quite a departure for director Christopher Nolan. Clever fictional dramas (eg Memento, The Prestige, Inception, Interstellar) tend to be his forte and an historical war drama seems, on paper, too constraining for his imagination. Yet, he pulls it off with aplomb, and uses his talent for mind-games in doing so. The three separate stories operating at different times and eventually syncing provides the alternative to what would otherwise have been a linear, less interesting story.Not perfect though, and certainly not in the same league as the masterpieces among war movies - eg Apocalypse Now, Saving Private Ryan, Tora! Tora! Tora!, Full Metal Jacket, Cross of Iron, Das Boot, Platoon, The Deer Hunter.Some plot developments and actions seem implausible and dumbed-down for a wider, more ignorant audience, and to simple make for greater drama. Tom Hardy's endless supply of ammunition (and 5 kills, including one while gliding) was a touch laughable. Rifle fire being able to penetrate the metal hull of a ship was interesting too...Allied with this, the movie is not as gritty as it could have been. Yes, we see death and destruction everywhere, but some things seem straight out of the book of Hollywood war movie clichés.In addition, the characters aren't that engaging - this is definitely a plot-driven drama, despite focusing on a handful of characters.Not a masterpiece, but very good nevertheless and certainly worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

Spectacular Change in Pace for the War Genre,"'DUNKIRK' was directed by Christopher Nolan and stars Mark Rylance, Tom Hardy and Fionn Whithead. ​In May 1940, Germany advanced into France, trapping Allied troops on the beaches of Dunkirk. Under air and ground cover from British and French forces, troops were slowly and methodically evacuated from the beach using every serviceable naval and civilian vessel that could be found. At the end of this heroic mission, 330,000 French, British, Belgian and Dutch soldiers were safely evacuated.{And I won't count the story recap as spoilers, you will know that if you had an education. }This movie is a breath of fresh air in a genre were each of its films is fighting for recognition. Dunkirk is a truly intense and thrilling roller-coaster minute one and lasts until minute 120. Featuring excellent performances from the entire cast and Nolan's signature use of effects and sound design, this is a movie that you need to see in cinema's to truly appreciate. Probably enjoyable on a small screen but I 100% believe it benefits from wonders and joys of cinema screens.This movie is retelling the event of Dunkirk. And as far as I am aware, it does it really accurately. We follow the battle from land, air and sea, and the way Nolan interconnects all the stories is brilliant. None of them are connected at first but they slowly begin to join together as the film progresses. The ending is truly perfect and I can't praise Nolan enough for his endings.This may take a while. Mark Rylance was fantastic as Mr Dawson and did a great job a commanding the movie to his will. Tom Hardy is probably one of the best actors working today and does a phenomenal job as Farrier. Conveying emotion purely through your eyes is very, very, very impressive. Fionn Whithead was great as Tommy and it is amazing that he rarely ever spoke for the entire film. Harry Styles was good in the movie. A sentence I never thought I'd have to say and never will again. Cillian Murphy was great in his small role and gave a powerful performance as a man traumatised by the war. Keneth Braghan was great in his more minor role but still managed to make a commanding performance. I am doubly impressed by the acting in this movie due to the fact that it is mostly visual and not-dialogue heavy so the actors had to utilise their face the most instead of their voice. I imagine that is very difficult in today's film climate so I will congratulate every actor in the movie, including the ones whom I didn't mention.As much as the performances were great, the characters were not. The split between liking and disliking this movie is based around the point of either the characters sucked so it was bad or it's a film about the conflict, not the characters, so it is good. I agree with the latter's sentiment more but I do agree that if that was the intention, don't follow anyone. Don't even bother giving characters a name. If we are expected to follow specific characters, the audience expects the writer and director to make us care for these characters. Again I do agree with the idea of it is about the battle but I wont be a blind fanboy and disregard any flaws with this film. I am not biased.This is 2017's technical masterpiece, I think. The effects used are phenomenal and I give bonus points due to a lot of it being practical. If that is actually true then that is exceptional. If there was CGI used, it wasn't very obvious or noticeable. Cinematography and editing are both top notch but that has become Nolan standard now. If the sound design for this movie doesn't get at least an Oscar nomination, I will lose my mind. I generally don't care about an aspect like this of a film but when it is extraordinary, you can guarantee I'll pick up on it. Sound design has always been a positive in Nolan's films and I think this may be his best yet. Truly exceptional work.This movie starts with the evacuation of Dunkirk and ends with the evacuation of Dunkirk. There is no in between and it is a film about Dunkirk. Please see this film in cinema's if you can but if not, see it anyway. It is an exceptional war movie which I really deserves its acclaim. Say what you want about Nolan, the man is a great director. I'll rate the film 9 HOMEs out of 10!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
It's not bad... but it's not great either...,"It's not that Dunkirk is a bad movie, it's just not as amazing as the advertisements or Box Office gro$$ lead you to believe. Between the lack of character development, and the uneven, time switching perspectives this movie was hard to follow and hard to invest in. Dunkirk has some interesting, moving scenes and historical info, but for the most part, it is slow and awkward. It took a while before I even realized that there were scenes being shown out of sequence. There is little done visually to inform you that a different perspective or flashback is happening. You'll see a plane looking down on a sinking boat and then a scene or two later you see people on shore boarding what looks like the same boat, and a few scenes later you realize you jumped back a few hours in time. I'm not sure why they chose to format the movie with all this time jumping when there was only a matter of hours between the flashback scenes, not days or years. It just made the film confusing. Your mind is so busy trying to work out the scene order and playing catch up, that you aren't concentrating fully on the details of the movie and you're not able to just enjoy it unfold. There are definitely a few standout actors, but because there are so many characters and very little character development, along with the weird formatting, most of the scenes have you struggling to figure out who is who, and which actors match with each story's flashback. Maybe if you read this before seeing the movie you'll go in more prepared and be able to follow the film better than I did. All in all, although it is worth a look, Dunkirk is not as awe-inspiring and impressive as other war movies, like Hacksaw Ridge, Saving Private Ryan, The Great Escape and Sergeant York, in My Humble Opinion. 8/2017",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
An Insult To Those That Served.,"Reviews claiming this movie ""greatest WW2 movie"" are an absolute nonsense. ""Dunkirk"" barely qualifies for the genre.* There is zero land combat between Allied and German forces portrayed in the movie. There is no depiction of tanks, artillery or infantry engaged in hostilities on land. There is a dozen aircraft and ships from the era and what looks like a cast of a few hundred. The movie does not deserve its title. It is in fact an insult to the memory of ""Dunkirk"", the professional British Soldier, Seaman and Airman, the civilian and merchant crews of the rescuing flotilla, the population of Dunkirk - to all those souls from both sides of the conflict present at Dunkirk late May early June 1940.* The 2 main characters are cowards. There is a repelling creepiness about their relationship. They don't look or act like professional British soldiers orderly holding on for evacuation rather they act like a pair of modern gender fluid sis males desperately trying to return to their safe space. This is the central story and it is about these 2 cowards deserting their post and using every trick they can think of to push in front of everyone else including the wounded to get aboard a ship home to safety. They even throw their rifles away not long into the movie the gutless scum. They deserved a court-martial sentence to be shot for the selfish, cowardly desertion of their comrades.If the Allied soldiers had acted this disgracefully the defense and evacuation of Dunkirk could never have taken place and the war lost.* A ""shell shocked"" soldier is rescued at sea by a civilian boat crewed by a middle aged gent and two teenage boys. This soldier flies into a rage demanding the boat steer immediately to England and not onto Dunkirk to rescue more men. In this rage he pushes one of the boys down a hatch to a lower deck where the boy strikes his head and dies thus committing murder. However, on return to England he is metaphorically slapped on the back and told ""not to worry old chap you are shell shocked so killing innocent people is totally expected of you. Don't you worry yourself we will lie to the authorities and the boys family so you never face justice. Now off you go and have some fun.""* The disgraceful behavior of cowards and and the unlikely, unpleasant murder of a boy are deemed more worthy to depict than the inspiring stories of heroic courage and mateship displayed by the highly trained and experienced professional soldiers these men were. Brave men on the outer defenses and town fought desperately to ensure their comrades safe evacuation. These men knew they faced two possible outcomes - death or capture for the wars duration. The soldiers evacuated would have swapped places with their mates defending the beach without a thought. The movie should be about their valor not the shameful cowardice of deserters or the unlikely actions of a soldier claiming ""shell shock"".This is perhaps the most over hyped disgrace of a movie I have seen. It is a shameful disservice to the men that fought at Dunkirk and the brave men in tiny boats that came to their rescue.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
War is the main character and I love it,"""Dunkirk"" is a relentless 1 hour and 46 minutes of war... and I love it.This was a first for me - on a couple of accounts. It's the first War film I've ever seen, but it's also the first Christopher Nolan film I've ever watched.I know, I still haven't seen the Dark Knight Trilogy (and I'm a Batman fan). It's a weird contradiction.""Dunkirk"" does this really interesting thing, that while there are characters and you obviously don't want them to die, there's not your typical:""Here's Joe. Joe has a wife and kids at home. Let's hope that Joe doesn't die, so that he can go home to his kids. Oh, no. Joe just died!""It doesn't have that, because the main character in ""Dunkirk"" is the battle of Dunkirk. The sights, the sounds, and the raw emotions are what you get in this film and it's amazing.Nolan does quite a few fantastic things when it comes to the production of this film. I love the timeline element, where there's three independent stories happening within the span of a week, a day, and an hour, respectively.I also love the fact that there's very little CGI, if at all. There are real planes, real boats and thousands of real people.Whether you like War films or not, this is a great film to just get immersed in.

Cinematic Marvel.,"One of greatest work of Nolan and Hans Zimmer. Based on true story of WW2 Dunkirk display one of the finest cinema, direction, background score, camera angle, plot with minimal dialogues and maximal expression.Genres -
Action, Drama, History, Thriller, War. NOLAN Is greatest gem to cinematic world. Work done by cast was splendid and consummate .The narrative of Dunkirk is relatively straightforward, but the way it's put together recalls the simple joy of watching someone construct a puzzle box. The film focuses on a week, a day, and an hour during the Second World War, as over 300,000 Allied soldiers are evacuated from the beach at Dunkirk, France, where they were essentially sitting ducks for the German forces. The timeframes follow the soldiers stranded on the beach, the civilians boats called into service to aid the evacuation, and the pilots serving as essentially the only defense against the German planes, respectively. As the film progresses, it's not only space that closes in on the characters, but time as well. The storylines push in, speeding up on their parallel tracks, as does the awareness that the longer these men are out in the open, the more likely they are to die.Dunkirk is cinematic war masterpiece created by Virtuoso Nolan and thrilling score by Zimmer will take audience to another dimension.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Excellent,Great telling of a story- afraid too many of the people watching were expecting a Hollywood USA thriller,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
One of the most overrated movies of the decade,"A 7.9?! Do we now put filmmaking techniques over story? If that's the case, then the SW sequel trilogy is a masterpiece according to this rating. Anyhow, let's get to the review.From a technical standpoint, this is an outstanding movie with gorgeous cinematography, editing, sound design, visuals and shots. It really is a gorgeous movie to look at and I do think the use of no dialogue helped with the feeling that there is war and there are stakes and I do like the idea of the story being told from 3 different perspectives. Very efficient way of storytelling there.With that said, let's move on to the bad. This movie was really boring. Sure it's short but I just wanted the movie to be over and the movie moves at such a slow pace unnecessarily and it's so repetitive with nothing interesting happening. I also rally didn't care about the characters. They could be replaced by pieces of wood and I wouldn't notice a difference. I felt no emotional connection to them, I didn't care about them, I never felt any emotion and I didn't care what was happening.This movie also doesn't feel too much like a war movie. I don't mind the lack of blood but everything is so quiet with little tension or action.Overall, this is a really disappointing effort from Nolan and how this movie got so much recognition shows that apparently storytelling doesn't matter if you get your technical aspects right. Watch Inception or TDK trilogy. Now those are real movies, not this documentary.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"Dunkirk lacks the character development to be in the pantheon of great war films,","There is an engrossing immediacy about Dunkirk, you are thrust into the action and the grip seldom loosens. It is pure action, pure cinema. The problem with this is that there is little plot and little characterisation, so the impressive spectacle does get slightly repetitive at times. This could have easily been a two-and-a-half hour picture, so there was certainly room for greater character development. It wouldn't be excessively negative to say that this was something of a missed opportunity.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Masterful visual storytelling on an epic scale.,"Extremely powerful and exciting war movie about the evacuation during WW2. Driven by a non-chronological narrative in three point of views, the breathless editing and a nerve-wracking score the film delivers several nail-biting sequences and a very powerful and emotional ending. The cast mostly relies on no names and very few stars, all bringing very convincing performances to the table. Additionally, the film is beautifully shot. Another masterpiece by Nolan and a highlight of the genre.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

It's truly gripping, exciting, nerve-wracking.There is beauty in every shot because of how gritty and realistic it is, not to mention the amazing cinematography.Yes, character's back stories can be interesting, but not having that didn't take anything major away from the film, and you still understood the life threatening situation these characters are in, connecting with them just the same.This movie was excellently done (as all of Christopher Nolan's films are) and I wish I had the chance to see it on IMAX.Every minute of it is packed with intensity, emotion, and fear.

"""Wars are not won by evacuation.""","FILM: 7.5/10.I recently finished rewatching the 2017 film Dunkirk, and it remains a technical marvel that leaves a lasting impact. From the very beginning, I am immediately drawn in by the incredible cinematography, which beautifully captures practical moments in camera instead of relying on CGI. It adds a raw and immersive quality to the film, making it feel all the more authentic.One of the standout aspects of Dunkirk is the solid performances across the board. With an ensemble cast that includes notable actors like Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, and Kenneth Branagh, each character feels distinct and well-portrayed. Despite the lack of a central protagonist, the actors skillfully bring depth and humanity to their roles, making it easy to empathize with their struggles.The film's unique structure is both its strength and its weakness. While it effectively depicts the harrowing events of the Dunkirk evacuation from multiple perspectives, it also leaves the audience somewhat emotionally detached. I wish for a deeper connection with a specific character, but this absence of a clear protagonist ultimately contributes to the film's portrayal of the war's impersonal, cold, and chaotic nature. To that end, it's both to the film's benefit and detriment.Hans Zimmer's pounding score, on the other hand, is an absolute triumph. It perfectly complements the tension and urgency of the film, enhancing the viewing experience and adding an extra layer of intensity to the already gripping scenes. Zimmer's music plays a significant role in keeping me engaged throughout the entire runtime.While Dunkirk is undoubtedly a visually stunning and technically impressive war film, I can't help but feel that the emotionally distant approach prevents it from becoming a truly unforgettable experience. Nevertheless, Christopher Nolan's directorial prowess shines through. His ability to craft a gripping, unconventional war movie is commendable, even if it is one of the weakest entries in his filmography.Ultimately, my rewatch of Dunkirk reminds me of its incredible technical achievements, solid performances, and Hans Zimmer's excellent score. The lack of a clear protagonist does create a somewhat cold atmosphere, but it also serves as a poignant reminder of the brutal reality of war. For these reasons it remains a film worth revisiting.FORMAT: 4K Ultra HD Blu-rayVIDEO: 10/10.Native 4K presentation, Detail level: Excellent, Colour reproduction: Excellent, Level accuracy: Excellent, Encode: Excellent, Master condition: ExcellentAUDIO: 10/10.DTS HD-MA 5.1 audio, Dialogue reproduction: Excellent, Soundtrack & effects clarity: Excellent, Dynamics: Excellent, Surround sound presentation: Excellent, LFE content: ExcellentMOOFIEMETER: 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
POWERFUL,"No doubt, Dunkirk is Nolan's best cinematographic movie of all time. Colour palette and harmony are just amazing. IMAX shots assert it selves. Especially plane scenes are admirable. Also, movie looks so real. Great decor, real places, real bombs,planes, ships... Such a wonderful production. Musics are so intense and fit with visuality. Hans Zimmer of course! On the other hand, story is a bit complicated. Sometimes it feels so empty but sometimes it feels so intense too. I cannot say so much about characters and actors because Dunkirk goes a really different way about these and it doesn't even try to show us backgrounds of characters. Honestly I was waiting a little different things from Nolan on it. Even so, it is a great -real story- war and historical film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Lack of Connection,"Dunkirk is beautifully shot, its score is wonderful and it's sound puts you right in the action. The story has some okay moments but overall I didn't feel even remotely connected with any of the characters which is a shame.

Anything could have happened to any character and I would have had zero reaction.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Best movie I've seen in a long time.....,I'm not big on war movies but this movie has become one of my most very favorite movies of all time. Dunkirk is shot out of order but then later syncs up and everything come's together like a puzzle. This movie is brilliantly put together. It shows that they took time and effort making this film. The acting in this movie is amazing. I sat at the edge of my seat from the start to the finish of the entire movie. The subtle clock ticking in the background and then stopping at just the right point is simply perfect. You really have to stay on your toes with paying attention to this movie because of the dates and times. It goes back and forth with it. I seriously can't see how anyone can give this movie a bad review because the way that this film is shot is like ART WORK. The cinematography was top notch.

Not the film you might be expecting - and all the better for it,"If you're expecting to watch this movie and grow to care and attach yourself to the major cast leaders, you're going to be in for somewhat of a disappointment. This is not a film about and individual, or indeed a number of individuals (as many people have pointed out, but for the wrong reasons). To achieve this would have been to focus on persons rather than the events. This is a movie that takes in the entirety of what happened without sub plots or the romanticies of just a few soles for you to attach yourselves. If you need this in a film - as by reading some peoples reviews a lot of you do (and I'm not saying that if that's what you like then you're wrong), then your watching the wrong movie.The people here who define a good movie only by whether they liked it would appear to be the very same people who would perhaps tell you a band is rubbish because they don't like the music. I was like that myself when I was twelve, but most people grow up and realise that what defines something as well made is not based on your own individual taste. You should be able to watch or listen to something, not like it, but realise that it is well made, thought provoking and something that others may find impressive. It's really quite amusing to read some of the comments on here from one or two star reviewers. A quick read will find you comments like - Music rubbish - Boring - It's disjointed (referring to the way the story is retold from several timelines) - required better CGI - Acting poor - Not factual - Why were there no Americans - Unromantic - Poor plot! Seriously people, if you don't find it to your taste, there's no issue, but come on, get a grip on some of the comments.If you want a new Private Ryan, don't watch it, if you want a love story, don't watch it, if you think the real events at Dunkirk lacked PLOT, don't watch it. If you want to see a pretty reasonable facsimile of a major event in history (according to survivors of the real event who went to the opening of the movie), be captivated, impressed and on edge, then this is the movie for you.If you don't like it, that's fine, but please, don't give one star to something that clearly elevates an entire genre of movies.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
A Sonic and Visual Masterpiece of Survival and Sacrifice,"Dunkirk is nothing short of a cinematic triumph, an audacious, visceral masterpiece that pulls audiences into the raw heart of survival and sacrifice. Christopher Nolan's visionary storytelling, paired with the bone-rattling intensity of Hans Zimmer's score, makes for an experience that transcends conventional war films. The sound mix, layered with meticulous precision, envelops you in the chaos, each explosion and engine hum contributing to the overwhelming tension and escalating heartbeat of the narrative.More than just an evacuation, Dunkirk becomes a tribute to resilience, capturing the grueling, almost primal fight for survival that defined this pivotal moment in history. It's in the quiet stoicism of men who, despite insurmountable odds, continue to hope, fight, and endure. Emotionally wrenching scenes like Collin's agonizing plane descent, George's unsung heroism, and the haunting silence as Tom Hardy's pilot is captured, leave an indelible impact, each moment calibrated to make audiences catch their breath or even bring tears.The film's simplicity in plot only amplifies its power, crafting a relentless journey that feels both intimate and epic. It's as though Nolan has painted a portrait of war not in words but in heartbeats and gasps, with each soundscape and visual echoing the inner turmoil of survival. Imagining this alongside Darkest Hour brings to mind an unparalleled epic, a seamless blend of front-line struggle and political urgency that would redefine war cinema. Yet, even on its own, Dunkirk stands as a profound, chilling achievement in film, one that warrants a strong 9.1 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
A lot to like but could have been so much better,"I saw it yesterday and I am sad to say that it did not live up to my expectations. It was a movie that I expected to like and wanted to like but it just came up short.There was a lot to like but there was much that was superfluous and too many ways that I believe it could have been made better. I believe that more context would have useful. A few lines of introduction as to how the situation developed was not enough. Somehow there should have been some way to convey more vividly what a disaster it would have been had things turned out differently. Only passing mention was made to the decision by Hitler to halt his tanks. The possibility of a reversal of that decision, by all accounts, created a sense of impending doom over those who were aware of the situation. This could have been used for more dramatic effect, of which there was otherwise not much.Another facet of the story of Dunkirk which I think got extremely short shrift was the assembling of the flotilla of small boats which crossed the Channel for the rescue. To many people this was THE main story of Dunkirk. It almost appeared that the side story about this was inserted so that the acting talents of Mark Rylance could be put to use. It seemed to add nothing to the main story.The battle scenes were great cinematography but I don't think there would have been lost if there had been fewer of them.I often feel guilty when I am critical of a movie like this but I don't think that simply making a movie about a serious topic does not always make for a good one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

The image of the evidence that happened then, feelings of soldiers that wanted to be evacuated to safe Britain across the English Channel were done awesome! The location was chosen well: a bay in the North of France, windy and cloudy seascape with funnels from aviabombs. Using real british and german plane fighters and bombers let the viewer fell real war action and enjoy the georgeous picture of a plane battle. The clock sound during all the movie, which pushes the atmosphere and doesn't let you fell relaxed, you always think that something dangerous can happen: explosion, shooting of the enemy or ""Spitfire"" which with the roar of the engine will fly by its head.

Simple ingredients. Better movie.,"What Dunkirk lacks in a complex story, it makes up for in its elegance and sophistication, as well as in its realism and engaging nature. You do not know the characters well by the end of it, but you still feel for them and hope for their survival throughout. The film interlocks three different stories beautifully, and while you know when it switches between them, it's edited very well and is not intrusive. I enjoy non-linear narratives very much, as I did in films like Pulp Fiction.The film does not feature many well-known actors, which helps keep viewers immersed in the film. It does feature Harry Styles, but I couldn't really tell it was him, and he gives a good performance so it doesn't really matter. In fact, I don't believe there were any bad performances in the film.I recommend seeing this one in the theater, it makes the experience even more worthwhile.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"A shallow, pathetic attempt to depict a war scene","This movie is so bad that we had to leave the cinema before it finished. It is merely a shallow attempt to depict the ""moment"" and nothing else.Content wise it offers no insight into the historic context, nothing. There's no dialogue, no story line whatsoever. If the intention of whoever made this movie is just to focus on the ""moment"", the state of being trapped of the soldiers then it also fails at that. For example, there were some efforts to portrait the mental state of the soldiers but dare I say it was an insult to those who fought in the war. What was being portrayed was mostly fear, the British soldiers depicted like a bunch of pathetic cowards, some was even tactically cheating to get on board, or accusing their fellow soldier of being a spy henceforth should get off the boat when it gets too heavy. Of course it's understandable to be desperate when you're in between life and death, but seriously what about other mentalities of the other hundred thousand soldiers? I cant help but thinking just play the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan on loop and you already have a much better result than this.Lookwise, it is so off putting. They said there were 400,000 soldiers trapped in Dunkirk but throughout the movie, you only saw a few boats and planes. Fair enough if they don't want to use screen effects to keep the realness, but then why alternate the colour of the whole movie to that omnipresent teal and orange look? It is too overused that some scenes don't even look real.The city in the opening scenes looks just fine and nowhere near like it's been at war, the high rank soldiers' uniform was flawless. The soldiers' faces look well fed and slept except some dirt on their face.In many scenes the composition of the frame is repeated in the same way: the camera was positioned below skyline so the frame was dominated by the sky and the beach, in the middle were silhouette of the soldiers, running across or. If this is the only way to portray the state a of being trapped then it shows a very very poor imagination.There's only so much left to criticize but I'll leave it here. For me this is the worst movie I've seen, also it's disrespectful to take such subject too lightly.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

Excellent rendition of an important historical event,"Countless movies have been made about the two World Wars, and each of these has been told from a specific perspective. Many of these movies (especially those featuring prominently established actors) were made to entertain rather than to convey a message. Chris Nolan's Dunkirk had a different purpose to it - one that was very successfully realized by the director, the crew and the cast of this film. That purpose was to convey the reality of the near-hopeless situation on the beaches of Dunkirk, and the indomitable will of the British people that succeeded in turning a would-be defeat into a victory of spirit. Three Cheers to Mr. Nolan and everyone who contributed their efforts to creating this tribute to the Heart of a Nation! And to those who couldn't see this film for the masterpiece that it is ...

"I'm sure it'll win prizes. Only ""Film of the year"" would be a bit far fetched.","""Wars are not won by evacuation.""I'm sure there are already as many reviews about Christopher Nolan's last movie about the battle of Dunkirk, as there were British soldiers on the beach of Dunkirk waiting for their evacuation. An awful lot. Although it wasn't a battle in the strict sense of the word, but rather a massive logistical operation to get the English army back on British soil. Whether this operation had any influence on the course of the 2nd WO, is something for military strategists and analysts to determine.In my opinion, there was an incomprehensible blunder made by the German commanders. Fortunately, because sauerkraut isn't really my favorite dish. It's not a chapter in this terrible world war, with heroic battles taking place. A bold choice, but nevertheless, it was a breathtaking spectacle.To call it ""Film of the Year"" is a bridge too far (you can call that flick a masterpiece). But Nolan succeeded in creating an energetic and exciting film that intertwines three different story lines in a non-chronological way. Tommy (Fionn Whitehead) is the key figure who must save his own skin from the beginning on, so he won't be mowed down by German bullets. It seemed like the only thing he did the whole movie was surviving one life-threatening situation after the other.Then there's Farrier (Tom Hardy), one of three Spitfire pilots who try to safeguard the crossing of their troops and hunt down fierce German fighter planes and bombers which are trying to sink as many ships as possible. And finally there's Mr. Dawson (Mark Rylance) who's crossing the canal in a simple yacht together with his sons Peter (Tom Glynn-Carney) and George (Barry Keoghan) to help with the rescue of soldiers. In this way Nolan incorporates three different chapters, each taking place in another territory. By land, at sea and in the air.The very first thing you'll notice is the largely wordless acting. Particularly Tommy whose lips seem to be sealed almost throughout the complete movie. It is as if in this war every conversation seems useless and body language speaks volumes. The majority of dialogues are at the expense of pilots and commanders. Unfortunately, the conversation between Spitfire pilots is sometimes unclear and restricted to indistinct mumbling. Partly due to deafening noise effects (and when you are watching this movie in a Slovenian cinema where it's hard to read the subtitles as well, this is a slight disadvantage).And that brings us to the soundtrack. It's omnipresent and, in my opinion, of decisive importance. Hans Zimmer's music seems to be constantly present and bolsters the entire film. At moments unobtrusive in the background after which it swells out into a climax. Let's say that this is the very first time the musical setting demands my attention and impresses me. The same goes for the deafening noise effects, which sometimes make it seem like you're in the midst of the war. The down diving Stuka's and the deadly cargo they drop on the beach with that terrifying, screaming noise. Sometimes I had the urge to crawl deeper into my chair.The way everything is portrayed is also phenomenal. The dogfights are in my eyes the highlights in this impressive film. The vast shots of the beach where thousands of Allies are crammed as sardines in a barrel. You can feel the threat of dead. The claustrophobic and precarious situations that'll make you feel as if you're trapped yourself. The despair flows off the screen. Thousands of Allies can, as it were, practically see their safe home but they realize that getting there is an impossible matter.This is, just like ""Saving Private Ryan"", an epic war story. Only the first one was more brutal and showed the horror of WWII in a terrible way. That's why I still can picture some scenes from this Spielberg spectacle. I'm afraid that won't be the case when it comes to ""Dunkirk"". The fact that it was a defeat that led to a victory afterwards is an indisputably fact. And yet, I had this ""that's-it?"" feeling afterwards. Without a doubt, it was a traumatic experience for the thousands of Allies, but the compulsory cheering moment as apotheosis was a bit too predictable. And I'm still wondering why Farrier made that decision in the end. As reasoned as his previous actions were, so stupid I found this final decision.Obviously, ""Dunkirk"" will win prizes at the major film festivals, but I'm afraid the main prizes will be awarded to others. I hope they'll release films the next six months that deserve the title ""Film of the Year"".More reviews here : http://bit.ly/2qtGQoc",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Blown Away,"I watched this film for my second time years later and would highly recommend anyone who hasn't to do the same. It is very intelligently put together. The intensity captured on camera feels like you are experiences it with the characters, as if you are trapped there at Dunkirt too. A tip would be to watch it with headphones, as the sound design and score are at their best in this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Another Great Nolan Film.,"If there is one thing that Christopher Nolan does better than any other director working right now it's that he puts butts in seats. Every single movie he has made since 'Batman Begins' has featured people swarming in droves to their nearest theater. I would wager that 90% of people that go see this film will not know anything about the subject matter. Which is sort of what makes him so interesting. He is making gigantic studio blockbusters of whatever he wants. Warner Bros smartly realized that this man packs theaters and makes money so they let him do whatever he feels like doing. Which is a little weird considering Warner Bros DC cinematic universe right now...Before I get too far into this movie I want to point out the few negatives I have with it. Keep in mind that these things will more than likely not bother anyone else. I also realize that these are nitpicking but regardless, they still took me out of the experience. And I would call this an experience, which is all the more reason that these nitpicks bother me. When something happens in an experience to take you out of it I think it's fair to point at that to say that it ruined a bit of the experience.And the thing that ruined the most parts of this film was the audio recordings. No, not the sound effects but the microphones that recorded the actor's dialogue. Almost every single time an actor talked there was an audible buzzing sound that would fade in and out each time a character opened their mouth. I'm pretty happy that most of the film didn't need dialogue because this bugged literally every time it happened.The only other blemish on the film's armor comes due to the color correcting and nonlinear nature of the story. There was a number of scenes where every single cut was a different color temperature. We would see a vibrant blue sky with a bomber flying and the next cut would be a boat that looked gray or orange. Or one cut would be during daytime and the next would be dark. Again, these are small issues but in an experience such as this, they stand out far more than they would in a 'Dark Knight' sort of film.However, this is easily the best war movie 2017 has to offer. Which is saying a lot considering the vast surplus of war melodramas from this year. Much like Nolans other movies 'Dunkirk' is a sensory masterpiece. Every shot in the film is near perfect. The composition of each frame and the camera movement is so precise for each individual scene. Not only that but the sound editing is absolutely spectacular.The film is abrasively loud and in your face. From the very first scene the film barrages you with ear piercing sounds that put you right in the middle of this war. Planes rumble overhead, bullet whiz by, and people yell at each other and it's all captured perfectly. In all honesty, if I were to judge this film based on its technical achievements this would receive top marks, especially when costumes, sets, and makeup is factored in.Because every single thing in this film is so believable that it often transcends being a film and almost feels like a documentary. Nolan's craft has never been better and he deserves endless praise because he directors the crap out of this movie. But Nolan is not only the director here, he is also the writer. Which brings me to the most intriguing aspect of the movie. The structure and story that we get aren't like your everyday war movie.Sure the story is very simple but it tells it from three different perspectives. Doing this allowed him to cut between the sea, land, and air which brings different dimensions to this battle. We see how each one affects and is affected by each other. This also allows Nolan to cut away from one thing to another the moment it gets dull. He doesn't have to restrict himself to making the air plane scenes interesting all on their own. Instead he just cuts to something interesting when the dog fight is over.Doing this keeps the pace of the film absolutely relentless. For ninety minutes you are barraged endlessly by this fight. While it may not always work the strengths far outweigh the flaws. The costumes, sets, acting, direction, cinematography, action, and the visual nature of the film all come together to create something that feels so different than everything else out right now. Sure, it may not be your typical summer blockbuster and I'm not sure I could ever watch it again but it's certainly worth keeping out.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
All time great war movie,"Dunkirk is a harrowing WW2 film that uses sound to show the horrors of war rather than reveling in gore. It's also one of the best war films ever made because its non-stop tension from the moment it starts but it doesn't glorify battles and bloodshed, instead choosing to focus on saving lives and the selfless heroism of everyday civilians. Survival is the victory here.Choosing not to reveal any backstory for the majority of the soldiers was a smart and unique decision. The fact that they're in this horrible situation and prevented from escaping at almost every turn is more than enough to keep things investing. The actions they take tell you everything you need to know about them and skillfully avoids exposition dumps that could wade into cliché.Even then there's still plenty of depth in the form Mark Rylance's still grieving sailor. Through his conversations with a reliably faultless Cillian Murphy, you get some of the most profound dialogue of the film and just like with everyone else, his actions when attempting to save Jack Lowden's likeable pilot reveal so much about what kind of person he is and everything he's been through.Christopher Nolan's direction shows astonishing technical prowess in a way that makes it look easy. His unflinching commitment to practical effects and keeping as much in camera as possible yields the best rewards with spitfire dogfights that go through the clouds and intense action across land and sea, all beautifully captured by Hoyte Van Hoytema's cinematography.With three stories across three different times that begin to interconnect as it ramps up to the climax, Lee Smith's incredible editing is on full display all the time. It moves between all of them seamlessly and seeing how they overlap is thrilling as some of the biggest events are witnessed early on without knowing, making them so much more tense when it circles back to them later.Hans Zimmer's score could not be more fitting. This is a film that rarely lets up on the tension so Zimmer weaves a ticking clock into his score which is a constant presence to emphasize the desperation as every failed rescue costs time they do not have. The rest of his work builds on this idea with each piece containing that same rhythm to continue the escalation.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"Mr. Nolan, What goes on in that head of yours?","Short review on the general concept and writing around time in this film.No Spoilers beside screenwriting idealism.I am currently writing a script that moves through time as much as Dunkirk does, and I am absolutely amazed at the fluidity of the cinematography in this film. I watched it for the first time the other day, while working on music- ended up never finishing because i was immediately drawn into the fight we as an audience are thrown into. Back to the movement of time, it took me a second to understand what exactly was happening- but independently so, you are immersed into the travel of every characters feats as well as how they intertwine.This is my first review and I still am trying to contain excitement, so excuse the brevity. Just go watch the film and stay on the deck!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Surprisingly interesting and epic WW2 story,"""Dunkirk"" was built on suspense and was able to tell a great story with very little dialogue, relying more on the visuals to portrays the terrors of war. Basically, film finds most of its tension in little pockets of visual suspense. The cinematography is stunningly IMAX-heavy and beautiful, the action, particularly the aerial sequences, is mesmerizing, while the music score is superb (for the story). Ultimately, ""Dunkirk"" isn't just a war movie, but also a film about the boundaries of morality in an extreme situation. Director did raise very profound philosophical and moral questions here. Overall, it is a very good movie, but I must admit the finale was not on the level like most parts of the movie, which maybe will make it for some viewers not to resonate with them after watching. Still, I did find it epic and very recommended.Rating: 8+",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Nolan is an unparalleled Genius.,"This is an excellent submission by Nolan once again, in this film Nolan keeps the viewer on edge the whole movie by showing a detailed look into the inconvenience, discomfort and despair that is war. However the true stroke of genius was minimizing the role and sway of characters and rather letting the viewer be more captivated by the events of the story, by mini-zing characters the story and events are given more weight in a counter intuitive way. This movie is moving and entertaining, I strongly recommend.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Nolan's interesting take on the war genre,"To sum up this movie one only needs five words: it's a war movie. Yeah, that's it. A movie about an important operation, which saved more than 330,000 soldiers from the beaches of Dunkerque, where they were surrounded by the German.From a technical point of view, the quality is impeccable. After all, it's a Nolan movie, so high quality was pretty much guaranteed. The movie is full of visually stunning shots (first one that comes to mind is one at the beach, at the beginning of the film, in which we can see the soldiers and where the frame is interrupted by two pillars or whatever they were; but also all the breathtaking aerial shots). I can't even begin to imagine how hard the production of the movie must have been, which I'd describe as colossal. A few ""action sequences"" (I don't how else to call them) are truly incredible to watch.The structure of the plot: this is what makes this war movie unique. It follows three different perspectives (land, sea and air) with overlapping time-periods, which create a non-linear narrative. Usually a war movie follows the actions of a certain group of people throughout its entirety. This is where the only problem I had with the movie arise; I didn't have much time to empathize with any of the characters. I know it's only my problem, because caring for a certain character or characters wasn't the point, but I don't know. I guess I'm used to empathize with at least one of the characters when I watch a movie. But fine, I understand Nolan's choice and I respect it. It's not about the characters and their emotions and personalities whereas it's about their will to survive.The cast: nothing much to say here. Acting is not the focus of the movie, but what little acting we saw was yet again impeccable. We have a few important and famous names, such as Kenneth Branagh, Mark Rylance, Cillian Murphy and Tom Hardy, and they all did a very good job. We also have a good variety of new names approaching the silver screen for the first time, such as Fionn Whitehead (who's only 20!) who was extremely good in his role and Harry Styles. A highly criticized choice, but in the end, he was decent. More than decent, actually. A new career may have started.A special mention goes to the astonishing original soundtrack, composed by Nolan's longtime partner in crime, Hans Zimmer. He WILL win the Oscar. Period. It'd be a crime if he didn't. As I've said, he has collaborated with Nolan in many of his movies, for more than a decade now, and every time he outdoes himself. His score accompanies the movie for its entire length and it adds even more tension and anxiety than the incredible images we see on the screen. Just sublime.Overall, this isn't the best war movie ever made; or even the best Christopher Nolan has ever made. By saying this, I don't want to sound incoherent because I really, really liked the film. The only and simple explanation is that I've appreciated more his other works. Watch it if you haven't already.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Visually impressive but lacking emotion,"I don't know what it is about Christopher Nolan's films but they just never appeal to me. Just like his previous films, 'Dunkirk' is technically great yet completely fails to connect on an emotional level. It's cold-hearted, soulless storytelling and no amount of visual effects can deflect from that.I know that the purpose of this film is to take a wider, more broad approach to telling the story of what happened in Dunkirk rather than following an individual character/event within the war, but for a film like this to be completely void of emotion is disappointing and it can't have been what Nolan had envisaged.The acting is good and the visuals are great, but beyond that 'Dunkirk' didn't do much for me at all. It's missing characters and emotion - two things that should be at the core of any war film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

Desperate fight for survival,"Dunkirk, directed by Christopher Nolan, depicts the widely renowned historic event during WW2 at Dunkerque in France which saw an allied army consisting of approximately 340 000 british and french soldiers trapped at the french beach surrounded by german forces. While under perpetual fire from the german Luftwaffe the allied forces make a miraculous escape aided by the british people.Don't watch Dunkirk for an intricate plot with complicated characters. It offers neither. The story is straight forward and the characters are barely characters. Most of them are only distinguishable from one another through their faces. To enjoy Dunkirk fully, the viewer must not look at the characters like fictional characters but rather as different depictions of the everyday man, as the depictions of perhaps a friend or a family member. See them as real people and the horror they endure hits harder. The lack of compelling characters is a major negative but with this mindset it adds a different perspective on the film.When the german Luftwaffe dives towards the british ships unleashing all hell upon the protagonists, is when Dunkirk shines. The large scale and the monstrous explosions adds to the immersion and realism massively. Dunkirk also shines (ironic choice of the word ""shine"", I know), in its gloomy, fatalistic and intense illustration of desperate soldiers fighting for their lives. It is tremendously immersive and a major positive to the movie.Dunkirk is not a film for the faint-hearted. For the most part it is quite dark. While containing some good cinematography, beautiful shots and great technical work, Dunkirk falls short in the story department. While a storytelling device in itself, its lack of compelling characters makes it hard to fully immerse yourself in the film. I'd recommend Dunkirk to those into war movies but otherwise I reckon there are better ways to use your time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Some of the reviews on here are fake/paid for,"Average Movie. Nolan has made a bore with interstellar and now this one. There is no story what so ever. Just soldiers on an island and soldiers in a plane. No plot or anything. Just two hours of soldiers on a beach. Since this movie is based on true events, how did the movie not have a plot? Instead of wasting your money on this go to google images and type in soldiers on a beach or soldiers in a plane. There I saved you 15 bucks. Loud and annoying music that wasn't needed. Hans Zimmer will try to use his music to have you thinking this movie will get intense but it never does.Another thing to note is most of the reviews on here for this movie are fake. I am constantly on this website and within the first 24 hours of the release of this movie there was already 100s of reviews posted. No other movie will have that many reviews that fast. Chistopher Nolan must of put some of the movie's budget into hiring people to write reviews. Planet of the apes came out a week before this and that only has 50,000 votes. This movie already has 115,000. Don't believe me? then check for yourself. Either half the audience had permission to watch the movie before anyone else or Nolan hired 100s of people for fake votes. Nolan is falling fast after his Batman Trilogy and he is an overrated director.1/10.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"Immersive, thrilling, epic.","Where do I even start, this movie is just amazing. The cinematography, the score, the visuals, are all amazing. The sound design is amazing. I could go on for ages about how much I enjoyed this movie.Sure, the characters may not be compelling, especially when compared to some of Nolan's previous work, but I still wanted to seem the succeed. Even though I already knew Dunkirk was a successful operation I felt nervous, tense, desperately hoping these men would make it out alive. When a movie, in particularly one based on a true story makes you feel that, you know it's great.As I already mentioned, this movie's score is incredible, I felt like I was there on the beach with Tommy and Alex as they desperately tried to survive, I felt like I was in the air with Farrier, shooting down planes, I felt like I was on the boat with Mr Dawson and Peter, saving lives. The score truly immersed me, and put me in the shoes of the characters. I felt what they were feeling. Anxiety, fear, confusion. The score elevates these characters immensely. Without it, the movie would not be this good.It almost goes without saying, but the visuals are spectacular. They're simple, understated, not very colourful, but that's what makes it so good. It truly creates the feeling of dread and peril that these men are experiencing.All of this and more makes Dunkirk a great movie.

"Vivid, sweeping drama with almost no character exposition","I appreciated Christopher Nolan's interpretation of the events in ""Dunkirk,"" and how he focused on the sounds and sights to connect the audience to the terror and uncertainty experienced by those who were involved. Visually, it's very exciting, especially the dogfights in the skies and the strafing of boats on the water. He obviously made a conscious decision to reveal almost nothing of a personal nature about any of these characters, including their names in some cases. You simply don't know anything about them, which is risky in a movie. Why should the audience care about some character we don't know? As the movie plays out, you do come to fill in those gaps a bit due to the excellent actors involved, particularly Mark Rylance, Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy and Jack Lowden. I assume Nolan's purpose for doing this was to show that it was this very large group of individuals coming together to do something miraculous in a time of global peril, when truly, their whole world and way of life was in jeopardy. Still, I couldn't help thinking that he might have added a few minutes here and there to give us more information or background on these men. The younger ones seem completely anonymous and almost blank.The soundtrack is very loud at times, and there's ""ticking"" that conveys the sense of danger and impending doom. It's almost as if you hear these men's hearts beating because they're just terrified. The action scenes are very well done. U.S. viewers (particularly younger ones) who are not familiar with the events of Dunkirk or the larger geopolitical situation of the start of WW2 would do well to read up on it a bit before seeing ""Dunkirk,"" because Christopher Nolan is not wasting any film on explaining it all to you.

Dunkirk,"Based on a true WW2 story: after the German invasion of France in 1940, thousands of British and Allied soldiers await evacuation to Britain in the northern coastal French town of Dunkirk.Among war films, ""Dunkirk"" is unique in that it begins during the aftermath of an invasion rather than before it. The focus of ""Dunkirk"" is on rescuing several soldiers - too many for the sea vessels available - and preserve their lives.The main narrative is broken into smaller stories. While all are intriguing action-wise, the characterization is thin overall. One exception is a story in which a helpful English civilian and ex-sailor (Mark Rylance) takes his own pleasure yacht to Dunkirk along with his young son and his teenage friend. The other stories are good in showing the tension of too many people to be rescued with too few vehicles involved but this tension could have been enhanced.Writer-director Christopher Nolan has done a superb job in co-ordinating numerous extras and evoking an event that is far from the experience of the average viewer. (Apparently, Dunkirk survivors praised the film's accuracy.) He is greatly aided by his technical team especially those involving visual and sound effects. Some of the film's visuals truly stand out.Although I don't fully join the almost unanimously high acclaim for this film, I still recommend it - especially on as large a screen as possible.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Emotional Epic,"I'm a fan of Christopher Nolan and hadn't realised he was behind this film or I'd have watched it sooner. For me he knows how to tell a story. This film is no exception.
The way the focus of the film is on a strict level of duty over selfish survival is captured expertly through the eyes of 3 individuals from air, land and sea. The shift in focus retells the same scene from each vantage point and due to this, it feels like a well rounded movie. You really feel for the people involved and see their story.
I had no idea of what these personnel went through but the filmography really serves the story well and you should feel a lot of empathy for the characters you are watching, and this is accomplished.
It's a little known part of WWII been brought thoughtfully to mind. The only reason I have not given it a 10 is due to the acting of Kenneth Branagh. I usually like him, but in this he seems to rigid and doesn't seem to move from The Mole. I feel Nolan could have used Branagh more effectively by utilizing him in another role. I loved Tom Hardy in this and his tale was explored very well.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"Beneath Untold Layers of Tension, an Observant Artist's Touch","The terror of a quiet solitude, exposed on an endangered French beach and desperately awaiting evacuation at the height of World War II. Abandoning the more experimental themes he toyed with in Inception and Interstellar, Christopher Nolan has set out to make a mostly-straight war picture, shining his spotlight on a major test (and ultimate turning point) for the British armed forces. Told from three entangled perspectives - one each from land, sea and air - we see heroes, victims, cowards and lunatics emerge from what might have otherwise seemed a nondescript group of young men. It's far less bombastic than the standard combat film, with a soft, observant character and distinct lack of extraneous dialog. That reticence, paired with an emphasis on beautifully-composed photography, reminded me more of an art film than an action epic. The battlefield's thick tension is inescapable, though, always drawing us back to the moment, with the frightened skyward eyes and skittish, shell-shocked nature of nearby soldiers proving a constant reminder that arbitrary death could be mere moments away. It's also the rare positive example of a recent tendency toward uneven sound mixes: a barrage of gunfire or sudden, screaming airborne bombing run can pack a mighty punch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Bullshit !!,"My greatest fear while watching Nolan's new movie if that just because he has delivered back to back world-wide hits and seen as the most intelligent film-maker; critics and Nolan-fans are obliged to given 10/10 ratings even if the movie is very average or even bad.Dunkirk finally turned my fear into reality.The movie is simply plain boring. You don't feel attached to any character. I don't even care if they die. The Aerial shots featuring Tom hardy all seem repetitive. It was not ""immersive"", ""out of the world"" experience as many critics are saying.One critic wrote that there was pin-drop silence in theater. Yes, I agree but not because people are tense but perhaps they are sleeping.And dear western media, I know world needs a anti-war message right now but that doesn't mean you start giving rave reviews to such a pathetic movie.

A fast and visceral war movie,"Watching this movie again at home almost a year after it was released to theaters on July 21st 2017, I still have a great deal of respect and love for how this movie and how it portrayed war and how fast and visceral it can be. Christopher Nolan mastfuly helms his shortest movie to date clocking it at 1 hour and 48 minutes, and it flew by. I orginally watched this movie at my local IMAX theater when it came out last year. Though I didn't write my review when I originally saw the movie, I waited to see if it still holds up on my 42 inch TV. Though the booming orchestra was gone and the massive screen was now small, the movie still brought me in to its setting and quick paced nature. This movie is about the event of Dunkirk and how everyone from land, sea, and air were affected. The movie is constantly jumping from these different perspectives.The editing is quick and strong. Every frame and cut seems necessary and tells it's own story. To the shots of the young men on the beach diving for cover from the enemy bombers, to the dad and his 2 boys saving a scared shell shocked soldier from drowning. It all feels very quick in nature and strong in heart. The main gimmick you could say in this movie is the switching of time and location or our main 3 stories. The Mole, The Sea, and The Air. Each with different amounts of time shown and cut between. I found this style unique and interesting on how it showed originally 3 unrelated stories and how they came to cross paths. Something rarely seems from a movie now a days.The cinematography in this movie is breathtaking. Very beautiful and intensely shot movie with master cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema behind the camera. He has shot movies including Interstellar, Spectre, and Her. Wide open shots of the beach and ocean soar high in the sky and swallow everything in the frame. These shots really show the scale and epicness of the event. These shots are often mixed in with close up shots of the soldiers in constant fear or pain. Or both. Almost everything in this movie is real. Hundreds of extras, real boats and planes, locations. Extremely immersive. This movie is a something to see visually wise.The characters and plot of the movie may be the one thing that is lacking here. You don't get to get into the characters minds very often. The movie is so quick paced and intense that very little time is left for talking. But for this movie it really works as a good things. The movie is not based around the characters. These characters that Christopher Nolan have written are strong characters for a backdrop for the main character, that is Dunkirk. I understand this might annoy people but when the movie concluded I still found the events they went though very engaging even if the characters sometimes weren't so fleshed our.The acting in the movie is also very good. Newcomer to limelight is actor Fionn Whitehead and does a great job with the little dialogue he has. Harry Styles, Cillian Murphy, and Tom Hardy all also bring in good performances. Though I believe the best performance in the movie is played by Mark Rylance. He places a strong father and gives much passion and relaxedness to the movie. Great job by all.I'm conclusion I am giving this movie a 9 because it is a masterpiece in film editing, cinematography and showing the massive scale of war in such a unique way. The acting all around it great but nothing ground breaking. Story and characters may be sometimes be lacking but never seems to bring down the movie much. In IMAX this movie was a joy to see because it is a more visual movie. Most of the joy from watching this movie comes from the events unfolding and not the characters connecting. From the beginning to the end this movie is quick paced and extremely immersive. Never a dull moment. Nolan often brings very visual stories to the silver screen in amazing ways, and this movie is no exception. This movie is about an intense visceral event that 330,000 soldiers experienced on the beachs of Dunkirk directed by Christopher Nolan and it is Amazing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Phenomenal & Unique,"A phenomenal war film with a very different narrative to the usual for the genre. It doesn't follow the 'rules' for film, a lack of chronology, 'main' characters, and single arc, emphasis is allowed to fall on war and it's horrors in real.Whilst visually beautiful, the audio and soundtrack are what makes this film so excellent. Acting is superb throughout, and no cast member outshines its role. A-listers such as Brannagh, Hardy and Murphy play their parts perfectly but remain tied to their characters. For me though, it was the three civilians which brought the most emotional moments, displaying the effects of war outside of the front line.It's not an enjoyable film to watch, the suspense is continuous and there is always an uneasy feeling of dread, but it is such a brilliant film. I've seen some negative reviews and I cannot fathom where they are coming from. It's not 'Hollywood', it's so much more respectful and true to the Dunkirk landings. Appreciate it for what it is.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Very compelling movie,"Before I watched the movie, I thought that this would be another boring history movie. That was what I expected. What I got, was a movie that showed me what the Allied Forces were actually up against; how difficult the war was; what they went through. This movie was made so intricately, that it made me feel what the soldiers felt; the fear; the joy; the sorrow. Though my review differs from others, I do not care. This movie was excellent and I would recommend it to everyone I know.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"Don't say anything, it's Nolan","Dunkirk is a 2017 war film directed by Christopher Nolan, starring Fionn Whitehead, Tom Hardy, and Mark Rylance. The movie tells the story of the Dunkirk evacuation during World War II, when British and Allied troops were surrounded by German forces on the beaches of Dunkirk, France.One of the most striking aspects of Dunkirk is its immersive and visceral depiction of war. The film is a masterclass in tension and suspense, with Nolan using a non-linear narrative to create a sense of disorientation and chaos. The movie alternates between three timelines: the land evacuation, the sea evacuation, and the air battles. This approach allows the audience to see the events from multiple perspectives, adding to the overall sense of urgency and danger.The film also excels in its use of sound and music. The score, composed by Hans Zimmer, is haunting and intense, with a recurring ticking sound that adds to the sense of time running out. The sound design is also exceptional, with the constant roar of planes and gunfire immersing the audience in the chaos of war.The performances in Dunkirk are outstanding, particularly from the young and relatively unknown actors in the lead roles. Fionn Whitehead delivers a compelling and understated performance as the young soldier Tommy, while Tom Hardy gives a powerful performance as a British pilot struggling to protect the evacuating troops. Mark Rylance also stands out as a civilian boat captain who risks his life to help with the evacuation.One of the strongest aspects of the film is its commitment to historical accuracy. Nolan consulted with historians and veterans to ensure that the events depicted in the film were as accurate as possible. The film also avoids the typical Hollywood cliches of war movies, instead focusing on the human element of the story. There are no grand speeches or heroic gestures, only ordinary people trying to survive in a terrifying and chaotic situation.The cinematography in Dunkirk is breathtaking, with stunning aerial shots and sweeping views of the sea and beach. The film was shot on 70mm film, giving it a rich and textured look that adds to the overall sense of realism.The only criticism of Dunkirk is that its non-linear structure can be confusing at times, particularly for viewers who are not familiar with the history of the Dunkirk evacuation. However, this is a minor issue in an otherwise exceptional film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

While I found photography and directing to be great, the plot was not up to par.

Movie that encapsulates Churchill's peroration from speech,"The movie was brilliantly written feeling as a visual counterpart to the famous Churchill speech. The peroration in the speech is captured in a dazzling way in the movie as you can feel the sense of hope and British pride. The beautiful visuals of the beaches and cliffs are very moving as Tom Hardy fulfills his duty. Seeing the Dunkirk evacuation from the civilians point of view provided a very clearer sense of what it must've been like and felt was this was the strongest part of the movie. Also enjoyed the scenes where Harry Styles character is assuming the civilians are ashamed of them, which is a point of view I hadn't considered but what must've been a very real thought.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Dunkirk,"Dunkirk, I feel conflicted writing this and it took me about a time to collect my thoughts, but Dunkirk is a ear shattering, mesmerizing and intense war film but it lacks a special something to make you fully engage, and care. I was mostly in awe during this movie, but not because of what the characters were doing, but simply because of the visuals and practical work.Directing, cannot be understated that this is a incredible looking film, special shoutout to the color palette, it looks vibrant but also bleak, a fantastic combination. The fighter pilot scenes were something special, the beach scenes, the amount of extras, the scale of it all, brilliant. This is a movie that will suck you in, even more so with the score..The score/music, Zimmer pulls off magic that never stops, every beating moment you're there, you hear and feel the escalation, the continues cold tension of waiting, it is a brilliant score, that only works on this exact movie. I wouldn't really go listening to it on spotify or anything, but it is tailor made to this movie in the most extreme manner.Audio, having seen a few Nolan movies so far this is by far the loudest of them all. And I'm relieved this movie is not the usual 2,5+ hours because I really started feeling it after a while and it just exhausted my hearing. Dialog was fine, parts that mattered were audible but not perfect. On a audio level, this equals a horror in terms of jump scares, because you will jump when it blasts your ears. Seems like this movie could almost induce shell shock just by viewing. Another audio caveat is also that it's highly depended on your audio system, for it to be effective you can't really put it on low and have no subwoofer, in a rare case this actually seems like one of those movies that only really comes to it's full potential in a theater, a opinion I don't always agree on.Story/etc, I get where Nolan is coming from. But it doesn't make for a good movie sadly. By giving us such a objective look, such a clean look as well; I found that the movie never really showed the horrors of war, because it decided to avoid any real nastiness. But that wasn't the intention. I don't need a gore fest, but when it's also so muted, it feels less impactful. Sound design for the screams are good though and very impactful, that is certainly a horror aspect. But back to the story, it's objective, flat, and just shows how it went, combined into three storylines which was fine, the aspect ratios where more annoying than anything though, and took my attention away from the full experience, cool idea, not great to watch. The main issue is making your main character generic soldier #77565, for a documentary or anything like that, perfectly fine. But we need something to connect to as a movie, the human element. The thing that makes war so horrible. There's just a lot missing there.It left me feeling like I saw a really pretty and impressive movie, but that's about it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Quite a boring movie.,"I like war movies but I certainly didn't like this one. I feel the title is wrong because it's not so much about Dunkirk as its about some blokes who where there at the time.Sometimes it was hard to follow which moment in time is shown, because the movie abruptly cuts between three perspectives, therefore even showing some events twice. I hate this - Repetitive: Much scenes are identical or slightly different from another. Flight scenes was like WHO cares. Keeping out the Germans at the front-line is just as much a part of the story of Dunkirk and it would've given us a chance to actually see the enemy and get some awesome battle scenes.This movie is highly overrated, due to many biased Nolan fans and critics. I found it a very boring movie. The lack of an interesting plot or any interesting characters sadly wasn't compensated enough by the impressive audiovisuals.

Amazing Music and Visual Storytelling,"Dunkirk (2017) is a historical epic thriller film that tells the story of the Dunkirk evacuation during World War II. It was written and directed by Christopher Nolan and shows the events from different perspectives - land, sea, and air.This is my 2nd time watching this film as my local cinema offered to watch it in the original version in 70mm projection. The image of the film in 70mm was vivid and vintage, although there was an occasional flickering during the film.The sound design in 'Dunkirk' is exceptional, reminiscent of the iconic ticking clock in Nolan's Interstellar (2014). This stood out to me the most with Hans Zimmer's score which is a masterpiece. It employs the Shepard tone, brilliantly underscoring the film's themes of fear and tension among the soldiers and the fear of the unknown. The Music and visual storytelling was emphasized a lot in this film and was pivotal. Although there was little dialogue in the movie, the dialogue per se was exceptionally well-crafted. In the cinema hall, the sound was so powerful that it made the entire room rumble, adding to the film's intensity.What stood out for me was the cinematography, especially the blue-themed color grading and the stunning pilot scene side mount shots. The POV shots from the viewer perspective of the fighter jets were particularly immersive. The sea landscape scenes are breathtaking, captured masterfully by Nolan's cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema.The casting is another triumph. Fionn Whitehead, portraying Tommy, along with Barry Keoghan as George and Mark Rylance in the role of Mr. Dawson, all deliver exceptional acting performances. I was surprised to see Harry Styles in the movie as he impresses the viewers with his acting chops, and Cillian Murphy showcases his versatility as an actor, delivering a haunting performance as a shell-shocked soldier.Overall, Dunkirk (2017) is a masterclass in filmmaking, where each technical aspect contributes to a gripping narrative that immerses viewers in the midst of this significant historical event.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

Superior craft,"Not your average war film, there's not much on dialogue, narrative or heroics to be found here but what I did find was a portrayal of endurance, and one hell of a well crafted piece of cinema.Rarely do I believe in the 'needs to be seen on the big screen' espousal thrown at many big budget efforts, but in this case I really wish I'd seen this on IMAX rather than the small screen.The only real script note in play here is the intentionally mind-fuddling overlapping time narratives, a bit Inception-like and not, where the 3 main areas of interest: the initial group of soldiers from the beach, Tom Hardy in the skies, and Mark Rylance in his little boat, slowly conflate together in their own little time bubbles, it is I suppose meant to parallel how confused that event really was even if it could be described as a little too on the nose.The technical aspects here, the scale and practical effects are sheer wonderment. How anyone could find this 'dull' with that pulsating score keeping the tension up whenever it wants (more often than not) kept my attention.Superior film-making.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

Breathtaking Epic,"If you know the historical event and the details surrounding it, Christopher Nolan's ""Dunkirk"" can be exceptionally rewarding. It's a masterwork of filmmaking in the most objective sense.This film sees the event from a few individual perspectives placed in desperate circumstances. Those few days are a moment in time that define a nation's will to survive at it's lowest point in the 20th century. Nolan, Zimmer, and van Hoytema have captured the essence of this in a gritty, intense, yet often beautiful way. All that plus the imagery is fascinating and very effective in conveying meaning beyond the plot and characters.To some the story, if not history, may need to be laid out in more personal and relatable terms. But to most who understand what Dunkirk was and what ""Dunkirk"" is, the emotional payoff is tremendous. Exactly what a great film should be.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

NOLAN'S SPRAWLING AND ENGROSSING WORLD WAR II EPIC,"Christopher Nolan's sprawling historical war epic thriller about the infamous World War II battle that culminated in the evacuation of over 400,000 British and Allied troops that ended up trapped on the wide open beaches of Dunkirk, France in 1940 following a catastrophic defeat. They now must endure a number of relentless repeated strafing and bombing by the enemy, a civilian named Mr. Dawson, played superbly Mark Rylance, sets out on a dangerous journey across the English Channel in his small wooden yacht with his son and son's friend, well-played by Tom Glynn-Carney and Barry Keoghan, to aid them before they are killed by the approaching massive Nazi forces, and a brave RAF spitfire pilot Farrier, played with true conviction by the amazing Tom Hardy, also bears a hand as he battles the Nazi Luftwaffe who are attacking the soldiers on the beach. Nolan's masterful Oscar nominated tour-de-force direction is pure visual cinema at it's finest and this is the best film of his extraordinary career. Nolan who also wrote the compelling screenplay gives us no background information on the characters in the film, the script focuses solely on the desperate evacuation which we are thrown in the middle of, and he uses only minimal dialogue to great effect. It is truly impressive the way Nolan generates suspense by interlacing action sequences with moment of dead silence, and the flawless detail of every aspects of the evacuation with scenes of death and slaughter that are visceral and intensely disturbing will have you on the edge-of-your-seat. Hoyte van Hoytema's breathtaking Oscar nominated 70mm IMAX cinematography is a totally immersive cinematic experience which is unforgettable. Razor-sharp editing, striking practical visual effects, and a powerful score by Hans Zimmer. This film also benefits greatly from fine performances from it's large cast which includes Fionn Whitehead, Damien Bonnard, Aneurin Barnard, Lee Armstrong, James Bloor, Jack Loeden, Kenneth Branagh, and James D'Arcy. Nolan's magnum opus and a powerful human drama done with a poetic and artistic grace. A masterpiece for the ages. Winner of 3 Academy Awards.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

Long way HOME.,"From the first seconds of the film, the viewer's attention is inextricably riveted to the screen. War tension, fear, pursuit, shooting. This is not a simple war film, with lots of shots, attacks and shouts of 'Hurray!' No, 'Dunkirk' is a film about the soul, about how war affects the human soul and about what people are capable of when there is no way out.The idea of the plot unfolding from three different angles (land, water, air) is simply amazing and shows us the picture of military operations as broadly and realistically as possible. Thousands of soldiers who are exhausted and dream of only one thing: to return home. Enemy planes targeting ships filled with wounded and water claiming thousands of young lives.Incredible cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema conveys human emotions and genuine anxiety. The body shakes from every explosion, from every shot. Close-ups, long shots - everything looked simply unsurpassed and alive.This film is filled with emotions. There is very little text here, but a lot of action. Every movement of the facial muscles is filled with one or another emotion that simply cannot be conveyed in words.Separately, it is worth noting Hans Zimmer and the mood his music gave to the film. Tension, hope, struggle, luck, anger, loss and victory. It was all amplified hundreds of times thanks to the magic of music.What's really nice is that Nolan, along with famous actors (Kenneth Branagh, Cillian Murphy, Tom Hardy), put young guys at the head of the plot. But the film does not boast of big names, because it is not about individuals. The film tells the story of hundreds of thousands of soldiers and the steadfastness of the people. 'When the soldiers can't go home, the house comes after them' - and it's amazing. Each story told, which ultimately comes together, allows us to feel the tragedy and joy of this historical event.'Dunkirk' is a quality film that captures the viewer's imagination and once again reminds us that war is evil.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Visually good but not enough depth,"This movie is visually amazing but is lacking in other aspects. The characters felt kind of shallow but the few characters that I felt had more depth were great being the dad, son, the shell-shocked soldier. The movie felt really choppy when it transitioned between the different stories. Also the stories didn't line up. It showed a dogfight between planes then cut to the beach then went back to a boats point of view of the dogfight. The movie includes lots of big stars but they blended them in which I really appreciated. For example I didn't realize Harry Styles was in it until I looked at the cast list. Overall the movie does many things right but I think if they had taken some more time to build more depth between characters then the movie would be significantly better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
An unusual ww2 movie,"To begin with this is probably my favorite WWII movie. The sound design in the movie is just superb there aren't many movies who do such a good job at setting the atmosphere only with ambience. The music written by Hans Zimmer just further elevates the movie. It doesn't need a bunch of killing and gore to show how intese the situation the soldiers are in is. The stylistic choice to not have many voice lines in the movie just further elevates the dire situation the soldiers are in. Dunkirk like most Nolan movies doesn't follow a linear timeline and the events don't happen in a sctrict chronological order. In Dunkirk we follow three different timelines, and although it might get confusing at the end of the movie everything clicks and we understand when most events transpire in the timeline. Overall this movie is one of the best WWII movies out there if not the best, the only reason it does not get a 10/10 from me is because of the acting being a little lacking.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
evacuation from battle,"When Christopher Nolan's ""Dunkirk"" got released, it drew controversy for omitting the Indian troops in British armed forces who were in Dunkirk. That said, it's one intense movie. It focuses on a couple of people participating in the evacuation and how their stories intertwine. Most of it is shot in a naturalistic style to increase the intensity, and there's limited dialog. There are only a few notable actors in the movie, so as to keep the focus on the story.It's not a great movie, but worth seeing. Tom Hardy's character's flight alone is enough reason to see the movie. From what I heard, Nolan's ""Interstellar"" sucked, so he's made up for it. I do hope that there's eventually a movie about the Indian troops in the British armed forces, though.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Review,Dunkirk was definitely better than 90 percent of war movies for the simple fact it does not do gore. Most war movies almost seem to glorify that aspect of war while this movie focuses on different aspects of war. This is a breath of fresh air in my opinion. I also think the different perspectives made it interesting rather than one point of view because if it was just the soldier dudes It would be so so so so boring. The civilians story was the most interesting of the three because it allowed for more dialogue and interactions between characters. Also the captain of the ship was just cool old man vibes so that also helped the story.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

A war film that actually feels real,"When you think of some of the greatest war films in history, there are a few that come to mind. From 'Saving Private Ryan' to 'Platoon' and 'Full Metal Jacket,' there are a few that have made a huge impact on society and are considered to be some of the greatest cinema made.Enter 'Dunkirk.' Christopher Nolan's extravagant take on the evacuation of allied forces from a French beach town during WWII as the German forces descended on them. Central to the events was the fact that British civilians were called on to man their own vessels so that they could make the trip across the English Channel and lend a hand in the evacuation, as the German air force complicated the rescue mission from above.The main reason 'Dunkirk' works so well is it feels ""real."" Nolan is a master of letting elements unfold on screen without the need to add unnecessary dialogue. The use of sound and wide shots of the open water and beach give the audience an immersive experience, which explains the three Oscar wins for sound editing, mixing and film editing and multiple other nominations. There are enough moments throughout the film to get your heart racing that are truly genuine.Other achievements by Nolan in the film include the ability to develop many characters in such a short runtime. The audience gets to know Mr. Dawson and his son Peter (Mark Rylance and Tom Glynn-Carney), who heroically race to save soldiers on their personal boat, as well as British soldier Tommy (Fionn Whitehead) and fighter pilots Farrier and Collins (Tom Hardy and Jack Lowden) whose heroics collectively make a difference in the effort.'Dunkirk' will likely be remembered as one of the better efforts in this genre for years to come, and a large part of this is Nolan's application of film techniques that have worked for many of his previous projects.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

A War Thriller That Redefines The Genre!,"Christopher Nolan's masterpiece Dunkirk, is one of the greatest war films ever crafted, period. The sheer amount of filmmaking artistry to relive the heart-rending moments of Operation Dynamo & the miracle of deliverance thereafter, deserves momentous praise, with its affecting themes conveyed through technical feats over embellishments. The film then honors the fact based stories, and what an achievement it was.In Dunkirk, the esteemed filmmaker captures the perils of war flawlessly, with tantalizing frames that brims with genuine drama, whether from land, sea or air. These frames showcase the most harrowing moments of the escape from Dunkirk, staged to perfection, that the immense fear, hopelessness & desperation of his characters resounds to its audience, without the need for dialogue & expositions. Nolan as well, veers away from manufactured sentimentality & false heroics, guaranteeing a spectacle whose most compelling feats, are in the filmmaker's chosen details. Nolan's directorial marvel peaks further in the RAF Spitfires & German BF Fighters dogfights, whose insane camerawork ushers exhilarating point of views that renders the action as original and authentic as can be.Apart from the fantastic direction, Dunkirk as well satiates the technical prestige Nolan films are known for. Hans Zimmer's sound design for instance, was impeccable, elevating the spectacles & tension of each riveting plot piece. The cinematography deserves mention as well, with striking images that serves to both dazzle & horrify. The use of practical effects over CGI offers transporting realism, an uncommon treat for war aficionados with a craving for factual representations.Overall, Dunkirk is Nolan's honest-to-goodness tribute that showcases the realities of war, and its psychological consequences. It then redefines the genre that is so used to aesthetically pleasing heroes with personal dramas, emotional arcs, & orchestrated valorous deeds. In its place are the most suspenseful & immersive sequences, unafraid to depict its star studded characters as random & expendable, terrorized by the bleakness of the situation. My sole criticism on Dunkirk, is its unconventional, multiple timeline approach that was needless. Beyond that however, is pure artistry!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"Well directed and filmed, just not for me","Dunkirk was well directed, well thought out, and the interweaving of the stories was quite unique. I don't know why, but I was expecting such a war movie with rave reviews to have slightly more action. To illustrate, we never actually glimpse of the enemy army because this film is not really about them, and in that sense it portrays q realistic side of war - the side of waiting and hoping and bracing yourself for a sporadic moments of destruction. It is slow, it is endurance, and it often ends in an instant.One of the main characters we follow is a coward doing his best to sneak out of the war zone, and is not very likeable, but through his eyes we see the danger that lurks at every corner in war, and we see that in war sometimes it is survival of the cautious rather than survival of the fittest. We also see the flip side; some great displays of morality and bravery that often end in sacrifice. These character stand out in a sea of understandably confused and hopeless soldiers and officers; sparse moments of true principles no matter the cost are on full display.I could tell this movie would be appreciated more by those captivated by military realism in their films and those who like to absorb the true atmosphere of war, particularly of the Second World War. But this movie just missed the mark for me and I ended up finding it a little boring at times. Still, production quality was very good, and the 4k blu-ray was memerising in the visual department but the absence of Atmos was certainly felt. A great entry to the 4k Christopher Nolan collection.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
The impact is one of combined horror and awe,"In Dunkirk, virtuoso director Christopher Nolan throws us straight into the action as hordes of desperate British soldiers try to get onboard a ship to take them back to Great Britain and escape the approaching Germans who have cornered them in the town of Dunkirk in the North of France. It's 1940, and the German forces are about to complete their conquest of the north-western part of continental Europe.Having watched another of this season's award favourites, Darkest Hour, about Winston Churchill's first days as Prime Minister of the UK in the early days of WWII, it is particularly interesting to see Nolan's out-and-out war movie take on the battle of Dunkirk (watching either film first will work). Nolan willingly sacrifices dramaturgy and character-development for realism and an authentic representation of the randomness of war. His film is basically 106 minutes of climax, with a constant suspense-curve in which the noise and chaos of war comes to the forefront and in which individuality is subordinate - as it by default is in war. This fascinating basis sets Dunkirk apart and gives it an undeniable and irresistible edge, even if the cost is a reduced emotional impact, as anyone familiar with the concept of narration would know. That doesn't mean that the film is non-narrative, however, because out of the chaos come three main plot-lines which Nolan alternates between following. Dialogue is scarce, but weighty. Glimpses of hope are rare, but ever so welcome. And the impact is one of combined horror and awe.The film is a homage to those countless young, brave and largely unknowing men who fought that war for us all. Among Dunkirk's many achievements, the technical ones may be the most impressive. And Hans Zimmer's uncharacteristic, intense score help elevate Nolan images from beautiful to haunting.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

I particularly enjoyed how the film is shot, the sound editing and the score. It's a watchable story about an event from World War II.I wouldn't, personally, say there's a standout cast performer. I don't mean that negatively, it's just more a film about a group of people rather than individuals - which I assume was the intention. There are still good performances, from the likes of Tom Glynn-Carney and Jack Lowden. It also features star names, including Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy and Mark Rylance.The music and how the sequences are crafted is what elevates this film up, while the pacing is almost spot on - they could easily have made this 2hr 15mins+, like most war films seem to do, but keeping it at around 1hr 47mins was a smart choice. I do still feel like it could've been greater, yet I still got entertainment from it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

One of the best of its genre.,"Dunkirk.Allied soldiers from Belgium, the British Commonwealth and Empire, and France are surrounded by the German Army and evacuated during a fierce battle in World War II.Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk joins the movies that shows how brutal the war was and how it'll always be, brutal and meaningless .It's not just that, this movie isn't a regular storytelling, not trying to be so dramatical but it was real and it felt real since the early beginning.Nolan tried to put us in the middle of the war in Dunkirk, particularly the evacuation of the British and the French army and the whole process generated some great dramatical aspects that didn't felt forced.The plot wouldn't be that interesting if Nolan didn't use the different time-lines, it got me focused and confused sometimes and that's what we love about that man, his movies are always a challenge for our brains but this time in a smaller scale.Everything technical was at it finest, especially the sound and the cinematography ...-Well done, lads. Well done.-All we did is survive.-That's enough.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"Thrilling, unique and well directed war film!","Christopher Nolan's war movie is in classic fashion, strangely paced. But make no mistake, it is definitely one of the movie's strongest factor.The three timelines is intentionally confusing, it makes the audience think and invested into the events that unfold.The other factor is the amazing soundtrack made by the legendary, Hans Zimmer. Who can turn even the simplest scenes, into one of the most intense sequences you'll see.There are 2 other factors that make this film as intense as it is. First is the camera movement by Hoyte Van Hoytama, that captures you and traps you into the action scenes. The second is the editing of this movie, done by Lee Smith. The editing is masterful, and is what turns this movie from a regular war movie to something smart, creative and never before seen.Overall, it is a short but enjoyable war movie. It has thrilling cinematography, an intensifying soundtrack and a triumphant ending. A good watch for any movie lovers.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Just not it for me,"""Dunkirk"" delivers a visually captivating experience while struggling to evoke emotional engagement. The story was consistent, as something was happening all the time. However, there were only a few moments where I felt tension, and if I did, it was in a minimal way, mostly because of the lack of character depth. I just didn't connect or care for anyone. For me, it was no different than reading this from a history textbook, where I just feel bad for the soldiers in Dunkirk, but not in a deep or emotional way. It wasn't until the very last speech when I did connect emotionally.Nevertheless, I did like the storytelling. The merging of the three different perspectives was well-executed and felt somewhat satisfying. The cast did a very good job, though I felt they were limited by the lack of complexity. The visual and sound effects were exceptional and immersive, and Zimmer's score was good as per usual, but not his best. Additionally, the cinematography is the standout aspect of the film. If anything kept my eyes on the screen at all times, it was the incredible and beautiful shots this movie has from beginning to end.I didn't dislike ""Dunkirk"", but it kind of felt like a disappointment being a hardcore Nolan fan. Of all his work, this is the one I enjoyed the least. While I think many people could appreciate its unique approach, it just wasn't for me.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Excellent war movie,"This movie was different from other war movies. Most war movies aren't as silent as this one. This movie had a lot less dialogue then what you would expect to see in a movie. The camera shots by Christopher Nolan were very well done, as it blew me away. When Harry Styles was brought in to act in this movie, I thought it was going to be a decent, not great acting by him. But he did fairly well for a pop singer. The amount of suspense you felt was unreal as you were hoping for something that might not happen.

A generous 6.,"A very disappointing film. In my opinion not as good as the 1958 film. Disjointed and lacking heart after an hour and a quarter I was looking forward to it finishing. Some of the acting and dialogue was below par and this contributed to my disinterest in what happened to the individual characters.On the positive side the sets, the costumes and the hardware were very good. The cinematography and sound were outstanding and the aerial scenes were excellent. I watched on blu-ray and the visuals were crisp and clear with vibrant colours.

Like military disasters, you jump from crisis to crisis, this film is a crisis.The critics who adored it for its cinematography failed to notice that no effort was made to hide modern items that were not present historically, attention to detail is a hallmark of a good historical based movie, but first you have to know what a detail is.I would be less than truthful if I said this movie rose to the level of disappointing.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
An Instant Classic,"Christopher Nolan is one of my favorite directors and he has again delivered with this masterpiece. What I love about the film is that there is very little to it, it allows you to sit back and watch the drama unfold without getting caught up in ""how John is feeling."" It is more about the event than any single soldier, a concept which I love. Some reviews have been critical, saying there is little character development, but in my opinion while it is minimal it isn't needed because the film is just fantastically shot and put together.The only complaint is I would have liked this to have been longer, maybe added something at the beginning or more dialogue about the unfolding events. However, I'm pretty certain there will be a directors cut when the BluRay is released to address this very minor problem.The acting is also fantastic. Tom Hardy does an incredible job of making you feel like you're in the cockpit with him. Because of the way this is shot, in many scenes it makes you feel a little like you are actually there. Some have compared this to films like Inglorious or Saving Private Ryan, but for me they are way behind this. For real war film/series favorites I would liken this to the Band of Brothers episode where they follow the medic on the front line.I cannot recommend this film enough and it looked amazing in iMAX.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Oscar Worthy Period.,"At this point, Nolan can make a Smurfs movie, and people are gonna still buy tickets and watch it. I'm not really into war movies, but I have seen war movies before like Saving Private Ryan and Hurt Locker. But no other movie in the world packs this much intensity. You know nothing about a character, you have no reason to like him, but you would still want him to survive. That's Nolan's magic. Previously Nolan set a benchmark for the Superhero movies, Mind benders, Sci-fi and now for War movies. Nolan and Zimmer worked in tandem to deliver a masterpiece that will set a standard for future war movies. This is probably the best cinematic experience I have ever experienced since Avatar. You will cry you will laugh, and you will awe every shot by Nolan. I hope Nolan and Zimmer will win Golden Globes and Oscar for this movie.

Why this could actually be one of the best war films even after accepting its weaknesses,"Dunkirk is one of the rare cases a film receives a huge critical acclaim and a mixed reaction from the audience. Some reviews arrive to consider the praise for the film being based solely on the name of its director, Christopher Nolan.The main criticisms that Dunkirk receives is: poor character development, repetitivity of the action, little emotionality.Dunkirk indeed doesn't really have character development. This is a fact. You get to know something briefly about Mark Rylance's backstory and his son's friend George, but nothing about anyone else. There is a reason for that: Dunkirk relies mostly on its fast pace, which simply does not give enough time to fully develop characters the way, for example, The Thin Red Line did with Stavros, or Saving Private Ryan did with John Miller. I dare to say that's not something the film needed at all. Stopping the story from taking its course so that Harry Styles and Fionn Withehead talk about their backstory and are more identified as characters would have taken away from the whole suspense feel the film expects the audience to receive. We got to love John Miller because of the night-time church moment, or the past reveal scene, or the scene in which he talks to Ryan prior to the final battle. These scenes are also those which make Saving Private Ryan a 2h40m film, with about 1h40m of action.Repetitivity of action is a criticism I understood while watching the film. As many of the readers might know, this film tells three story lines contemporarily: one that lasts days, on ground, one that lasts less than a day, on the ship called ""Moonstone"" and another that lasts less than an hour, on the spitfires. These storyline become increasingly interconnected through the film, until the final climax. What sometimes happens is that you see the same action from a different perspective ten minutes after you have seen it from another. So, the film's first sequence that involves Spitfires has three of them flying over the sea, and there is a sailor ship in the corner of the shot. 30 minutes later you will realize that the ship was the Moonstone when you see that same thing from the perspective of the people on the ship. There are several of these repetitions. That's why some viewers felt it repetitive: most of the time (expecially the ship scenes and the plane scenes) they saw simply the exact same scenes. Anyone familiar with Nolan must know how he either did complex story lines on a linear plot, but is more known for the non-linearity of Memento, The Prestige and so on. Dunkirk is following this habit in a truly outstanding and clever way.Dunkirk had no ""Earn this."" scene, or any moving John Williams score. The ending had some emotionality to it, but no other scene in the film. Dunkirk doesn't want you to cry. It wants you to feel the suspense the soldiers felt. Up until the last minute or so, not a moment of relief is left to the audience, and this is conveyed through the fast pace of the film and its very intense Zimmer score. Taken alone, the score is very similar to others he composed, but it does what is needed for the film's intensity.As for accuracy, I looked up the main things about the Dunkirk evacuation before watching the film. A lot of elements are slightly mentioned or implied. E.g. the french defending the perimeter, or the existence of a second dock for the french, overall the sense of chaos is fully present, and the film delivers it well. There are some minor inaccuracies or simplifications, true, such as the German planes' scheme colour being one that they didn't use until some time later, which apparently was an intentional choice, but all the main details of the Dunkirk evacuation where there, in my view.When the movie finished, I was relieved through the ending, but it delivered the intensity and climax that no other war movie gave. And Dunkirk did this without showing a single nazi soldier or without true warfare scenes: this is why Dunkirk should be considered one of the best war films made so far.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Bland and Disappointing,"I came away disappointed as I had been looking forward to this film for a while. I will try to avoid spoilers, but will say that there was not a single swastika, no reference to Nazis (or even Germany for that matter), and virtually no close up view of ""the enemy."" Is this the new form of whitewashing history, and pandering to the ever growing sensitivities of an overly politically correct entertainment industry? At any rate, aside from this same annoying trend that ruined Captain America and Wonder Woman, there was no emotional depth to the movie whatsoever, both in terms of the characters or action. Worst of all, there was an artificial feigned sense of selflessness among the main characters on several occasions. Movie on the whole just fell flat.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Misunderstood Masterpiece,"Christopher Nolan has up to this point never made a bad movie. Some of them aren't great(Insomnia), but none of them are reprehensible atrocities. The people who hated or didn't like Dunkirk wanted to see something moving and character driven like Saving Private Ryan or any of the other great WW2 movies out there. Nolan chose to make the audience a character in this film rather than have the audience follow around a solitary character in which we place our empathy. To the haters of this film: I understand, but I certainly don't agree. In my opinion, this film should FINALLY get Nolan a well deserved Oscar nomination for Best Director, and depending on the competition that remains to be seen, he might very well deserve to win in that category.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
A Technically Brilliant Film with No Emotional Center,"""Dunkirk"" is the first Christopher Nolan movie since ""Memento"" that I've actually liked, mostly because he does the exact opposite of what he does in most of his movies. Rather than build a baffling, incoherent epic around a concept too ambitious to ever make sense as a movie, he crafts a spare, naked film about a very specific and compressed series of events, namely the military disaster that resulted in the messy evacuation of Allied forces from the beaches of Dunkirk in France.The film is technically brilliant. Its stars are its editor, composer, and cinematographer, who work seamlessly together to maintain a throbbing pulse of dread throughout the entire film. There are some big stars in the movie -- like Kenneth Branagh, Mark Rylance, and Tom Hardy -- but they mostly blend into the background of the faceless and nameless many who tried to find a way, any way, to get off the beach before the German forces arrived. Nolan can't resist getting up to some of his old tricks, like some mixed up chronology that makes things somewhat disorienting for the viewer at first. But they're used well and serve the story rather than overwhelming it.I didn't much care for the heavy handed, schmaltzy passages that pepper the later part of the film and feel more like Steven Spielberg than anything that came before it. Indeed, the whole film does feel a bit like ""Saving Private Ryan"" in that it spends most of its running time creating a visceral, almost documentary-like recreation of events and then can't help throwing in some old- fashioned Hollywood sentiment as if the director feels he has to reward his audience with some feel- good pap to make up for putting us through the ordeal of everything that precedes it.Overall I admired ""Dunkirk"" for its technical craft, but I was mostly left cold by it. It doesn't have any emotional core to it, the feel-good passages aside, which are more bombastic than emotional anyway. There are people to care about in the abstract, but no real characters. These men don't have inner lives, none that we're shown in any case, and that limits the impact of what happens to them. They're representations of men rather than the flesh and blood real thing.Grade: A-",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

Dunkirk (one of Nolan's best),"Dunkirk directed by Christopher Nolan starring Tom Hardy, amongst other stars tell the real event during World War II and how 400,000 soldiers were able to escape. After watching this movie I can easily say this is one of the best of the year, hands down. From the opening sequence to the final sequence, the movie doesn't stop at giving you a single breath of air. The cinematography is absolutely fantastic and beautiful. Every shot in this movie feels completely on-point, not a single take was misplaced. In my opinion, this is Nolan's best directed film to date. To my understanding there was no use of CGI, every battle sequence was practical effect. The air sequence where Tom Hardy's character is in is absolutely breath-taking. The film doesn't have much dialogue, it rests on the amazing score by Hans Zimmer and boy, what a score he pulled off. This is a film that is about the event rather than the characters and that's where the movie for some might not work. In previous war films such as Saving Private Ryan or Hacksaw Ridge, you get to know the characters or get behind them-rooting for them. In Dunkirk, you don't get that. You don't get that one scene where you get to dig in inside a character and root for them. As I said, this film is about the event of Dunkirk. So, if you go into this film expecting great characters you're gonna leave disappointed. But if you don't go with those expectations then Dunkirk is a perfect film. For my final grade, I'm gonna give Dunkirk 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

Dunkirk is Christopher Nolan's greatest film,"It came across that Nolan wanted to put viewers in the same shoes as the soldiers and what many of them would have experienced. So it is exactly that, an experience that you get taken through with multiple perspectives rather than just a quick, simple paint by numbers, narrow perspective story like many films give you.With the way it's shot and the sound is designed, there is an ever present and intense atmosphere of danger. You don't know where the Germans are or what they have on the way. All you do know is its got to be really bad because hundreds of thousands of British and French are trapped on a beach, trying to find any way they can to escape and survive. They can see England across the water with no where else to go and no way of getting over the channel.Christopher Nolan often focuses on how the audience engages with the films he makes on a deep psychological level. He's not just about being historically accurate or on the other end of the spectrum throwing explosion after explosion at you. Hes more focused on the ways he can make you feel immersed and relate to the situations. The feeling of drowning, of being trapped in a small space and the fear of the unknown. Right now, I don't think you could possibly get closer to the feeling of how it may have been for the soldiers in Dunkirk when it actually happened.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Rating: A,"Some things are undeniable: the sky is blue, fire burns and Christopher Nolan is one of the best directors alive. His originality in the way he tells a story is always mind-blowing and very unconventional, which makes some critics' minds go against him simply because they just can't understand the brilliance of said director.Once again, Nolan directs the hell out of this movie! Not only his storytelling is very different, it actually fits perfectly into the film's line of events. Once you get it, it literally makes you go ""Oooooohhhhh, so that's what you wanted me to understand. Cool!"". The fact that he used 6000 extras plus real boats and planes from that era elevates the movie's realism. The real locations make the whole film look stunning and the cinematography is pure perfection.As for the story itself, I gotta emphasize on this: it's literally a WAR movie. From the very first shot, BUM! You're in it! This might be one of the best (if not THE best) pure war film in history: the dizzy air fights, the bombs constantly being dropped on the beach, the gunshots, everything feels and SOUNDS so real! Hans Zimmer's score proves that he's one of the best composers ever ...For the first time in my life, I honestly felt sick and uncomfortable watching some scenes on IMAX. Normally, this would be a negative, but not on a war film like this: it delivers the message it wants in the most REAL way possible. If I didn't feel well, seated on a chair, watching a war going down on a screen, I can't even imagine what it's like to actually experience it.The cast is great, especially Mark Rylance as Mr. Dawson who brings a needed level of emotion to the movie, Fionn Whitehead as Tommy who we follow throughout the major part of the runtime and also Harry Styles as Alex who surprised the hell out of me, the kid can actually act!Like I said above, this is a very unconventional film which portrays the war in its most horrible and fierce state. There's almost no dialogue during the whole runtime, there's no chat around a fire where the soldiers talk about their pasts and families, there's never a moment to rest. That, for me, it's perfect because it depicts the war as it probably was! I can't imagine people having dances and chats on the beach while bombs are being dropped, so this aspect of the film, for me, it's as real as it can get.However, this leads me to my only issue with this movie: its characters. Since there's no backstory to any of them, I can't really connect or get attached to a single character. I understand that that's exactly what Nolan wanted, but the truth is that I didn't feel scared for someone's imminent death or worried that someone might not make it to the rescue boats ... God, I needed to go to RottenTomatoes to check some of the characters' names because I couldn't remember them! They are nothing to me because I know nothing about them ...Still, I can only see this as a minor issue for me because I can understand what Nolan was going for, I truly can. Dunkirk is about the EVENT and not the people in it.The whole movie gives me that sense of danger and urgency with the thrilling air fights, with the soldiers' fear in their faces every time a plane goes by, as well as their hope every time they go away. The worry and sense of duty that the sailors show navigating into the war to save their fellow compatriots is emotional and captivating ... Every single one of these aspects elevates the film in such a way that I can't look at it and not see a perfect portrayal of WAR.In conclusion, Nolan does it again. His unconventional storytelling and beautiful cinematography, as well as Hans Zimmer's score, turn Dunkirk into one of the best war movies of all time! From the dizzy air fights to the bombs being dropped, everything feels incredibly real and scary, which makes this film probably the best portrayal of a war in its most fierce state. The cast is great, the characters not so much, but the story is about the event that happened and not about the people in it. So, go and (try to) enjoy a war through a screen without throwing up or leaving your seat: after all, you are safe ... They were not.MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"A film that leaves you wanting more, but not in the good way","Christopher Nolan's' Dunkirk was a not-your-typical war epic with masterful cinematography,technical display, and score that, to all its best efforts, fell flat. The film was based on true events of the evacuation of 300,000 British soldiers from Dunkirk beach during the height of World War II. The film sets itself apart from other war films, deciding to focus on group survival instead of specific characters, bouncing from different perspectives between ground, sea, and air. Each of these mini plots take place along different time lines, giving away new pieces of information as the story unfolds, and eventually meeting up at the end for the climax of the film. Even with all these elements, it still felt as if things were missing from the story. The absence of a main protagonist made it difficult to connect on an emotional level with the characters. There were great, subtle performances by the characters that were given screen time in excess than 5 minutes, but not enough to truly resonate with the audience. The score, as wonderful as it was, played out with the intense build up of a ticking clock that always seemed to be leading to some grandiose action sequence that never came. It's an unfortunate misstep that leaves you with a feeling of wanting more, not in the sense that you wish it didn't end, but that you were robbed of the few pieces of a puzzle that would have led to an exceptional film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"If Stanley Kubrick Made A World War Two Film, It Would Be Dunkirk!","THIS is how you do practical filmmaking and still make it feel innovative in a digital age of media while making your film seem comparable to classics like Saving Private Ryan and FullMetal Jacket. Basically everything in Dunkirk is analogue, practical and it doesn't need to depend on overblown-CGI trickery whatsoever. Chris Nolan has given us a war movie that feels like it came from the mind of Stanley Kubrick; the scale, larger-than-life direction and impeccable cinematography all makes this film feel like it's the creative offspring of the great-late Kubrick himself.Chris Nolan has made another masterpiece for the ages and easily one of the best films of the 21st Centry just like he seamlessly achieved with Memento, Insomnia, The Prestige, The Dark Knight Trilogy, Inception, Interstellar and finally Dunkirk (as of this writing).Dunkirk tackles one of the most overlooked events of the Second World War (at least in cinema) and even in the first fifteen minutes of the movie it's instantaneously better and FAR more respectable than films like Pear Harbour. With Dunkirk, Nolan NEVER disrespects the tensions of the war and the horror it brought about, and there isn't a moment where he tries glorifying the terror. This is a war film without physical grit but PLENTY of psychological dilemmas that actually perfectly fits this kind of war-movie. Sometimes it's the emotion that's more impacting than seeing the entrails of characters going all over the place like in Saving Private Ryan (that film is still fantastic); the paranoia amongst the British and French soldiers in this film is its own form of horror. You start to wonder how the hell did the Allied forced win against the Nazis in the end? Well we did; and the events of Dunkirk changed the modern world forever.If you're a fan of Chris Nolan's work, please see this movie, be it on IMAX-70mm, regular 70mm or 35mm or digital; just see it at the movies regardless of the format.

This is a thrilling and harrowing look at the Dunkirk evacuation, and the victory it should be recognised as, not as a shameful retreat. Nolan focuses on the event itself rather than on the characters, so the little dialogue and the ordinary characters are not missteps. This is an unselfish and balanced look through different perspectives at the event.

The ensemble cast also includes Welsh actor Aneurin Barnard (UK TV Mini-Series Cilla and War & Peace) as Gibson, former English member of English music boy band One Direction Harry Styles as Alex, English actor James D'Arcy (Let's Be Cops, Jupiter Ascending) as Colonel Winnant, English actor Jack Lowden (Denial, A United Kingdom) as Collins, Barry Keoghan ('71, Trespass Against Us) as George and Tom Glynn-Carney as Peter.Filming locations in Dunkirk include countries, cities, places like Dunkerque, Northern France, English counties like Hampshire, Dorset, Holland, US State California, USA.Overall Dunkirk is a brilliant war, action, drama, history film filled with war, action, drama, history, violence, shooting, soldiers in World War 2, ships, boats, air jets, sea, beaches, the will to survive and will, loyalty, team work, togetherness, a race against time, outstanding performances from all the actors involved, a good insight in to what the soldiers had to go through during World War 2 and many other things throughout the film.So I will give Dunkirk an overall rating of 4 out of 5 stars and Dunkirk is worth seeing if you like other war films like Saving Private Ryan, Enemy At The Gates, Empire Of The Sun, The Great Escape, The Dirty Dozen, Full Metal Jacket, Cross Of Iron, Schindler's List, The Thin Red Line amongst others.So if you get the chance to see Dunkirk in the cinema then you should go and see it sooner than later.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
The film that almost saved 2017 Cinema,"Listen, Christopher Nolan is a very talented director; most of his movies are good, some are rather great, but only one film he's made has really felt that it had a bow wrapped around it, and that was ""The Dark Knight"". Dunkirk fell the shortest of this achievement, while still being immaculately beautiful and a tremendous technical accomplishment.This is the biggest film shot on IMAX and 70mm, both, to ever be released. Dunkirk told a painstakingly true story of World War II, in a new way, with very little dialogue (and when there was any it was very plot heavy), little personality in characters, and contained feeble amount of emotional moments.Dunkirk just wasn't what I want out of any film. I appreciate going against conventions, many of my favorite directors and film are know to do that. But still, I seek a more emotional connection than this repetitive, near documentary style war film. It was kinda boring. Character, ethos, and anticipation are what mostly keeps me interested in a film. And for those things to be established, characters usually need to speak about something other than the plot.The cinematography while containing some stunning, and beautiful shots, was in all not overly brilliant. I was a big fan of the close ups, the ultra wides that just look beautiful on large format film!, and a few others scattered throughout. I've seen better dog fights. I served it's purpose. The color grading was amazing however! And the sound was stellar, honestly some of the best gunshot and bomb sounds effects I have ever heard. For all of these things is why this film gets a 7 instead of a 6.But where it counts, in the story, this film just does not fulfill my desires, nor my expectations for Nolan. Like Interstellar, there is still an empty hole in this film, something isn't quite tightly wound. It was a great undertaking of a film, and a new technical frontier for what is possible with large format, still when you compare this to another true story like Titanic, I can surely imagine that there could have been a more emotionally involved way of telling Dunkirk. When side by side, this is one of my least favorite Nolan films, ie. the Dark Knight, Inception, Interstellar, The Prestige, Batman Begins, Momento, heck I'm still debating it over Dark Knight Rises.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
An epic for the small screen?,"My short comment here might fly in the face of others; at least from what I've read on F'book. First I liked Hans Zimmer's soundtrack, and felt its volume (and drone power) were excellent. Also in (contrarian) hindsight, I would say wait and watch this on your small screen. Of course, with headphones that is.So many scenes herein stressed a sense of claustrophobia. Shot in dogfight cockpit battles, or caught up in the hell of water-bound hulls....even aboard the mighty Minnow, er I mean, Moonstone...that's tight quarters. Big faces don't necessarily mean the big screen for me.That being said, Mark Rylance was excellent by the way, and that's not just my AARP card talking. More of his level of noble honor in the most savage of situations would be welcome in fact and fiction.Took my boys and some friends to the film, one of whom is quite the WWII ""enthusiast"" (well there may be a better word than that, but I remember kids like that when I was young and there is a degree of enthusiasm that strikes me in hearing them discuss authenticity and strategies.) For folks like that of any age, well you've already seen this film. For others, perhaps wait on renting after this film gets its Oscar nomination but before it fails to win Best Picture?? Also a fun fact, apparently the Germans were the enemy. (Yes I'm sure it was Nolan's intent, but I haven't read yet why, and honestly I'm not all that interested in the rationale behind his choice.)",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

Unusual war film - no obvious central characters...,The story is the protagonist. There isn't really an obvious pivotal point - in terms of an individual character - around which the movie revolves - perhaps Tommy - the young soldier whom we see - desperately trying to stay alive and find his way to Britain.The story of the evacuation of Dunkirk is amazing in itself. Christopher Nolan's take on it - and the sheer desperation and fear that young soldiers feel - during a war - is simply amazing. I loved it.,,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

Great spectacle- underwritten story,"I am an enthusiastic amateur historian with a particular interest in World War Two. When I heard this film was being made I was both excited, and apprehensive. I was thrilled that one of the great military evacuations of history was coming to the screen, but worried about how the sheer scope of covering an exodus of around a third of a million troops, with the successful ending known, would be tackled.Early reviews praised the spectacle, but criticised the narrative.It is a very good looking film with plenty of panoramic sweeps giving it an epic feel. Director Christopher Nolan has produced a film with an authentic, defiant, heroic , tinge. Understandably, Nolan eschews trying to tell the whole story. There is no Goering, Rundstedt, Hitler, Churchill or Gort. Instead the story is told in three micro stories on the sea, land and air. This has advantages, and disadvantages.There is an intensity and visceral energy to the aerial dogfights, the plight of foot soldiers desperately trying to leave the beaches, only to find themselves torpedoed, and back on the beaches again, and hose manning the flotillas of small boats. However, those stories are vignettes, and not enough time is given to develop an emotional connection with the protagonists. The absence of input from the respective national and military leaders also fails to join the dots of individual heroism and tragedy.Thus the early praise and criticism is both justified. This is a fine looking film, spectacular, and compelling in its presentation. But the narrative, and characterisation, is weak, making it fall short as one of the great war films.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
A Stone Cold Masterpiece,"I'm not one of the biggest fans of Nolan, although I do like Memento (9/10) and loved TDK (10/10). I saw them both in theaters in 2000 and 2008, respectively. They have been my two favorites of his movies and I really do appreciate his artistry and talent in these movies. I'm just pointing this out to say I'm not a Nolanite who loves everything he does. For example, I wasn't a big fan of Interstellar, and I found Inception to only be good for a one time watch. Batman Begins was good, but although I liked TDKR, I found it flawed and a little overrated.However, here comes Dunkirk. I went into this with low to no expectations, and I recommend doing the same. While I heard rave reviews, I thought, ""Oh no, here go the critics again with their overrated reviews..."" since I also read some negative reviews from audience reviewers claiming it was ""only good, not great"". So, I really had lowered my expectations, leaning toward the audience reviews.Wow, this movie is awesome is all I can say. It is a visual masterpiece and in recent years, I have rarely been immersed in a movie the way I was with this. From the opening clip, it grips you immediately, and it rarely lets up.This is the real deal. Within the first 20-30 minutes I already loved it. I had to just hope it didn't slow up or weaken by the end because I already thought it was a masterpiece. At one point about halfway through, a thought ran through my head ""Nolan is a genius"".I don't know, maybe I'm just starving for a great summer movie, but I don't agree with any negative reviews of this film. it's almost perfect. The 90 minute edit down was much needed and I appreciate it as I have been asking Nolan to do that for years. I found Inception and TDKR could've been much better with better editing, shaving off at least a half hour if not more. Here, he does it so the whole movie is tight.Some people have (and it's easy to), complained about the lack of character development or script, but it doesn't matter because the battle is the script. It could have used a little bit more character development, and that's where my 1 point deduction comes off.If you are looking for a good movie that is ""an immersive experience"" that will grip you and barely let up, then I highly recommend Dunkirk. It's the best movie I've seen this year and one of the best war movies I've seen. This is one of the very few movies that I've seen in recent memory that I could say is worth the cost of a movie ticket.It made me want to immediately see it again. That's when you know it's good. This is what summer movies and blockbusters are all about.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Extraordinarily tense war film told through individual stories,"Although touched upon in some films in the past, the British-French evacuation of Dunkirk in 1940 as France neared total collapse at the hands of the Germany Army in WWII has never been given the kind of comprehensive and vivid treatment that Nolan's explosive war film does.This film fully captures the anxiety, desperation and seeming hopelessness that the British Army faced in its efforts to save its troops in France and prepare to defend their own soil as Hitler's armies defeated the French and overran the European mainland. It does so by giving the audience a close-up of the evacuation from as many vantage points as possible. These include the British troops trying to cross the English Channel (told from both masses and a small group) as well as civilians who used their own vessels to aid a depleted British Navy in rescuing the troops and from the air in which British spitfire pilots fought gallantly to protect British ships and troops from German aircraft and finally from the British high command desperately trying to pull off a miracle.In the air strike scenes, Nolan makes the screaming sound of a German dive bomber as menacing and tension-inducing as any director has done in recent memory. The tension is amplified to a raw crescendo by Hans Zimmer's brilliantly realized soundtrack. Equally impressive is the sense of dread created in individual troops trying to escape but facing one seemingly fatal catastrophe after another. As far as performances go, this isn't any one actor's film, though everyone is great with exceptional work by Fionn Whitehead, Harry Styles and Mark Rylance. Tom Hardy has a fairly important role though he spends most of the film muzzled by a fighter pilot mask. The film's achievement lies in creating a wide-ranging account of courage, sacrifice and perseverance in the face of almost-certain disaster. It doesn't offer much speechifying or jingoistic sentiments, just the hard-boiled realism of war.The story of a hardened and weary army trying to escape to defend its own shores might not resonate right away with audiences unfamiliar with the war, but this film is a lot more than just a mere depiction of history. It's also a master class in dramatic spectacle and the recreation of an epic tale of survival in a war that at that moment seemed likely to end very soon. Splendidly realized, it is not to be missed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

Masterpiece triptych,"Greetings again from the darkness. Even for us frequent movie-goers, a truly great film is a rare and emotional experience. Leave it to Christopher Nolan, one of the finest film makers working today, to deliver a World War II masterpiece centered on a remarkable and historic evacuation, rather than one of the epic battles that more directly led to an Allied victory. The result is a spectacular, stunning and relentlessly intense assault on our eyes, ears and emotions  it's a horrific thing of artistic beauty.Mr. Nolan chooses a triptych approach to tell the May/June 1940 Dunkirk story from three distinctly different perspectives: The Mole, The Sea, and The Air. The Mole (term for protective sea walls) is the ""by land"" segment, and it shows nearly 400,000 soldiers lined up on the beach – nervously waiting to be either rescued or massacred. The Sea puts us not on the deck of the Navy destroyers, but rather alongside the citizen volunteers who answered the call to ferry men off the beach with own pleasure vessels. The Air plops us inside the Spitfire cockpits of two Royal Air Force pilots battling low fuel as they attempt to protect their fellow soldiers below. This 3-part film harmony expertly captures the disorientation of war by shuffling between the three segments, and varying the timelines and sequence of each.This all happened pretty early in the war, as Winston Churchill had only become Prime Minister a few weeks prior. It should be noted that Mr. Nolan purposefully avoids the usual war room blustery (we see neither Churchill nor Hitler, and there is no mention of the infamous Halt Order) and allows the action to tell the story. Instead, his focus on the (very) young men being sent to battle makes a clear political statement on the absurdity of war. One of ""The Sea"" volunteers (an excellent Mark Rylance) delivers the message when he states it's the old men running the war, so he can't be expected to just sit back as young sons are sent to fight and die.Despite the epic look, feel and sound of the film and the massive scale of the event, this film is surprisingly at its best in the small moments of heroism and the dogged determination of individuals to survive. Minimal dialogue allows the horrors of war to take center screen. Danger and death are at every turn – bombings, torpedoes, drowning, gunfire, and most any imaginable peril is ever-present. We witness PTSD (shell-shock) in the form of Cillian Murphy's shivering rescued soldier, and are reminded that every young man present will be either dead or scarred for life. No one escapes war unscathed.The opening sequence finds young Fionn Whitehead and his squad being targeted with gunfire as German leaflets fall from the sky. The leaflets are maps outlining the hopelessness as German forces have them surrounded. The film is meticulously researched and historically based, though the few characters we get to know are fictionalized accounts. The practical effects throughout are breath-taking and much of it was filmed on location at the Dunkirk beach. There will likely be some complaints regarding the scarcity of female characters and those of color, but the technical aspects of the film are beyond reproach – although the French might have preferred their military receive a bit more attention. Hans Zimmer's score is unique and searing as it perfectly captures the intensity of the film. His use of a ticking watch only perpetuates the constant feeling of running out of time. Cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema and Editor Lee Smith prove why they are among the best at their profession.Given the spectacle of the action (if possible, see it in IMAX or 70mm), it's remarkable how we still manage to get to know some of the characters. From The Mole segment, Fionn Whitehead, Aneurin Barnard and Harry Styles represent the young soldiers, while Kenneth Branagh and James D'Arcy play officers. Tom Hardy and Jack Lowden are piloting the Spitfires, while Mark Rylance, Barry Keoghan, Tom Glynn-Carney, and Cillian Murphy are aboard the rescue yacht. Nolan regular and good luck charm Michael Caine can be recognized as the voice on Air Force radio. There is a 1958 film with the same title, and it stars John Mills and Richard Attenborough. The connection (other than the Dunkirk title) is Sir Attenborough's grandson Will appears in this current film.The horrors and impact of World War II continue to be an abundant garden – ripe for the picking when it comes to movies. Over the past 70 years there have been numerous approaches to telling part of the story that redefined the world: Judgment at Nuremberg (legal aftermath), Casablanca (romance), I Was a Male War Bride (comedy), Tora! Tora! Tora! and From Here to Eternity (Pearl Harbor), Shoah (documentary), Schindler's List and Son of Saul (holocaust), Downfall (Hitler), The Great Escape (entertainment), Patton (bio), The Pianist (personal), Saving Private Ryan (Normandy), Das Boot (U-boat), The Thin Red Line (Guadalcanal), and Letter From Iwo Jima (two opposing perspectives). Each of these, and many others, have their place in War movie history, and now Christopher Nolan's film belongs among the best.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Too perfect,"Fun fact, when Nolan said he'll make a virtual reality movie, but without the goggles, he wasn't kidding with Dunkirk, its too real.2D, 3D, or IMAX (highly recommend IMAX for this movie), you will feel like you are in the battlefield itself, this is a technical achievement, the sounds and visuals are so realistic you will feel you are in the movie itself. This is the most realistic war film ever.The movie is INTENSE, the sudden noises can scare you, the incoming danger of bombers will worry you, Chris Nolan captured the horrors of war so well, you will feel sad and bad for each soldier who dies, this film is a beautiful experience of the true horrors of war.Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy well done. Harry Styles, best debut ever, you will love him here, he can act. All the cast were superb, I mean everyone. Michael Caine cameo is also there, just his voice.The film does not have so much dialogues, but the story is told so well through cameras, sound, and actors' movement, which just increases the intensity. Its more of a survival film then war action like Saving Private Ryan (no comparison), but the action again is phenomenal. The film is also just under 2 hours, but because of pace, and uneasy yet amazing OST by Han Zimmer (his new top work), this will be the slow but amazing almost 2 hour film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

Dunkirk - Movie review,"In my opinion Christopher Nolan did it again with Dunkirk, this movie was realistic as hell. This movie is about the evacuation of 400.000 men during world war II and when I am saying that this movie it's about this event, it's about that, because this movie doesn't have specific characters to relate to or care about. All the characters in this movie are just soldiers trying to survive to this situation.Like I said in previous reviews, I'm a big fan of war films. And most of them are really good because they tell the story about soldiers trying to survive to horrible situations. Dunkirk is about this event in history, and just that.If you are looking for a film with realistic characters and people with families going into the war zone well Dunkirk will like you disappoint you because you are not going to get that.Well, let's move out to the filmmaking. This movie is recorded so well that when you are watching the movie makes you have this sense of discovery to how they make this. Nolan directed and wrote this movie, and you can see it. The direction and how the script works out it's beautiful, this is easily one of the best scripts of the entire year, and this movie doesn't have too much dialogue, which makes it even more powerful when we look back to the story. The way Nolan directed this film makes you be terrified by how the Germans are trying to kill this people. This movie it's not so violent, there is a lot of scenes were some people die, but you just listen the screams and the bombs exploiting around this people.This movie has a presence of fear and suspense during the entire run time, and this feel it's created thanks to the great sound editing and the incredible score composed by Hans Zimmer, this is the greatest score that I have listened in any war film ever.So guys, Dunkirk was even better that I expected.

"A visual masterpiece, but lacks humanity.","Dunkirk was a great movie, and a great war movie, but I don't think it was one of The Great War Movies.  The cinematography and the action were incredible, but it didn't have the emotional heft of something like Saving Private Ryan, The Hurt Locker, or Apocalypse Now.Dunkirk was fast paced and incredible tense, but the quick editing robbed the film of any moments to breathe and for characters to interact or form.  That isn't to say that the editing was bad.  On the contrary, it was a fresh take on a traditional WWII setting.  But I never knew any of the characters.  I didn't care what happened to them.  I felt like I was watching pieces in a bombastic game of chess instead of a real human struggle.  Besides mild stress and pure awe at some of the set-piece moments, I didn't feel much of anything. Overall, I'd say the movie is a masterpiece in the sense of what can be put on film, and I'd absolutely recommend that you see it in IMAX.  It's a visual treat!  But I do not think it has the staying power of other, more human war films.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Slam-DUNK!,"Ingeniously applying his cerebral skill-set to the mechanics of historical war dramas and factual portraitures — Nolan unleashes a meticulously crafted, suffocatingly suspenseful survival epic that bears his patented structural spin on its dirt-covered sleeve. He doesn't follow a set template but creates his own — radically cross-cutting between perspectives of variable time-frames, the narrative unravels simultaneously on land, water and in air, before converging in a breathtakingly volatile finale. The audacious split-narrative works brilliantly and possesses the urgency that would've otherwise been lost to a more conventional approach, instead we get 100 mins of sustained panic-inducing climax which is further intensified by Hans Zimmer's pulsating score resembling a ticking clock and surging tide.Nolan isn't really concerned with telling a story, preferring to create an experience - and a supremely immersive one at that! Devoid of didactic monologues and cheap sentimentality, thrusting us headlong onto the Dunkirk sands we're given a glimpse into the crack of rifle-fire, the maelstrom of war, the frenzy of fear, the distinctive wailing siren of the Stukas, the muffled screaming of drowning men or the shell-shocked groans of the ones that temporarily made it. The exclusively Brit ensemble (featuring the likes of Tom Hardy, Mark Rylance, Kenneth Branagh, Cillian Murphy etc) is uniformly excellent with a particularly impressive turn from newcomer Fionn Whitehead. Technically, DUNKIRK is as much a visual feast as aural bliss. Hoyte Van Hoytema's evocative lensing lends stylistic harmony to the proceedings through careful juxtaposition of nerve-wracking air-combat sequences, chaotic underwater stretches with the panoramic paranoia of the war-torn beach, propelled further by bone shattering sound design and some crisp editing.Ultimately, DUNKIRK is a masterwork of understated terror grounded in brutal reality and in the very best tradition of great (spectacle) cinema — packs the power to transport the audiences into the very heart of the action, especially when experienced on the all-encompassing IMAX screen.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
a special effects spectacular based on Dunkirk history,"As the movie world erupts in loud applause for Dunkirk (2017) there is a serious question being overlooked. A defining characteristic of historical drama is that it leaves us with a better understanding of history. If a viewer knew nothing of the history of Dunkirk would this film make sense? In other words, does this film have a coherent narrative that explains what happened or is it a digital effects spectacular?Dunkirk depicts three dramatised military scenarios that unfold in the air, on the ground, and at sea. Viewers must draw on prior knowledge to make sense of why 400,000 mostly British troops became trapped on a French coastline surrounded by German forces and facing imminent annihilation. The only hope to save what Churchill had called ""the whole root and core and brain of the British Army"" was to evacuate the troops across the English Channel. From fragments of talk between officers we gather that British Forces were unable to provide effective air support and troop-carrying vessels, so a hastily arranged flotilla of 800 British fishing boats and pleasure craft are sailing towards Dunkirk to save whoever they can carry. The action shifts frequently between parallel and sequential timeframes: in one scene, the camera is running along a beach, the next flying in a Spitfire sortie, then on top of or under a sinking ship. There are no prominent protagonists or antagonists, just archetypes of military and civilian personnel, both heroic and not. We follow a couple of young soldiers fleeing for their lives while enemy bombings and gunfire tear into their comrades. We meet a British civilian skipper who has answered the evacuation call and follow his journey across the channel to rescue soldiers from bombed ships and downed planes. We share the cockpit of a lone British fighter pilot as he fires on enemy planes to stop them bombing British troops on the beaches and on vessels, all while knowing that he is running out of fuel.What happens in each of the film's fictional scenarios is not the point: it is the totality of chaos and the scale of relentless carnage that assaults audience senses. When seen in high resolution 70mm film the spectacle is overwhelming. The booming soundtrack is repetitive and manipulative; constant percussive pulses and orchestral strings designed for only one purpose: to increase audience heart-rate. The dialogue is minimalist and voice recording quality in several scenes is poor but the action is all that matters. The scale of the combat scenes is massive and there are numerous scenes where the viewer will be disorientated, not knowing the good guys from the bad. But this is a pale imitation of what it must feel like in the chaos of battle.This is hardly entertainment. If the director's intention is to numb viewer's senses with a 106- minute glimpse of hell then this film is a success. If it is to tell the story of Dunkirk, it just does not have the narrative framework to explain how and why one of the world's biggest military disasters even happened. If it is to commemorate the Battle of Dunkirk, then turning the story into a massive digital effects spectacle makes a limited contribution to our collective memory of what has been described as the crucial turning point of World War II. Where it fails to illuminate Dunkirk history it makes up for as an immersive masterpiece of spectacle.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Soul destroyingly awful.,"Nolan has done it again. Building suspense with heart pumping music only for nothing to happen. It happens time after time after time. I was very excited about seeing it because the trailer looked unreal, but the actual film was a disaster, made worse by soulless actors who just there for the payday.To think there were 400,000 troops on the beaches of Dunkirk, only for Nolan to have a few hundred on the actual set, that to me is just sheer lazy directing. I understand it would be a struggle to have nearly 400,000 extras on set, but surely nowadays it can't be that hard to digitally add them to the film.Poor from start to finish.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"Suspense-filled Thriller With Only 2,940 Spoken Words","Dunkirk, in short: The story of when British, Belgium and French soldiers were trapped, surrounded, and all but abandoned by their government in a small French village. The call goes out to all civilian boats: bring our boys home.Dunkirk, in my words: Propaganda leaflets are dropped from the sky by the Nazi Luftwaffe. A British soldier picks up a few, with the intention of using them as toilet paper. The notice reads, ""We have you surrounded"", then the bullets fly. So begins Christopher Nolan's latest film about the ""colossal military disaster"" that became an inspiration to an already frightened population less than one year into WWII. The soldiers are ordered to retreat to the coast and await their ride home. Thousands of men standing-by on a beach in Dunkirk, France. They can nearly see home - across the English Channel - from where they are positioned, out in the open, ""like fish in a barrel"" for the circling enemy planes. The Germans are closing in fast on their position. There is no fleet of battleships and frigates on the way to evacuate them, only a flotilla of patriotic civilians with their fishing boats and pleasure crafts; unarmed but fearless.Things you'll LIKE about Dunkirk: 1) It is awesome. When it starts, it doesn't stop until the credits role. The story moves very quickly and is seamless. The music is suspenseful, building, and intense and works to keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the 106-minute running time. The aerial photography is nothing short of spectacular as it closely captures RAF pilot Farrier (Tom Hardy) during his mission. 2) There is very little spoken dialogue but there's a lot of action and the story is shown from three key perspectives. The script I read had 23 pages of dialogue. 2,940 spoken words to be exact (I counted them myself). The entire script has 15,325 words in total, including described action scenes and screen direction. It works, and it works well.Things you'll DISLIKE about Dunkirk: 1) This easily could have been a longer film, but it's not. As it is now, it's one of the shorter Christopher Nolan efforts at 106 minutes. Following (1998) is 69 minutes, Memento (2000) is 113 minutes. Dunkirk could have added another 15 minutes to the running time without changing the flow. 2) Guys, you may not like the One Direction dude (Harry Styles plays Alex) in this. However, you can take solace in knowing that he can act!",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"A technical masterpiece, Empty at emotional core","Dunkirk and Saving private Ryan both movies are based in WWll but there is a huge difference. On one hand Saving private Ryan relies on human emotions and depth, Dunkirk relies on visuals and effects. Which is definitely a bad thing for a war drama where film lacks the emotional depth which should be generated after watching a war movie ( like in Schindler's list, SPR).Dunkirk, almost as War for the Planet of the Apes, plays out without much dialogue, leaning on just the background score and effects in most scenes. It almost goes without saying that Hans Zimmer delivers with another incredible score. The sound design is also extremely well crafted. The sound of planes passing above, the gunfire, and the explosions all contribute to a compelling thriller like situation, almost similar to Saving Private Ryan.The cinematography is great. The effects in this film are breathtaking. The casting, authenticity, WWII vehicles are on spot. The best part about movie was the minimal use of CGI, which are the dominating part of action in the movies these days.While the characters in this film aren't that interesting, Harry Styles, is excellent at his debut. Mark Rylance, Kenneth Branagh, and Fionn Whitehead also all give standout performances despite the limited screen time they are given.  The only character in the movie which I cared for was Mark Rylance's.The concept of three parts coming together, the beach, the sea, and the air is an interesting idea.I should love this film. Historical drama? Compelling story? WWII setting? One of my favorite director ? Amazing cinematography? Mind blowing sound? Superb performances from an ensemble cast? All of these elements made me sure I would love this going in. But, Dunkirk's lack of emotional connection.If I reviewed this based on technical achievement.. it's a 5 star rated movie. But it lacks the emotional depth and it had nothing extra ordinary to take home. I simply can not put this in the list with Saving private Ryan and Schindler's list.At the risk of sounding like a person.. trying to take a different stand, I did not love this film. Do I love elements of this? Yes. Is this a 5-star movie? Definitely and Unfortunately, no.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Dunkirk,"This movie is great! For someone who is currently serving in the Military, i love the idea of military like movies and this movie sets a scene for anyone who wondered what its like going to war or battle.

All war films should aim for such intensity,"I am a Chris Nolan fan as his movies are always, gripping, far reaching and personal. This was no exception. An instant classic, absolutely absorbing and superb, riddled with plenty of suspenseful moments, multiple aspects, multiple stories and multiple times lines all connecting and impacting in a great tale of historical significance.

Good but far from the greatest,"Dunkirk is just over 150 kilometers from where I live. After watching the movie I would surely one day go visit the place, after all it is where the history was re-written by the brave attempts of hundreds of small boat owners to save 300,000 men trapped by enemies. Coming back to the movie, it is a visual and audio feast limited by character development and compelling script. Though far from qualities of the longest day or saving private Ryan, this is still a very watchable movie to be must seen at theaters at big screens. I wish Christopher Nolan has put some more focus on the character development and elaborate story telling, after all he had some of the best contemporary actors and second WW as background.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Dunkirk for Millennials,"In screen writing, a shot is an image captured by the camera. A scene is a meaningful dramatic movement within the story. A sequence is a collection of scenes with a unified dramatic purpose, usually between 10 to 20 minutes long. Millennials like their shots and scenes fast like the commercials that show images for a couple hundred milliseconds maximum, and Christopher Nolan made this movie just for them. There is no classic character or story development; it seems to be just a collection of quick scenes cut and mingled from what should be different sequences. I doubt there is a proper sequence in it. Nolan described it as ""his most experimental film,"" and that truly is what this movie is, but I give it a 7 for technical work.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

Dunkirk movie review- Stylish (no pun intended),"To this day, people do not know why Adolf Hitler allowed the Dunkirk evacuation to happen. He has the entire British army pinned on a beach. He had them surrounded, and the Luftwaffe had air superiority in the sky. The U-boats made life hell in the seas, and the British were considering a conditional surrender at that point. But he stopped his advance, he let the British army escape, and the rest we know is history.""We shall go on to the end. We shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be. We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender."" - Winston Churchill, after the Dunkirk evacuationHistory notwithstanding, Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk is not a war movie in the traditional sense. There are no sweeping armies, grand strategy at play, rousing speeches, intense drama or fierce combat. Instead, it establishes 3 interlinked perspectives, one each an exposition of the 3 essential asks of a soldier at war- resolve, courage and the will to survive.Mark Rylance leads the first theme, where he demonstrates impeccable resolve against the odds to do his bit in the civilian action in the evacuation. Tom Hardy is the courageous Spitfire pilot who selflessly tries to offer protection from the skies, even at the cost of his own freedom. Harry Styles leads a group of soldiers who are, well, just trying to survive. All the three threads play across different periods, in different theaters (land, sea, air) but all converge to one fateful moment.A good war movie is one that makes you hate war itself. Unlike traditional war epics which tries to do that by establishing good and evil sides, Dunkirk tries to achieve that by focusing on realism- the harrowing experience of the combatants. Dunkirk eschews dialogue in favor of visuals- George c scott's opening salvo in Patton might be longer than the entire script of Dunkirk. But Nolan's signature take is all encompassing here- an ominous score by Hans Zimmer engulfs the senses, wide 360-degree shots highlight expanse and impact, IMAX shooting tech makes you feel as if you are a part of the movie, and a mix of stalwarts and fresh faced actors bring in both innocence and class. In a way Dunkirk plays like an atmospheric horror movie. At the same time, the central theme that Nolan has explored in his Batman trilogy is touched upon here too- how do humans react in times of chaos.Is Dunkirk the best film of the year so far? Maybe for die-hard Nolan fans who like his ""different"" take on the war movie genre. But somehow it did not click for me the way I thought it would. Maybe because the movie ended just when it was getting engrossing. Maybe it was a bit too economical- run time, script, settings. Maybe because in India we just cannot experience IMAX tech in all its glory. Maybe because I prefer traditional war epics with dialogues and punch lines.Maybe because 19 years on, I am still not over Saving Private Ryan.Let that assessment take anything away from the immersive cinematic experience that Dunkirk is. Just don't look at it as a war movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"Excellent survival scenes, but nothing more","This movie is a technical triumph, you feel the soldiers' fight for survival as if you were there yourself. Trying to get out of downed plane, escaping a sinking ship, etc. The music with it's time ticking, edge of your seat sounds together with the pictures gives a repetitive feeling. Every scene sounds like a nerve-wrecking, pulse-pounding climax. The problem for me is that there is no coherent story and you don't really get to know the main characters. Maybe I was disappointed because I read all these excellent reviews, if not I might have given this 7 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Bleak and hopeless.,"If you enjoyed the last twenty minutes of Titanic, then this film is for you. If you liked the bleak vision of humanity that Christopher Nolan portrayed in The Dark Knight Rises, you might like the atmosphere of this film. If you want a generic war-is-hell and survival is matter of chance film, you may well appreciate this.If you remember Dunkirk as a victory snatched from the jaws of defeat; as a near-miracle when for a full day a storm grounded the German air force in Flankers while the Channel was as calm as a millpond; as a day when sixty German planes attacked four hundred men on the beach and inflicted no casualties; as a time when men were buried hastily but with military honours rather than being allowed to lie dead on the beach; then this film does a huge disservice to the truth.Finally a note on accuracy. The film may look right but it is missing almost any detail that might bring hope into the situation. The images may be accurate; the atmosphere is more appropriate for a film about a concentration camp.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

A very special war movie indeed,"Beautifully shot and crafted the desperation of being on the losing end of a full military retreat. Out of hopelessness comes salvation. The multiple different story threads intertwine and are often partially repeated from different perspectives, the big acts of heroism from individuals and the little people combined is quite uplifting and moving to watch. The movie almost reminds me (in mood and design) of those 1960s, 1970s and 1980s movies .. Waterloo, Battle of Britain, Barry Lyndon .. sort of slightly detached.

Dunkirk - True warfare,"I left Dunkirk feeling an unusual sense of sadness. There is, at least for me, a tendency to become very desensitised to war films after you watch so many and yet Dunkirk has knocked me out of the park with it's magnificent beach-bound atmosphere. Every bullet is real and threatening, the sound of metal on metal as they hit various materials is a shock without fail. A plane flying overhead is a death machine swooping down to take you away. Dunkirk is a portrait of fear and goodness me is it hard to look away.See this on a big screen with the best sound near you, relax as best you can and let Nolan's masterpiece take you back in time to a moment of mankind's brutality that should never be forgotten.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
A masterpiece of our generation.,"War is not something we should celebrate. It brings out the worst in humans. Dunkirk shows us a small part of war where humans were pushed to the absolute maximum and it was something which changed people for the rest of their lives.When watching a war movie, most of us have a ""expectation"" of how a movie should be. We expect lots of shooting, lots of man to man combat and lots of gore. But with Dunkirk this is different.This movie is such a masterpiece in a way it tells the story of war very differently. It looks to tell the feelings of a person less by dialogues and more by pure emotion. The way the movie is set up, there is nothing but pure tension all throughout the 100 or so minutes of its play time.Also, a special kudos for the brilliant score for this movie. I'd go as far as saying that 50% of the movie was really carried by the score. Some of the scores that start slow and rise slowly to its full tempo and volume really add to the whole mood of the film. This is arguably one of the best scores Hans Zimmer has done till date.Not only the score, but the sound of Spitfires and explosions at various points of the film feel different than most movies of the past. The muffled sounds of explosion in different scenes really hit hard.This movie is really best enjoyed on the big screen. It just wouldn't be the same on the small screen and wouldn't be as immersive.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
A love letter to the UK,"Nolan is a master of his craft. He really flexes his thematic muscles on every project. Amazing imagery and always has an impressive nack for telling a story. Stunning cinematography and A+ acting, easily one of the most intense movies I've ever seen. The more I recount it tho the more I am sure it was a love letter to the UK, which is a pretty charming sentiment. It seemed like a showcase of Brit grit in the face of overwhelming odds. Honestly at some points I felt I was watching a visual representation of a history textbook. Not really what I was hoping for but immensely entertaining. A very vague plot if one at all, just a series of truly jaw dropping events and character reaction. But maybe that's the point? Colorful examples of bravery and cowardice in the face of monumental situations; with unfortunately predictable reactions. But what are we to expect from a director who has mastered the alternative mind-bending fiction which has won our hearts for years? A director who's toes are just barely wet in the ocean of nonfiction narrative? He dives full confidence into the alien realm and newcomer Nolan scores an 8/10. A noble mark for my favorite filmmaker, credited with creating some of the best fiction ever written and displayed.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"Good, but overrated","""Dunkirk"" is not a bad film, but it does not at all deserve the lavish praise that has been bestowed upon it by critics. Its chief problem is that it has no truly strong characters. Now, some people have said that this is a result of the nonlinear narrative, and they're wrong. The problem, rather, is simply inadequate character writing on Nolan's part. The narrative structure is arguably a strength, as it truly does cause us to feel – for a short while – the silliness and arbitrariness of war. The film's lack of strong character development, however, unsurprisingly becomes a more glaring fault as the film unfolds. Its best scenes are mostly in the last third, though the speech sequence at the very end is overly preachy and heavy-handed.""Dunkirk"", ultimately, is an example of how realism to a film's subject does not make that film a masterpiece. Depth is needed; excellent characters are needed. I truly suspect that if you were to show any reasonably good film critic the first 40-50 minutes of this film and not tell them that Christopher Nolan directed it, they would likely see little difference between it and most blockbusters that they are forced to review every summer. Yes, Zimmer's score is strong, and there are moments of excellent camera-work. Nevertheless, the fact that this film is actually being lauded by not only audiences but even a fair number of critics as one of the greatest war films ever made makes me somewhat concerned about the future of film criticism in the United States. What makes ""Dunkirk"" as significant a work of art as ""All Quiet on the Western Front"", ""Paths of Glory"", or ""Apocalypse Now""? Nothing, because it is nowhere near those films artistically and intellectually.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
No more than a good TV historical drama,"Is this a scam, or has the capacity to be critical been lost due to the very sensitive and emotional subject of the film. For me, it seems like a joke... How could this momentous and dramatic event in our recent history be presented with so little means and ambition ? From books and historical reports, the boarding was a mess, planes were all over the sky, there were myriads of boats and ships, the beach were left with tons of discarded equipment and weapons... We see none of that. How can you give an idea of what it must have been with only a few sparking clean vintage planes, one small war ship, 12 period fishing or leisure boats... How could so many shots taken on site incorporate 1960's, 70's or even 80's buildings, street furniture, modern container cranes... How can it be night for the scenes at sea, and day for what happens on the beach, in Dover, or in the air at the same time ? How long can a spitfire fly after it has run out of petrol, and still manage to fight... For those who like history, it is a waste of time. For those who like action and war scenes, it can be watched but will be a disappointment For those who seek emotions and a peek at humans behaviour during the event, there is reasonably good acting, in a good British drama tradition. I suggest to wait for one year and watch it on TV where this show belongs.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

Quite possibly Nolan's masterpiece,"Only days after its cinema opening it has already become fashionable to knock Christopher Nolan's magnificent ""Dunkirk"" as if Nolan's past success was tantamount to some kind of blot in his present copybook or did the films naysayers simply expect more? I admit a bit of CGI might have helped the films scale; there seemed to me a paucity of both men and boats but for once scale isn't the raison d'etre for Nolan's film. Clocking in at under two hours and eschewing stars in favour of a handful of decent actors Nolan homes in, not on the epic, but on the small.At the beginning of the film titles tell us that we are actually seeing three different time-spans running concurrently; a week at the Mole, (Dunkirk itself), a day on the sea and an hour in the air and thanks to some brilliant editing we experience events on the beaches, in one small pleasure cruiser and in an air battle simultaneously. This is no ""The Longest Day"" but something altogether more intimate. If the action sequences are on a relatively small scale for a war picture of this size, the suspense and the fear they generate are epic and Nolan ensures that every dogfight and burning vessel looks damn real. Here is a war film that has a ring of truth to it and I found it deeply moving.The cast may seem large but by using talented players who can actually act, the characters he concentrates on come vividly to life. Newcomer Fionn Whitehead is excellent as the young soldier we are first introduced to at the beginning of the film and follow through to the very end while Mark Rylance has no trouble stealing every scene he's in as the civilian determined to make it to the beaches and back again. If Kenneth Branagh and Tom Hardy seem more like guest stars, they too create credible characters with whom we can identify while technically the film cannot be faulted; this is a film that can safely expect a slew of Oscars next year. It's also the film most likely to pick up the coveted Best Picture prize. Nolan has finally proved he is a lot more than the sum of his parts.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

"Wonderful movie, and very poignant if you understand WW2","This is the best, and most thought provoking war movie I have seen for a long time....yes Saving private Ryan was great, but it still couldn't extract itself from that 'America won the War' attitude that underlies most Hollywood produced movies. This film however shows a real understanding of what it was like to be at the sharp end of WW2, when the UK as an island nation were stretched far too thinly trying to defend itself and its allies. The acting performances are understated, but excellent at the same time...none are likely to get Academy nominations, but each played their part in portraying the full gambit of emotions that were taking place during that particular low point of the hostilities. I sat in a cinema with many teenagers surrounding me, and found myself hoping that they understood what was being shown to them and that they appreciated the sacrifices that were made on their behalf. Having scanned many of the other reviews it is interesting that many detractors seem to prefer that Hollywood approach to WW2, and appear to have no comprehension of the reality of the early 1940's ..... this is a sad fact, and whilst its not great to dwell on the past it is important to understand it. Well done Christopher Nolan and all the cast - definitely a must see movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
This is what filmmaking is about,"I think most movie fans were excited for this film. I know i was very excited, but then again Christopher Nolan is absolutely one of my favorite directors. Right up there with Scoresese and Spielberg. So naturally ""Dunkirk"" was one of my most anticipated movies of the year.I have rarely seen a film this thrilling and intense. ""Dunkirk"" never gives you a moment to relax. It puts you right in the middle of the action and it works. ""Dunkirk"" is filmmaking at It's finest. Instead of CGI Nolan uses real destroyers and real spitfires. This makes for one of the most realistic war films you will find and this without all the gore and flying limbs you're used to in war films. The score by Hans Zimmer is one of the most important aspects of the film it get's your heart pumping during the non-stop action and in that respect is one of, If not the best film scores of the year. As for the performances those are great as well although we don't really learn that much about the characters. The different characters in the film don't have big emotional arcs. Perhaps some will consider this a big flaw, but for this film it works. In that way It's more realistic. In a situation this intense you wouldn't have the time to tell about the wife waiting for you at home. A scene like that is left out and i never for a second I missed it.

"Enemy: flat & one dimensional characters, Winner: cinematography","As for the 'critical praise' goes, I understand Nolan tried to capture here a macro point of view of the historic event/evacuation story of Dunkirk but it turned out another disappointment (after Interstellar)! Thing is most of the epic & classic war movies comes with an individual or a set of characters, backed up by a rich screenplay that eventually made us started to care for them while we witnessed the horror of war to gradually unfold with a graceful touch of heart or humanity at some point in the story. In Nolan's Dunkirk, the single character development was minor issue with mere importance, as I guess he was more interested to depict the event as a ""character"" itself that's facing a struggle to survive in one of the most awfully cornered situations in the history of world wars for an allied force. Most of the ""major characters"" were either desperately trying to escape or determined to follow the course of their duties without much portraying emotional aspects of their convictions. Frustrating part is, after all these years it was a great opportunity (missed!) for a film maker like Nolan to really make a remarkably true epic war movie based on such an intriguing war event like Dunkirk...started from the point of Nazi war plan to skillfully corner the Brit & French allied force and their historic rescues at the end! I understand that not every war movie needs to be character driven with great cast like PATTON, BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN or SCHINDLER'S LIST and there was even war film made in such approach where they remarkably portrayed an horrifying event of war without much focusing a set of characters i.e. COME AND SEE (one of the best war movies ever made, IMO) but Dunkirk sadly failed to left any sort of moving impression on me as a viewer.Though the presence was there but directly (with characters) there wasn't much portrayal of German enemy side in Dunkirk. The irony is actually the 'real enemy' were flat & one dimensional characters and the only real winner in this movie was cinematography, stunning!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

Nolan's Latest is His Greatest,"Viewed in IMAX 70MM.Dunkirk arrives with a bang, further solidifying writer-director Christopher Nolan as one of the best filmmakers working today. Nolan presents the tense World War II thriller as a triptych, detailing the evacuation of Dunkirk from the perspectives of land, sea, and air. Perhaps the film's most astounding achievement is that we never see the Germans. The film's focus remains entirely on the evacuating Allied soldiers and those sent to support their efforts. By never showing the Germans on screen, Nolan presents them as a looming specter over the Allied forces, an invisible presence that can surprise them at every turn. This only adds another level of tension to a film that manages to sustain a taut, uneasy atmosphere for nearly its entire runtime. Nolan's main concern lies with answering the question of whether or not these soldiers will manage to escape. As such, we never once are transported to a war room to watch military leaders quarrel about what the next move should be. Instead, we follow three distinct groups: soldiers that include newcomer Fionn Whitehead's Tommy, a couple of RAF pilots led by Tom Hardy's Farrier, and a small boat crew led by Mark Rylance's Mr. Dawson.I got the opportunity to see Dunkirk in IMAX 70mm and I only wish more people could as well. The enormous screen and earth-rattling sound place you right in the center of the action to potent effect. Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema again teams up with Nolan after previously collaborating on Interstellar to awe-inspiring results. Around 90% of the film makes full usage of the towering screen, with only a few sequences presented in a more traditional letterboxed style. Nolan and Hoytema use the larger frame to their advantage, crafting spell- binding shots at every junction, whether it be a close-up shot of a pilot's face or the sweeping image of thousands of soldiers waiting on a beach. Dunkirk demands to be seen on the largest screen possible.The film also marks the sixth collaboration between Nolan and composer Hans Zimmer. The explosive, ever-present score from Zimmer serves as the model accompaniment for the film, the stirring urgency of the music matched effortlessly with the harrowing images of war and escape. Another Oscar nomination for Zimmer would not be a surprise. But the way that the score mixes with the sounds of the battlefield is an achievement in its own right. Explosions boom and gunshots ring, fighter planes and bullets whizzing by. But through all the chaos, all the madness, Zimmer's score serves as a ticking stopwatch, counting down the minutes as the palpable threat from the Germans grows.Despite the relative simplicity of its storyline, Dunkirk is perhaps Nolan's most experimental feature. His three stages of war all unfold over various time frames, which are interwoven by Lee Smith's masterful editing, creating a non-linear narrative that astounds with both its sweeping scope and intimate, poignant emotional beats. The sparse use of dialogue also stands out. Nolan revels in visual storytelling, employing dialogue only when necessary, with the soldiers communicating their fears through their actions rather than through conversation. Admittedly, the characters that populate the world of Dunkirk are not the most developed, but they are all defined by their desire to make it back home. They are all tethered by this longing, and we can feel their mutual trepidation and hope as they struggle to find a way out of Dunkirk.Unconventionally, the majority of the soldiers of Nolan's film are not heroic figures, especially those on land. The event that Nolan uses as the basis for his film is historic not because it marked a major victory for Allied forces, but because the British suffered an ignominious rout. As such, some of these men are terrified for their lives, while others, knowing very well that any moment could be their last, subsist solely on their love of country. Every actor across the board, from established British stars like Kenneth Branagh to newcomers like Whitehead expertly bring their characters to life. Whitehead and Harry Styles both deliver great performances as two inexperienced soldiers determined to survive. Meanwhile, in the air, Hardy simply dominates the screen, his steely gaze working wonders as a substitute for conventional dialogue. The film's best performance belongs to the magnificently understated Rylance, who delivers a heroic performance as a sailor who navigates his yacht towards Dunkirk to save lives, despite the danger that awaits.This danger manifests itself in a manifold of ways. A soldier stranded at sea remarks that he is the lone survivor of a U-boat attack. Farrier and his fellow pilots engage German fighters over the Channel. In a haunting opening sequence, Tommy runs desperately through the streets of Dunkirk, evading enemy fire. The film's action sequences benefit from Nolan's skillful direction, and the aerial dogfights, in particular, stand out amongst the rest. Hoytema's camera captures the proceedings with such precision that it puts the action in most Hollywood blockbusters to shame. While his camera hardly ever lingers on the carnage of war, Hoytema knows when to draw out the tension, creating sequences that left me breathless.With his latest, Nolan delivers another masterpiece that might just be his best film yet. It works as a demonstration of bravery, a celebration of courage, and an acknowledgment of fear in the face of adversity. While not my favorite Nolan flick , Dunkirk delivers a cinematic experience unlike anything I've ever seen. The way Nolan so adeptly sustains the tension throughout is simply mesmerizing and a testament to his directorial prowess. Packed with stunning IMAX camera-work from Hoytema, some of Zimmer's best work to date, a talented cast giving it their all, and an underlying message that underscores the need for hope, Dunkirk is a rousing spectacle from a director at the top of his game, and the best film of 2017 thus far.Rating: 10/10 (Masterpiece)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

"Christopher Nolan reaches yet another new high with this brilliant movie,","In a movie that entirely engulfs you it's rather unusual that the acting performances are almost unimportant.  Yes, Mark Rylance, as ever, puts no foot wrong but this is not a movie about acting. This is a movie about visceral experience.This is a movie about paying double the price to experience it in an iMax.  Pay it man.Christopher Nolan does not do anything less than 8.0 IMDb movies.  His class is overwhelming.  Interstellar blew me away with its imagination but this is a step up even again.And one of the reasons for that is his relationship with Hams Zimmer.  This movie's extraordaryness starts with the music which feeds off the utterly spectacular sound design by ( Help me I can't find it on IMDb) xxx.You are overwhelmed by the sound from frame 1.  Remember Saving Private Ryan?  Remember how you winced in your cinema seat.  That was the sound.  Now square that.  Hell, no.  Cube it.Now, think how Saving Private Ryan Looked.  Think about how you squirmed in your seat.  Cube that too.Now, think how after the first 20 minutes (if we are all honest her) it got a bit dull.THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN WITH CHRISTOPHER NOLAN.Christopher Nolan is the gift that just keeps giving.This movie gives and gives and then gives a little more.Costume, photography, sound, SFX (not much in CGI if anything) are all awesome.This is an actual masterpiece.I think it will min multiple Oscars, including best movie and director, with the rare distinction of no acting medals. (I hereby predict 10 Oscars.)It's a straight 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Subtlety In The Most Intense Of Moments,"Christopher Nolan's latest film is a true spectacle that needs to be seen in the largest theater. For what it lacks in memorable characters it makes up in intense action filled moments. All of which is held up by Hans Zimmers score which has it's foot set in the spectacle by having a consistently tense filled but subtle tick that pushes the story forward, connecting different moments into a outline of the event the film is based off of.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Just go watch it ! Nolan has returned to form !,"No need to elaborate more on that ! This movie is basically marketing itself. I'll just say that it's just simply a no-nonsense war movie. No clever expositional dialogue, no beautiful protagonists, no elaborate plot. Just 400,000 Allied soldiers surrounded by Nazi forces on the shore of the French town of Dunkirk, trying to escape. By any means means necessary; and all the brutal realities of war that accompany it. Just a gritty narrative played out onto the screen masterfully, supported by a bone-chilling score from Hans Zimmer. Will keep you hooked till the very end.Yes, there are 3 different perspectives, yes their timelines are intertwined and jumbled a bit. But, that's the 'Nolan' touch which makes it even more watchable.Just go watch it !",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Interesting approach but hard to sit through,"Dunkirk was a disappointment and is easily Christopher Nolan's weakest movie to date. There were many issues I had with that movie: confusing overlapping story lines, exchangeable characters without any depth, mostly faceless acting performances, a constantly numbing, overtly dramatic and repetitive soundtrack and lots of headache-inducing shaky camera passages, even in parts of the movie when nobody is getting attacked. Those who call this movie one of the greatest war movies of all times clearly haven't watched many films of that kind. Over the past twenty years, films such as Saving Private Ryan, The Pianist, Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War, My Way and Battle for Incheon: Operation Chromite all had intriguing characters, gripping tension, memorable scenes, moving soundtracks and spectacular special effects. Before you voice your opinion about Dunkirk or any of its reviews, you should be familiar with movies like these.However, there were still a few elements that I liked about Dunkirk that made the movie entertaining and overall slightly above average. First of all, the storytelling is an interesting experiment, as it follows the Dunkirk evacuation from three perspectives: land, sea and air. The land perspective is the most gripping one and follows the epic odyssey of a young British Private. The sea perspective has its strengths when a tragic accident happens on the boat of a courageous civilian who wants to support the Royal Navy but the characters could have been a little bit more fleshed out. The air perspective is the weakest one in my book despite an epic finale because the fight sequences always exactly look the same and it's at times hard to follow what happened to whose plane. A strong element of the movie is its historic accuracy despite a few fictionalized characters here and there. The settings look authentic and especially the uniforms and planes look realistic. It must also be added that stories about the war shall not be forgotten as history tends to repeat itself and as it's important to honour those who fought for the freedom of the future generations.In the end, Dunkirk has its merits and doesn't go the easy way with heroic characters, stunning special effects and traditional plots. However, the numerous overlapping plots are at times confusing, the characters are mostly redundant and the omnipresent score doesn't add to the movie as it was intended by the makers. If you are interested in the Second World War and have watched numerous war movies already, you might be interested in giving Dunkirk a shot as well. However, if you are less familiar with war movies, you might easily get bored with this film and should watch the movies I have mentioned in my introduction first.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"The technique in this movie is astounding. The story, and the history, not so much.","The most astounding thing in this movie, for me, was the cinematography. It is eye-poppingly riveting, and often very beautiful. From the early scene where we suddenly see the beaches of Dunkirk spread out before us against the brilliant blue of the sea, through many following scenes, the color and the framing of many of the scenes is truly remarkable. The cameraman clearly has a painter's eye.The action photography is also often remarkable. The filming of the dogfights, with constantly tilting cameras, gave you some idea of what it must have been like to be in those fighter planes.The various stories - on the pier, in the skies, on the small British pleasure yacht, on the sinking trawler, etc. - were sometimes juxtaposed to great effect, each one heightening the effect of the preceding one.The music - and use of sound - in the movie was also dead on, heightening the tension over and over.In short, this movie held me glued to my seat almost from the get-go.But that did not keep me from seeing the problems.The first is a matter of taste. Once the tension starts, it almost never lets up. I realize that for some viewers that's a plus. I could have used some variation.There is, for all intents and purposes, no real acting in this movie, and certainly no character development. An occasional break in the tension to develop the characters to some extent would have made the movie more interesting to me.My big issue, though, is the way this movie treats history. From the first scene on the beach, where we see the British soldiers lined up waiting to board a ship to evacuate them back to England, this movie is designed to praise the courage and calmness of the British soldier, as well as the heroism of the British civilian who sailed small boats across the Channel to save them. 300,000+ of them, in fact.What the movie simply ignores is that while Britain evacuated virtually all of its troops from Dunkirk, they did so at the expense of the French, tens of thousands of whom were left on the beaches to be captured by the Germans and spend four years rotting in POW camps in Germany. At the very end, Kenneth Branaugh's character says that he will stay ""to wait for the French,"" but in fact the British did not. Once they got their own troops out, they stopped the mission.There were also certain situations that were set up just to milk the audience's emotions, such as the blinding and subsequent death of the young man on the yacht. That, to me, was manipulative.Overall, however, there is much that is impressive in this movie. It is slick, but impressively so. There's no real depth to it - you know nothing about the characters and don't have any feelings for them - and it doesn't raise any real issues to think about. The most moving moment, by far, is moving only because someone else wrote it: Churchill's great speech about how the British will go on fighting. It makes you realize that nothing else in the movie has that sort of verbal power. If you want this story treated with depth, try Mrs. Miniver. That's manipulative as well, but with far more humanity.I can't imagine watching this on a TV. It needs a big screen with vibrant color and a great sound system. But if you want to be riveted to your seat for two hours in a movie theater, you could do far worse.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
One of Nolan's best,"I've always had problems with Nolan. He uses too much exposition, it feels like he makes things overly complicated for pretense, and he just seems to overstuff his films with more and more (the last film that didn't suffer from this was Memento). Here, he finally makes a film that seems to go out of its way to not touch on any of those things. The premise is simple and we are out in the middle of various characters at wartime. Many scenes go on without dialogue. Further, this is one of his shortest films, definitely in quite a long time. I don't think it's a perfect film (sometimes the mostly effective score seems a bit much and at times the film would benefit from not jumping back and forth between story lines). However, the more simple approach taken here actually elevates his characters to become actual human beings rather than thematic symbols, which is also something that he has suffered from in the past. It's not an overly emotional film at all, but I found myself more emotionally invested in these characters than I have in previous films. The ending montage seems like it was a bit overdirected, but other than that I left the theater feeling quite satisfied. only time will tell how my feelings change (and with Nolan films, many times they do).",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Once I grasped it was a metaphor about events in Dunkirk,"I initially had reservations about Dunkirk. My first reservation was that the beach looked empty with only handfuls of soldiers visible. You never got the impression that there were 400000 soldiers trapped on the beach. Secondly this must be one of the most bloodless war films ever made and, whilst it's easy for directors to slip into war porn these days, men just falling over when shot is utterly unconvincing.Despite these misgivings I found the film gripping from beginning to end. The aerial scenes in particular were outstanding. The score and sound design were also outstanding ensuring that tension and was maintained and built upon throughout the film. I was also impressed by the mixing of the three timelines and points of view. Going in it seemed impossible for anyone to weave the three together but it works to perfection.Ultimately my take on the film is that Nolan has created a film that is a series of metaphors about what happened at Dunkirk and not a depiction of the reality of what happened at Dunkirk. The combination of the cinematography, score and fractured timelines give an impression of the horrors of waiting on the beach to be rescued that a more conventional approach could probably never achieve. Another director could have produced an effects heavy movie which lumbered on forever with saccharine character backstories and a linear chronology and it would not be nearly so effective.I may be wrong but I think Dunkirk is one giant metaphor. And it works",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
The best film in a decade.,"Not just good. Superb. Without doubt the greatest film of the last 10 years. I shall watch this again this weekend. Literally that good. 10/10. Oscars must be due galore.Fionn makes a spectacular entrance, Tom Hardy is terrific, Kenneth Branagh perfect. Mark Rylance is utterly riveting in his portrayal of a man set out to do what he believes is the right thing. Pace is spot on,the use of the ticking sound original. The audio is so good that it can never be viewed anywhere except the theater.The dog fights reminded me of the best from 'Battle of Britain' but they are much, much greater still.We feel the fear and the intensity without the need to be shown blood and gore.

Good aerial combat scenes,"If you are passionate of historical aviation, you'll love this excellent war movie. Forget the ridiculous and unrealistic stunts of ""Red Tails"" or ""Flyboys"". Here the flight scenes are absolutely well done and credible and fit perfectly in the plot. Just a couple of remarks, though: in the close up scenes of the pilot in the cockpit the light and the shadows should turn when the plane is manoeuvring in a dogfight; He-111 planes attacking targets at low altitude are quite unlikely, Do-17 or Ju-88 were a better choice...and in the scenes filmed with the POV from the wing of the Spit the engine doesn't look like a RR-Merlin, which gave a distinct shape to the nose. However, these are minor details and the film is very good. Great show.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Home,"I saw Dunkirk 4 days ago, but I really wanted to sit on the experience and not review it until I fully understood what Christopher Nolan was going for. This isn't your typical war movie, neither it terms of structure or execution. But it is how you'd expect Christopher Nolan to tackle a war epic; with a non-linear structure, tightly written and directed scenes, and one heck of a mind-blowing score from Hans Zimmer. It's far from the easiest film to dissect, but the experience is undeniably moving.Being a massive Christopher Nolan fan, I came into Dunkirk with high expectations and a ton of curiosity of how Nolan would treat a true story. This is the first film of is that attempts to take real-life events and present his own depiction. Unsurprisingly, the thing I love most about Dunkirk is Nolan's direction. Quite often war films look at the big picture (rightfully so), covering events from each side and telling in-depth stories about politics and survival. There's nothing wrong with those approaches, but the fact that Nolan takes a massive-scale approach to Dunkirk visually, when in reality the film is just about soldiers trying to survive on one particular beach, makes it all the more impressive. When you get past the fact that there's little dialogue and character development, there's plenty to love about Dunkirk.Nolan's films all have those defining visual moments, as he often loves to have his non-linear structure be used to its full effect and use the multiple story angles to create a few epic moments. Think Inception, when the ""dream is collapsing"" and there's 3 different layers of dreams all coalescing at the same time. Dunkirk uses that same approach for pretty much the entire movie, The Mole (beach), The Sea, and The Air. The editing can be frustrating the first time around, as it was for me, especially when you really just want to learn more about each of these characters if they expect us to care at all. Jumping viewpoints turns out to be exactly the way this film should be structured. In reality, none of these soldiers would have time to tell each other their respected backgrounds or life stories, they're just trying to survive. I thought Nolan handled this beautifully.Complementing the rapid editing is yet another terrific Hans Zimmer score. Nolan said in an interview that he gave Zimmer a recording of a ticking clock to give him an idea as to how he wanted the tone of the score to feel. Well, Zimmer took that to heart as that ticking clock is literally heard throughout the film. I love all of the Zimmer-Nolan collaborations, and Dunkirk is no exception. In fact, Zimmer's score could almost be considered more of an impactful character than the real characters themselves. There aren't many composers that can match the intensity that Nolan wants behind and in front of the camera, but Zimmer definitely does.From Tom Hardy's almost dialogue-less performance, to the breathtaking cinematography from Hoyte van Hoytema, and the incredible work done by Hans Zimmer, Dunkirk is a film which sees Christopher Nolan at the top of his craft. It's the shortest film of his since 'Following' but it may very well be his most emotionally effective film, and that's without developing any characters. Every year I'm hoping to see movies that change the way cinema is made and viewed, Nolan is one of the few directors that constantly break new ground in Hollywood. As much as Dunkirk isn't what I thought it would be, I can't ask for anything more than for him to reinvent the genre.+Score+Non-linear structure+Mind-blowingly gorgeous visuals+The best air-force sequences ever from a war film10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Artful Directing,"There were a lot of hyped movies coming throughout the year, but after interstellar, I was only really looking at what was Mr. Nolan's next move... when I saw Dunkirk and realized it was a war movie, I couldn't avoid but having an ""iffy"" gut...but here we are and Dunkirk is another Christopher Nolan's masterpiece.This movie from a cinematographic point of view is spectacular... I mean I am not expert to speak about the Imax cameras and 16 mm or something, but for a movie that doesn't lean into the 3D "" frenzy schizophrenia"" this blows one away... please watch it in a movie theater... not suitable for rooms/TV if you really want to live and feel the movie... the photography is awesome, the takes really great, the feel of the movie feels like...WAR...What I really like in this movie is the survival and the war drama element to it... Sometimes war movies seems to organized to be true, I mean people in the war... This show case various situations where even though officers were in command, not always seemed that there was full control over the troops... and this feels like true... the plane wars, amazing! The survival from young soldiers really great... the civilians commitment to support their soldiers really emotional... Overall it is great, the special effects...What also makes this movie great are the actors, simple lines, great acting... raw emotions, true emotions... every single one of them were great...If there is one thing I question in this one, is the stories connection, not sure if Mr. Nolan's techniques of reverse storytelling plays it right here...But overall a 7+ movie...highly recommended.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
A non-masterpiece,"This is a movie that a lot of people consider as masterpiece, but for me it isn't, but I'll understand why others consider it as one.The genius in this movie is the use of sound, the ticking sound throughout the movie makes your brain think that something might happen every second. It really keeps you on the edge of your seat.The only flaw is that it didn't have enough character development, but I can understand why. There wasn't a certain hero, every soldier was a hero so it tried to give you perspective of many, who fought.Recommend.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
I came out of this film with no nails left to bite,"I would prescribe that anyone going to see Dunkirk bring with them 1) a defibrillator 2) strong anti perspirant 3) a stiff drink for afterwards. (Oh and some tissues for the end when Elgar accosts your already tattered emotions!)Going into this film I was emotionally under-prepared for such a fiercely evocative experience! The film is an immediate sensory explosion and has your heart beating at an alarming rate pretty much within the first 5 minutes. When I came out of the cinema I had bite marks in my knuckle and here's the magic formula for how you put exhilarating and slightly cruel levels of tension on your audience. First off the music has a constant ticking beat which seems to slowly become more frantic as the film progresses. Han Zimmer manages also to interweave an almost mechanical quality into the score which ramps up the tension especially when there is large scale damage. The quality of the ambient sound and shots made me feel scarily involved in the unrelenting Dunkirk conditions. The shots were so wide and dynamic it felt at times like virtual reality. There are three different stories that cleverly interweave as the film progresses; Land, Sea and Air. Land is explored over the course of a week, the sea explored over a day and Air over the course of an hour. As the stories weave together you are often pulled between three different perilous scenarios. I love how Nolan play's with around with time lines in his films and I thought it was a very original concept to have three different time frames in one film.Dunkirk did an impressive job of capturing the immensity of the damage as we experience ships being torpedoed and sinking from various terrifying angles and perspectives. In amongst these large scale sequences though the film also hones in well on the micro moments. There where some beautiful facial reactions that expressed real depth of emotion without the need of dialogue. I think the film had an interesting presentation because as Christopher Nolan said in an interview he wanted the whole story to be very present tense and there was no focus on backstory. Some people disliked this approach to character presentation but I thought it worked well for the film that everything was happening in the moment. There are some very breathtaking sky shots in this film and when the planes where diving I can say I felt on the cusp of queasy. Definitely catch this film on a huge screen with an all guns blazing sound system as you will feel the bombs and music in your seat! A fantastic film and a very emotional ending (bring tissues or at the very least a porous sleeve)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"Great atmosphere, empty characters","A war with no blood is no war. PG-13 makes this look like a cleaned documentary. The characters are rarely questionable in their decisions, even with their lives at risk in every moment: too much heroism and very little moral misery. The film is closer to propaganda than to the real thing.Besides the obvious disappointment with characters and heroism, I've loved the cinematography, the storytelling, the pace and the oppressive atmosphere created by Nolan. It really makes you feel the clock ticking. Hans Zimmer job with the soundtrack is kind of an environmental sound design rather than actual music. It works, but is far from the thing he gave us in Interstellar.In short, this is a remarkable film, but not the thing I expected from Nolan. Really enjoyable in terms of immersion but failing in key things like characters and moral decisions",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Dunderkirk,"One of the greatest triumphs of arguably the most pivotal six years of human history, reduced to 1 hour 40 minutes of, ""Look what I did with the light in his eyes!"", ""You see, the sea foam was a metaphor of Death's cold blanket...."" to, ""See how deafening that silence is here?"" ego stroking. The cinemetography was erratic and the dialogue would've been predictable if not for it's constant contradictions. It is as if a crew of hipsters wanted to make an Avant Garde art film from whatever subject was picked by lot out of a tweed trilby.

"One part suspenseful and two parts engaging, Dunkirk is the loudest silent movie I've seen (it's also incredible)","History has proved that war is Hell. Soldiers that have been there and back will reveal that they were in constant fear that any moment could be their last. There was no such thing as a safe haven. The moment they would retreat to their tents and shut their eyes for the evening would be treasured as they were never sure if they would ever wake up. Sure, having their hands on a gun or even knife might give them some reassurance, but the cloud of death is felt by everyone, with the acceptance that they're okay with sacrifice.There are too many war movie to name, but how many of them deal with the actual fear that came with it? Even I'm hard pressed to fully name one. I think it has to do with the ideology that's similar to how the American government wants the public to see its military; fearless. Vulnerability seems to be seen as more of a sign of weakness then humanity, especially in film. It's always about trying to be the hero. It's all about showing that your have to stand and face the enemy. What if I were to say it's okay to run? Dunkirk let's you know that it's alright to dream of home within hopelessness.The film opens with some history exposition informing the audience that it's 1940 and very early into WWII. We are then introduced to three different stories that seemingly blend together as the film progresses. First on the land is about a young British private Tommy (played by Fionn Whitehead) who (along with the rest of the troops) is being pushed closer and closer to the ocean. He joins with fellow private Gibson (played by Aneurin Barnard) and later Alex (played by Harry Styles) as they simply hope to catch a boat that will take them home.The second story on the water is about an older mariner Mr. Dawson (played by Mark Rylance) as he and his son Peter join with several sailors in transporting their ships to Dunkirk to help with the troop rescue. They later pickup a shell-shocked soldier (played by Cillian Murphy) and deal with him wanting to turn the boat around.The last story in the air, centers around three spitfire pilots on the English Channel to provide support from the Nazi attacks. Though one of the pilots Farrier (played by Tom Hardy) gas gauge breaks, he continues to fight as long as he can.If film has been about immersing audiences into new worlds, then Dunkirk will transport you to the terror of WWII. Right from the opening scene (which I will not DARE spoil), I found myself flinching to gunshots and explosions, as if I was in a VR experience. Director Christopher Nolan again extends his belief that cinema should be an experience and Dunkirk is an incredible suspenseful war movie that gave me an idea of what fear I would have felt had I been in the military.It's been said that real veterans of the Dunkirk event felt like they had returned. I can say that this movie looks and sounds incredible. For such a story that shot in a wide scope, you ironically feel that claustrophobia that each of the men in France felt when they thought they were going to die. Sometimes its right on the beach and sometimes it's on the sailboat in the little rooms where that may have been the only safe place. I saw this in IMAX, and I can say that it amplifies the sound to a level that added the number of times I jumped from my seat.Will Dunkirk receive a best picture nomination? It's tough to tell, but I'm sure it's already guaranteed all of the technical awards from effects to sound to especially score by the great Hans Zimmer. The music, like the movie, all feel like a ticking time bomb that will eventually go off, yet you never see the timer.If I had any issue is that the movie does feel a little long even with it's hour and forty minute running time. A lot of that has to do with that you listen to very little dialogue and all the focus is the reaction of the characters. This makes for what has to be the loudest silent movie I've seen.I'll give this ten Dunkirk flags out of ten. Watching Dunkirk on the big screen will feel like a historical roller coaster, so if sound volume doesn't bother you, spring for the IMAX screening if you can. While I can't say this is Nolan's best work, Dunkirk justifies his claim that we need cinema for movies like these.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Dunkirk is an experience. Nolan a master at work.,"Pros: A masterpiece of cinema. Directing, editing, cinematography, music, acting. Every ingredient in this film put into it was of the highest quality and as such, it sucked you into the film. This is the work of a man at the peak of his ability, creating art in ways that are becoming harder to find in modern cinema. Like Spielberg, he has managed to find an army of artists that now appear to follow him film to film helping him realise his masterpieces and in that respect this film is an experience to your senses for the 100 minutes you are watching it.Cons: The story. Simple, no characters I could relate to, in fact most of them felt very expendable throughout the whole film. Considering the lengths Nolan went to convey the huge sense of scale of the war taking place around these people, I felt that the story moving throughout it was quite plain, were it not for the music creating an ever present sense of tension, I would probably have not been held by the story at all. Maybe he was trying to show how truly low in value human life is during a time of war, or trying to present the stories as more of a collective of the soldiers on the beach all being humans etc but I just could not get immersed into it as deeply as many of his other stories he has told sadly.Fantastic war film. Definitely sits well in Nolan's work.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
The most absorbing technical marvel since Gravity,"Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk is making headlines as the best war movie in years, and arguably Nolan's best film. The former I can understand and I don't agree with the latter, but that's not really important. I think most people will agree that Christopher Nolan's gripping direction as well as the film's cinematography, sound, and special effects all amount to one of the most impressive technical marvels in years. Dunkirk takes the war genre to a new level, similar to the way Saving Private Ryan did about twenty years ago, with absorbing action scenes that create an authentic war feel. Saving Private Ryan is not the best analogy to this movie though. To me, the best comparison is Gravity (2013), - both gripping stories about survival under insurmountable odds that keeps the audience invested with its technical wizardry.Dunkirk follows three stories at different times during the ill-fated battle. One story follows a British air force pilot played by Tom Hardy in what are the best dog fight scenes scenes in years. Hardy is once again covered by a mask, but it makes no difference. The second story is about a British infantryman trying to get off the beaches of Dunkirk at any cost. The third story is about a group of civilians (one played by Mark Rylance) who assist with the rescue effort in their ordinary boat. The chronological narrative tricks will remind Nolan fans of his first film, Memento, but it's no where near as complicated. Eventually the stories intersect. The one element uniting all of these stories is the struggle for survival. While some characters are paralyzed with fear, others manage to stay brave and fight the good fight. You barely see the Nazis, and the violence is never graphic, but you feel the horror of war through the sound of the bombs, the sound of the bullets hitting metal near the soldiers, and the sheer desperation in the eyes of the soldiers.The technical features of the film have deservedly received the most acclaim, but the cast's performances are all commendable. Hans Zimmer's score is also his best in years. The music will get your heart pumping.Of all the praises I have heaped on this film, I do have some reservations. I am not sure how well this film will hold up on a small screen. Without the big screen to take in the picture, and the speaker system of a movie theater, I don't know how gripping the movie will be. It may be just fine, but I think the film will lose something on DVD. The lack of a traditional story and developed characters may harm the film's repeat value.Still, if you're going to see one action spectacle this summer, see Dunkirk in IMAX. You must see this movie on the biggest screen you can. The sounds and the sights will make you feel like you are really there.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

Nolan's Masterpiece,"To call Dunkirk an epic is both an understatement and a disservice. Never does the constant tension or sheer scale of Nolan's vision hinder the intimacy between the viewer and the film, creating a personal experience rarely found in films of this scope. Dunkirk retells the famous Dunkirk Evacuation from three unique perspectives, through the eyes of those on land, air and sea. Due in part to Nolan's ambitious approach to storytelling — as well as his attention to detail in all aspects of the film-making process — Dunkirk stands as Nolan's most accomplished film yet.In contrast to previous works, Nolan opts to keep the core story of Dunkirk simple and faithful. Where he applies his ambitious ideas is in the films structure. Dunkirk follows three separate view points within their own unique timelines. These are the fighter planes in the air, the civilian boats at sea and the men trapped on the beaches, set over one hour, one day and one week respectively. While on paper this may sound like Nolan over intellectualising this simple premise, upon viewing, these timelines seamlessly converge at the climax of the film — something that is a spectacle in itself to witness. This structure, however, serves a greater narrative purpose. It allows the viewer to see the same events from a new perspective later in the film. By allowing the viewer to witness these moments from different view points, it allows for a greater understanding of how the various characters are being affected by what is happening. An example of this can be seen when Tom Hardy watches his fellow pilot making an emergency sea landing only to shift to the perspective of the civilian boats tracking this dog fight from below, unsure of whether the pilot has survived and is in need of rescue.In deep contrast to this bold, complex structure is the movie's sparse dialogue. Very often, Dunkirk is akin to war films of the silent era. Instead of leaning heavily on dialogue to both progress the story and give insight into the characters, Nolan chooses to convey plot points visually. The visual story telling on display here is impressive. You learn to care about these characters not through what you are told about them but through what you see them do. It is how they choose to act in situations which teaches what kind of person they are. It is what you see them experience which makes you care for their survival. It is amazing how moving Dunkirk is in spite of Nolan choosing to have several characters instead of one focal. It emphasises the reality that Dunkirk was the culmination of the actions of many.This visual storytelling is bolstered by the outstanding ensemble cast. You have newcomers Fionn Whitehead, Harry Styles and Tom Glynn-Carney matching the performances of the established cast members like Tom Hardy and Mark Rylance. A lot of the film relies on the expressions you see painted on these characters faces as the film unfolds. When you see terror in their expression you feel their fear. When you see hope light up a man's face, you feel it yourself. A particular scene that really emphasised this is when Tom Hardy is trying to decide what his next move will be. All you need to know is in the eyes. As the viewer watches Hardy's eyes, they know everything that is racing through his characters mind without a single word being uttered. This is a great example of how Nolan uses expression to invoke empathy, instead of resorting to contrived backstory. Nolan also utilises expression to more creatively depict unfolding events. There is a scene where instead of simply showing an enemy plane suddenly flying towards the beach, the camera remains fixed on Kenneth Branagh's expression as it changes from relief to terror. This shot paired with the sound of an aircraft engine approaching makes for a far more effective way of conveying impending peril. Filming the moment like this instead of simply showing the enemy plane humanises this moment since you witness how the situation affects those on the beach directly.Nolan does not rely only on sight, instead utilising other senses to immerse the viewer, most significantly through his use of sound. This comes in the form of excellent sound design along side audio cues to further illustrate unfolding events. You feel the sound impact on your body every time bullets are fired and bombs are dropped. The sound feels so real that you never feel at ease with what you are hearing, with the hundredth bullet being just as shocking as the first. In contrast, there are moments of undisturbed silence just waiting to be shattered by another bullet. It is disparities like these which maintain the films unbroken sense of suspense, even when fighting appears to have momentarily ceased.There is still so much that could be said about this film from its great use of practical effects over CGI to the breathtaking dogfight scenes. It is very difficult to criticise any aspect of Dunkirk. At 106 minutes, the film feels the perfect length. Not a single frame is wasted in telling the story. Viewers are left on the edge of their seat from the first frame to the last. Dunkirk perfectly conveys the trauma of war without ever glorifying it, instead telling a very human story about courage and unity, triumphing against impending doom. The directors decision to break the conventional storytelling structure of films creates a more authentic realisation of Dunkirk whilst maintaining a strong emotional connection. Dunkirk constantly reminds us that actions speak louder than words. Every aspect of this movie comes together so perfectly that Dunkirk is not only one of the greatest war films of all time but one of the greatest films of modern cinema.This is Christopher Nolan's Magnum Opus.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Best Nolan film,"Saw this movie on 70 mm film on Wednesday. We don't have IMAX where I live unfortunately. But nonetheless it was still a majestic experience. This is without a doubt the greatest cinematic experience I've had. The scope was big and the sound was deafening without losing clarity(they have one of the best sound-systems in that cinema in my country). I wasn't really prepared for this movie. It's unlike any other Nolan film before or even war movie. No grand speeches, no politics, no flag-waving, no propaganda. Just survival, nothing more, nothing less. It's all about the experience. You're in there with the anonymous soldiers. You don't have time to have heartfelt conversations while you're being torpedoed, bombed and shot at. It's all about the terrifying, unrelenting suspense that never lets go. This is Cinema at it's finest. Go see it on the biggest and loudest cinema available!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
A very different kind of war film,"A different kind of war film. Very little dialogue or character development, it just places you in the middle of the action, in several different locations, in the air, on the Dunkirk beach and on one of the many boats that sailed over there to pick up the 400,000 stranded British soldiers. There was no real 'feel' of there being that many small boats, though it must have been an armada. It's a very sonic film, the subwoofers are really put to test, thundering along in scenes where, it's not really needed. Still, an entertaining, and ultimately, quite moving 1 hr and 46 minutes. And Harry Stiles can ACT.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Nolan over his head. Lost between Saving Private Ryan and Memento,"The movie has so much potential in the first 10 minutes but then it falls apart. While Nolan is trying to decide if the movie wants to be Saving Private Ryan or another Memento, he forgets to build any characters or narrative that anyone can care about.What a shame given the cast he had at his hand. He was just unable to direct them or bring together anything redeeming or with any level of depth.Aside from the first 10 minutes, there are some beautiful cinematography. However, the scenes are shot on different days. One sunny and the other overcast. So the beautiful visuals are unable to sustain any type of mood across the length of the movie.At the end, it's clear the story was too ambitious for Nolan and he was just unable to put it together.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"Confusing, confusing, confusing","To say that this movie is confusing is but an understatement.Horrible, horrible editing, with scenes going back and forth in time without any meaning, making the whole experience unpleasant and difficult to watch.I really tried - and succeeded - to watch it till the end, hoping that it would get better eventually, but it never did, unfortunately.A good idea, and a potentially good scenario ruined by nonsensical editing.To this day I ask myself what was the guy doing on top of the overturned boat all by himself, how did he get there, why was he by himself, where were the rest...
Never got an answer to any of these questions.Otherwise good special effects, pity that they were ruined in the end by the scenario and editing.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Another Nolan masterpiece!,"The wait is finally over. I've never been this excited to watch a movie in years. And it sure was worth the wait. Watched it last night and it was better than I expected.The story of Dunkirk is well known. During the early stages of World War II, Allied soldiers from Britain, Belgium and France are surrounded by the German Army on the beaches of Dunkirk, around 400,000 soldiers were evacuated.There isn't a lot of dialogue in this film and there isn't a central character to develop. It is telling the story of the battle rather than a person's story during the battle, and I like that.This movie is a MASTER of keeping your attention to the screen, probably y thanks to the magical musician H.Zimmer. He proved again that he's the best. He provides the perfect mood for a war epic.This is the movie that everybody must see. So what are you wanting for ?",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"Dunkirk was exactly what I had anticipated it to be, and then some","To put it into simple terms, Dunkirk is the best cinematic experience I've had in years.Once the credits started rolling, I was lost for words. So strong had the impact of this film been upon me. I was clearly not the only one, as the whole theater was silent. It was as if we were all soldiers returning home from an hour and three quarters of war experience.From the moment when the first bullet is fired, we're are completely submerged into the narrative. The story focuses on three narratives in three different settings, that all tie together in the events at Dunkirk 76 years ago. The inter-cutting between these different narratives is brilliantly done, where all the stories serve as a companion to one another, despite being fundamentally different. Alhtough a story structure like this is not common in cinema, I believe it works perfectly for the atmosphere Nolan wanted to create.The craftsmanship in this film is absolutely stunning. Every aspect of this film is masterfully crafted, and flows with each other to create the perfect harmony. That's because the film isn't trying to show off how great certain aspects are. It's all about creating the experience of watching it. That is also the reason why the narrative isn't in a traditional war epic format. That's because this film doesn't take you on a journey so to speak, as it provides you with the experience of war. It is a very tense experience that leaves you with no real breaks to settle down. That's because you constantly feel like you are one of the soldiers depicted on screen. I feel inclined to add that this film may not be a good experience for people who have experienced combat, or have been severely affected by it. This is also not a film you should see if you have a history with drowning. Luckily I've not been affected by either, but I can still imagine how it must have felt like. That's how real the experience of watching this film really is.I would strongly recommend seeing this film in theaters. That is mostly because of how amazing the sound design is. As I said before, no single aspect takes over another, but the sound design is undeniably a crucial part of creating the atmosphere. The experience is therefore best if watched with good surround sound being blasted all around you, while your eyes are stuck to the big screen.One of the best things about this story is that it doesn't really pick a side. The film only shows you one side, but moral questions regarding the men you are fighting are left out. The film also doesn't talk about the horrors of war. It simply shows you what it was like. This ties into the fact that this story isn't a journey. It is an intense experience.The atmosphere this film offers is so intense that you can feel the salty breeze from the sea, mixed in with the horrible smell of dead corpses. Throughout the entire film, you feel like you are there with the soldiers. We care for them, we fear for them, and we emphasize for them. That's simply because we are one of them. Or at least that's what it feels like.In the end we are all like the silent spitfire gliding through the air, as we admire the bravery of the people depicted on screen. So strong is the will to help those in need, that men and women alike risked their lives to save the soldiers trapped at Dunkirk. It is about the power of people to sacrifice in order to save, even when faced with a great adversary. This message, combined with the extraordinary experience, is what makes Dunkirk a true masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
The clock's ticking,"Dunkirk is without a doubt my favourite cinema experience of the year so far. I mean, thats not that hard to achieve since in 2017 the only films I've watched in the theatre were John Wick 2, Ghost in the Shell, Spider Homecoming, the more recent Transformers (bleh, bleh, bleh) and Despicable Me 3 (yeah, I did). The rest of it were at home. And although John Wick and Spidey were very good flicks, they weren't as gripping and intense as Nolan's Dunkirk. You know you're in for a ride from very first shot. In two minutes it's already kicking the fan. When we reach the beach and see what many have to do in order to survive comes the sudden realisation of the hopeleness and the miracle that needs to happen to bring all of those soldiers back home. The three separate timelines were just perfect to brilliantly tell this story. The mesh so well and make the film fell fluid and dynamic, always moving, interconnecting events and characters, almost like chapters of a book. We don't get to know much of the characters but I believe that what we're given is enough to figure out ourselves some of the backstory and motivations of the characters. The collective is what's a stake here. We might be confused when trying to identify who's who, specially on the big setpieces, but that just adds to viscerality and intensity Dunkirk excels in delivering. Both the photography and soundtrack are amazing. One friend of mine jokingly told me a few das ago that the music just wouldn't stop and became ad eternum. I didn't know what make of this, but believe that if it was well executed, Nolan could do whatever he wanted. Spoiler - it was. The OST makes for the lack of dialogue - yes, this is almost a silent film - and elevates the action and the stakes. It fits like a glove into the overall tone of Dunkirk. Actingwise is very solid - shoutout to Styles who really held his ground and turned a surprisingly convincing performance. Hardy is brief but gets the hang of it. The rest of the cast is quite good, with many of the actors being unknown, another factor that contributes to establish the collective over the individual.Got to give it to Nolan.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Should have been better,"Okay...I guess that's the review, just, okay. Without IMAX, it would have fallen below my score of 6/10. I saw this movie on 7/24/2017, in an IMAX theater. While the screen and sound were amazing, the movie itself suffered from character development, or the lack thereof. I also think this movie was barely PG13, ranging closer to PG, which a serious war movie should be rated R, in my opinion. I honestly don't know how this movie is getting 8's, 9's, and 10's---it just isn't that great. Without giving anything away, you basically only connect with one character, and you still learn nothing about him.What this movie needed:-Character development -Tighter plot -In sync, instead of out of sync storytelling -And women who helped in the war effortIf you see this movie, sit close to the screen (IMAX does make the flight scenes awesome), and bring food; no use you being hungry and bored.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Disappointing,7 points for a great looking movie but zero for anything else. Didn't care for the scope of the movie but to elaborate might be considered a spoiler. Although the bullets and explosions sounded great the limited dialogue in the film often could not be made out (maybe more of an IMAX theatre issue). Almost zero character development. Couldn't recommend this movie to anybody who isn't a complete history buff. They might like it but at the same time some parts seemed unrealistic but again I'll stay away from spoilers. Really surprised how some very big time movie critics are so over the moon on this flick.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
A jarring spectacle about human survival. Nolan delivers once again. IMAX viewers beware,"If you're a fan of Christopher Nolan what more do you need to know? The man is a great director and he knows how to shoot a movie. Dunkirk is definitely one of his most experimental films in years and I just loved it. He crafted a different kind of war movie that doesn't so much focus on the combat aspect or gore of war, but rather the fear and isolation one feels in these awful situations. It's claustrophobic, it's uncomfortable and the use of IMAX cameras immerse you into the film unlike anything I've seen in years. That can be a huge factor in deciding whether or not you see the movie especially in IMAX. One of my fellow viewers was disturbed by the sound effects alone that she couldn't get through the whole thing. She was freaked out by how loud and real the gunfire sounded. It will make you feel anxious and unsafe so you have to know what your limits are watching war films. There's not even any blood and gore it's just loud, suspenseful, and non stop claustrophobic scenes the entire movie. Everything is done as practical and real as it can possibly be, and I never thought it looked fake. From the scenes involving water or dog fights it was all very authentic. We have many other films that show how brutal the combat was in WW2 like Saving Private Ryan, but that wasn't the point here. You don't focus on specific characters as this is a story about survival and just humanity in the darkest of times. There's actually little to no dialogue as the movie is carried by it's spectacle and Hanz Zimmer's music which is outstanding once again. One thing I appreciated about the film was showing how these men on the beach were all young and inexperienced. It's brutally honest about how the mentality was every man for himself. Reviews are saying it's odd for Nolan to portray soldiers from his country in such a negative way, but I've talked to many friends who have WW2 vets in their families and they said that's completely accurate especially in a movie like this. Dunkirk was one of the biggest miracles in Britain's military history and some say it was a game changer in the war for we never would have helped them conquer the evil if Britain had surrendered. Everything used here was effective and for that, it's so far my favorite movie of 2017.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Dunkirk @ IMAX 1570: A Must See,"Caught this @ Imax on Thursday night on the 1570 viewing.It's a beautifully crafted film. Zimmer's score drones throughout creating a sense of non-stop tension and foreboding. It's relentless, almost fatiguing in parts. The sound-stage and the score really make the film. You hear and feel so much of the film. It was bloody loud in parts. I could have been Tom Hardy's co-pilot and still couldn't hear or understand a word he said.Nolan once again uses time as a motive, utilising a non-linear structure telling three separate stories that intersect during the Battle of Dunkirk. It's done very well. The cast is very good throughout, all giving solid performances.My only criticism would be that it was pretty tame and a somewhat low- key rendition of the Battle of Dunkirk. It's almost minimalist in parts.Very, very solid filmmaking.Will watch this again as I think the Imax experience was a little overwhelming and all encompassing at times – the dog fights, dive- bombing and air scenes were intense!Definitely an early contender for awards season.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

Tense and riveting work of film-making,"Dunkirk is a tense, riveting piece of film-making. The action moves from beach to sea to sky with the story showing how the event was played out among all involved in this historic event. I felt like I was inside the Spitfire as it raced across the sky, or drowning inside a boat as it was bombed and burned. The scene looking across the English Channel was dark and cold and the waters rough. While there was great heroism, the viewer also sees the worst as men suffering from shock come face to face with critical choices. The cast was made up of many fine performers but I found Mark Rylance was best as he portrayed the quiet heroism of Mr. Dawson, who along with his two sons, volunteered his small craft for the evacuation. The movie seems to point out that people like him were the backbone of the massive evacuation effort.

Dunkirk IMAX,"Dunkirk is by far the best movie of the year so far. If you are going to see Dunkirk you have to see it in IMAX. The acting was fantastic especially by Harry Styles as Alex. This is one of those films that when you watch it you know you are with them. Christopher Nolan did it once again with another great film. Every second of the film was shot perfectly as every camera was put on the object like the cockpit had a camera on it. Dunkirk was a brutal battle and this movie proves that it was brutal.Parents yes this movie is rated PG-13, but it was rated that problem just because Harry Styles is in it because if he was not in it it would be R. This movie was extremely intense the whole time so if you don't want your kids to see it and they want to tell them when they get older because they would love it.

"Impressive and spectacular film about ¨The Dunkirk evacuation¨ , also known as the Miracle of Dunkirk , code-named Operation Dynamo.","This an important, interesting movie depicting Battle of Dunkirk , this was an important battle that took place in Dunkirk , France, during the Second World War between the Allies and Germany . As part of the Battle of France on the Western Front, the Battle was the defence and evacuation of British and allied forces in Europe from 26 May-4 June 1940 , being shot with monumental logistics and means of effecting the landings to rescue escaped soldiers . This rousing adventure about one of the most difficult campaign of war detailing the epic feats of some valiant heroes contains noisy action , German raids , idealism , unlimited courage , breathtaking battles , bravery and impressive sandy outdoors . Set during World War II, and stuck on the beaches near Dunkirk , Allied soldiers from Belgium, the British Commonwealth and Empire, and France are surrounded by the German Army and evacuated during the fierce battle and seen through the eyes of a soldier amongst those trapped forces, two Royal Air Force fighter pilots, and a group of civilians on their boat, and Commander Bolton : Kenneth Branagh and Colonel Winnant : James D'Arcy who are attemping to organize the evacuation fleet. At the point of crisis, at the point of annihilation, survival is victory ! .When 400,000 men couldn't get home, home came for them !.This spectacular war movie contains thrills , exciting battles , aerial raids , dogfighting , romance and historical events . It is an enjoyable movie about warlike feats , courage and good feeling . This War movie packs crossfire , large-scale action , battles , shots of troops , landings and many other things . Notable movie pulls things together enough to rise thanks to continuous images of aviation , military marches , explosions , smoke and shootouts . This blockbuster is a stunnung description of such an important event but it is a context in which the battle offers the concrete development , life and death , as the Allied army being actually surrounded on the beaches of Dunkirk . The pic is well starred by a plethora of known actors and newcomers as Mark Rylance , Kenneth Branagh , Tom Hardy , James D'Arcy , Cillian Murphy , Fionn Whitehead , Barry Keoghan , Damien Bonnard , Lee Armstrong , among others. Rousing and thrilling musical score by the great composer Hans Zimmer . As well as colorful and evocative cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema. The film is magnificently produced with big budget by John Bernard ,Jake Myers , Erwin Godschalk , Emma Thomas and Andy Thompson . This famous event from how was orchestrated and developed the notorious but dangerous , risky feat was professionally written/produced/directed by Christopher Nolan.The picture was well based on historical events , these are the following ones : General Von Kuechler assumed command of all the German forces at Dunkirk. His plan was simple: he would launch an all-out attack across the whole front . Strangely, he ignored a radio intercept telling him the British were abandoning the eastern end of the line to fall back to Dunkirk itself. Although Churchill had promised the French that the British would cover their escape, on the ground it was the French who held the line while the last remaining British were evacuated . Enduring concentrated German artillery fire and Luftwaffe strafing and bombs, the French stood their ground. On 2 June (the day the last of the British units embarked onto the ships), the French began to fall back slowly, and by 3 June the Germans were about two miles (3 km) from Dunkirk. The night of 3 June was the last night of evacuations. On 4 June , the Germans hoisted the swastika over the docks from which so many British and French troops had escaped under their noses The War Office made the decision to evacuate British forces on 25 May. In the nine days from 27 May-4 June, 338,226 men escaped, including 139,997 French, Polish, and Belgian troops, together with a small number of Dutch soldiers, aboard 861 vessels -of which 243 were sunk during the operation-. British Fighter Command lost 106 aircraft dogfighting over Dunkirk, and the Luftwaffe lost about 135 - some of which were shot down by the French Navy and the Royal Navy . The docks at Dunkirk were too badly damaged to be used, but the East and West Moles or sea walls were intact. Captain William Tennant -in charge of the evacuation- decided to use the beaches and the East Mole to land the ships. This highly successful idea hugely increased the number of troops that could be embarked each day, and indeed at the rescue operation's peak, on 31 May, over 68,000 men were taken off. The last of the British Army left on 3 June and all of them returning to Dover. However, Churchill insisted on coming back for the French, so the Royal Navy returned on 4 June in an attempt to rescue as many as possible of the French rearguard. Over 26,000 French soldiers were evacuated on that last day, but between 30,000 and 40,000 more were left behind and forced to surrender to the Germans .",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

Great action sequences,"Sometimes historical stories are best described by telling the tale from the perspective of a few individuals instead of trying to give the big picture. The Longest Day and any Michener work is an example. I think that approach works, with some slight reservations, in this one. The focus is on Rylance as the stoic (as it were) small boat captain pitching in; a couple of ordinary soldiers trying just to get out of the trap; and a Hurricane pilot protecting the retreat with developing petrol issues. As you might expect, some of their paths criss cross, which in some ways makes this a little pat, like some Spielberg concoction. It also seemed a little played out and long on time although it wasn't. But the cinematography and the action, particularly the fighter action, is just stupendous and trumps those concerns. Worth a look.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
A Technical Achievement in Filmmaking Devoid of Any Depth or Emotion,"Make no mistake, from a technical perspective Dunkirk is an absolute achievement in filmmaking. Shot in portion on IMAX and completely on film, it's a visually gorgeous movie with breathtaking cinematography of dogfights in the sky and battles at sea. The sound effects and mix are possibly the best I've ever heard in a film! The gunshots are and loud, frightening, and realistic and every scene with a plane closing in sounds as if it i flying right above the audience making for an all the more immersive experience. And as always, Hans Zimmer delivers another excellent and powerful score that is one of the best I've heard in a film in quite sometime.Yet, Dunkirk makes the same mistake that many technical and visually impressive films do, it forgets to give us any reason to care about what's going on within it's craft. Nolan has made a film that is strictly about the event that took place and has chosen to tell it in an unconventional non-linear structure with three different areas of the event taking course over the span of a week, day, and hour. By within a few minutes dropping us into all the chaos unfolding and not stating the structure aside from brief ""One week...etc."" cards in the very start, it takes a little bit of time to fully grasp the way the story is being unfolded and difficult to get into during the first act with things moving at such a quick pace . The biggest issue with Dunkirk though is that there is nothing to get invested in. I'm debating whether to even say this movie has any characters because none of them have any depth, personality, or background. This is a film where we are suppose to be rooting for the survival of these people, yet aren't given any reason to care about them other than the fact they are soldiers fighting the enemy. As the film progressed, I found myself not wanting to see where the actual story would progress, but instead hoping that there would be something else I could appreciate visually or technically to keep me from losing complete interest.Another big issue is that Nolan desperately wants this to be a grim and horrific portrayal of war. However, this is difficult to do when the film is restricted to the boundaries of a PG-13 rating. This is the perfect example of a film that needed an R rating to fully be effective in what it was trying to do. Take films such as Saving Private Ryan or the recent Hacksaw Ridge in which the battle scenes become borderline horror films due to not just their suspense, but brutality and graphicness. Not that Dunkirk needed to be a Gibson gorefest, but it's portrayal of war feels all too tame and can't deliver on the level of suspense that's built up in the scenes proceeding it.That isn't to say the film isn't without tense scenes, one in particular where soldiers are hiding in a ship that is being shot at for target practicing is particularly nerve-wrecking as well as the climax and the ending are also very well done. As for the acting, there isn't a bad performance here, but with little dialogue or much to do other than look frightened the cast isn't given a lot to work with to show off much. Tom Hardy's role could have been played by any other actor and it wouldn't have changed a thing which can be said for most of the cast here.For a film that has openly taken pride in how experimental, unique, and going against what is norm in Hollywood, Dunkirk ends up being exactly what Nolan has been criticizing. It's a complete exercise in spectacle that's trying to get a pass with it's unique style and filmmaking techniques to excuse it's lack of depth and emotional core. I can appreciate Nolan for taking a different approach to a war film and it certainly showcases his talent as a director, but just because it's different doesn't automatically make it good and without any real depth, characterization, or emotion only further provides evidence of his weakness as a writer. If the film had been trimmed down to 30-40 minutes and released as an IMAX feature it would have been much more impressive, but the film itself is an empty exercise in technical achievement that's in it's own way a new breed of cynical filmmaking.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Visually and Sound Wise... Wonderful,"Dunkirk (2017)**** (out of 4)Christopher Nolan's story of German, French and Dutch soldiers being trapped by the German's and the risky evacuation attempt that would require the help of common people.You have to think that DUNKIRK was one of the most hyped movies in recent memory. As soon as it was announced people started talking about the brilliance that they were expected. Throughout the production the hype grew even more. When the teaser was first released it didn't try to hide anything. The marketing was aimed at people and they wanted the people to know that this here wasn't just your average war picture. With all the hype into it, Nolan actually managed to deliver a great picture and one of the most dazzling that you'll ever see and hear.I've heard a lot of people asking if we really needed yet another war movie. To be honest, the war genre had played itself out even before sound came to movies but I've always said it doesn't matter how many times something has been done as long as you get to see it in a new way. There's no question that Nolan is a technical genius as his previous films prove that. What DUNKIRK has done is pretty darn impressive because everything we see in the film is something we've seen countless times yet it all seems fresh and original here.Visually this is certainly one of the most impressive war movies out there. Pretty much from the opening to the closing sequence is nothing but action and there's so much that your sense are never given a break. I think what's so impressive with the look is that the director manages to put you in with these characters and you really do feel as if you're in the water with them, in the plane getting hit or on the boat being bombed. The terrific use of sound also puts you right there in the action and some of the sound effects were so real that you couldn't help but feel as if you were right there.The entire cast deliver terrific performances and especially Kenneth Branagh. Throughout the movie I was thinking that I'd probably be critical because there wasn't much heart or emotion with what you were watching. That was until the finale when it finally hit me with what the director was trying to do. DUNKIRK is a technical marvel and a film that put itself out there as something special and different.

Dunkirk is an unrelenting Cinema triumph! (unmissable!),"Watching Dunkirk at an IMAX Cinema is reluctant to be an unforgettable experience (for me it was, surely). Filled with unrelenting tension. From start to finish there isn't a minute's respite. With each gun battle, torpedo attack, aerial bombing and explosion, there's end-to-end action which is in equal parts gripping, thrilling and stunning. Expect your heart to hammer for the entire 107 minutes. I didn't hear a cough, sniff, barely an intake of breath from my fellow captivated cinema-goers. Nolan's Dunkirk will suck you in and spit you back out - in the best way.As a Briton, this was seriously important, valuing the details. The magnificent history of Britain has tales to fill almost every book in the world and this powerful document of an era, the World War II and one of Britain's greatest military expenditure (which was actually a retreat by all means), told in stark terms by the Dark Knight director, a Brit-phenomenon himself, Christopher Nolan was more than overwhelming and satisfying. How the evacuation of Dunkirk in May 1940 turned out: how nearly 400,000 mainly British (which means mostly English but don't forget our Scottish brothers) troops escaped from the beach and harbour of a northern French port while being bombarded by the NazisSurely, my main expectation with war movies is the terrifying gore (thanks Spielberg). Blood, organs spilling everywhere, limbs blown off; all an accurate depiction of war but just so awful to watch. There's hardly a drop of visible blood spilled in Dunkirk but it is still one of the most brutal and powerful war films I've ever seen.Steven Spielberg might have owned the Normandy beach landings while Clint Eastwood owns Iwo Jima, and now, Nolan has authored the definitive cinematic version of Dunkirk. Unlike those other battles, however, this last was not a conventional victory, but more of a salvaged retreat, as the German offensive forced a massive evacuation of English troops early in World War II.And unlike those other two directors, Nolan is only nominally interested in the human side of the story as he puts his stamp on the heroic rescue operation, offering a bravura virtual-eyewitness account from multiple perspectives — one that fragments and then craftily interweaves events as seen from land, sea and air. Coming from Nolan, the film retains the same legendary scale but it's blended with a more intimate and structurally fascinating project like his earlier works Memento and Following.Anyone who ever saw Memento knows Nolan is a fan of playing with time and structure, incorporating a pulsating suspense factor even without spelling anything out for the audience. Again, like a true master of cinema, he lets it all come together in sometimes surprising but enormously effective and even emotional ways. With sparse dialogue and an emphasis on three separate angles on the Dunkirk operation, Nolan creates three smaller elements that lead to a much bigger picture.No action movie is complete without an epic score and Christopher Nolan has once again teamed up with the infamous Hans Zimmer following the success of their collaboration for The Dark Knight Rises. Given the lack of dialogue, the score is the ""leading character in the film."" The soundtrack is the star of the film.With that, the film divulges into three interlocking chapters but is told from three different perspectives. There's 'The Mole, One Week', taking place on the harbour wall from which thousands were rescued and where we see a commander (Kenneth Branagh) trying to make sense of the disaster. There's 'The Sea, One Day', where we see civilian sailor Mark Rylance set off from the English south coast. And there's 'The Air, One Hour', in which RAF pilot Farrier (Tom Hardy) engages in dogfights with the Luftwaffe. There are other characters – young troops on the beach played Fionn Whitehead and Harry Styles; a disturbed soldier (Cillian Murphy) rescued from the hull of a sinking warship. Yet as much as these familiar faces give us something to grab onto, this is a war film without heroes or a straightforward story. The event is the story. If that means some of the film feels chilly, a little distant, it's at the expense of easy sympathy and simplistic drama.Sir. Churchill called Dunkirk a 'miracle'. The newspapers tagged it a 'triumph'. Nolan resists any punch-the-air celebration. Hans Zimmer's score scrapes away at you throughout, piling unease on unease before flirting with Elgar's war remembrance anthem 'Nimrod' and backing off, as if embarrassed.Questions are posed about the British government: a survivor asks a RAF pilot back home, 'Where the hell were you?'. The older generation owes a debt to the young: 'That old bloke wouldn't even look us in the eye,' observes one soldier. We hear Sir. Churchill's 'We shall fight on the beaches' speech, but the words come from the mouth of a dazed soldier, not the PM. There's no glory here, just survival. It's a sombre tribute that makes a distant war feel uncomfortably present.What was so brilliant about this war movie, as opposed to other blockbuster war movies, was the lack of any cheesy back story. There was no handsome soldier trying to get home to his childhood sweetheart, no lieutenant attempting to rescue a long-lost brother, no young boys crying for their mums, no romance - just a lot of actual war. The film was all the more real and heartbreaking for it.Never mind that Britain if stood alone at that precise point during the war, this film is like the Brexit version of British identity in a nutshell: proudly isolated, independent, not European, and strongest everywhere in the world.Go watch this in an IMAX Cinema if you can. This is a 2017 must- watch. A must see if you're English. A must see if you're Scottish. A must see if you're British.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

Fantastic and the best World War movie,"I felt an array of emotions while watching this movie. Dunkirk played with my head and heart at many different levels. Three stories playing side by side for Air, Water and Land. I felt the passion and the amount of work gone down in making it. Very expensive indeed! Best part of the movie for me was the background score by Hans Zimmerman. The fact that he used Nolan's pocket watch to get the ticking sounds gives the music a personal touch. Christopher Nolan should get an Oscar for Dunkirk.It isn't just another War movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Nolan's Least Ambitious Work Yet,"Dunkirk is a World War II action thriller written and directed by a true giant of Hollywood: Christopher Nolan. Nolan's greatest strength as a filmmaker is his ability to take tried-and-true film archetypes and reimagine them in refreshing and thrilling ways. Before the film was released, he claimed that he would do the same to the classic war film with Dunkirk, saying that ""this is my most experimental film since Memento"". Unfortunately, the reality is far from the case.Dunkirk is very competently put together as a film from a master director like Nolan should be. It is very nice to look at; the wide shots are epic, and the action sequences look consistently great. It is also one of Nolan's most intelligible films, as the sound mixing actually lets you hear the very little dialogue there actually is. The plot is very easy to follow even with the slightly off-kilter non-linear storytelling. It's just a very solid film that doesn't overstay its welcome; it comes in to tell a little story about WWII with little to no character depth and gets out.However, it is this very fact that puzzles me. It's such a standard war film that it's baffling to me how Nolan saw this as an experimental work. Sure, the slightly non-linear story adds a bit of flair, but it is nothing that hasn't been done in a thousand other war films. The characters express their personalities by body language and few lines of dialogue; Saving Private Ryan, Full Metal Jacket, Band of Brothers do it better. There is a civilian element to the story: many modern war films include this. I'm just not seeing what is special about this film. And that's really a disappointment coming from my favorite modern director. In some ways, I would have appreciated Dunkirk more if Nolan tried something crazy and completely flopped (as was the case with Tenet).Little risked was little gained in the case of Dunkirk. It is a slickly produced war film that is enjoyable but will not stick with the filmgoing public beyond its box office shelf life.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Nolan's War Blockbuster,"A beautiful movie with the best visuals, music, acting and sound you could hope for. The cool thing is that it is told from 3 different perspectives, and happening at different speed of time. One story goes over one week, one story goes over one day, and the last over one hour.My problem with the movie is mainly 2 things:1. As a hardcore Nolan-fan i was expecting at least some kind of different perspective on the war- genre, something that would make me think, or see things I have seen before from a different view.2. I felt like there were too many people, or main characters you didn't get to know well enough to care about, so the movie's emotion did not struck me as it maybe was supposed to. If there was less action, and more character development, I maybe would care more about them.Overall an insanely well created movie, but more for the mainstream action/war-fans than the mindbender fans.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Not like any other Nolan Movie & definitely Not like any other War Movie!,"Christopher Nolan, Hans Zimmer, Mark Rylance, Tom Hardy, Kenneth Branagh & Cillian Murphy. What else does one need? A 1hr 47min (Nolan's shortest feature film after Following) epic filled with lots of breathtaking moments. It's only the second time that Nolan touches the Non-linear story telling & he does the magic again. Last time was back in 2000 when he gave us Memento. Dunkirk isn't a war Movie. It's more than that. It a story about survival & perseverance. Direction & storytelling at it's peak. There was nothing much Nolan could have done since the history has already been written and it cannot be changed. But what he did with the History of Dunkirk is truly amazing. One will not see any Nazi in the whole movie but still feel their presence. Screen time & dialogues of Hardy & Murphy are not much that one would have hoped for but still they did justice to what they got. Without Zimmer this soon to be a classic would have been impossible. That ""Tick, Tick, Tick,, Tick"" tone set the intense atmosphere, just like he did with Time (Inception) & Docking Theme (Interstellar). Nolan is incomplete without Zimmer.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Good Film - Although Styles' Storyline Will Make You Angry,"This is a typical Nolan film, where it's very slick, very expensive, well-filmed, and well-acted.Dunkirk was a massive undertaking. Chamberlain's failings as PM and a host of other factors left so many soldiers stranded on the beach that if they were captured or killed, the war would have been over.Churchill put Operation Dynamo into action - mobilising as many as were able to rescue the soldiers stranded in Dunkirk, despite some people in parliament and the British public calling for surrender to Hitler while there could still be 'good' terms made for England.Civilians and soldiers alike - people who had seen war and those who hadn't - showed immense bravery throughout every aspect of the operation.As to historical accuracy, the events themselves are broadly true. French soldiers were denied being evacuated at first, until Churchill specifically said that EVERYONE should be pulled out.But I really can't attest to one aspect of the story, and that's the bits with Harry Styles and his lot, who act like selfish pig dogs throughout. It is infuriating. I really can't believe that aspect of the film, having been in the army myself and studied military history. When push comes to shove, even shell-shocked soldiers do their best for others.Also, not sure why Nolan chose to leave out the entirety of the RAF's contribution to the fighting. They were not, as the film seems to suggest by leaving out their actions, left out of the battle entirely. The film suggests only a small number of planes fought. In fact, most we engaged in heavy combat keeping Nazi bombers and fighters off the beaches. It's an odd thing to me.Overall, a good film.But I do feel most acted in a lot better form than anything Harry Styles and his ilk do in this movie. I'd have enjoyed this film more if he'd been blown to bits in the end, to be honest.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

A Cinematic Experience,"Going into Dunkirk, I thought the movie would be the modern Saving Private Ryan due to the rave reviews it had been receiving. However I was pleasantly surprised by the cinematic experience created by Christopher Nolan. The movie, through Nolan's now trademark convoluted timelines, tends to disregard the complexities that particular war movies may create and focuses more on the raw emotions of the actors that tied together with the harrowing visuals makes Dunkirk one to watch in 2017. Also who would have though Harry Styles could actually act. Overall the film is terrific, though those who are more intrigued by dialogue driven movies may not enjoy it as others as the dialogue in this movie is kept to a minimum",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

Worst Nolan's movie,"It was absolutely great cinematography but the story just wasn't that joyful as the rating. ""Dunkirk"" is a tense and gripping war film that delivers a visceral and immersive experience. The nonlinear storytelling adds an extra layer of complexity to the already intense action sequences, creating a sense of disorientation that puts the audience right in the middle of the chaos. The performances are solid across the board, but the real star of the movie is the stunning cinematography and sound design. The aerial dogfights are breathtaking, and the ticking clock soundtrack adds an extra layer of tension. The film is also notable for its lack of graphic violence, which only serves to make the moments of danger and suspense even more impactful. While the nonlinear structure may not be to everyone's taste, ""Dunkirk"" is a masterclass in tension and suspense that showcases Nolan's talent for crafting unforgettable cinematic experiences.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"Intense, taut, and Rylance","How could Christopher Nolan, a lover of twisted timelines and bender of perceived realities, make a WWII movie interesting? With the evacuation of Dunkirk, he's chosen what would appear to be a straightforward, linear plot. Get from the city to the coast, get from the coast to a boat, and get from the boat to the other side of the English Channel to enjoy the vista that is (are) the White Cliffs of Dover.His creative touch, and what makes the movie an entertaining thrill, is to follow three interwoven timelines: (i) if by land; (ii) if by sea; and (iii) if by Spitfire. The characters are disposable, much like people in war, yet Mark Rylance proves again his mettle as one of the most under-appreciated actors of our time, and Harry Styles perfunctorily portrays the human version of a turd without too much distraction. Would David Bowie have found a role had he lived long enough? Sting is surely still available, and Phil Collins could always use more screen time.Dunkirk reminds us that war is hell, some humans are good people, and ultimately nothing really matters unless you get your story printed in the newspapers. What good is the spectacle if no one sees it? That's why movies have advertising budgets, after all.As for the Hans Zimmer score, which makes overuse of Shepard tones in order to imbue intensity, it's fine. It's bombastic and detracting, and the movie could have done entirely without music without affecting the intensity, urgency, or sense of desperation.Much like Quentin Tarantino, Christopher Nolan wants you to know he's a great filmmaker, and you can feel it oozing from the screen. Perhaps they could stand to use a little more Rylance in their lives.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
A bit over-ambitious,"The three time-lines of this film don't work for me. I appreciate that the span of the Dunkirk evacuation has to be compressed and expanded, but the approach here seems like a workaround.The sound track is a big distraction - too loud and largely unnecessary.There are many technical and military aspects that are simply flawed.On my second viewing I found these negatives to be really frustrating.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
A very good war film,"I'm a big fan of Nolan. So this might be a biased review.A war film which focuses mainly on fleeing rather than fighting can only become a classic when one of the best directors in the history of film making puts his mind to it. This is unlike the other second world war films, it avoids all the violence and gory. Instead of that its focused on the emotions of the characters. This is a brave approach for a war film and the end result was spectacular.The cinematography was epic. The aerial shots of spitfires was mindblowingly good. This practical effect is a statement of Nolans brave and amazing visions. The following shots of soldiers put the audience in their shoes. The fear and uncertainty could be felt pouring out of the screen due the amazing work of Hoytema.And then there was Hans Zimmer. His intense soundtrack just added another layer to the emotions shown on screen. The buildup of an intense sequence or the statement of epicness by the compositions of Zimmer is pivotal to this film.The acting were great from every single actors, even the 1D guy surprised me!! The fear of the soldiers the honor of the Dawsons and the bravery of the pilots, everything were spectacularly acted by all the actors.The massive production in the end gave us a war film to remember. I think this is one of Nolan's best works so far and will be in a lot of top war film lists in the days to come.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

"Dramatic, twisted and uplifting. Not the best of Nolan, but a great attempt to retell an almost harrowing story","It can be a presumed general consensus that it is easier to become a star actor than a star director. While some enjoy cult following, others are more mainstream. Very few among them are able to consistently balance between the both which is where Christopher Nolan stands on a pedestal among his contemporaries. Nolan had a strong cult following throughout the early part of his career and then 'The Dark Knight' happened. The fans were at a fever pitch during conclusion of the trilogy with chants like ""in Nolan we trust"" reverberating the entire social media; there is no such precedence for a movie director.'Operation Dynamo' which is a code name for the evacuation of Allied soldiers from Dunkirk is a widely recorded operation that took place at the end of May 1940. When the British Expeditionary Forces along with French and Belgian armies were trapped in France surrounded by Nazi Germany troops at the height of their power, the only way out seemed to be an evacuation from Dunkirk which had adequate port facilities.The story is said from 3 perspectives -LAND: Where the ground troops are desperate to find their way to any of the ships available that can ferry them home;SEA: Told from the view of crew of one among many merchant navy and personal boats which came to the rescueAIR: A Spitfire squadron of three in lookout for any Luftwaffe threatsThe thing that strikes you most is the fact that you are in the middle of the operation as soon as the movie starts without a background or a narrative (even when I was not expecting one). The gloomy vista of the beach, pale and desperate soldiers, a body here and there sets up the chaotic but silent atmosphere without hardly a word being said. The electrifying yet subtle background score keeps you at the edge of your seat and takes the overall experience up a notch. A similar compliment for cinematography too.Christopher Nolan has so far been able to meet the sky high expectations of his fans and critics alike but there has always been a trick up his sleeve to wow his audience at some point in the movie. This is not that movie. It has far little character driven story to be considered as a dramatic movie and a complete lack of background narrative to be taken for a documentary. But it does hold a small trick that Nolan has perfected over the years - scrambled screenplay with intertwined timelines; It has become a bit of a habit to let the audience solve the puzzle which is his screenplay and the gratification one gets when the pieces are put together gives him a box-office hit. While I got entertained, I still find it evolving into a pattern.There have been many WWII movies. Some great ones too. What does Nolan's Dunkirk bring to the table in an already crowded genre? It neither has the grit of Saving Private Ryan as much as you hardly see a drop of blood in a war movie, nor does it feature the drama or compassion as in The Pianist or the flamboyance and entertainment value of The Great Escape. But it does hold its ground by staying grounded. There are no faux heroism sequences, an unremarkable debut of a very popular singer and does not try to suffocate itself with too many stories. The ensemble cast delivers to the point that you no longer see them to be acting. The irony of a victory in evacuation is not lost in its storytelling.Dramatic, twisted and uplifting. Not the best of Nolan, but a great attempt to retell an almost harrowing story.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
A masterclass in movie-making,"The last time we saw Dunkirk in a film was in Joe Wright's ""Atonement"" which featured a staggering five and a half minute Steadicam shot of a hell on earth beach scene. Now, thanks to the supreme talents of British director Christopher Nolan, we have an entire film devoted to the miracle of May/June 1940 that enabled some 340,000 British and French soldiers to be rescued by the British Navy and a hastily assembled fleet of over 800 small boats.Nolan is what film studies call an auteur, someone who stamps an individual style on every work that he produces. In fact, Nolan is a most unusual auteur because his films are commercially successful (most notably his ""Dark Knight"" trilogy). But he often makes his viewers work hard because frequently he likes to use a non-linear narrative (most dramatically in ""Memento"", ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"").In this sense, ""Dunkirk"" - which he wrote, produced and directed - is classic Nolan in that there are three story lines: one largely set on land and covering a week, another located mainly at sea and occupying one day, and the third taking place in the air and filling just one hour. The three narratives intersect and finally converge temporally at the end of the film. It is as well for the viewer to know this before seeing the work for the first time and it means that a complete understanding of the time-lines probably requires more than one viewing.The unusual narrative structure is not the only distinctive feature of ""Dunkirk"". Visually and aurally it is a striking film and I viewed it in IMAX which was a stunning experience. Whether it is the vast expanse of the beach with thousands of soldiers lined up or the claustrophobic bowels of a crammed ship or a close-up of a pilot in his Spitfire fighter aircraft, whether it the whine of bullets or the explosion of bombs or the howl of a Stuka dive-bomber, this is a work which is almost overwhelming. When one factors in the astonishing soundtrack from Hans Zimmer, the movie becomes a heart-pounding experience.There is a roster of familiar talented actors - notably - Kenneth Branagh, Mark Rylance, Cillian Murphy and Tom Hardy (although we barely see his face) - but Nolan deliberately cast young, newcomers to the screen in many of the soldier roles. In many ways, this is a minimalist movie: a simple plot (if complicated time-lines), comparatively little dialogue, very few women characters, no German faces at all - just an unrelenting focus from the opening scene to the closing minutes on that strip of sand and the tens of thousands on it. The end sequences teeter on the edge of jingoism, but overall this is a masterclass in movie-making.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"Heart pounding, heart breaking war thriller","Can I start off with a question? Why do we go see movies? To escape, to learn something, or to feel something. Dunkirk perfectly captures all three and, like the movie, this review will come to you in three parts.One, to escape. Watching this movie was a truly immersive experience. When the planes darted around I felt dizzy. When the soldiers gasped for air as their boat went under I could feel their anxiety and tried to reach out myself, and swim for the surface. When a bomb blew up I felt I was in danger. The suspense built throughout this movie reached levels only a true master can dream of. I don't know what made me feel this way, and maybe I'm not supposed to know. Maybe the intent wasn't for the audience to go searching for the origin, but something about this movie made me care deeply about every single character. Maybe because most of the men were just baby- faced little boys, whether they were top billing or an extra with less than a second of screen time, I wanted to rescue them. Which precisely encapsulates the history of the mission. Dunkirk was a rescue mission. They tried to save every young man stuck on that beach that day. And I could feel that. I felt in with the characters, like I knew them and was in the same boat. I wanted to survive just as much as them, but we wanted to survive together.Two, to learn something. Dunkirk is obviously based on the evacuation of Dunkirk in World War Two. We talked briefly abut this in history class but not to any large extent. As a result, I was walking into the theater knowing little about what happened except the basics. Now, Nolan's characters are all fictional, but they are drawn from the real people that made the story. The movie is fast paces and taking place along a short stretch of time. The characters are always on edge and doing something, so there is little room for exposition about their own lives. However, there is some scattered throughout, perfectly placed so that you can have that, without ever feeling forced.Three, to feel something. As I stated earlier, this movie forges a deep understanding and protective relationship with every single character. I feel like they are my babies and I want to make sure they are okay. The ending, which I won't spoil, is perfection itself. Capturing what must have been felt after Dunkirk was evacuated: relief, exhaustion, and victory.Throughout the movie there is a constant, underlying ticking noise. A clock, which they are up against. The rounds of a revolver, pointed at their heads. A fighter plane getting ready to fire, swirling above them, squealing.Obviously, this is One Direction's Harry Styles's acting debut. And yes, he can act. He's got a lot to learn, sure. But he's got raw talent you can see in this movie and I expect we will see many times in the near future.All across the board, performances are spectacular. A chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and this chain would be unbreakable. Each actor providing a step up for their partner in a scene as they build each other up. A little note I have is that most of the soldiers looked very similar. Dark hair, big eyes, and a stiff face. I assume this was a very conscious choice for the director to make.Dunkirk has three simultaneous and interspersed story lines. This works well for making sure you don't lose interest, but it depends deeply on your ability to recognize the actors. This goes back to all the soldiers looking the same. There was a part that I found to be an unnecessary tear-jerking attempt, but that's not to say it at all spoiled my enjoyment of the movie.I'm not going to go into Nolan because we all know he's proved himself as someone who can do this. However, I will say, though I am not a huge fan and haven't seen everything he's made, this is unlike anything I've seen his name attached to. It all felt so real, a stark contrast to the inception approach that nothing is.And last but not least, it's just really pretty. The wides and close ups and deep emotion each shot brings, whether you're conscious of it or not.You will find your heart beating and breaking from the opening credits to the end.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

"More potent, loud and puzzling than you might expect!","DUNKIRK - a mini-review 8 out of 10 Albert stars This movie is extremely gripping and powerful. I enjoyed it, despite the loss of life it depicts. The film tells the basic story of the Brits in Dunkirk, who were trapped by the Nazis in France. They came under steady aerial bombardment. For more basics and background, see IMDb.com I saw it in IMAX, which I understand is THE way to go with this high visual impact film. Before writing this mini review, I decided to let my thoughts ""marinate."" Now they are ready to serve: If you are thinking of seeing it, here are some things to consider: * It is violent. So is war, right? If you don't tolerate violence -- even if in historical context -- don't see it. The violence is not extreme, by the way. Someone I was with spent 3/4 of the movie looking away from the screen. * It is loud, extremely so. * The aerial combat scenes were filmed with authentic period planes, and some are intentionally crashed to make the movie. The dogfight scenes are intense and amazing. Some questions I had are these: 1. Why was no historical background given? It is bewildering to wonder how the Brits could have been stranded in such a predicament. In later discussions, people have told me that Hitler hesitated to attack because he felt the Brits were fellow Aryans. 2. How could British intelligence have been so bad that they did not know the Nazi Panzer tank divisions would advance rapidly and trap their soldiers? 3. Why were they sent into harm's way without air support, heavy artillery, tanks, etc.? I also feel that the Nazis, although the Lear villains, were also human beings, Why not understand their individual psychologies, doubts, and deaths? War is a form of murder. Let's get to know at least ONE example of who we are so happy to be murdering. So that's it for minor objections and questions. A superb film!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

A visual master piece,"Nolan is famous for his non linear way of story telling. Dunkirk also is a big example. Different characters different timings all making sense only in the end. But one thing that stands out in Dunkirk is its technical aspects. May it be the shots or the sound or even the actors, everything has got that Nolan touch. But when compared to Interstellar or even in Dark Knight rises, we have seen so many WOW moments. Dunkirk comparatively have less moments like that. But i have to say the shots are like real WOW. Talking about the story, Nolan succeeded in showing us the real aspects of war like hunger and human emotions but still it lacks a strong base, at times we are confused and at times we are heartbroken. I can only rate the movie 8 because my mind was always full of the scenes from Platoon and Casualties of war and trust me Dunkirk is nothing like that.It surely proves the capability of Nolan on making a good visual effects movie but not that great storyline.A good movie should make us question ourselves about how and why this and that happened, Dunkirk doesn't make us think so.

An Experience,"This isn't a movie. It's an experience. So I treated it as such and walked away...disoriented, since you really feel like you are there. Watch it in IMAX 70mm 15/70 rather than 5 perf 70mm.For an American like me, I'm not entirely sure what the big deal was. But to Brits it meant a lot. When the stranded soldiers are desperately wanting to get off the island, the German soldiers were closing in. Problem...you never fully sense the horror of the war like the beginning of ""Saving Private Ryan"" Instead, you get a relatively quiet movie based on a rescue mission. The battle was an absolute failure but the victory was in its retreat. Interesting concept.With most of Nolan's movies...what can you expect except total immersion. For that...what an accomplishment. For others who hate on Nolan for being...Nolan, you probably will hate on this too.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Disappointed!,"The evacuation of Dunkirk was a miracle. I had wondered what this film would have to say about it that hasn't been shown before. The beach scenes are portrayed as lines of soldiers standing quietly. There are no non-coms screaming orders or keeping order. Everyone is acting like they are waiting for afternoon tea. Air battles: repetitive. The same yellow-nosed Bf-109 gets shot down several times. (Yawn!) And the timing of the air scenes is simply unbelievable. In an effort to create suspense a Heinkel 111 takes nearly five minutes to get close enough to be shot down by a Spit. This is despite closing speeds in excess of 500 mph. Just not believable. Other efforts to create suspense are simply contrivances. The crowning disappointment is the main kick: the miracle of Dunkirk was the response of hundreds upon hundreds of small boat owners, ship owners, ferry crews....ordinary Britons who risked their lives to get anything that floats across the channel to rescue the troops. This is given short shrift, not only in following only one boat, but in so few boats actually being in the film. I don't understand the hype this film has been given. Wait for it to come out on DVD, then don't bother to see it.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Damn!  AMAZING!,"I walked into the movie with low expectations. I thought it would be one of those World War movies that's a big deal for a weekend, then nobody cares later, and I hope to GOD that this isn't the case! This movie was AMAZING! The acting, effects, sound, and all in-between was fantastic! The pacing would seem awful at first look, but it keeps you on the edge of you seat! You will be in the middle of a fast paced action scene , when it cuts to a more slow, calm shot. This works so well in the factor of: ""Whoa! What Will happen next?"" All the time.My only two complaints- The character development was minimal, and you hardly knew anybody's names.And there was sometimes buzzing from one of the soldier's microphone. I don't know if it was a mishap with the theater's speakers, though.My rating - 9.5 / 10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"An Intense Drama ""DUN"" brilliantly by Mr. Nolan.","I'll keep the review as short as possible. First of all WELL DUN Mr. Nolan. Thank You for the epic display of camera work and smoothest cinematography after a long time. If you're expecting a war-war like movie experience, you will be disappointed just like my few colleagues felt. The CGI experience and the camera work ( taken from the plane point of view) were really eye catching. The intensity was amazing and was the back ground score by Mr.Zimmer (the clock ticking) made it reach to a next level of experience. The silence which is due to fear or grief was so well displayed that one can actually feel the intensity that every soldier would have felt to go home. Less of dialogues and more of a punch and crunch situations during the evacuation was captured, blended and picturized that one could start tapping their feet. The movie displayed the nature of a human being of finding the best possible way to survive even though you have to let your own people bleed. With being selfish nature shown, the strongest character of a human being of being patient and ready to take the routes available to save as many lives was shown. The back and forth picturization of the story from different angel was the icing on the cake.Though i was so glued watching the movie, may be the story could have kept a bit long would have been best. what i feel go for it but not considering the actual war thing in your mind, rather go with a mindset of a more intense rescue mission displayed and brilliant work behind the cameras and the long distance shorts taken. for me for the direction and cinematography , the DUNKIRK should be the clear WINNER.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
A beautiful cinematic experience!!!,"First of all, coming into this movie you should not expect character development as you do in other movies, some may find the lack of connection with the main protagonists from this film as a weakness, but getting connected to one character or a group isn't the point of this film. Its more about the event that happened. You feel like you are there, right between those man hoping for another day of life, hoping to go home, hoping for a miracle... From minute one till the end you are in this movie, every shot is amazing, the scenery is astonishing, you cant look away cause everything is almost perfect. A true pleasure for the eyes, and a interesting look to this historic event.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Don't get all the hate,"I was extremely excited for this movie, but after seeing some of the negative reviews on IMDb, I kinda grew skeptical. And boy oh boy, did it blow me away! I will try to rebuke common criticisms towards this movie as best as possible. Sorry English is not my first language. 1. Lack of character development/background story makes it difficult to empathize with the characters: This is somewhat true. When the movie starts, it gets right into the action without introducing the main characters. Frankly, I got irritated at first when I had to follow these characters whom i knew nothing about. But as the film progressed, their personalities started to manifest through their actions, and I naturally grew to care for them. I know some moviegoers prefer/demand to know more about their background stories, for example: do they have loved ones at home? did they commit crimes before?, etc. Personally, I think that has been in every other Hollywood war movies, and Nolan isn't known for beating a dead horse, but for inventing/pioneering new, unconventional ways in telling a story. I think it's refreshing to see the characters being characterized through the little actions that they take. Generally, people who bash this movie tend to compare it to Hacksaw Ridge, saying that they care more about Desmond Doss than any other character in this movie. To be honest, I just don't care about him at all. He is just the typical heroic type we have seen in other movies, so it just seems unlikely that such character will die. There is absolutely no stake at all in that movie. On the contrary, in Dunkirk, non of the character fits the heroic type; they all strive for survival. Such a realistic take on war makes it more likely that at least one of the main character will die. 2. Non-linear story telling makes the movie confusing: Personally, I didn't find any problem following this movie, simply because Nolan is so masterful in creating a flow that connects one scene to another. Despite being unchronological, three different stories in this movie are beautifully interwoven: they all complement each other in painting the Dunkirk battle in the audience's mind, and ultimately *minor spoiler* become one in the most beautiful way. I'd posit that this technique Nolan employs does not hinder but makes the movie more interesting and unique",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

A mind blowing piece of cinema and a film like none other before it,"I can safely say that you've never seen a film quite like Dunkirk before.You may think you know what your getting yourself into as you grab your ticket, order your popcorn and beveridge combo (and hopefully additional choc-top), but Christopher Nolan's anything but typical war film, that thrusts us headfirst into the Dunkirk evacuation/battle, is an experience unlike any other.Forgoing the need to follow a traditional narrative or even the need to join the audience to any one character more than another, Nolan's wholly immersive and often breath-taking big screen event, is the work of a cinematic genius at one with his craft with an ability to deliver a piece of cinema that will likely take us all some time to fully comprehend.From almost the very first frame of this visually stunning spectacle, Nolan brings us to into a thrilling fight for survival that for around 100 non-stop minutes takes us on a perilous, danger filled experience on land, sea and air as a collection of British soldiers and countrymen look to escape the beaches of Dunkirk as the German army encompasses them ever so surely.The way in which Nolan uses this history making moment of World-War 2 to explore a pulse-pounding tale of survival and sacrifice is incredible and delivered through a non-linear fashion that plays with timeframes and portrays numerous scenes through different points of view, Nolan has crafted a war film cume thriller that must surely be one of the tensest films ever made.You feel every bullet passing through the air, you feel the ominous dread of planes flying over head unleashing hell from above, you feel the full force of a crash landing or crushed bones and you sense the unrelenting will to survive, all playing out through a spectacularly crafted film production.Seeing Dunkirk in Imax is a jaw dropping experience and this is a one of those films that all should seek to catch on the nearest biggest screen available.Nolan who alongside DOP Hoyte Van Hoytema and renowned composer Hans Zimmer has crafted an undeniably impressive big screen creation. Zimmer's frantic tension racketing score and Hoytema's expansive lens (perfect for Imax enjoyment) working alongside Nolan and his committed cast that is spearheaded by Fionn Whitehead's young solider Tommy, Tom Hardy's dogged pilot Farrier, Mark Rylance's everyday seaman turned hero Mr. Dawson, Cillian Murphy's shell-shocked and nameless survivor and yep One Direction's Harry Style's Alex, Dunkirk is an all round production that will likely partake in an abundance of technical end of year awards and hopefully past-due awards recognition for Nolan himself.A master of his art for so long now, Dunkirk feels like the final undeniable piece of Nolan's filmography puzzle and for anyone that has felt in the past that Nolan is undeserving of the praise he has so far received, good luck arguing against it now after sitting through this impeccably designed and executed thrill-ride that achieves its goal of not delieveing a history lesson but an utterly captivating encapsulation of the Dunkirk event.Final Say –While it has some minor flaws and foibles (what film doesn't?), Dunkirk is clearly the work of a master director that acts as groundbreaking cinema that should be sought out by any who have even a passing interest in film.A white-knuckle examination of an unbelievable true life event, that's filled with spectacle but most importantly an understated yet touching and thought- provoking power, Dunkirk is easily one of the years must-see film's and a likely all time classic of the war genre.5 pieces of bread out of 5",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"Good war movie, but not great.","It was a good movie as far as visual effects. However, there was very little acting. The movie made the German air force look small and inept. Whereas the RAF fighter was able to fight on, and on, and on, and fly forever without fuel, and shoot down German planes faster than Rambo mowing down Russians with AK-47s, The aircraft also never ran out of ammunition, like a cop in an action movie who never reloads and shoots hundreds of bullets. If you have an aviation background like me, you will know that with weight and balance issues, bullets are limited to a certain amount. My other issue, being a person of french descent, was the total lack of time given to the french soldiers who held the line so that the British could escape. The french fought bravely, unlike many Americans think. But they suffered from poor generalship at the time. They had better tanks than the Germans, but these were poorly deployed. Overall, despite these mistakes, it was a good weekend movie. I gave it 6 stars.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Survival! Survival! Survival!,"We all knew that Dunkirk was going to be a huge, sprawling epic, in every sense of the word - something that is the lifeblood of the modern cinema. I also sensed we were going to see an ensemble cast showing the audience small, but important pieces of the action at Dunkirk. And that is precisely what Dunkirk is all about. However, one factor looms larger than all the hopes for character development and structure within the basic storyline of the mass evacuation of allied soldiers from Dunkirk in the face of resistance from the German Army. That factor is the need for survival, survival of the huge amount of men trapped on a beach in Dunkirk. I suspect that the survival instinct at its most basic is something that modern man rarely experiences, so we are at the mercy of the Director, Christopher Nolan, who has to make us feel it. I think he succeeds rather well. He has to impress upon us the huge dangers these men felt for every minute of what definitely must have felt like a 24 hour day. What does survival require? Animal instincts surely come to the fore, we saw that in the instance of Cillian Murphy's war shocked soldier, whose cowardice threatens the lives of those around him, in the opportunism of the two young soldiers who cheat their way back onto the ship that potentially offered them the chance of freedom, only to see it bombed to nothing by the Lutwaffe. The technical aspects of the film are excellent. The attention to detail, the prevailing atmosphere of surreal unreality, the stark visual battle sequences, are all excellent. I was totally immersed in this film, as I am sure others are when they see it. Outside the cinema, groups of people stood discussing it. My scriptwriting tutor used to call it ""instant success"". This film is an instant success, and I feel it could become a cinema classic. Mary Gumsley",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
undeniable skills,"It's 1940. Allied forces are trapped around the beaches of Dunkirk. Naval Commander Bolton (Kenneth Branagh) organizes the evacuation from the pier. Tommy is the last survivor of his squad. With another soldier, they pretend to be stretcher bearers to sneak onto the medical ship. Farrier (Tom Hardy) flies one of 3 Spitfires into action. Dawson (Mark Rylance) with his son Peter and friend George Mills pilot his pleasure craft to the rescue. They find a survivor (Cillian Murphy) from a sunken vessel.Christopher Nolan delivers a visual film of compelling action. He uses great silences. The flying sequences are impeccable. The sea action is compelling with some real ships. I have a bit of hesitation with the portrayal of some of the soldiers. The Cillian Murphy character is perfectly fine as a soldier suffering PTSD. If he's the only one, it would be a very compelling portrayal but Nolan puts in too many. I'm also willing to accept Tommy's lies to escape. It's not until the beached boat where there seems to be a problem. I can understand the Lord of the Flies mentality. With Germans taking potshots at them, there are two logical moves. They could either go out and fight or hide and wait. They have guns and fighting is possible. There is no logical reason to kick out Frenchie which would only prove their existence in the boat. They are acting irrationally which is excusable but Tommy needs to call it out. I would also want a separate section with soldiers fighting rear guard action. Tommy's tale could be so different and more action packed if he stayed to fight for a little while. Overall, Nolan's film-making skills are undeniable and this is a compelling exploration of this historical event.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"Visceral, haunting, breathtaking -- Nolan is back!","The wait is finally over. This is the most excited I've been to watch a movie in years. And it sure was worth the wait.To sum up this movie in one line: ""Nolan does justice to war."" But for someone who has recently been obsessed by the happenings of WW2, I'd go so far as to say Nolan has given us one for the ages. Every shot, every scene has been carefully constructed so as to elicit the perfect reaction from the audience. There is minimal dialogue. Nolan has received criticism for over-explaining things in previous movies. Here he takes a total 180° turn in that regard, giving us one of the most realistic portrayals of war while keeping it truly engaging.You would do well to know a little about the miracle of Dunkirk before stepping into the theater. Nolan makes no excuses for you as the audience. His approach towards telling the story is unique in that few war movies have zero backstory. This also helps to keep the movie tight and gripping from start to finish.Hans Zimmer is in his element. Stellar performances from the ensemble cast.Nolan's best? Definitely right up there.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"Overall, an awe inspiring and unique war story that doesn't focus on the grit.","The Good: It gives a great sense of suspension with the constant and random air, land, and sea attacks hitting you hard with the impression of being surrounded. I recommend seeing it in theaters for the audio quality of sound that the air raids give off; it really strikes the fear into you when you hear the sirens of Stukas coming for you. I had some doubts of having Harry Styles being in a war film, but, I realized his presence adds to the environment making his fans wonder if he is going to get killed or not. The historical immersion is is prominent with to date uniforms and weapons. You'll hear constant references to the units such as Grenadiers or Highlanders which to me is a definite bonus to my immersion with the story. The characters portrayed may not be real ,however the stories that are told are a combination of facts condensed (like Band Of Brothers or The Pacific). The story telling is unique as it sets up a time line from each character's perspective to culminate into the big picture. The focus is not on the usual grit and gore, its about telling the story of what happened. The approach is also unique in the aspect that they talk as little as possible. This helps the movie by making it more of an experience, visually seeing what is going on and sometimes guessing what the characters are doing.The Bad:It's a British based film, there are going to be parts where some Americans do not understand the lingo or slang such as ""lorries"" or ""petrol"" and some people might not understand the geography like when one of the pilots asks about Calais. You do not get a grip much on who is who. The pilots are always masked and the minimalist approach on talking slightly holds it back. You just see this or that guy, not Alex or Tommy.Overall,I think it is a step above the trash of heroic blood and guts war movies. It makes it's stand on the struggles of the many rather than the few. Go see it in theaters it is worth the ticket.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
A WWII depiction of verisimilitude,"Has Christopher Nolan struck gold again? Yes he has.Where do I start with this one? I am putty in the hands of films. They can very easily manipulate me emotionally and linger on in my mind for days and even months. But of late, despite this certain weakness, I wasn't being able to spot films of such caliber that could leave a long-lasting impression on me even though I really have been watching some great movies. But now, finally, that spell has been broken. Dunkirk has taken me on a ride, plunged me into the cold depths of the English Channel, made me scramble for life aboard a sinking ship and pray to dear God for a miracle. It is exactly that, which we witness on screen. With not much of a particularly intricate story to tell, it is simply a raw and immersive visual feast of the horrors of war.Right from scene 1, you're thrown into action. The film lives and breathes in the moment, just like the characters who're trying to escape fate and have hardly any time on their hands for anything else. There is not a single scene that is wasted and due to its tight run-time, the film feels perfectly measured. Every frame brings with it a sense of uneasiness and an overbearing feeling of a portentous, if not ominous, immediate future.In classic Nolan style, we see perfectly color-graded shots,frequent angled viewpoints and a non-linear narrative consisting of three separate timelines occurring very close to one another which eventually merge in the end. The cinematography is flawless and the use of real locations and props (including even the planes and boats) only add to the authenticity. Hans Zimmer's background score is haunting and forms an interdependent relationship with the visual proceedings of the film, elevating our experience to the stirring heights of amazement. The crescendo of the tense, shrill sounds of strings with the arrival of an enemy plane or just the tick-tick- tick of a clock, signifying the race against time, laying low in the background of momentarily silent scenes can give anyone the shivers.The characters we see are not allowed to sit with us and tell us the stories of their past lives. We don't know if some young man left a fiancé at home or grew up with only one parent. No one person receives special focus and our attention is never drawn away from the war. In spite of this, just the spanning theme of agony and fear makes us root for every single one of them, even the ones we see for only a few seconds. We palpitate and draw sharp breaths every time a rescue attempt is thwarted mercilessly by the Germans or someone is fighting for life in a dire situation.""Survival isn't fair"" is very rightly said by one soldier in the movie. Especially when circumstances are so trying that the basic thread of hope that binds humanity together is being stretched to its limit, one should not be expected to think of anyone but one's own self. However, every now and then, when we see a ray of compassion breaking through the rock solid layer of desperation and the ugliness it can lead to, we're reminded of the power of our hearts. When a mass of civilian boats appear on the horizon to save the soldiers or when a fighter pilot makes sure to destroy an enemy plane even when he's about to fall, we are made to realize that empathy is really all that defines us. No one was born of special mettle but built it up in themselves and let it out even when it was hardest for them to do so. It renews the belief that maybe we too have such potential within us.While I do think watching the movie in IMAX will make it even more extraordinary than it already is (and I heavily regret not being able to do that), Dunkirk will be marvelous irrespective of the format it's viewed in.This is a story of something true that definitely took place in the past. People went through living hell and survived. But watching this film, it was jarring to accept this blatant yet almost unbelievable fact. While we may never come close to knowing what it must really have been like to exist even for a second in the reality of that sort of terror, we can try beginning to fathom it by finding out how, by just being a mere spectator of a fictitious recording of the same events, we can be so severely moved.P.S. If this doesn't win an Oscar, I don't know what will.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Unbelievable rubbish,"I now believe that critics are total fakes. Anyone who gives this a good review is in the pay of Hollywood studios or is a pretentious moron who likes to see some hidden meaning where there isn't any.The biggest problem is that the characters are so poorly developed that you don't care whether they live or die.Throwing in some A list stage actors doesn't take this film to another level it just emphasises what a poor film it is.

Lack of story depth,"I loved the scenes but not the story. It is not deep and not well connected. The timeline is not linear and few times when it switched to other location it was not so easy to track the time. Also the main characters didn't show much emotions, so I guess that this was the reason that also I (as a viewer) didn't.

And I thought Split was the most intense film of the year...,"Dunkirk is the 10th movie of one of the best directors of the generation, Christopher Nolan. That alone was a reason to get hyped about it. It's about a real life event in WW2, the Dunkirk evacuation. No character backgrounds, no specific interactions, just that event alone from three perspectives, the dock (one week), the sea (one day) and the air (one hour). And they are all shown in parallel.There is barely a character with at least some background, but still, Nolan somehow manages to create such intensity and anxiety, you will spend 100 minutes at the edge of your seat, barely breathing. One of the concern about a film was its PG-13 rating, but it doesn't even need it. It doesn't take only blood and gore to express the horrors of war. It can help, yes, but Nolan didn't need it. The performances were very good too. I was a bit skeptical about the casting of Harry Styles, but he gave one of the best performances in the movie. And there is also one more thing that helped build the anxiety, and that's Hans Zimmer's score. Of course, I expected no less from Hans Zimmer, but once again, he surprises with the always present clock-ticking noise that increases the sense of urgency. And when all that anxiety is over, it gives us some beautiful moments for the very end.With no blood and no character development, this incredibly shot film will keep you on the edge.

One of the most realistic depictions of war in cinema history,"Many war movies in the past have focused on character development and heroes within a battle. However Dunkirk showcases the horrific aspects of war to a greater extent than ever seen. Nolan encapsulates the terror of battle, the desperation for freedom and above all suspends the viewer in constant anxiety thanks to Hans Zimmer's excellent yet terrifying score. Above all this movie was just real; some might say to its detriment but personally I have never walked out of cinema so speechless in my entire life.

I'm stunned people hated this film - but then -,"I watch just about every war movie and tele series I can, and Dunkirk is my favourite to date. It's totally brilliant and clever, but most of all, totally different to others in this genre, which I reckon is at the heart of why people hate it so passionately.In a way, calling it a war film is a misnomer. This is not the stereotypical war flick, in any way. It's not about being in the blood and muck with everyone dying around you while you hang by a thread - if you want that, something like Black Hawk Down can't be beaten. It's not about individual failure or triumph - say Jarhead or the Hurt Locker - nor even about how 'the unit' works - that's what Band of Brothers or Generation Kill has well and truly covered.It's really an evacuation movie - a movie about being trapped, and about time closing in on those poor bastards on that beach, the psychological experience of that.Aside from it being a beautiful movie to look at, and exploring the psychological experience in a way I've not seen in a war movie before, the way time is handled in this film is to me the truly magic part. It's almost as though time is actually the main character of this film. It circles around and back around, creating and maximising that feeling that these guys are pawns, trapped, waiting, always waiting for what happens next, (just as those at Dunkirk must have waited,) not knowing if anything would happen before the enemy got onto that beach. It reminds me of the book Catch 22 by Joseph Heller, where the timeline circles around three times, escalating at each pass, the pressure only increasing. I admit I usually hate non chronological movies, with the proviso, unless it serves a purpose - and this movie is one of the very, very few that fit that proviso for me.I admit that if you watch war movies for action, you're going to hate this film - but for a film that captures a psychological truth of this part of the war, this film stands brilliantly alone. I love it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

A reasonable review,"This is a reasonable review that will surely disappoint both sides - the ones that love it and the ones that hate it.Nolan has such a huge, loyal following that this film would be loved no matter what. As of now, this film has shot up the IMDb top 250 and is currently at number 55.No. This film, is not the 55th best film of all time. That's completely unreasonable.Before you call me a hater, my favorite film of all time is Inception. I loved Nolan's Batman films (and I normally don't like Batman films) and Memento, as well as Interstellar and the amazing The Prestige (also in my top 10).But this film is not that good.I saw this film yesterday a few weeks after it came out. The volume was completely normal. People criticized the ultra-loud soundtrack, but it seems that this was adjusted somehow because the audio was not just not-very-loud, it might have been a little on the soft side. (For the sake of reference: I saw it in a big North American theater in IMAX.)I know what people mean when they say ""loud"" when referring to Nolan's films. Inception was very loud and The Dark Knight Rises was the loudest film I've ever heard/seen in my life. So I'm not doubting anyone.As to the film - I don't get why Hardy was cast in this film. I'm not sure what his contribution was - other than bring his big name to the investors of the film. It really could've been anyone else and would not have made any difference.I like the fact that they used a lot of practical effects and huge numbers of extras, but why didn't they use CGI to augment the production. I don't see it as practical-vs-CGI, they can be used together. Oh well.The soundtrack was okay. Nothing special. Sometimes it added to the mood, sometimes it was annoying and distracting.The use of celluloid film instead of digital was interesting. The film had a nice grain to it, I like the saturation of analog film and since this was a movie set in the past, the use of film was appropriate.Overall a good film. I don't get the 10 star reviews or the 1 star ones and I feel that the 10-star ones have a Nolan bonus while the 1-star ones are compensating for the 10-star ones or have systems where instead of not- awarding stars for something they didn't like or something missing, are instead giving minus stars for every flaw until there are no points left to deduct.Be reasonable. 7/10.

A message to the naysayers.,"This is one of my all time favourite movies. Hats off to Christopher Nolan who's done once again. It's the closest thing to being actually in Dunkirk. Nolan makes you experience the confusion, desperation and fear the actual soldiers must have felt and only a director of his calibre can achieve that. 
But what has really prompted me write this review is seeing the constant bad ratings this movie has been getting lately and I can only think of two reasons for this recent trend: either some trolls with a lot of time in their hands are at work on imdb and or there has been an increasing number of ignorant reviewers submitting their opinions of movies that are well beyond their intellectual capacity. To the former I say, ""What you are doing is low, sad and pathetic"" and to the latter, ""Please refrain from reviewing movies you can't understand as it is not fair for works of art like Dunkirk to be brought down by ignorance.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

I loved every minute of Dunkirk,"Being the last day of the year, I thought I should review my absolute favourite film of 2017. Dunkirk directed by Christopher Nolan, was a movie which blew me away. I had to see it more than once in cinemas, due to how stunning it was visually. The beach, the ocean and the sky all looked incredible, with the help of little to no CGI, but just purely amazing cinematography. The reason as to why I love this film so much is because of how different and unconventional it is. Dunkirk represents war in the most realistic way. It shows you that in moments of horror, you don't always get to know the soldiers around you and their back story. This film deliberately throws the audience into the climax from the beginning. I loved how Christopher Nolan was able to tell such a simple story in a really complex way. This is shown with his play on time, which made the film all the more riveting. The score by Hans Zimmer added so much, and worked really well with the sounds of war. At times I was unable to seperate the two. Everything from the vulnerable performances to the runtime was perfect. I loved every minute of Dunkirk. The ending left me with goosebumps. So therefore I give it a 10. I've noticed I've mostly been reviewing movies I love, so in between my Star Wars series I will be sharing my thoughts on some films I hate with a passion... Look forward to that.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"The ""featured review"" is wrong","OK so hear me out. Yes, the first time I watched it I was a bit bored. I went online and learned all about what happened at Dunkirk, and watched it again. It was much better after knowing what happened. How people were trying to get out of France and the panic it created.The same thing happened to me with Zodiac. At first I thought it was a bit boring until I re-watched it after learning a lot about it. I live in Norcal and was not alive when it was happening, but never the less my parents were and they had stories to tell me. My grandfather worked in the DOJ with fingerprinting, so he had worked the case too. I am sad that he died before I could talk to him about the case.Anyhow, that's the same thing with Dunkirk. If you learn about what happened then re-watched or watched for the first time it will all make sense, and won't seem so boring.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"A film with no real center and told from multiple point of views, Dunkirk is nevertheless a showcase of artistry and emotional beats","Non-linear story lines can get lost and muddied under a lesser director, but not with Nolan. A film with no real center and told from multiple point of views, Dunkirk is nevertheless a showcase of artistry and emotional beats.Dunkirk is told from three perspectives, all under duress from the same enemy. The film is a masterpiece in editing as it builds drama and tension by exchanging scenes between the multiple point of views to present character development. The first half hour builds the premise as the characters find ways to escape their encirclement from the enemy. As the story progresses scenes are alternatively presented to show moments of despair, relief and hope. Solid acting from the cast carries the film and makes the viewers sympathize with their predicament. Heroism is sprinkled throughout, never missing the point that in war casualty is inevitable. Sacrifice, trauma, the need for self-preservation and survival is ever present and is explored by the various interactions between the characters.The film's truly shines in the artistic department. Glorious cinematography, production design, special effects and powerful score. It is worth watching for those qualities alone.Ultimately, the premise of having no real center is what makes Dunkirk short of a masterpiece.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Nolan did it again!,"Wow, but really.This movie should be seen on the biggest screen available (IMAX very recommended). The Sound mixing and editing are so amazing that in some scenes the whole theater trembled like in an earthquake.For very long moments Dunkirk acts like a horror film. The Germans are the Unseen enemies of the movie that just want to destroy the British heroes. Like the Joker of The Dark Knight they are very scary and you never know when they will attack.It's been 2 days after I watch the movie and some scenes from it not yet leave from my head. Christopher Nolan isn't just a good director but, alongside Edgar Wright, the real superhero of this summer.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Another fantastic war film,"Nolan's Dunkirk for me is another in quite an exclusive club of incredible war films. I really enjoyed the way the story is told through various eyes which allows viewers to understand the war through different perceptions. The cinematography in this film is also sensational and will do enough for fans of visuals over story. The characters are also given enough dialogue and time on screen for us, as viewers, to care about them. The only reason this is not a 10 for me is because since watching Dunkirk and writing this review i have watched 1917 and Saving Private Ryan which are 10/10 war films and Dunkirk for me just falls short of reaching those levels.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
First Nolan history movie,"Dear readers, Dunkirk (or Dunkerque in French) is a based on history movie that recalls about the allies soldiers of World War II that had been trapped in Dunkirk, a city in Northern France. The beginning of this movie is quite epic, but after watching it, there are some critics that I need to deliver as a movie lover. The critique is about the plot itself. I love Christoper Nolan. I watched all of his movies that are always mind-blowing, so that when I watched Dunkirk, I hoped that I can see a mind-blowing movie of history of World War II. My expectation was not really fulfilled, but at least I can enjoy the beautiful landscape of war zones. Well, Nolan is not a history movies director so far, so that he must learn a lot from the history movies directors that are more experienced to create a beautiful war-plot. In Dunkirk, you can not understand the plot. Who against whom? Why he did that? Or who with whom? You could only understand it if you are history lover or if you read a lot about World War II, but that is the history movies Director's part isn't it: To make understand the audience about the history. In this Dunkirk, I am so sorry to say that Nolan did not explain the big plot before the Dunkirk events, for example there was not an explanation why the soldiers were trapped in Dunkirk and why there were the divisions of attacking strategy between Infantry, Navy, and Marine soldiers, and also there was no such a good ending to explain who finally wins Dunkirk event. Based on my experiences watching Nolan's movies, he tries to mind-blow people with the plots, but in Dunkirk, I feel just watch National Geographic series about the war. Sorry Nolan, as a big fan of your movies, please learn to make war movies plots.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Visual Expresion Vs Character Expression,"If we valued the expression of motion picture to be the cult climax of visual connotation, Dunkirk would be a solved masterpiece. I personally felt no indicator of time or pressure to feel lost in the story in the whole run time of the film. Nolan uses high angle shots to explore this open fantasising and still rather unexplored area of time in history on screen. The sound track that booms the planes war flight delivers the chill of placing you in sand on Dunkirk. But the characters delivering this story and map out the foundation of the war frame and harness no power to connect personal emotion to screen.Do we ask the question then, should Nolan have used characters to deliver the story along the way to develop that connection on screen with human emotion or was it passive enough to allow the cinematic expense of ""war in action"" to be enough? If we pulled out any of the boys acting in this piece and placed them in octane drama and asked them to deliver more dialogue, they would drown in ordinary mundane common muck. True Harry Styles cannot really be faulted for this first time big screen appearance  and his ability to act should be credited accordingly. However if human emotion is the way to value cinema then this film just lacked that simple connection to make you fight for someone or better yet, the British soldiers that were fighting for the time they lived in.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Excellent,"An expertly crafted film on Dunkirk. Christopher Nolan and Hanz Zimmer deliver the suspense in this true epic. The sound, acting, and effects are all top shelf. The dread runs thick throughout and I honestly don't think I could take much more. I'm happy it's less than 2 hours. I'd probably rate it higher if it wasn't so dreadful. I'm sure it's fairly honest to it's history though so maybe I'm being to harsh. WWII was most certainly not a happy time. Easy 8/10 for me and maybe even higher for you? Check it out.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Best & Most Realistic War Film Of The Current Century. Non-Stop Tension. Perfect 10.,"By the standards I set for the depiction of war on film, this is a perfect movie. This film needs no love story, or 30 minutes of background monologue from Tom Hanks, or cheesy soundtrack music for marketing purposes. This is 100 minutes of tension, fear, uncertainty and confusion. In the fog of war, there is no room for all of that sentimentality that Spielberg and other filmmakers have been propagating for decades in war flicks. So, maybe your mom or your girlfriend won't find this wartime experience enjoyable... ok, so don't ask them to share it with you. Too many filmmakers think they are being clever by placating studio executives and/or ratings boards and softening their films. Afterwards, they brag about the love story that afforded them more violence or an extra 45 minutes in the theaters. In an attempt to make a movie with something for everyone, they end up with a film that is somewhat inauthentic when portraying the actual war. In reality, guys that sit around telling stories and staring at black-and-white photos in a war-zone, die in that war-zone.In 'Dunkirk' (2017), Christopher Nolan avoids all of the mistakes of past directors when depicting war on film. 'Saving Private Ryan' (1998) is one of my favorite films, and I gave it an 8 rating on IMDB. An 8 rating sometimes represents a film that could have been perfect, but fell short for some reason. In the case of 'Private Ryan', the film starts authentic and becomes more of a family film. That's stupid - we don't send children to war. We don't take our girlfriends or our mothers to war. We don't take an orchestra to play uplifting music before we charge, or sad music while we talk about our time back home. 'Dunkirk' keeps the tension and tone for the full 100 minutes. No sappy love stories or cheesy music - just war and the effects of war on individuals.'Dunkirk' (2017) also contains the best non-verbal acting in an war film that I have ever seen. For decades, we depicted war through the designer glasses of Hollywood - where everyone speaks clear English and all soldiers look like movie stars. WWII was a WORLD war, including many countries and languages. Add some hearing damage from explosions, and people had to learn to communicate with their eyes and body language. Non-verbal communication doesn't always translate well through film, so Hollywood dumbs everything down for the viewer with dialog. Much like war, ""Dunkirk' requires complete attention to detail. Some viewers will completely miss entire subplots of the film by looking at their phones instead of watching the eye contact between two characters from across a boat. So be it - war isn't for everyone, and this film was made for people to experience war on film.Modern technology allows 'Dunkirk' (2017) to create the authentic sights and sounds of planes and bombs that are period-specific to WWII. Lightweight mountable cameras helped to create the best aerial dog-fights in a film since Howard Hughes set the standard over 60 years ago. In our era of technology, most directors choose to post-produce effects with computers. 'Dunkirk' kept the computers to a minimum. Apparently, Christopher Nolan is aware that war isn't always symmetrical or pretty.After writing a couple of hundred in-depth movie reviews, I am getting less and less comfortable awarding a point for ""My Personal Favorite"" movies. I am a 'math guy', and 1 point is 10% of a perfect 10 rating - it's significant. I have only awarded about 5 of those points so far, and I may go back and remove them later. But, I don't know how to quantify, by category or numeric value, just how refreshing it is to see a film that doesn't pander to executives trying to capture the largest possible audience, or editing down to score a PG-13 rating. My rating system doesn't have a way to award a point for being so much better at depicting realism than every other film in the genre, while using less technology. So, until I find a better way to quantify it's greatness, I am going to give 'Dunkirk' (2017) that extra point for being my new favorite war film.

Awful and Fascist,"No character development, no saying the ""Enemy"" were Nazis, no seeing the Nazis planning to carpet bomb the allied forces who were sitting ducks. In the guise of Artistic Sensibility the director has made a fascist diatribe. To all the sycophants who like the movie, watch Private Ryan",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
A Great War Story,"This is the story of a battle. It is not about the men in that battle. It is also about all battles.Some have criticized ""Dunkirk"" because of its lack of character development. Other films have done a good job of following (developing) characters as they negotiate scenes of war. But this film chooses to focus almost exclusively on the chaos of war. Still, it is not without characters, and director Nolan has chosen to focus on a handful of individuals to explain the ways that fortunes can change amid chaos.He also uses a non-linear timeline. For some, Dunkirk stretched over interminable weeks. For others, their stories were encompassed by one harrowing day. Still others joined the fray only for hours. But all of them were subject to the drama of a countdown, whether it was due to small windows of opportunity, the unpredictable weather, or logistics.Hans Zimmer's music certainly drives the drama and helps accentuate the timelines that are at play. The soundtrack has a driving cadence overlaid by sounds that are like screaming sirens.The action is poetic. With minimal dialogue, we witness the transformative nature of war, the impossible choices, the drive for survival, the inhumanity that war requires. At times, the action is moving; at other times, it is overwhelming.Despite what some have written about this film, it is very true to the reality of Dunkirk. For example, the cranes that stand above the city actually were there.Seeing this film drove me to read about the precursors to this action. And to explore the stories of those who actually were there on that final day. Finally, it led me to better appreciate the great significance of that day in the history of the world.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Good but not a masterpiece,"The movie is about the evacuation of the British army from Dunkirk, France during WWII. The movie in general is quite good and the acting is very convincing, however, the movie is very tense and you can barely take a break to breath. Also, the movie has only one theme and doesn't have many events nor ups and downs, it's all one theme for the whole movie. It felt to me like it was one big prolonged shot of just one scene(Although it is obviously not). To sum up, i just would like to say that the movie worth watching but it is definitely not my favorite WWII movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"Terrible, I have almost lost my hearing","Nolan is one of my favorite directors and I was waiting for this movie to come out and finally it did. For the first time in my life I had to literally escape the theater because the volume was unbelievably high. There were so many high frequency sounds that I couldn't stand listening to the soundtrack. I play in a rock band and I am used to loud sounds and yet I had to exit the cinema. It took me nearly 2 hours to fully recover. Some of the people had their hands covering the hears for most of the scenes. The movie is amazing but I think it's totally useless if you can't enjoy it. Would you still like a beautiful sunset next to a worker operating a huge drill? I will wait for the DVD to be able to lower the volume and watch the ending.

Britain propaganda,This film is great as cinematic elements like visual and sound elements but I did not like the Britain propaganda throughout the whole film.

A Failed Experiment,"This latest Christopher Nolan film is about the evacuation of soldiers stuck at Dunkirk in second world war. Usually Nolan films contain deep and complicated story structures but this time he is telling you a straight story about survival. As an audience, what you expect from a war film in modern era since we have seen so many great war based films before is a certain level of freshness in story or in it's presentation. As a clever auteur that he is, Nolan knows that he is responsible for this. So what he tried to do here is that he made a war movie and immerse the audience in this experience.But the verdict is, it still fails bring something new. The non linear presentation is the major drawback for the lack of focus which results in the failure of such an immersive experience. Its shame that the whole film feels repetitive and unfocused since the opening scenes with less dialogue and more action was promising. Film starts its decline with a side story in a boat with a stranded soldier and the boat owners. And then it never recovers.Recommended watch instead of Dunkirk: Son of Saul",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Perfect,"Everything about this film is perfect. The cinematography is some of the best I've seen. Every frame is shot to perfection. Every line of dialogue is brilliant. The pacing is tremendous. The acting is flawless. The sound fits the tone of the film superbly. The storyline is simple, but extremely effective and captivating. Christopher Nolan simply does an amazing job on this film.This movie is unique as it steers away from a main character. This allows you to focus on the overall objective of getting off Dunkirk beach, which makes for a better and more realistic watch. Giving one character more importance over another would completely take away from the story and the nature of war.In my opinion this is Nolan's best film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Don't listen to IMDb trolls reviews. Its a pretty great movie. 86% audience score.,"If you look at the reviews on here, you'll see most people either love it or hate it, and a few people find it good but not great. However, the latter is less pronounced. The reason why is because only the most passionate people write reviews for popular and critically acclaimed movies such as this.I'm just writing this to actually help people who may be on the fence about watching it and like me, may not be sure which reviews to believe to make their decision.However, the audience Cinemascore is very high with an average of about 85%, maybe more, RT is around 83%, and of course here it's 8.7 after 50k + ratings currently. So, analyzing that, you'll find the vast majority of people do not agree with the negative reviews or really any actual rating below an 8. Anyone who rates below an 8 is in the vast minority. And this is not to include a Metacritic score of 94, with about a dozen top critics giving it a perfect score of 100.Nolan movies always attract haters. Heck, on IMDb any critically acclaimed or pop movie attracts lots of trolls, haters, and negative reviews. So don't listen to the MINORITY that vote it below 8 or are highly critical. They're either trolls, Nolan haters, or they didn't see superheroes in capes so we're disappointed a summer movie was actually artistically made.Now, that being said, let me give you my brief review: Visually speaking, Dunkirk is amazing and awesome. It's a little like Gravity in that way that the visuals alone are enough to make it a good movie experience. They're stunning.The film is shot like an old classic, silent war film with very little dialogue, relatively speaking. There is dialogue, but just not nearly as much as most war films you've seen. Simply put, this is visual storytelling, perhaps like silent era films in some ways, but with modern day technology.But not to worry, the film grips you from the opening scene and is riveting with nonstop action sequences. Personally, I found it hard to look away, my eyes glued to the screen. In other words, if you just accept it as a visual war movie and an artistically made one, there is no need for excess dialogue; it's good enough as is to rivet and immerse you in the battle of Dunkirk.Technically, and visually, it's about perfect. You feel right away that this is shot like an Oscar contender, and that is sustained throughout. It very likely will get many nominations including Best Picture and Director.Personally, I thought it was great. There's no wasted scenes, it goes by fast (only about 90 minutes), it's nonstop action, with beautiful scenery and scenes. It plays out like a heroic victory for the allies due to several heroes including a pilot in a dog fight.This is a 4/4 **** movie with no weaknesses other than if you're into artistic writing it doesn't develop characters. But the story's essence is to put you right into the middle of the action.I liked this more than Private Ryan (9/10) and Hacksaw Ridge (8/10). Take that for what you will. It's just more immersive, tight, shorter, and visually astounding. I liked that there were no wasted scenes.So in conclusion, on this one, believe the 10 or so top critics who gave it a perfect 100 score on metacritic, and the audience who gave it an 86% overall. That's telling you most people loved it. Don't listen to the negative critics on IMDb. They made me doubt its worth, but once I started watching it I loved it and knew they were in the wrong.9/10 (no less than 8)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Christopher Nolan at His Absolute Best,"When Christopher Nolan announced that his next movie was going to be about World War II, people were skeptical; they had their doubts. But people had their doubts when Heath Ledger was cast as The Joker and Nolan proved them wrong.With Dunkirk, Christopher Nolan has hit the bull's eye. He has proved once again that no matter what his films are about, they are always going to be an amazing experience.Dunkirk is a film about the Dunkirk Evacuation ( Operation Dynamo ) that took place during the World War II. In 1940, more than 4,00,000 soldiers were evacuated on the beaches of Dunkirk, a small French town. Dunkirk is a story about that miraculous event.It is an unusual film. What I mean by that is, any moviegoer going into the movie would not expect the kind of film he would see. Most of you may have seen Saving Private Ryan and will be hoping for something similar but Dunkirk will throw you off balance. It is the complete opposite of Saving Private Ryan and that is why it shines so much.It is an experience and not a story about some individuals. There are no character backstories, so you won't get to know much about the characters. **You are in the battle from the first scene itself and you are going to stay there for the next 107 minutes.** You feel like a ghost watching the brutality of world war with your own eyes (Thank god, most of the war is bloodless).** There is very less dialogue, which you may hate, but it is also a unique thing about this masterpiece.** It is a no bull crap approach towards war. The war is not forgiving; you won't get time to shave your beard or shake hands with your friends or talk about your high school crush when each step you take may decide your fate. It is war and it translates to death if you are not careful. It is about people fighting for their lives and wondering if they will be able to make it through.The lack of character backstories and dialogue may be a shortcoming of the film but the more I think about it, the more sense it makes.** It results in a film that is thrilling, intense and nerve- wracking from beginning to end; there are no scenes that kill the tension.** Also, It does not politicize or glorify anything. It just shows you the war in its most raw form. It is terrorizing from the first scene till the last. There is almost no CGI; the IMAX cameras were placed on real airplanes and the film was shot, It makes my jaw drop in awe.***Dunkirk is the most realistic depiction of war I have ever seen on screen.***The cinematography is gorgeous and you will wonder how the DOP Hoyte van Hoytema was able to film it. The sound editing and mixing is on spot (Hans Zimmer's name is enough). The bullets sound exactly like bullets and the explosions are like real explosions; you won't get the feeling that Michael Bay is trying to blow things up. Last but not the least, what to say about the genius - Christopher Nolan. Most of his recent films have focused more on the crazy ideas and visual wonders but **Dunkirk proves that apart from being a person who has some amazing ideas, Nolan is a great storyteller too.** His storytelling abilities shine in Dunkirk. He himself is the writer and without his writing, it would not have been the film it is. he uses the nonlinear narrative and plays with the concept of time, again in a very effective way.***With Dunkirk, Nolan has established himself as one of the greatest filmmakers of all time.***It is the best film he has made since Inception. It is a strong contender for the Academy Award for best picture and Nolan himself may get nominated for Best Director, a recognition that he truly deserves. With Dunkirk, Christopher Nolan has hit the bull's eye. He has proved that no matter what his films are about, they are always going to be an amazing experience. Just go and make sure you watch it on an IMAX screen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
"Very good, but what is the relevance?","Really, in terms if cinematic viewing, this film is an 8/10 pushing a 9/10. Incredible levels of tension that I have rarely seen, really good music and visuals and fantastic acting. The only thing regarding the acting was that the actors mumbled a lot and it really frustrated me that I couldn't hear what they were saying (especially the pilots with their mouths covered). Although it didn't detract a huge amount from the whole story line; since the film was more of a ""show"" rather than ""tell"", it did however, take away some enjoyment.However, what struck me the most, was how there was not one person of colour in the entire film. I realise that this is a historic drama and they wanted to portray it just as it was in history, which is fine, but these days I cannot see how directors can justify making a film that does not hire any actors of colour. If it doesn't, it begs the question what is the point of making the film, why are you not making an effort to hire POC? There are thousands of black and minority ethnic actors waiting to be hired (and women for that matter, of which I counted about 5 during the whole movie). Colour- blind casting is done constantly in theatre and is never an issue (as well as gender-blind casting), I think it's about time we transferred it to film, the human imagination is very capable of filling in the gaps where necessary.In fact, we need a change in the whole film industry, more representation for under-represented communities, more female directors, more female protagonists, less objectifying of women etc. etc.Also, I thought it quite a strange time for this film to be released, why now? I would understand if it were the anniversary of the battle of Dunkirk, but no, nothing. A way in which this film resonated with me (having been in the Dunkirk area recently) and a way that the film could have had a more present day significance if had been done in a slightly different way, is that they could have drawn parallels with the refugee crisis which is still continuing right now. People waiting desperately to get to the UK, having crossed a sea in sinking, overcrowded boats, fleeing from violence.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Best War Movie Since Apocalypse Now,"Out of all the war movies made every year, there was one that is considered the greatest. That is Apocalypse Now. Now there is finally a film which can compare to that in terms of total intensity, direction, cinematography, story, war scenes, and suspense. This is tied for the best war movie of all time with Apocalypse now.It is straight up, one of the most tense films you will ever see. The first second of the film, it puts you in the middle of the war on the beaches of Dunkirk where over 300 000 soldiers are waiting to be rescued. You don't need character development in this film as it is not meant to show individual characters. It is meant to show the evacuation of Dunkirk itself, therefore you don't need characters to be developed in this film. The way Christopher Nolan tells this story is only a way in which he could pull it off. There is three narratives or three different stories going on that ultimately end up merging together. The first narrative is about the soldiers on the beach. The second narrative is about the normal people who took their boats and risked their lives to go to Dunkirk and save soldiers trapped at sea. The third narrative is in the air and shows the intense dogfights which occurred in the air.In this film, you will not look away as it keeps you in suspense all the way through out. If you look away, you will surely miss something. This is the most intense film i have ever seen and it deserves the debate to be called the best war film of all time. It is the best film in the year 2017 and i would be surprised if it gets snubbed in the Oscars.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"

Where's Michael Caine?,"MAJOR SPOILER: At the risk of been added to the dreaded blacklist, throwing all caution to the wind, I'll say it: Michael Caine is not in this picture.I went to this film expecting exciting action sequences, sweeping drama, technical virtuosity and a genius-level script. All the trademarks of a Christopher Nolan film. Also, obviously, like so many, I went because of Michael Caine. After all, this is a Christopher Nolan film. This is Nolan's first film set in England, well, actually in France, but with British people who want to go back to England. Wait, maybe The Prestige was set in London, I don't exactly remember. Wasn't Tesla in that movie? Tesla was never in England, not that I know. The Batman movies were definitively in Metropolis. Interstellar was in rural America and later somewhere else. So was Inception. In all places except England. Whatever. How will Nolan use Caine? I wondered. This is the first opportunity Nolan has had to use Caine as a British man in a British film that takes place in Great Britain (or in France, oh wait, the Prestige, maybe). Batman's butler may have been British, I'm not sure. Caine as a NASA scientist in rural America, definitively American. So I sat and waited for Mr. Caine to appear on the screen. This is, after all, clearly a British film, I thought, the most British film Nolan has made sans The Prestige. There's Mark Rylance. There's Kenneth Branagh. How much more British can you get? There's Irish Cillian Murphy. Caine should appear at any moment, I thought to myself, and settled for the impending appearance. Michael Caine in Imax again! This will be surely a memorable experience. Will he appear in a boat? In a plane? He's kind of old to be riding around in a plane, you know. Surely, he'll be a general giving commands at headquarters. Or maybe he will be one of those colorful English fishermen. The minutes passed, then an hour, and no Caine. Where's Caine? I kept asking. Not even a cameo? Did I miss him in the crowds? Then a frightening thought crossed my mind. Wait a minute, didn't Caine die in Interstellar? Is he actually dead? Really dead? It can't be, it would have been news all over the world. Then the movie ends. No Caine. Unbelievable. I checked the web and yes, Caine is still alive in real life. Nolan, you ungrateful bastard, how dare you? How could you do this to Michael Caine? You know you would be a nobody if it weren't for Caine! How could you leave Michael Caine out of the film covering one of the most important episodes in the history of Great Britain, in its finest hour? How could you do this to your fans? Did you kill him for good in Interstellar? Did he ask too much money? Why, Mr. Nolan, why? For whatever reason, leaving Caine out of this picture was a big mistake on your part. Mark my words, Nolan: this decision will haunt you for the rest of your life, and will cost you dearly. I guarantee it.",,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Dunkirk,"I didn't know much about the style of this film so I was open to any take on Dunkirk. Trying to imagine the fear of the sitting ducks at Dunkirk was well portrayed by the faces of the soldiers. Knowing that at any minute you could be shot the wait to leave the beach would have been painstakingly long. There was no real need for character building since there were overlapping stories & the purpose of each character was quickly understood with very little dialogue. There were times I wished that there were subtitles because it was hard to understand but even still the message was given with the eyes of the actors. Most of the soldiers were 17 or 18..just young boys who found themselves in a perilous situation and looking to each other for understanding of what they were experiencing. I really liked the movie, didn't care for the soundtrack and found it irritating when it would rise to a crescendo. This movie would appeal to history buffs like me & to fans of Harry Stiles. There were no real stand outs in the acting but I think that was the point...no lone wolf/ hero",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
Nolan Does it again,"Christopher Nolan's new cinematic war thriller literally takes your breath away, as the masterclass director returns in an intense powerful experience.On the beaches of Dunkirk, the British soldiers wait to return to England, but ambushed by German attacks, must fight for survival to get home. In a triptych storyline, we see the events on land for one soldier Tommy played by (Finn Whitehead), in the sea, arriving support their troops Mr Dawson (Mark Rylance), and in air in a British cockpit with Farrier (Tom Hardy) This is a grand event for my relationship with cinema, as Dunkirk had the privilege to be my first IMAX experience, for which the journey is so worth it. With Nolan's 65mm format, Dunkirk is not a film its an experience or better yet it is happening. In such a massive screen at the BFI IMAX, it becomes a powerfully immersive experience that places you right in the middle of Dunkirk, surrounded by the booming sound of the guns and bombs. So many moments you will find yourself holding your breath, the 1hr 47 mins run time is an fierce gripping venture.The magnificence of Christopher Nolan always surprises, as my favourite director, Dunkirk has been a very anticipated feature for me and so many and finally with its release Nolan has amazed as always. Carrying the spectacle of Intersteller (2014) but down to a Belgim, Nolan proves how really gripping, smart, and cinematic film can be. I know that an IMAX experience asks a lot, with the journey to London and higher price, but when a film like this comes along it is very worth your while.Dunkirk is not just a cinematic presentation but also a remembrance to all the soldiers at Dunkirk, emitting a spectacular tone of British pride, Nolan demonstrates his passion and respect for the event, which through certain moments brings out a sensational joy to the heart. With a lack of a script, Nolan resembles silent cinema, and this is where the film is strong, with marvellous beautiful sequences of silence or just sound and no speech creates the real cinema of the film.Hoyte van Hoytema's clutching cinematography is fantastic, from the tense silence at the beach, to the sinking ships, and the rather wonderful landscape shots above Hotema's only drags us further into the film. With a classic Nolanesc feel to way of the camera, we o have a documentary feel to film adding that extra authenticity. The most mesmerising shot war films since Saving Private Ryan (1998).The real technical talent is Hans Zimmer's astonishing score. So many times Zimmer's collaboration with Nolan has given birth to many brilliant tunes, and Dunkirk brings the best one yet. From the tension building sound of the ticking, to the unsettling but absorbing groans of the sea, and ships, Zimmer creates pure war poetry and indeed horror.As for the ensemble cast, Nolan places all members exactly where they should, especially Kenneth Branagh's pier commander is exactly perfect for the film. Tom Hardy showing off his eye acting talents with his plane mask on, experience gained from his role as Bane no less. But a well done is deserved to Finn Whitehead in his debut film with a real perspective of the disaster.Christopher Nolan proves once again why he is the greatest director of all time, in an explosive cinematic experience. Inception and the Dark Knight will always be his masterpieces, but Dunkirk is a wonderful piece of work. I do strongly recommend an IMAX viewing if possible, or just a cinema experience. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Drama, History"
