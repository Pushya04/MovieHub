Thor Rocks.,"I know this film has been ragged on by many people, but I really enjoyed it. Was great seeing Asgard, and how Mjolnir followed Thor around was wonderful. Hey, Thos has always been one of my favorite characters, and Hemsworth plays him so well.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Thor,"Is this a huge stepup from the original ""Thor"" movie. No, unfortunately not. Is it another watchable, fun superhero movie; yes, definitely. It's a really good movie and if we look at the way Alan Taylor directs this movie, it's actually not that much different from what Branagh did back in 2011. Chris Hemsworth is good as usual and Tom Hiddleston is more wonderful than ever as Loki, but the villain Malekith, played by Christopher Eccleston, unfortunately, is a bit of a disappointment, mostly because of the lack of motivation.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The Light at the End of a Dark World,"When we left our friends in Asgard, all was right in the 9 realms after Loki was thrown into an abyss for his selfish ways and almost destroyed everything the Asgardians hold most dear. But it has been 2 years since Jane Foster and Thor parted ways and now they are reunited because of a darkness that shrouds over Jane's inner body as she infects a most powerful and deadly weapon that could not only destroy her but the entire 9 realms – it takes a vicious monster Malekith (played wonderfully by Christopher Eccleston) to destroy all of the races in the universe to converge it all in darkness.But it takes Thor (Hemsworth) along with Foster (Portman) and Loki (Hiddleston) to save the day. But what we don't know may surprise us – that the Tesseract, the Aether, so close together creates something more deadly than what they could ever even think that could happen to the fate of the entire universe.This movie was excellent and I am looking forward to seeing what is next for our mighty god of thunder.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A good entry into the Marvel Universe,"Having just watched a premier screening, I am delighted to come away from the cinema to write a positive review. Thor Dark World is a spectacular special effect driven film, much of which is set in Asguard.I was worried that including Loki yet again might become a little repetitive, but in this film he excels as a great character, I only hope however that they don't overdue his presence in the Marvel Universe. How many times can this guy come back from the dead?There isn't as much character development as the first film, and Thor's friends are nowhere near as interesting as the Avengers. I guess they simply needed these characters to all remain as they were so as to keep continuity within the Marvel universe, but its noticeable how little impact the storyline will have on anybody.The armies of Asguard were noticeably lacking in fire-power and weapons (even though they have an armoury), which is made even more evident when an entire guard division bring knives to a laser-gun fight. Their turrents were the only defense they had against an Ariel assault and proved to be practically useless. You would expect them to be better prepared.The healing powers of Thor, Jane, and even a smashed alien space-craft become a bit of a running joke as well. But at least they get hurt, even if it only takes them a scene to heal. And if smashing every column holding up a building is still not enough to take it down I'm not sure what will be.Christopher Eccleston played a competent bad guy, although his intentions for what he was doing was still unclear as to why. Its simple to say he was insane and just wanted to kill everybody, but when a threat of that magnitude appears and planetary alignments are in effect, you expect half the Universe to show up and stop him or take advantage of the situation, or come looking to take the power for themselves. I also expected to see the entire army of Asguard come to help out at the end like they apparently did in the past. Not just Thor who appears there by mistake.The scientist with the miraculous plot saving devise is also a little hard fetch to take in, especially when he creates a remote control for cosmic anomalies. Along with Loki's illusion power which also serves as a convenient plot-saving devise at times. I'm willing to overlook these but there's no denying what they are.Overall its a good enjoyable superhero movie, which you will want to watch several times and is a decent entry into the Marvel Universe.P.S. Watch it in 2D, The 3D added little of worth.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Action Packed Fantasy Romcom?,"Well I was so looking forward to seeing this movie when I went last night, and although it was reasonably good it was not at all what I expected.Watch the official movie trailer and you see what looks like quite a dark fantasy, so you can imagine my surprise when throughout the movie the audience was laughing out loud at the stupid one liners. Yes I know this is entertainment, and this movie was moderately entertaining, but once again the makers have tried to please everyone by adding a bit of everything; action, special effects, romance and humour, just far too much of the latter for my taste in a genre that does not require hilarity to succeed.Although it has a lower IMDb score I much preferred the 2011 Thor, a stronger storyline, darker and no laughing matter!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"All style, no substance","The acting was solid. The production value was superb. Everything else was really poor.The back story and character motivations are laughably sparse. Most of the characters are completely one-dimensional, with the possible exception of Loki. The plot is the most boring and typical of all action plots - some ""bad dudes who happen to be really ugly"" decide to ""destroy the world for no reason other than being evil"" and ""only our hero can save us all"", etc. Moreover, it was lazy writing - whenever an absolute miracle needed to happen, it conveniently did, every time.Of course this is a mindless blockbuster Marvel movie so we shouldn't expect much. But the thing is that these kinds of films CAN be made with a reasonable plot, pacing, and character development. The writers were obviously just going through the motions to cash in on the surefire moneymaker sequel, and from a business perspective it is hard to fault them. But it says a lot about the sad state of Hollywood in 2013 that this film currently has a 7.7 on IMDb.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Loved it!,"For starters, I loved this film! I was a fan of the first but this one is superior in every way. The actions scenes are better, the plot is better and there is great banter throughout the film. Due to these factors it is entertaining and has more than enough in it to keep you interested. The acting is fantastic, especial by Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston, as they work great together and appear to have a great understanding of each others roles. I just can't understand why people don't like this film unless they are not a fan of superheroes. After seeing this film last night I read through a few of the reviews afterwards and was shocked as some people were giving it lower than 7. These people are clearly boring and have no idea about an entertaining film and enjoy watching films that just depress you and have no idea about what a fantastic superhero film this is. I recommend you watch this immediately as you won't be disappointed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Sigh...Zzzz...,I was never a really big fan of Thor to begin with and this movie just proves it to me again. This movie was so slow and boring. The first hour I almost fell asleep a few times. The special effects were really well done but other then that I really do not think this was a great movie. I gave this movie a generous 6 out of a possible 10. Normally these types of movies at least earn a 7 from me but this one at best was a 6 only.You can tell that this sequel was made for the sack of making some more money off the very boring Thor. I for one will not waste my money on a third that is for sure. They really need to stop wasting everyone's time with Thor. He is boring and other then his looks has very little going for him.

Thor The Dark World: One of the weaker MCU offerings,"PlotWhen the Dark Elves attempt to plunge the universe into darkness, Thor must embark on a perilous and personal journey that will reunite him with doctor Jane Foster.CastThe same bunch as before but now we have a disappointing Eccleston and Fandral has been recast with Zachary Levi.VerdictI didn't hate the first Thor but I didn't deem it a great film, our titular character bounced between distinctly unlikable and oddly hilarious and didn't seem to manage as a leading man. The supporting cast, a combination of bland and oddly quaint! Dennings character walking a fine line between being quaint and deeply annoying.The humor is on point, the visuals are interesting, Thor is the same mix of unlikable and funny (But less so than the first film) but the plot is really unengaging, Malkeith makes for a terrible villain and the ending is really quite poor.The film also distances itself from the MC quite a bit, there aren't as many nods as we're used to though the Captain America cameo was kind of neat.I consider Dark World one of the weak links in the MCU, thankfully Thors next solo outing made up for it.RantsI don't know what it is with Portman but she's so remarkably unlikable. Is it her face? Is it her acting ability? Is it her real life personality? I honestly don't know what my issue is. She just looks like someone who would kick me between the legs, put a cigarette out in my eye and expect me to say thank you.BreakdownSome funny moments

"Well, that was a surprise","Just got back from seeing this and thought I'd put in my thoughts.This is by far the most intricate and thoughtful of the Marvel films to date, with a great story and some superb performances, particularly Hiddleston's as Loki. The characters from previous Asgard related outings are there, but thanks to some good writing, are more 3 dimensional and therefore, interesting. This is one of the few films that would have benefited from an extra 15 minutes or so to explore further the motivations of the key protagonists.There is plenty of large scale action, as well as some laugh out loud humorous moments that help to keep this kicking along.I am both surprised and delighted that this is not only the best superhero movie to date, (even eclipsing Spider-Man 2), but currently the best movie I've seen this year.Don't miss this!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Marvel has lost it, it is now just a Comedy","Marvel has finally lost anything it had going for it. It is now completely aimed at kids.

I loved all the previous marvel until iron man 3, I then gave up on the iron mans and thought that Thor 2 looked a bit darker.boy was I wrong. Really disappointed. The whole thing is a joke. i know i sound like a bit of a moody Michael but i was really looking forward to this. I have now given up on marvel and will not be going to see any more of them.

Pure Enjoyment!,"Occasionally in life there are those moments of unutterable fulfillment which cannot be completely explained by those symbols called words. This sequel is one such moment. I do need to see it again. In terms of pure enjoy-ability, I put it top 3 of all sequels that I have enjoyed.What I really liked...-Every single character gets a moment to shine and every single actor cast in these parts are perfect.-The comedy is perfect. It's such a fine balance overall and everything works because it's very subtle and fits in with certain circumstances.-Some very tender emotional scenes. I won't spoil anything with specifics.-Some superb action and what could very well be award winning special effects.-All characters interactions are great and handled very well. This is a fantasy story that really cares about character first and it shows all the way through. Even Natalie Portman's Jane feel more fleshed out than she did in the original film.-The set pieces and other realms talked about in the first are seen here and are beautiful and well done. Asgard was even better believe it or not.-The mid-credit and end credit scenes, both cool. Make sure you stay for both.Marvel hit a pure home run with this endeavor. This film works because of the great cast and the fact that they took this subject matter seriously but remember to have fun. Chris Hemsworth was again perfect. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Better than expected,"Let me just start this by saying that I was not expecting great things from this movie, but Marvel has done it right again and i believe that anyone who enjoyed the first movie will not be disappointed with this one. The special effects were really cool and the Asgard scenes were amazing in IMAX 3D. The return of Thor and Loki was by far better than I expected. Loki was really better than in ""The Avengers"", it was more funny and more enjoyable to watch. The only negative point in this movie is the villain (Malekith) which is like an accessory to the story. Marvel Cinematic Universe is getting better and I cannot wait for ""Guardians of the Galaxy"". Definitely a surprise, ""Thor: The Dark World"" is one of those rare cases where the sequel beats its predecessor.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Better Off Otherworldly,"Thor: The Dark World made a wise choice of stepping up to its sequel. It tends to explore worlds beyond Asgard and Midgard, and innovating more details around this absurd universe. Because if your source material have a world this rich, it makes your everyday reality look boring. It's a fine escapism, but the joy stumbles when it goes to the storyline. It's almost like the opposite of the first movie. Here, it works better when it simply shows the heroes fighting off the bad guys, but feels forced when it tries to pull off a drama. The overall film can be entertaining, but it messes a lot of elements within the surfaces.The big problem already lies by justifying the word ""dark"" in the title. While being dark and serious is not really a problem to this modern era of blockbusters, the film never felt natural for it. Though, the first movie was more special when it was focused on the drama, here it definitely feels force. There are those ""tragic"" or ""emotional"" scenes when it feels so contrived for the sake of fitting and pleasing the audience who seek for sheer deepness. The result is surprisingly not compelling, which makes you wish it was handled by Kenneth Branagh again. The film also suffers with a weak plot, there are large parts where the good guys are lingering to brood, making plans, and just goofing around while they're surrounded by a formidable enemy. Those moments they waste pretty much kills the momentum.The movie is better when it stays loyal to the roots of a Marvel picture. Staying in the action and the comedy is when the film felt more comfortable, although it may get out of hand. The cast gives plenty of life, as always, especially when Tom Hiddleston is around to spice things up. Director Alan Taylor seems to be more interested in creating inventive action set pieces and featuring stuff that we don't normally see in the genre, which helps a lot to bring pure energy within the adventure, while the CGI effects bring massive scale in any world they stop in to.Thor: The Dark World had its fun moments, but also suffers by its missteps. The recent trend of ""darkening"" almost every latest superhero movie somewhat affects it. Having drama scenes is definitely not the problem since the first movie was fascinating because of those parts. The real problem is how the film delivers them, it instead makes them look preachy and pretentious. It would have been a straightforward quest, because that's where the film works better. If the whole film is completely adventurous and full of personality, then it might end up being somehow remarkable. Still, Thor needs some pizazz to its gravity to make it more than just another action blockbuster. For now, Thor: The Dark World is fine enough as a distraction.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Even D.C Comics fans will like this movie.,"Out of all the Marvel movies I have seen, Thor has been my favorite, so when I heard that Thor: The Dark World was going to be released, I was psyched. Of all the films that where in the movies at the time, (Hunger Games: Catching Fire, Captain Phillips etc.) I chose to see this one, and I was not disappointed.If you did not watch the first Thor movie, you may not understand this one in it's entirety. If you did not like the first Thor movie, then this is not for you.But if you watched and liked the first film, you will love this film.

Its Sense of Humor Is The Spark!,"In the beginning, there was a all powerful dark force called The Aether. The powers on Asgaard contain this force and keep it hidden for thousands of years, only to be found by none other than astrophysicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman). When The Aether takes possession of Jane, of course, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) comes to her rescue.However, as Asgaard and the Nine Realms face the resurgence of the Dark Elves led by the diabolical Malakeith (Christopher Eccleston), a catastrophic planetary alignment threatens to end the existence of the whole world. Thor was forced to solicit his incarcerated renegade brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) to help him with his elaborate rescue plan. Can the two estranged brothers actually work for one common goal?Honestly the first hour of this new Thor film was so dark it was almost dull. The computer-generated special effects looked so fake and unimpressive, very obviously cartoonish mayhem. The acting can be so hokey and corny, so serious and heavy-handed despite the emptiness of the story. The plot itself is very familiar, and reminiscent of many other superhero films. The romantic scenes of Natalie Portman wearing a gown felt like scenes in a ""Star Wars"" prequel.But there was that sudden turn around midway in the film when Thor and Loki joined up that the film snapped into place and never looked back up to the very end. The second half came alive because of its quirky sense of humor. These boisterous moments were largely due to the characters of the eccentric Dr. Eric Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård), Jane's cute intern Darcy (Kat Dennings), and Darcy's own dorky intern Ian (Jonathan Howard). I feel these funny moments saved this film from wallowing in self-seriousness. They may seem so out of place, yet they were still so laugh-out-loud hilarious.However, are these funny scenes really what director Alan Taylor wants us to remember this movie for? The brotherly interaction between Thor and Loki should have been the main focus, but this can be buried under so many other less-important computer-generated details that tend to overwhelm this production.In any case, overall, this film turned out very entertaining superhero action film that audiences will enjoy. You may not really be able to fully understand how the fight action went from realm to realm in the climactic battle but these were exhilarating to see. The artwork in stark red and black with broad brush strokes over the final credits were awesome to look at. Don't leave right away as you know there will be extra scenes to whet your appetite for more adventures to come. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Just average,"Compared to the previous Thor, this one was just average.Compared to any other recent avengers movies this one was not good at all.If you're looking for Stiff acting, Failed joke attempts and plot holes then this is the movie for you.Special affects are OK but below par compared to other Marvell movies.Its was nice to learn a little more of the back story of Asgard but it was the Asgardian acting that made the film particularly bad.Lots of people are talking about how the anti-hero of the story, Loki, is this total rebel bad-ass and compare him to other beloved villains like Heath Ledge's Joker but not so. Loki's participation in the film is minimal.Overall, just average, but I wish I would have picked a different movies to see at the cinema.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Action hero movie, emphasis on the ACTION","In this movie, there is way more action than plot. It appears that the director/writer was focused on making the movie ""exciting"" first, then coming up with some plot devices to fit in with it. The ""Aether"" is particularly uninspired as a choice for the big bad. It's an excuse to skip writing any characterization for the antagonist; (""Hey, it's just an evil entity that's silent and just sort of.. there. Yay! Less work for us!"").(SPOILER) My biggest complaint with the movie (and this bugged the heck out of me) is the completely out-of-place spaceships and fighters (Think x-wings like Star Wars. Yes, really.) Asgard is supposed to be a realm out of myth. There is a reason everyone gets around using the bi-frost, isn't there? If everyone has spaceships, why were we told in the first Thor movie that the destruction of the bi-frost prevented transportation to other realms? And if these people have guns, why do all the characters on Asgard fight with swords/clubs/daggers? I'm trying to get over my annoyance about this ill-advised overlap with sci-fi. Not having any luck with that.The movie is entertaining, though, in the same way that mindless summer blockbusters are. This would have fit right in with summer releases. Some nice in-jokes for Marvel fans.Now for the actors:Natalie Portman is pretty boring. She doesn't have much to do except swoon, really.Chris Hemsworth does a good job; in my opinion there are limits to what you can do with Thor as he's written in these movies. A bad actor could make a disaster of it; a good actor can make it just fine. There's not much room for an actor to show off his craft.Anthony Hopkins is never bad, but both he and Rene Russo are just sort of there to occupy roles that have to be filled. Very one-dimensional, but then again, that's not out of the ordinary for superhero movies in general.The best part of the movie?? TOM HIDDLESTON. The dude wears Loki like a second skin now. He steals every scene he's in. The character of Loki would, in anyone else's hands, be as simple and one-dimensional as all the other characters in the movie. Instead, he brings subtlety to a role that could easily be reduced to scenery-chewing. He's a master at the grin that conveys, all at once, the mischief of a little boy, the evil of a true villain and a bit of the resentment of the orphaned and overlooked son. I found myself paying much more attention anytime he was on screen just because I find his portrayal to be bordering on the sublime.6 out of 10 overall, because of the (gag) spaceships and the lack of any suspense for the audience.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Just Wonderful! Packed with action, heartfelt emotion, humor, drama and intensity.","Thor The Dark World is brilliant and completely tops the first film. There are a lot of extremely funny bits in it as well as some dark and moving moments. Probably a much funnier movie than it had any right to be given the subject matter. Loki is done perfectly and the dialogue between him and Thor is superb.If you're a fan of the first, this certainly won't disappoint at all. Without spoiling anything, the scale of this film is very Avengers-like in that the action pieces are amazing. During a sequence halfway through, I literally turned to my friend and said, ""this is freakin' awesome"".Needless to say, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Each frame is packed with action, heartfelt emotion, humor, drama or intensity. I was expecting to simply see crazy mythology with monsters destroying the landscape of the nine realms for two hours. Instead, I was shocked at the depth and complexity of this film. You definitely need your brain and your heart turned on for this one, unlike other CGI mishmashes. If you want a movie with just dumb action and no plot then stay away from this exceptional film. The performances are top tier and the visual effects may be the best I've seen this year. I have to join the majority of people and even critics that are praising this film. It's a true joy and such a pleasant experience.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"10 stars for Loki, -4 for the movie","I hadn't watched any MCU movie until the release of Avengers: Infinity War, after which I had decided to bingewatch all the MCU movies so that I could catch up with everyone else before Endgame. Since I was practically skimming through all the movies, I only remembered the ones that had something absolutely memorable to show. This one, however, I barely remembered anything, except for the scene where it was shown in the end that Odin was actually Loki. That's not to say that this movie is bad. That's just saying it's... forgettable.Thor: The Dark World is a movie that I only remember in fragments. I remember a castle exploding in which Thor's mother died but nothing before or after that. I remember Loki being upset because he had been imprisoned and was throwing tantrums but nothing after that. Normally if a movie is so forgettable like it was in the case of X-Men: Apocalypse or Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1, I just watch the trailers, Honest Trailers, Pitch Meetings, Cinemasins etc to remember everything that happened in that movie. But I'm not gonna do it here. I want to see how much I can review based on what I thought of it on my first watching.The cinematography of this movie is pathetic, so is the CGI. Normally I prefer aliens having a bad CGI as in the case of Zack Snyder's Justice League since it gives a video game-like touch to it, but here it's just... trash. And what's the deal with the camera always being tilted sideways in many scenes? The characters were straight up terrible. The whole ""intern of an intern"" and punching Thor in the face to check if he's real (I don't remember if it was a slap or punch) wasn't even funny yet both the jokes happened twice. Also Thor hung his Mjolnir on a nail so that we could know it's not actually heavy. As I'm writing this review I'm remembering what all happened in it, but still not very nicely.I actually fell asleep while watching Thor: The Dark World, something I have never done for any other movie before. That's how slowly paced and boring it was. The talking scenes were a little too much and were barely audible. I think I really need to watch it one more time if I have to just get a basic idea of what it was. This could have been the MCU movie I hated the most if it wouldn't have been for Loki. He carried the whole movie on his shoulders. I remember all his scenes.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Another outstanding effort, Marvel does it yet again!","It's hard to believe that a movie with this subject matter can make you think as much as it thrills you and makes you laugh. Yet, this film does just that. It really does appeal to all of your movie viewing skills. It's very artistic and you would expect no less from a director that crafted Game of Thrones. He presents the entire film in a way that can be savored. Many aspects are classical drama and yet other aspects are just plain old fun kick-butt action scenes. It's a perfect blend and this movie is far deeper then I would've thought. The pacing was perfect as is the indirect link to the Marvel movie Universe... I can't wait to see what Captain America brings us in his sequel.Also, I absolutely love the character of Loki because there was so much texture to the character. He's the perfect Marvel villain. He was complex but with a tinge of madness mixed in and perfectly written for the film. The rationale for what he does and how he behaves is masterful. I truly loved how Loki was written and portrayed. Then again, I honestly can say that about all the main characters. Thor and Jane really are allowed to shine here as well.My main critique after watching the first film was the instance romance between Jane and Thor. After watching this movie, you buy the love at first sight scenario boosted by the situational intrigue. This time around, the pace of the film really worked well. I can't remember a film that grabs you like they do right off the bat and never lets go but does it with intelligence and heart. Hard to argue any editorial cuts at this point whatever they may have been.Overall, a movie that's superior to everything else that I've seen this year.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Not as good as the first film, but fun nonetheless","Phase 1 of the Marvel Project is all done and dusted, a phase which started on a massive high with the first Iron Man (arguably the best solo Marvel superhero film to date), and ended on one with Avengers Assemble (the best Marvel film, in my opinion). Marvel Films did what was seemingly impossible, and did it unbelievably well. So, like millions of others, I waited with bated bread for Phase 2 to kick off. Iron Man 3 rolled around andheh. It wasn't an awful film and the Tony Stark character took an interesting turn, but it didn't live up to the success of his first two outings and the Marvel standard as a whole.Which brings us on to the next step of Phase 2 – Thor. The first film was one of the big surprises of the genre. While his other superhero friends are steeped in some level of reality, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is from an entirely different world, so the task of bringing him into 'our' world and making it believable was a tough one. But they did it, and the result was a thoroughly entertaining film that took advantage of the character's supernatural elements. With the sequel, directors Alan Taylor and James Gunn (taking over from Kenneth Branagh) decided to amp the supernatural side up even more.While the first movie introduces us to Asgard, Thor's home planet, The Dark World is set almost entirely in the alien world. This time, Asgard is under threat from an even darker foe hell-bent on literally destroying the entire universe. The epic plot allows the film to explore Asgard with much more detail, and we gain a better understanding of how the world works. Expectedly, we're treated to some gorgeous CGI and special effects, making it fun to watch. The fish-out-of-water formula is also subverted as Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) is now in Asgard, essentially playing our eyes and ears. Unfortunately, that formula isn't as successful as it was in the first movie. Watching Thor try to make sense of Earth is genuinely hilarious, but we don't quite get that with Foster. Funnier than that is seeing Foster's Earth friends go about their business (Kat Dennings, in particular, is very funny).In fact, the scenes in Asgard, as a whole, aren't overly amusing. That is, until, one Tom Hiddleston enters the fray.As Loki, Hiddleston is once again sublime. That scathing sarcasm, the wry smiles, his excellent diction and tone; everything about the performance is a pleasure to experience. It is by no means an exaggeration to suggest that he steals every scene he is in. My favourite scenes were the ones that he was in – just waiting for him to say something, and knowing it was going to be gold. And it pretty much always was. The character's journey in the film is also very gripping, and sets us up nicely for whatever might come next. Loki is to Thor what Iago is to Othello: he is the actual main character, he is the one we want to see. And just like people have argued that Shakespeare's play should be called Iago, I would strongly argue that the film should have been named after Loki.Where we have a problem is that, when Loki isn't on screen (and his screen time is crucial but limited), the film just never seems as engaging. I found myself missing the character, and wishing he was ever-present. I won't reveal any spoilers but will say the ending makes up for that longing, but that doesn't stop the film suffering because of it.This is, overall, why the sequel just doesn't work as well as the first film. And it isn't just the lack of Loki's presence; other characters I wanted to see more of were used sparingly. Kat Dennings, as mentioned before, was one of those characters; and Stellan Skarsgard was another. Instead, we saw a lot more of Anthony Hopkins (boring and uninspiring), Idris Elba (strong presence but also boring) and Christopher Ecclestone (who is completely unrecognisable but actually quite good).Don't get me wrong, The Dark World is not a bad film. It's much better than Iron Man 3, and there is enough excitement and good action to stop you getting bored. It just isn't as engaging as the first one, that's all. Sadly, Phase 2 of the Avengers Project has started with a bit of a whimper; we can only hope it gets better from here.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Super Awesome!,"Thor: The Dark World - What's coming from the sequel of the epic movie of Thor? Awesomeness! I am already excited for the movie to hit the theater, now I am extremely thrilled once watching it. I think it was more into the movie itself than what to do with the prequel of it, or even The Avengers Movie. I mean, it certainly can be enjoyable enough even if you didn't watch any of the other two movies. I am a big fan of Loki, and that would certainly escalated even much better after seeing his stunning tricks in this movie. Believe me, you would be too. I think it was a solid story plus actions in it. More than just entertained by the hilarious scenes that keep on flashing upon the screen, the Max of 2 Broke Girls (Kat Dennings) sprinkled more dusty jokes that would make you laugh. I am a big fan of Marvel Avengers Game on Facebook too, which help me love this movie so much more with all those characters such Sif, and not to mention its newly Special Ops 14. And if you're a fan of Chuck, the Zachary Levi played quite a role in this movie as well. I can't explain how much I love this movie, unless you watch it yourself. As for me, it deserves a super straight full stars in a role!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Dark World - A Cosmic Compromise,"!! Possible Spoilers!!*Thor: The Dark World* is a mixed bag. While it boasts impressive visuals and the return of the charismatic Loki, the film struggles to maintain the same level of enchantment as its predecessor.The introduction of the Dark Elves and their quest to plunge the universe into eternal darkness offers a promising premise, but the execution feels lackluster. The villain, Malekith, lacks the charisma and complexity of Loki, and the plot often becomes convoluted.Chris Hemsworth reprises his role as Thor with his usual charm, and Tom Hiddleston once again steals the show as the mischievous Loki. Their dynamic is a highlight of the film, providing much-needed humor and tension.The visual effects are undeniably stunning, transporting viewers to the breathtaking realms of Asgard and beyond. However, the film's pacing is uneven, with some sequences dragging while others feel rushed.Overall, *Thor: The Dark World* is a serviceable sequel that offers some entertaining moments but ultimately fails to reach the heights of its predecessor. It's a film that satisfies on a visual level but lacks the emotional depth and narrative cohesion of the first installment.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Why haters hate.,"Far exceeding Thor (1), The Dark World is brilliantly shot, well-acted and leaves the viewer wishing for more. In truth it could've been 20min longer but I liked it. People love to complain about this movie *SPOILER* (DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS FILM) The reason Thor and many others shift through one realm into the next is due to a Once in 5,000 Years event called The Convergence, where all Nine Realms line up, causing energy and matter to be able to pass realm to realm as though through a door. Some people can't grasp this and therefore, due to their sloping foreheads, will never grasp this concept. When asked, ""what is your favorite Marvel Film Franchise (?), a noted physicist said Thor 1 & 2, because of how true these events actually are being considered in the real world. (Wormholes, etc.) But back to the film. This is great. Im seeing people say They hate this but loved Avengers, or vice versa. This is ludicrous. Say you don't like Thor, fine. I have no issue with personal taste. All I'll say to sum up my feelings are, working at a comic shop, reading Thor all my life, this is a great story with great banter and action. Even my die-hard DC friends love this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Marvel has out done themselves again. Great Film!,"Infinitely better than the first (which I liked) because of better action, humor and emotion. All those people who were worried about Thor being underpowered are going to be pleased. The effects are wonderful and it is indeed a very funny and a very moving movie in places. I'm happy to report that neither factor is overused or gets in the way of the feel or story. It's the right amount of humor and right amount of angst. Cinematography is great and the score is amazing. Whoever scored this film should do so for the rest of the Marvel movies in my opinion.I knew they would nail the pathos but was pleasantly surprised by the creative fight sequences. They are phenomenal. Not overly long but when they rage, THEY RAGE. Also, Kurse can rival the Hulk in terms of scary power. He was better utilized than the Destroyer was in the first film. Loki is the scene stealer that was all hoped to see! Jane and Sif add more than eye candy but you would expect no less from Marvel. Hemsworth has cemented his legend as Thor with this effort. My only real disappointed is a minor one. They didn't really show the nine realms in any real detail. It seemed a cop out that hey're just open landscapes. Yet, maybe they didn't want to commit to anything for future movies.Overall, this is a wonderful movie and maybe Marvel's best solo film.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
One of the better entries in the Marvel series,"Thor: The Dark World is the next entry in the high quality series of Marvel movies over the 7 years or so and it is one of the best. Its funny, its got action. And did I mention its funny? Honestly, I think this movie had more sarcastic comments, wise cracks per minute than it did hammer punches to the face.Story is fairly generic. Super evil guy thought long dead wants super evil thing. Thor and crew doesn't want him to get it. It's straighforward enough. However, for a movie titled Thor, it sure does spend a large amount of screen time with other people, Natalie Portman, the other scientists when Natalie Portman is in Viking Land, Loki, the bad guy, Loki again. Actually, I don't really mind the Loki part. I hate him as a character, but he is fascinating. He truly is the god of mischief, you never know what side he is on, though usually its his own side. I don't understand how anybody trusts him ever.Every character always has something funny to say. Every side character is comic relief, and Thor is pretty funny himself too. With so much casual comedy all the time, the incredibly sad and dramatic moments create a jarring tonal shift. Then after a short while its back to jokejokejoke. For most of the movie, the action isn't that mind blowing or fascinating. But the movie makes up for it with the final fight, full of chaos-inducing wobbly gravity and warping all over the place.tl;dr a fun, entertaining super hero movie, with jarring tonal shifts, but one of the most fun final action sequences.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"The Aether, the Dark Elves and Loki","Odin (Anthony Hopkins) recalls when his father Bor and the warriors from Asgard vanquished the evil Dark Elves and their leader Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) that wanted to send the universe into the darkness during the convergence of nine realms unleashing the powerful weapon Aether. Mallekith escapes and Bor hides the Aether in-between two stone columns.In the present days, on Earth, the scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) that is waiting for the return of Thor, investigates a gravity phenomenon in an abandoned factory with her assistant and her intern. She finds the column where the Aether is hidden and the substance possesses her. In Asgard, Heimdall (Idris Elba) reports to Thor (Chris Hemsworth) that Jane has disappeared. Thor returns to Earth and finds Jane; but when he sees that he has a strange energy protecting her, he brings Jane to Asgard to be healed.However, Malekith also awakes and goes to Asgard to retrieve the Aether. After a bloody battle, Frigga (Rene Russo) is murdered by Malekith and Thor proposes treason to his warriors friends of Asgard and teams up with Loki (Tom Hiddleston) to seek revenge for the murder of their mother and to vanquish Malekith before he destroys Asgard with his Dark Elves.""Thor: The Dark World"" is another great adventure of Thor. In this movie, Thor makes the most unlike association with Loki and the result is a wonderful movie. The scene of Loki fighting with Thor is the best moment of ""Thor: The Dark World"". Chris Hemsworth perfectly impersonates Thor and the conclusion surprises. Last but not the least, the movie is to be watched until the very end of the credits because there are two additional scenes in the credits. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Thor: O Mundo Sombrio"" (""Thor: The Dark World"")",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Fun movie going experience,"Thor, the Mighty Avenger, returns in his third outing in as many years. His latest installment derives plot strands from Thor and also deals with the residual effect of Avengers Assemble.With Loki imprisoned in the dungeons of Asgard, Thor strives along with his loyal comrades Lady Sif and the Warriors Three to maintain equilibrium across the nine realms. However, unbeknownst to Asgard, an old nemesis resurfaces in the form of the dark elves. Circumstances dictate Thor to forge an unlikely alliance with the captive Loki, in order to prevent an impending cataclysm.Directing duties change hands from Kenneth Branagh to Alan Taylor. A television veteran, Taylor has experience with shows such as Lost, The Sopranos and recently, Game of Thrones. It is that background which serves him well in this instance.He excels in making personalities with demi-god status more relatable, both in triumph and loss. All things affiliated with Asgard exhibits more authenticity. Furthermore, the characters are grounded in reality and the sequel delves deeper into the intricate relationships between characters than its predecessor.Chris Hemsworth is an admirable physical and emotional embodiment of the Norse deity. Tom Hiddleston is able to delineate grey shades in another accomplished performance as the nefarious Loki. While the latter may garner plaudits for his portrayal, Hemsworth shines as the eponymous warrior as well.While Thor was ostracized to earth in the first movie, the roles are now reversed and Jane Foster, played by Natalie Portman, is taken to Asgard. Portman is afforded a more substantial role and is pivotal to proceedings. All in all, she does well as Thor's star struck love interest.Doctor Who alum Christopher Eccleston portrays the implacable Malekith, a dark elf hell bent on seeking retaliation. While he delivers a menacing threat, assuring higher stakes for Thor, ultimately Malekith is tantamount to a generic and one-dimensional antagonist.The highlight of The Dark World is undoubtedly its humor. The blue print is akin to Iron Man 3 and the director is able to balance the comic relief with dramatic sequences. Secondly, the Thor and Loki dynamic is a thrill for viewers. Their collective charisma ensures some of the movie's better sequences.Moreover, the action and visual effects, in keeping with other Marvel movies, are exquisite. Battles are well executed and expansive, particularly the swashbuckling finale. Last but not least, the story arcs for both Thor and Loki culminate in an emotionally satisfying manner.The film is not without its loopholes though. At a running time of only 112 minutes, events unfold at breakneck speed, which may feel like several scenes have been edited. Ultimately, the sequel is bigger than its precursor in terms of scale and provides an engaging movie going experience.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
An unfocused mess,"The first Thor was probably one of Marvel's more trickier movies since it centered heavily around Norse mythology. To make it work in the ""real"" world was a massive task. Integrating a billionaire playboy who doubles as a tech-powered superhero, or a scientist who turns into a green rage monster was easier to accomplish than the fantastic world of Asgard, Gods & Monsters.Credit must go to Kenneth Brannagh who found the right balance between the fantastic and ""real"" (that's a stretch anyways) world. Furthermore, Brannagh focused on the characters instead of bombastic vfx (he still provided tons of beautiful shot visuals though).His replacement Alan Taylor however goes in the opposite direction and favors stylish visuals over character development. Worse still, the pacing and tone are all over the place.The Dark World tries to hard to provide the same brand of humor Joss Whedon is known for but fails to deliver the laughs, or they are rather misplaced.Bottom line: It's a too unfocused movie that suffers from a weak script and a director who tries too many things at the same time.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Excellent!,"Thor was arrogant and impulsive and learned to become more worthy . Thor : The Dark World begins an amazing way showing a great view of the mythology behind the 9 realms , the threat generated by the Dark Elves that have Ether that the course of the film becomes the real danger , then we have an already created for the development of the plot . We have an excellent view of the whole essence of the comic book Thor , the costumes and special effects contribute in an extensive Experience the general performances performed by the actors are convincing , the villainous Malekith is well interpreted and demonstrates a true cause for their action, Loki once again steals the show and keeps a large treacherous and leaving everyone in a state of attention to each step taken by him . Throughout the film we have a load of jokes and acceptable contrapartes , the mythology is explored very well in the movie as references to various occasions , the special effects are excellent , the soundtrack is good and demonstrates a balance between action of the moment. The film has problems like lack of direction in relation to the romance between Thor and Jane Foster and causes get stressed enough , in the final moments of the film lacks a bit of understanding . and we also have references to the Marvel universe , and stay until the end because there is 2 scenes after credits ; Thor : The Dark World is a great movie and one of the best ever made by Marvel Studios , is well worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
oh my god! this was just! no words!,"OK so i do have some words and they go a little something like this.... this movie was Bad with a capital B, Now i am an avid action film lover and mainly of marvel films and i went in with high hopes because i liked the first one but ill say again so disappointed.Allow me to list what was missing/wrong from this film,1) The plot! well i had trouble finding it or maybe i did find it but didn't believe that was it so i kept looking, it just did not suck me in at all and it didn't leave me wanting more.2) Visual effects! they were OK i guess seemed kind of dated in some places not the best iv seen but hey not the worst, Still for a movie of this caliber and expectations it was very much lacking.3) The Characters! (aka the soul of a movie) well this movie had no soul in fact when i left i felt mine died a little, this made me kinda sad but i got a frozen coke on the way out so that made me feel better for a little while i guess. Anyway i thought we were going to see the characters develop more but i was wrong again and man i hate it when i'm wrong 16 times in one day, I felt nothing for them i didn't even care for any of them and that bothers me a lot when you go to see a movie like this and you don't care? something is wrong and or missing.4) The Humor! A lot of people are talking about this both bad and good but i can't comment cause i didn't see nor hear any humor.5) Reaction from the Audience! Like watching a movie with friends when you reacted together in the same way for example laugh at something amusing it makes the movie more enjoyable, non existent in my theater of about 12 or so but still you would expect something like a laugh, a giggle or gasping but well you already know what i'm going to say.In conclusion this is my first time submitting a review for a movie and to be bothered so much by a movie to then write one has to mean something, It just seems like movies these days are lacking in heart they just want to pump these out without putting heart in them and that makes me sad... sad enough that now i have to go watch friends to cheer me up.Thank you for reading and remember these are just my thoughts and opinions by all means if you want to see it please do and form your own thoughts on the experience and i hope you enjoyed reading.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Better than the first Thor..,"I thought that Thor was a decent movie, but possibly the weakest of the Avenger stand alone movies. I didn't think it was on par with The Hulk Remake, Iron Man, and even Captain America. I felt the Thor movie was a little weaker (Captain America is a close, but not too close, second place).That said, Thor: The Dark World gives Thor the type of movie that the first one should have been. The scale is larger, the effects are better, and I think the story was stronger. I enjoyed the humerus aspects of the film which were ramped up due the success of the Avengers. This formula works.Hemsworth does a good job with Thor. You can tell he's really embraced this role as it is his defining role to date. He obviously looks the part, and he does a good job giving Thor a personality. He's a little rigid, but I think that's the character he's playing. The intensity is there, but so is the comic relief when it needs to be.Tom Hiddleston really steals the show with Loki. His charisma shines through in his portrayal and you can really tell when a truly talented stage/film actor such as Hiddleston finds a role and a character that he truly loves. His portrayal is effortless and full of emotion, which in my opinion, makes Loki by far the most intriguing villain in the entire Marvel Universe.I could do without Natalie Portman's character. I understand it's necessary in order to humanize the film and link Thor to Earth, but I find it a little pointless that she has to be included as a piece of the puzzle surrounding the Dark Elf mytho. Having Asgaard and the Dark Elves battle on their own would have been just as effective and less annoying.The three Agaardians are utilized much less in this movie and were almost rendered to bit-parts. I thought this was too bad as I'm certain they have larger roles to fill in the comic book universe and would have been a better fit into the movies as compared to the group of annoying human characters.Odin (Anothony Hopkins) was a mystery to me. In the first movie he is seen as a confident, wise, powerful leader whom must be shown respect and yet in this movie he appears to be a cranky old man. I wasn't thrilled with the treatment Odin received.In the end this is a solid movie and I think much better than the original. There are some strange directions taken with the story, but in the end some fantastic effects, solid acting, funny jokes, and Loki redeem many of the flaws Rating: 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Thor returns and hammers in great entertainment...,"Normally not one to be keen on superhero movies, but still I do watch the movies for entertainment. And whereas the previous Thor movie was alright, then ""Thor: The Dark World"" does surpass the previous movie.Sure, the storyline is cliché and you see what's coming a mile away. But still, it works out, because this is generic to the core, but there is just something fundamentally entertaining about this classic good vs. evil storyline, where evil wants to lay waste to the universe, and a single force of heroic good-doers thwart the evil plans.The storyline in ""Thor: The Dark World"" is about an ancient race of dark elves, who according to Asgardian legend, are conquered and exist no more. Along with them is the Aether, a force so strong that it can lay waste to the universe. When Jane Foster (played by Natalie Portman) comes across a minor cosmic anomaly in her search for Thor, little does she know that she has stumbled upon the Aether and awoken it from its dormant stasis, and along with it the dark elves.As for the effects, then ""Thor: The Dark World"" does deliver right on the money. The CGI are awesome to behold and also very realistic, which just adds to the worth of the entire movie. Without proper effects, then a Marvel superhero movie would not work out on the same level.And as for the costumes, armors and creature designs. Well that just blew me away. There were so many awesome details and concept designs going on here that it was just mind boggling. Asgard is indeed a marvelous sight to behold, as are the armors of the Asgardian warriors. But the Kursed creatures that were with the dark elves, that was just beyond anything I have seen.It is nice to see people return to their previous roles, and even with a pinch of comedy as in where Loki portrays and makes fun of Captain America.If you enjoy these particular types of movies, then ""Thor: The Dark World"" is well worth watching. Great action and lots of adrenaline to keep you on your toes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Loved It -  wasn't sure I would.,"I was worried that the color being so blue-ish and steel-like would distract me, along with the obviously make up artist change, but the story is very clever and well acted out. For whatever reason MARVEL spares no expense to add levity across the film to make the severe theme(s) less painful (without spoilers). Stay until after the entire credits sequence, and when you get home pre-order the DVD. Tom as Loki is priceless, and the Eric Selvig character actor is almost Cleese-like. It's nothing like Ironman 3 nor Wolverine, it's all MARVEL keeping in phase with the upcoming stories. You'll love how creative they get with Thor's Hammer as well - pay close attention to it toward the end of the film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
An amusing and simply a better sequel.,"While it possesses a predictably uninspiring plot almost every superhero movies use, Thor: The Dark World manages to be entertaining due to its clever script, great chemistry between the cast and amazing visual presentation. It improves on the original with larger action sequences and smoother, more appealing and more elegant scenes. At heart, the relationships between characters are amusing to watch, especially the dysfunction brotherhood of Thor and Loki, much to Tom Hiddleston's credit.It opens up slightly plain with monologue explanation of a banished ancient race that made an ominous weapon, was defeated in way and ultimately swore vengeance upon Asgard, which harrowingly feels all too similar to Superman's nemesis, amongst others. It then reintroduces the characters and how they fare after the events from the first movie. With Thor's concern over his duty and longing for Jane, the first half is a bit mundane. It does gradually become much more compelling with good acting and light yet efficient humor. Dialogues are funny, presented at timely occasions and don't feel forced. There lies sincere playful moments; more than most movies of its kind has to offer.Acting from the cast is charming. Chris Hemsworth seems more comfortable as Thor. He shows a fairly natural performance and it coincides well as the character itself becomes more mature. Natalie Portman as Jane is decent, but she's still somewhat trapped in the damsel in distress role. Tom Hiddleston performs wonderfully as Loki, still looking mighty treacherous but has a hint of redemption this time around. It's good to see both brothers interact with each other as that is one of the best moments of the movie.As expected from a blockbuster movie, it delivers quite well on its depiction of alien worlds intertwined with Earth. Asgard has abundance of tiny details, from its gadgetry, garment to mishmash of traditional Viking and futuristic housing. Color palette has changed from the first's dusky set of New Mexico to more cloudy grayish skyline of London. Nifty spectacles are spread throughout, battles are fought exotically and the clash of colors is enchanting. Its 3D effect has reasonably vivid impact, it won't impede the visual, in fact adds to the enjoyment.Thor: The Dark World is simply a better sequel. The plot might be generic, but its genuine humor, good acting and delightful graphic ensure an enjoyable lighthearted watch. As it stands now, it's one of the better action fantasy movies of recent time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Fun, epic and it fills up the whole room of excitement","Thor the Dark World is a total revolution from the first movie. The one thing i noticed though, throughout Thor, Avengers and Thor 2, his hair gets longer every time (which i'm not complaining). The movie was full of action, which fulfills the audience as they walk out of the theater. On the other hand, comedy took place in many parts throughout the movie. What is more interesting is that most of the comedy was performed by Loki, who everybody knows as a major Marvel Villain besides Dr. Doom and Thanos. The comedy, in my opinion, was there because the success of the Avengers, which had many comedy scenes in it, made this movie likable. This movie totally fixed the things that miss from the first Thor. There were many scenes where they introduced Thor's ability to performed his power in certain ways that no one had ever seen before. The connection of Thor and the people of Asgard and his family was portrayed really well by their language, joke and style of speech. The music was an epic score. It really defined the story and I still could not get it out of my head. It's not as memorable as Pirates of the Caribbean but it definitely built the excitement watching the movie. Everybody must go see it. It's well thought and the story and action really defined Thor. Go see go see!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Now this is how a comic-book film should be made,"I'm pretty grateful to the makers of the film; as I left the theater, I had that feeling which I haven't felt since the 90s. There is not one single unnecessary, exaggerated, dull or boring scene (some events which could easily be told by cliché scenes are artistically presented) and this is a sign that the film-makers of Thor: The Dark World take what they do serious and respect the audience.

"A decent and entertaining sequel, ""Thor: The Dark World"" is a lot of fun, but can't quite measure up to its predecessors.","In 2011, I was given a very decent surprise by the Marvel release ""Thor"", the fourth entry in ""Phase One"" of the ""Marvel Cinematic Universe."" (The overall franchise including characters like Iron Man, the Hulk, Captain America and Thor, all leading to the ""Avengers"" films) I wasn't sure what to expect going in, as the character seemed far too different from prior films in the franchise. ""How could this work?"", I would ask myself. But I'm glad I took the chance- I was blown away by the imagination, humor and wonderful storytelling. And it ended up being one of my favorite ""Phase One"" films.So I went into ""Thor: The Dark World"" with decently high expectations. The first film was such fun, I couldn't wait for the second. And how did it measure up? Unfortunately, it doesn't quite match the high quality of the character's previous outings in ""The Avengers"" and his 2011 titular film. However, despite that, it was still a very decent, humorous and very fun continuation of the character's story, and is well worth seeing for fans of the character and franchise.The story centers on Thor (duh), as he struggles with a number of situations, all leading to the possible destruction of the universe. After being re-united with his beloved Jane, Thor realizes her body has been inadvertently infused with ""Aether"", a powerful force that could potentially spell doom for all existence. Forced to protect her from a treacherous Dark Elf lord named Malekith, Thor will need to forge an uneasy alliance with his imprisoned brother Loki in order to save the known universe from Malekith's evil plans.As was the case in the first film, the cast is fantastic. Chris Hemsworth is blast as the hero Thor, this time showing more range and emotion than prior outings, making him more identifiable and compelling. Natalie Portman is also great as Jane, though I will comment that despite having a lot to do in the film, she doesn't have a lot of depth, making her feel tacked on at times, and as though she's only there to drive the plot forward. Kat Dennings and Stellan Skarsgard as Jane's companions Darcy and Selvig are an absolute joy, being more or less the comedic relief, as is newcomer Jonathan Howard as Darcy's new intern, Ian. Anthony Hopkins and Renee Ruso add a lot of class to the proceedings as Thor's parents, Odin and Frigga. Christopher Ecclestan is adequately threatening as Malekith, though he feels a bit under- developed. And supporting roles by the likes of Jamie Alexander, Ray Stephenson and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje are all very well-played, making good work in their secondary roles. But as before, the real show- stealer is Tom Hiddleston as Loki. He is just such a breath of fresh air, and gives such a compelling performance that he almost always overshadows everyone else. A truly remarkable performer.The script by Christopher Yost, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (based on a story co-written by the late Don Payne) is where some of my issues lie. It's not a bad script by any means. It's tightly paced, has some great sequences, and generally had something for every character to do. It also has some surprisingly hard- hitting scenes of emotion that surprised me. But I just feel that it leaves some characters under-developed. And it felt like a far smaller story as a result. (Even though it's larger in scope, it feels like less is happening.)Directorial duties are handed off this time to Alan Taylor, best known as a television director, though he has a few feature films to his credit. And I think he did a serviceable job in this film, with a strong visual sensibility and a keen eye for visual storytelling. Though I do feel that his work as a television director does show in some sequences, particularly early on. While the film is mostly theatrical, a few action sequences do have a slight ""tv- aesthetic"", though I could forgive them as they were few and far between. That being said, I did prefer Kenneth Branagh's direction in the first film a bit more. His more operatic, even slightly melodramatic style just fit the tone better, in my opinion.The rest of the production is top-notch though. The costume and set design is shockingly beautiful as it was before. The different worlds are clearly defined, and it seems a lot of care, research and detail was put into every aspect, lending credibility to the overall story. The cinematography was also something to behold, and I particularly loved the lighting. And the visual effects are astounding. Some of the best CGI work I've seen lately. Even when I knew the things on-screen weren't real, I still ""believed"" they were there.The only thing I think fell a bit short was the musical score by Brian Tyler. It just wasn't memorable, and although it fit the mood, it felt generic. Whereas in the first movie, I found myself recalling the gorgeous musical cues and even humming them to myself... here, it's just sort of generic swords-and-sorcery fare. A lot of drums and horns. And a few appearances of what I liked to call the ""Hans Zimmer 'Bwwwaaahhh'."" That loud, deep noise that has been popular over the past 5 or so years, that just sort-of sounds like someone shouting ""Bwwwaaahhh"" with a deep voice whenever something big happens on-screen.However, although I feel like I was pointing out a lot of negatives, there's still many positives here too appreciate. The action is great, the cast wonderful and the humor a blast. It's still a darned fun, entertaining film, and worth seeing for fans... it just isn't quite as good as it could have been.I give ""Thor: The Dark World"" a pretty-good 7 out of 10. Worth seeing for fans, but it probably won't win any new viewers.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Poor writing and characters,"There are a number of reasons why I found this film to be disappointing, unlike its predecessor which I enjoyed very much.1) Underdeveloped Bad Guy Syndrome: I know almost nothing about the bad guy even after watching the film. A dark elf who wants to blow everything up. Apparently that's all we need to know and all we'll ever know about the main villain in the film.2) Pointless Main Characters: The main characters in this film offer nothing of substance or value. For example, you could have replaced Jane with any other character without affecting the film. She exists solely as plot vehicle. The film does not explore her relationship with Thor, her reaction as a character to being transported to a different world, etc., etc. She's as thin as cardboard, like the rest of the main characters of this film.3) Very Poor Humor: Almost all of the jokes in this film made me roll my eyes and groan. It's as if the script writers liked the humor in Avengers and attempted to duplicate it without any knowledge of how.4) Ridiculous Plot Devices: Things in this movie only happen because the script says they have to. For example, Jane being the one possessed by the dark energy. Or the car keys being discovered on another planet. These things make no sense but exist solely because they have to for the plot to continue. I hate that.I had high hopes for Thor II but in the end it was just another disappointing let down.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Amazing CGI,"One thing for sure about this movie is the CGI. It is quite impressive and amazing. A lot of effort has been put to make this movie a good science fiction movie.However, as in most of the science fiction movie or the stories from Marvel. there is always the nagging thing which bothers me. In the set up where the character is using laser gun or whatever they call it, there is still some army who is fighting with a sword, lance and using shield. This does not really making any sense. If they could create something weapon of laser class, why would they fight using a sword ? And to make it worse, the party with the sword is actually beating the guy with the gun. I know this is science-fiction and movie is an imagination of something, but can it be made with more sense ?Another detail which I find a bit annoying is the ""politically correct"" selection of characters. This is a story of Nordic god. I have nothing against the African American people, but does it make sense to see one of the God portrayed by a black guy ? It does not matter how good the acting of this particular person, but he is so out of place in the environment of Nordic setting. Maybe for once; drop the ""politically correct"" attitude and do something for the benefit of the art...",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Actually really rather good...,"The Review: For me the original Thor film was my second , least favourite Marvel adaptation after Captain America (sorry Capt.). It wasn't bad but it always felt like it was missing something special. Now, two years later and bolstered by an appearance alongside his Avengers buddies, the Blonde, buff god returns in what is a far more well rounded and successful movie.The Story: Faced with an enemy that even Odin and Asgard cannot withstand, Thor must embark on his most perilous and personal journey yet, one that will reunite him with Jane Foster and force him to sacrifice everything to save us all.Firstly let's get this out the way. Thor 2 is actually really good. Excellent in fact. Of all the Avengers films, it's probably the most 'together ' . It has a simple story, which moves at pace, with action and drama but keeping it tight enough to come in at under 2 hours. It even manages to get around (at least MOSTLY get around) the standard CGI monster fighting CGI good guy trope that has hobbled the end of every Avengers film since Iron Man.A large reason why the film works so well is the sublime decision to once again sit an unlikely candidate in the director's chair. Be it Jon Favreau for Iron Man or James Gunn for the upcoming Guardians Of The Galaxy, Marvel have a knack of picking the right man for the job. This time out respected TV and Game Of Thrones director Alan Taylor brings a more even vision to the film, much more suited to the material than Kenneth Branagh, and obviously revels in having a larger that his usual budget to play with. The action is clean and well shot, and best of all you can see every punch, every explosion and every insane flying spaceship moment.Oh and talking of flying Spaceship moments director Taylor is obviously a fan of 80's cheese fest Flash Gordon, being that he borrows a considerable part of the films finale for the attack on Asgard. Not that I'm complaining as the mix of sci-fi, Norse legend, super hero and action make for a pleasant change form the usual Earth bound Marvel world.Hemsworth once again proves he is a man of considerable talent, delivering action alongside comedy and the occasional pathos. Naturally Natalie Portman has little to do (as is the female role generally in a Marvel film) but she remains a welcome addition, as does the returning Idris Elba, Tom Hiddleston (once again a stand out as Loki) and Anthony Hopkins (as his most gravelly). Rene Russo even gets to kick arse, which is nice. As for former Dr Who and professional grump Christopher Eccleston he does good with his limited bad guy role, but in reality with the added make up and FX it could have been anyone as Dark Elf leader Malekif.In truth the film has little against it, other than maybe an element of familiarity, and ends up being one of the best blockbusters of the year. Maybe not as good overall as Iron Man 3, but certainly more fun. For the most part.So overall a good script, great characters and some snappy dialogue alongside standout action sequences and a fast pace mean that deservedly Thor The Dark World will be another hit for Marvel. Truly a studio that cant seem to get it wrong.Reviewed By: Phil HobdenJoin the debate on our Facebook Group (www.facebook.com/groups/Filmsploitation) or on our website (www.thefilmpodcast.co.uk)",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Marvel was still perfecting his formula,"At this point, Marvel was trying and perfecting his formula and you can really notice it. The movies from phase 1 all had their unique touch, now they now feel more the same. This movie has the same problems as lot of the other marvel movies, jokes after jokes despite being a serious movie, a bad villain with no motivation, extra sidecharacters that do nothing, etc. And the story isnt really that interesting because of the villain mainly. Hes boring and uninteresting and you feel that he isnt really a threat. Still, despite being very inferior compared to its predecesor, and very forgetable, I still enjoy watching it and I consider its severly overhated.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Thor,"I think it was an excellent and enjoyable movie, even considering the parts that seemed unnecessary. I say this despite not being able to leave a critical review but an opinion is an opinion whether or not it is an informed one so they all count, both the good and the bad. I think the movie got a raw deal with all the other big movies that came out afterwards or maybe it just did not fit peoples tastes even it was a good movie . I don't understand why people are hyping Loki, yes the actor that played the part did an excellent job but the actor that play Thor also did an excellent job in how he portrayed the title character . I can't honestly see anyone else as Thor. I liked nearly the entire story the movie told and I did not find the villain to be as lacking as has been claimed by some, I just accepted him for who he was. The villain make have had a different personality to differentiate him from his counter part in the marvel comics.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Solid blockbuster with good mix of effects and entertainment, although needed to play to its strengths more","Years of disappointment and bad experiences have told me that most summer blockbusters are not the event movies that the advertisements would like you to believe; yes they are about the spectacle but with large TVs and strong sound systems being the norm now, it is not a big loss to enjoy such films in your home away from talking people, mobile phones, crowds and inflated prices. So it was with the Thor sequel. The original film had been pretty good but seemed cluttered with introductions and franchise stuff. The second film doesn't have so much of this and it mostly works pretty well although it must be said that it never seems to consistently play to its strengths.The plot does seem to link to Marvel lore that fans will appreciate but for the casual viewer it works well enough to do the job without knowing too much. Basically some dark power has escaped and Jane has been exposed to it making her a target for some dark elves who seek to destroy everything. Thor must not only protect her but also destroy the dark power before it can be harnessed by the elves – a task he can only perform with the help of Loki, currently rotting away in a cell. As a plot it sets up lots of confrontation and this is the main thing we are here for, so in that regard it works well enough. That said, it doesn't seem to be able to do enough of its better stuff.The better stuff tends to be the less serious material; Thor is a character and a story steeped in serious words and big Norse gods whereas Iron Man (for example) has a playboy at its centre, thus making the fun and swagger easier to come by. This film benefits from Loki being fun and playful as a villain and when he is around the film is better; there are a few other aspects where the playful fun comes in but mostly it is associated with Loki and there are frankly too few of these scenes. The fun adds to the entertainment value and while it does still work without it, it doesn't work quite as well.The special effects are good though and if you are looking for distracting noise and spectacle then this does the trick – perhaps not enough to hold your full attention but perfectly fine if you wish to switch off the brain to a certain extent. The cast act well considering they are mostly on a green screen. Hemsworth gets the balance right between playing a big god and also having a bit of fun, his only issue is sometimes the material doesn't let him do this. Portman is not so much of a presence although she does well enough and she has good chemistry with Hemsworth. Hiddleston gets the best material and has fun with it. Hopkins booms out his lines and Eccleston is a good (but unrecognizable) villain. Support is good from Alexander, Stevenson, Russo, Dennings, Skarsgård and others, while HBO fans will enjoy seeing two very strong characters from two shows represented by Akinnuoye- Agbaje (Oz) and Elba (The Wire).This isn't an amazing film but it is a solid blockbuster with good effects and plenty going on. I prefer it when it mixes some fun into the more faux-heavy dialogue and I'm not sure why it doesn't do this more often but it still works pretty well if you're in the mood for effects- driven action and spectacle.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Good movie though felt held back than letting loose with the scope Thor Universe has.,"Having mix reactions about the movie, on one hand i loved minor characters like Darcy & her Intern, The Warriors Three were a hoot. In the big league, Loki was awesome as always though his deceptive plot seemed simple than complex which i prefer.Thor was being Thor, while i grow less of a fan of that beard by each passing movie, i do enjoy his dialog delivery. Jane Foster is growing tiresome at least on me, her animated counterpart was better portrayed in Avengers EMH, i guess Natalie Portman can't do much about this one as the cinematic character itself seems to lack scope for development. I really want Marvel to move to Thor & Sif, Sif for the brief period i saw her in Thor tales of Asgard, grew on me quite well.I was looking forward to the Dark Elf but again Thor Tales of Asgard did a better job with Algrim than Dark World with Malekith. Like Man Of Steel the movie can be better experienced in moments than a complete experience, the end credit scene for example just increased my curiosity & some scenes featuring Loki did bring out the best of Thor.I hope the Next Thor movie can build on this.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"This movie continues the storyline on our titular hero on a fairly blemished note, but at least it is not a total washout","This sequel to 2011's 'Thor' exhibits the return of our titular Marvel superhero with both the good and the bad to offer for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. With no surprise, expectations were high on how this film would handle the resurrection of the hammer- wielding god of thunder considering how the cinematic universe is set speak to the fanbase rather than Hollywood's general expectations. This only bring us to the question of whether it succeeds. The answers lies square in between yes and no. Kenneth Branaugh who directed the first film dropped out of the project, and the director's chair was handed over to Alan Taylor. The final outcome shows the Branaugh holds a slightly more gifted handling on the source material whereas Taylor's rendition of the titular hero leaves more to desired. By no means does this mark a disaster of a sequel but rather a disappointing one to say the least. It has the sleek visual scope that everyone would expect to come from a big- budget MCU entry, but what it has to offer from a narrative standpoint is fairly underwhelming. Chris Hemsworth returns as Thor, the god of thunder who returns to Earth to find his lover Jane Foster (played by Natalie Portman) cursed by a mysterious force known as Aether, a sinister weapon helmed from a dark realm. And the evil leader Malekith (played by Christopher Eccleston) is behind all this. When Thor brings Jane to Asgard to learn what's happening to her, his father Odin (played by Anthony Hopkins) lacks interest is helping. This leaves Thor with no one to turn to but his dubious brother Loki (played by Tom Hiddleston) in a fight against Malekith and his army of Dark Elves in an effort to free Jane of this sinister curse.Watching Thor battle against the evil demonic forces, thrashing his lightning-charge hammer in an ass-kicking frenzy should be a whole lot of fun. For awhile, it has its moments of excitement, but it is not too long before the excitement steadily starts to drain out beneath the underwhelming storyline. The film does what its predecessor did best, and that is setting up the story with an intriguing premise involving a mythological war raging between Asgard and the evil forces that threaten the mythical realm. Once the the plot kicks into gear, it settles with something less interesting than what is promised. The first half moves along a series of frenetic, visually-arousing action sequences intertwined with overlong exposition used to establish our new main villain Malekith, who is played cleanly by Christopher Eccleston, but nonetheless fails to grow as an interesting figure. Whereas Tom Hiddleston's Loki flourished with charisma that made him a compelling villain, Malekith lacks depth and feels awfully generic which only renders it final climatic sequence less effective; though not without plenty of sweet special effects to go around. As for Chris Hemsworth, he remains charismatic ever as ever in the title role as does Tom Hiddleston as his brother Loki who's alignment on both the good side and the bad side stands ambiguous. Meanwhile, Natalie Portman is restrained in the damsel-in-distress role that operates more as a plot device than a solid character. Many will be wishing she and Hemsworth demonstrated a much stronger chemistry.Thor: Dark World marks a fairly inferior chapter to the now- franchise, and ends on a rather disappointing note. However, it is not to say that Alan Taylor doesn't offer the goods in terms of special effects action elan to occupy those who are able to skim past the patchy flaws in its script. Compared to other entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, this makes for a lesser option, but maybe one worth at least a try for better or worse. After all, the movie is not a total washout",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A Bit Anticlimactic,"""Thor: The Dark World"" takes place shortly after the events of ""The Avengers"" (2012). Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is in custody and has been imprisoned for life on Asgard, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) has brought peace to the nine realms, and all is good in the universe. Or so it would seem.Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and her intern, Darcy (Kat Dennings), noticed some gravitational anomalies in London. Jane stumbled into a wormhole of sorts and wound up with some dark matter in her body called Aether. That was Marvel's hackneyed way of putting Thor and Jane back together again.We find out that the gravitational anomaly is due to the nine realms coming into alignment; a phenomenon called ""The Convergence."" This happens once every 5000 years, and it's a big deal because a dark elf named Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) wants to capitalize upon this event by releasing the powerful Aether in order to bring darkness to all nine realms. Didn't we just escape a world threatening disaster?Thor will have to figure out a way to stop Malekith and save the nine realms. Standard superhero stuff. It's a bit anticlimactic after watching ""The Avengers."" Instead of seeing multiple heroes do their thing we're relegated to one guy and his helpers. I'm glad he saved the world for us mortals even if it wasn't that exciting.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
An Asgardian who is now ready to become a king,"This film was quite expected. Marvel has already gained a reputation as the creators of excellent blockbusters about superheroes. Thor is a wonderful character. And his return was expected.The film demonstrates an excellent picture, the play of the actors, a twisted plot, so necessary for the overall narrative of the entire cinematic universe. There is comedy, drama, battle scenes. In general, everything that the viewer expects when he starts watching a blockbuster.Tom Hiddleston truly adorns the picture. His Loki is a diverse and complex character, to whom one way or another he begins to relate with sympathy. And this is the merit of the actor, his charisma and good looks.Chris Hemsworth is irresistible again. He is smiling, severe where necessary, dramatic and again perfectly conveys to the audience the emotions and experiences of his hero Thor.Jane Foster and her friend are funny together, setting the heat with their antics. Jane is more serious, and Darcy is an eternal joker, without which the film would definitely lose.Christopher Eccleston's work is not very impressive. But this is rather an omission of the script. His villain Malekith acts as some kind of cardboard, brutal. The character is not revealed. He just exists and needs to be defeated.Computer effects are back on top. They are especially colorful when you watch a movie with 3D glasses. I've been waiting for this. That's what I got. No more and no less. Just for granted. The special effects are bright, which often even distracts from the essence of the film. Maybe that's why there was a feeling that the characters' characters were faded against the background of the picture.In the finale, you realize that now Thor is ready to become the true king of Asgard, he has passed the path of becoming, realized how important it is to be a loving and responsible hero.The film will not make fans disappointed. Good music, a strong soundtrack, a great picture and the actors' performance is on top. But still something is missing for a furore. There are a couple of memorable moments that are especially pleasing, but, unfortunately, not the whole movie.8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Definitely Not The Best MCU Film,"I've been rewatching all the Marvel Cinematic Universe films recently, and Thor: The Dark World is my most recently finished. Although this movie isn't the best MCU film, I still think it's worth the watch. Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, Stellan Skargard, etc. are all great in the film, but I think where the film goes wrong is with it's villain. I believe that they should have given more character development than they gave him. We don't know why he originally wanted the Aether other than him wanting power. The other qualities of the film are just fine. Most of the humor lands, and the CGI/special effects are great.My rating: 6.75/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
You have seen this before. Watch something else.,"Walking out of Thor: The Dark World I felt I just watched Transformers: Dark of the Moon again. It has the spit out formula that blockbuster movies like Iron Man 2 have. It feels like TV has another spin off cop show. The CGI is big-budget, but the story here has hardly any suspense and is boring. The movie reuses the short action, talking, villain creates problem, talking, and conclusion plot line. The movie starts with a small-scale fight with irrelevant enemies to introduce Thor. Then Jane messes with a portal while an ancient vengeful antagonist who lost long ago shows up, all the way to the mid-point when Marvel recreates the Star Wars The Phantom Menace battle with the energy shield dome and two armies run at each other, and it ends shortly, to restart in the ending. Thor has no weaknesses and he needs Loki for distraction. Describing the ending in one sentence sounds like the premise of The Avengers ending. Save your money for the next Marvel movie.

Enjoyable Action Romp,"This movie improves on the last Thor film. It's nicely paced and has some excellent action scenes.

one of the worse film in marvel series and undeveloped (6.3),"I think thor regressed compared to the first movie and I think it got worse while waiting for it to be better.It was a pleasure to see the Thors universe in the first film, but I have already known that universe a little bit, I want to see different things now, but the only thing I see is the change of the enemy and the 7 universes coming on top of each other.There were some ridiculous events in the movie for example Jane Foster going into Thors universe, of course, she goes elsewhere before thor's universe and unwittingly steals the power the dark elves want.Though thor's movies are interesting, Thor has an advantage over other superheroes.

"The God of Thunder Returns, with More Lightning","Marvel's superheroes just keep coming. It's just only been a few months since the release of the immensely successful ""Iron Man 3"". Now it's Thor, the God of Thunder to strike back. Thor is of course the least relatable of the Avengers. But that doesn't stop this movie from succeeding.There are multiple references to what happened in the blockbuster ""The Avengers"". Often referred to as the ""alien invasion in New York"", it doesn't really play a major role in the primary plot in ""Thor: The Dark World"" itself. So, even if you haven't watched ""The Avengers"", don't worry, you won't feel left out.The plot of ""Thor: The Dark World"" concerns with something extremely ancient. The Aether is kind of like a fluid that is extremely full of energy and is able to turn ordinary matter into dark matter. This ancient relic begins to play its part in the story after scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) travels to another world accidentally and encounters it. It is later revealed that every 5000 years, the nine realms will be in perfect alignment and therefore, borders between these worlds become blurred. This is an event known as the ""Convergence"".However, due to the recent activity of the Aether, a race called by the Dark Elves, led by Malekith, are awakened. Apparently, they were once ruthless rulers who were defeated by Odin's father Bor. Bor vanquished the Dark Elves and it started a peace that lasted for thousands of years. However, Malekith wants the Aether to plunge the whole universe into total darkness. He intends to that at the peak of the ""Convergence"". Now, it's up to Thor to stop Malekith and his evil schemes. If Thor is to defeat Malekith, he's going to need help from someone unlikely...... Loki.Yes! A team-up between Thor and Loki. This is one of the most exciting components of the film. Thor is serious, powerful whereas Loki is wise-cracking, mischievous, and very tricky. Together, they form a very well-balanced duo and seeing them work together is true joy.There is plenty of action. Of course! It's a superhero action movie. But the superpowers incorporated here are mighty and therefore the sequences are intensified. The Aether is slick and don't forget, Mjolnir is a ravager. The 3D is amazing and I watched this in IMAX 3D. Not all of the scenes were shot in IMAX, but some of the landscapes were incredibly beautiful. More of Asgard is revealed and it really is gorgeous.The movie also had a comedic nature. In fact, it was funnier than I expected. The mischievous and charismatic Loki is plenty of fun to watch. Watching him on screen is pure delight and his character is extremely interesting. But you also have to keep an eye on Dr. Erik Selvig, Jane's ally. He's gone a bit crazy in this movie and therefore, his antics are hilarious in the movie.Malekith is an all-powerful villain and he is intimidating. However, I didn't really think he was an interesting villain. His background is rich but that was short. We don't know really know Malekith. He is extremely devoid of character and sometimes, he's so boring. He, along with his race, speak a language that sounds like pre-historic dialect to me.Performances were wonderful. Chris Hemsworth is a well-rounded character and has given Thor adequate depth. Natalie Portman is stunning as the pretty and intelligent Jane Foster. Anthony Hopkins shows his class as Odin. Tom Hiddleston is flawless as Loki. His performance is top-notch. Christopher Eccleston's performance was polished enough, although his character was a bit boring.So is it a good movie? Yes. ""Thor: The Dark World"" is a good sequel and I would say that this exceeds the original in quality. I enjoyed the film although the villain was kind of dull. It may fall in some aspects but overall, this is a great success. And as a Marvel film, check out the two post-credits scenes.Rating: 8/10Final Verdict: ""Thor: The Dark World"" is a well-polished sequel that has great action, excellent chemistry (especially between Thor and Loki), but lacks character in the villain.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Thor faces off with some angry elves.,"The word that most comes to mind when describing Thor: The Dark World, is IMPRESSIVE! This second independent Thor film in no way disappoints and in my opinion is only topped by The Avengers in likability. The sheer scope of the movie is awesome. We see a lot more of Asgard and get to bounce around to a few of the Nine Realms for a very enjoyable ride. Director, Alan Taylor does a phenomenal job balancing the action (and there is a lot), the drama, and the humor in this film. There are some genuinely touching scenes in this film, something that Marvel, overall, has done a good job with in the Avengers based films.The basic plot involves some pretty nasty Dark Elves and their desire to unleash some cosmic badness, effectively ending the universe as we know it. These elves are tough hombres. They have stealth ships and weapons powerful enough to cause Asgard and our heroes some real problems. But the heart of the film lies in the relationship between Thor, again played perfectly by Chris Hemsworth, and his mischievous brother, Loki, who Tom Hiddleston has made my favorite villain. The best moments are between these two. I won't throw out any spoilers, but I will say that Loki is spectacular.Natalie Portman is back as Jane Foster, Thor's love interest, as is Stellan Skarsgård, who is very fun to watch as Erik Selvig, the slightly off astrophysicist. Anthony Hopkins, puts in another turn as Odin, Thor's old man and conveys a tiredness of the old king as he once again faces war with an old enemy.See this film in the theater.

Some jokes were better rephrased in French than in English, from what I've seen in the trailer. A couple scenes were almost word-less and still had me shaking in laughter.

Dark World focuses mainly on Thor, and Thor. The supporting cast is there but much less important than anything Thor does to progress the plot (the plot on Earth has no effect on the story).

Flawed but unfairly maligned,"Thor: The Dark World is a fun movie that has its limitations, but still manages to entertain.One of the things that this movie does well is its interplay between characters. We see a deeper exploration of Thor's relationship with his brother, Loki, as well as a budding romance between Thor and Jane Foster.The special effects in the movie are solid, with good CGI used to bring the Nine Realms to life.However, the movie's plot is a bit convoluted and can be confusing at times. Additionally, some of the jokes in the film fall flat and don't quite land the way they're intended to.Despite its limitations, Thor: The Dark World is still a solid entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

Avenger Franchise has Lost its Steam,"TERRIBLE MOVIE!!!We just saw the movie today and we wished we hadn't wasted the money.

Plus the last hour or so of the movie became terribly predictable and simply boring. The first two Iron Man movies were fantastic, the first Thor and Captain America movies were great, but not with the disappointment of Iron Man 3 and not Thor 2 I feel that the Avengers franchise has lost its steam....

"Great fun, great film.","Thor The Dark World was everything I was hoping for and quality entertainment from opening scene to the last. The director presents the entire film in a way that can be savored. Many aspects are just plain old fun kick-butt action scenes. It's a perfect blend of action and humor and yet it still remembers to pack a heart. The pacing was perfect even though I would've liked to have seen more quality time spent between Jane and Thor. That would've added more credibility to the chemistry and longing they both display for each other. Besides a few minor shortcuts in story, this film packs quite a punch and is every bit as good as I hoped it would be.Just like Iron Man, they played both sides of the fence perfectly. You need know nothing about the character to enjoy the film yet the fans were respected and spotted the little things that service the story but don't really register to non-fans. There are heavy ties to the events of Avengers but since everyone saw Avengers, that's a good thing.I think this sequel is very well written and proves the character and the mythos have layers to explore.

An unaccomplished sequel,"As per Marvel studios the production, effects, costumes etc were fantastic, certainly provided a spectacle. 
The plot however was (to sound like a douche critic) fairly contrived. Followed a very basic formula with little depth and character development.

A good sequel.,"THOR: THE DARK WORLDAs sequels go, I was expecting this to be quite bad... but to be honest, I liked it as much as the original movie.The movie is about Jane Foster. Jane was the love interest in the original movie and she has now been hot with something that has given her a strange power. Thor returns to Earth to protect her from the evil Dark Elves.This is a very worthy sequel. It was made after the Avengers Assemble, so if you are going to watch these movies in order, then watch the original Thor, then the Avengers Assemble and then this.The story is really good. I like the way that Jane has got more involved in the fight this time around. Thor takes her up to Asgard to protect her so most of the movie is set up there. As I have stated in the original review, the vision of Asgard is so colourful and beautiful so I was happy that a lot more of the movie was set up there.As before, the effects were very good and the fighting scenes were great. The action was a lot of fun and kept you glued to the screen.The main thing I didn't like about this film was how quickly Thor had forgiven Loki for what he had done. Thor needs his help and understand that, but he should never forgive him for destruction and death he has caused in the last 2 movies. It just didn't feel right.The movie stars Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Anthony Hopkins, Tom Hiddleston and Christopher Eccleston. The acting seemed better in this movie than the last one. It was great to see Christopher in this. I have always liked him and thought he did a great job in this.The make-up looked great too... the creatures looked really creepy and fit in really well into the movie.This is a good movie and if you enjoyed the original one then you will like this.""Well done, you just decapitated your Grandfather.""For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Entertaining and Inspirational,"I was really waiting for this movie to come out as recently I have really fell in love with Marvels work. And because I have seen the first part of Thor (I know I haven't reviewed it yet but I will) and really liked not only the overall concept of it, but also how it has been made for viewers to enjoy.Although IMDb suggests that this is an action, adventure and fantasy genre movie I would definitely add comedy to this list as well. You will see in this post later on few silly quotes I fancied, but believe me - there was a lot more where it came from! I was laughing really often although others in the cinema weren't quite as much, so it gets back to your sense and level of humor.Story totally fascinated me by its moving around the time ans space and how it all fit together. Although partly I wished I could get to know other worlds as well but they managed to connect every story on the timeline quite good.This movie totally inspired me at the time I really needed it and especially by showing me really well made bad character. He was gruesome, ingenious, evil and overall resentful. Although from the story I understood that their species weren't left a lot, but in the movie it seemed like quite a lot of them fought and died, and fought more, I would have wanted to understand - where did they came from? Born suddenly, and if so then how? But this was the only thing I couldn't understand as one super strong warrior can't be at all places at the same time to win the war, right?Although I couldn't understand why the quality of effects changed during the movie from really crappy made ones to really great, overall I really enjoyed this movie and will definitely watch it few time more.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Me Thor, you Jane","It sure was Dark all right, they weren't wrong there. It's as well to remember this is Marvel-Disney; so what if there's the odd mix of dark menace and light-hearted frivolity, it's only a motion picture after all. I enjoyed the first Thor but the second was even more stylish and enjoyable if weighed down by even more nonsense-science.Er, basically primeval dark forces attack Asgard – and Greenwich, London – pretty obviously via gravity space-time wormholes, Thor's girlfriend Jane is accidentally invested with a sinister Mcguffin power that is chased after by the head baddie (whose physog reminded me of a young Davros from Dr Who), Thor doesn't trust Loki and Loki doesn't blame him, and cartoon bones and concrete are crunched remorselessly from the off. On the way to the crackers climax Thor obediently hangs his hammer up on a handy coat rack and decides to catch a handy tube to get to the final battle in time. Light comedic touches like those always go down well with me, I love panache when trying sell a ridiculous plot or watching a film revelling in brazen brainlessness. It's also the first film I've ever seen to contain a last minute killer twist, then a sinister teaser for the next film, and finally a droll comedy moment to end on but one that would definitely have dire implications for anyone happening to be walking by at that moment! As with the first film I thought Tom Hiddleston stole the show, and Idris Elba had a marvellously enigmatic character to portray. And again, the serious reason for some of the warring sides to fight with swords and some with guns escapes me, as it did at 11 years old reading Edgar Rice Burroughs' Martian series. The cgi cartoonery seemed perfect to me, capturing flawless vistas of other worlds and impressive violence alike to these old eyes.The kids would probably make much more sense of it all than I could, and maybe even follow the swift impenetrably dark battles successfully – me, I went along with it in the right spirit and thoroughly enjoyed it. I mean why bother giving it a chance at all unless you want it to work?",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Definitely one of the best MCU movies ever produced!,"This is the second time that I've watched ""Thor: The Dark World"" and I am very confident when I say that this movie is definitely one of the best MCU solos that have been ever made. I've heard that there are a lot of people who didn't like this movie, or who believe that the other parts of ""Thor"" are better, but I think that this one is the best.Aside from the fact that this one is overall darker, ""Thor: The Dark World"" has a very good acting, great special effects and CGI and an unexpected great soundtrack. Ok, maybe the storyline it's not as solid as with other MCU movies, but for me Malekith it seems like a really scary and threatening villain and somehow it reminds me of the dark elves of ""The Elder Scrolls Online"", which made the movie to seem even more interesting, because of this tiny resemblance.""Thor: The Dark World"" it's a successful MCU movie.

Extremely Disappointing.,"I went into this movie very excited. I love marvel movies. In fact, The Avengers was one of the best movies of the last couple of years. While I thought the first Thor movie was the worst of the first wave of Marvel movies, I went into this one with high hopes. But within the first five minutes of the movie I was bored out of my mind. Throughout the entire movie NOTHING happens. They spend the entire movie talking about doing something, or talking about things they did off screen. Even the action scenes were incredibly boring. they just bounced around from punch to punch. Nothing really ever gets resolved. Then there's the writing. The characters are very one dimensional. There dialog was very unrealistic. I mean, no one talks like they do in this movie. And there is absolutely no character development, the characters end the movie exactly where they started! Then there's the villain. I love Eccleston. But they didn't give him anything to do. He simply walks on screen, looks at something, then walks off. He's BORING! Just like everything else in this movie. All this movie is capable of is beating you over the head with all of the pretty lights. And while the movie is gorgeous. That doesn't cover the lack of story. In the end, this movie was terrible. It was one of the worst excuses for a movie I have ever seen.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Another decent superhero film, which is entertaining enough, even if it sometimes tries a little too hard to be something it's not.","'Thor: The Dark World' (or 'Thor 2') is another solid entry into the Marvel Universe - it's not the best superhero film, nor is it the worst. I'm glad they've kept the cast together and hopefully Marvel can do this across all their franchises, as it gives them a bit of authenticity. It's fun to see how they link some of the threads back to 'The Avengers', particularly with Dr Erik Selvig (Skarsgård).Now, I don't know who out there actually loves Thor, because he's certainly one of my least favourite Marvel characters, especially in the comics, as he's so rigid and boring and never does anything too exciting. He's certainly no Wolverine or Spiderman. And that's the film's biggest hurdle - how to make Thor and the story interesting for 110min. It sort-of achieves this... I know it's mostly set in Asgard, a different realm, but even then there are still a few things which stretch credibility:Why do the ""Dark Elves of Svartalfheim"" wear puppet masks? And why do they want to destroy the universe and - presumably - themselves?What exactly is the ""Ether""? It's not just an alkaline chemical...Where exactly is the ""Dark World""? Is it on Asgard, or is it another realm? Is it different to the ""Limbo"" dimension?Is Benicio Del Toro actually needed at the end of the film?Why is Asgard so poorly defended?Why does the final confrontation take place on Earth, where the Dark Elves can be easily found? And why can't the other Avengers - or the Fantastic Four, or the X-Men - help? Especially if the future of the universe is at stake? Seems unlikely S.H.I.E.L.D. would leave this up to Thor by his lonesome...One of the big saving graces is some of the witty laughs provided by Chris O'Dowd and Kat Dennings (plus Stan Lee's patented cameo!). There's some expertly timed quips thrown in, which add some levity to what could easily become quite a cumbersome story. I think that Hopkins was pretty wasted as Odin, Hemsworth has some decent moments as Thor, but Hiddleston as Loki once again almost steals the show, because even though you may hate him, he's often so likable! A great character to hold this part of the Marvel Universe together.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Just A Blast! I Just Loved This Film!,"Thor works on so many levels. It meets its toughest challenge and that is to make its super powerful blond godlike lead character relatable and spark a connection to the audience. For all the action extravagance and adventure, a surprising connection occurs here. This certainly isn't some wild video game popcron flick. It also packs the perfect amount of comedy and connection. It's what Marvel does best, give us heroes with flaws.A lot of this film takes place hopping across realms and that was absolutely the right way to present the film. The fantastical elements really work. Asgard is breathtaking and incredible. They manage to be dramatic and serious most of the time but balance it with a sense of humor. Thor finds the right mix similar to the way Avengers did. The film never becomes too self-important or portentous but still is dramatic and fun. That is something to savor and enjoy. Sure, viewers are thrilled by his powers, but we relate to his emotions and his flaws. Add some intense sibling rivalry, great action and romantic entanglements and Thor may just be the best movie of the year.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Mixed thoughts from someone who loved the first film,"A few complaints before I address what worked for me. While I enjoyed it, I felt it didn't have quite the ""wow"" factor the first film had. The mood throughout is somber, both in look and feel, with the occasional bit of humor (mostly from Kat Dennings). The story is more complex and I'm not of the camp that feels that is always a good thing. Once again, the cast is great although it seems the supporting characters like Sif and The Warriors Three are largely wasted. Odin is especially pompous and unbearable this time around. When you have Thor having to counsel his father on peace not war, it feels at times like this isn't even the same Odin from the first film. Obviously the sci-fi gobbledygook elements will please many. I'm referring to the Aether nonsense and everything surrounding it. It's one of those ""shut your brain off to enjoy it"" moments for me. Also, Loki's trick of using illusions or impersonating people was used way too much. It made the last time he uses it in the film less effective. The villain Malekith is uncharismatic and, frankly, dull. Finally, the look of the film wasn't my favorite. This is just a stylistic preference but I felt it was too ""Lord of the Rings"". Everything was muted colors and kind of depressing. The first film was much brighter and felt like more of a superhero movie. Stick with what has worked for you, Marvel. Let DC make their dour superhero films. Keep it bright.OK, now you read all that and you probably wonder how I can say I still enjoyed the film. Well, I loved the performances from Hemsworth and Hiddleston. I also liked Kat Dennings and appreciated how she lightened things up. Natalie Portman had way more to do than the first film and was enjoyable and pretty as usual. While I said I didn't care for the overall dark look of the film, I did admire the special effects. They were very well done, save for the opening scene which was a little too fake with obvious CGI soldiers. Ultimately, I enjoyed it enough but it wasn't one of my favorite Marvel films. Thor is my favorite Marvel superhero and I loved the first movie. I realize a lot of fans are rabid about these films and have a ""you either love it or hate it"" mentality but I'm in the middle. I liked it but I didn't love it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
What was that?,"Terrible movie. As bad as the first entry and this is hopefully the last. Convoluted, blurred, and without meaning, this was a mess from start to finish. I give it 4 stars for some humor, and the fact that I own several 60's Thor comic books and hope the attention increases the worth of my collection. BAD! I fell asleep early on, went to get popcorn and soda to wake up; after another 30 min found myself dozing again. This is amazing considering it was cold and very loud in the theater. Forgive me, I like story development, and characters to root for, or root against. There is nothing worthy here. This was made because the previous entry made money, so why not chase the cheddar shall we?! Hollywood and their overuse of CGI is increasingly bad and overdone. The characters hop around, as they do in Man of Steel another bad flick. They move really fast and do things we could never imagine characters doing 30 years ago on screen. Well so what?! It looks sooo fake and the result is an unimportant, needless and ridiculously boring movie.

A very good sequel,"About two years after the events from the first instalment, a very old enemy of the universe awakens, seeking to find his lost power and turn everything into darkness.

This time, Thor must find a way to eradicate it, while struggling to protect his family and human friend. As its predecessor, it is filled with plenty of action, drama and suspense, while sometimes even making you laugh with a very well placed joke or pun. In comparison with its predecessor, it is much more serious and dark, thus more captivating and interesting.

I've come to accept your surrender.,"Thor gets another try to make a great movie. And while it is enjoyable, it isn't great. It's just...decent.I liked Thor a lot more in this movie than in his first flick and the Avengers. He was much more charming, likable and yet still a force to be reckoned with. Hemsworth's performance was a lot better in this movie too, even with his emotional scenes, like with Frigga's death and when Loki died.Speaking of Loki, he was incredible in this movie as well. His brotherly banter with Thor was so enjoyable because it is what normal brothers actually do. I'm glad that he's still playing his games with Thor and Asgard.I also really like how this movie looked. The first Thor film actually looked pretty good showing the mystical Asgard but in this film it's much more defined. I love the scene with the ships fighting each other because we get to explore the land more. Even the wardrobe for the characters looks better as it doesn't look like plastic but looks very well designed. One scene that was powerful as well as beautiful, was Frigga's funeral. No words were spoken but there was still a huge amount of emotion that could be felt. It also helped that it looked amazing.The villain in this movie, Malekith, was horrible. He was even outshadowed by Loki. He had no development or interesting qualities, we were just told that he was evil. He is no doubt the worst villain the MCU has had.I also have to complain about the humans in this movie. Jane was still annoying, and I still don't believe Natalie Portman as a scientist. Darcy was equally as annoying as total nuisance and caused mass eye rolls in the theater. I still like Selvig, as he's dealing with being under Loki's control. I am actually glad that a good portion took place in Asgard although Jane being there was bad.Even though the final battle took place mostly on Earth, it was actually really fun, having Thor fly around and go through portals to different realms and different parts of London.+ Better performance from Hemsworth + Loki + Asgardian aesthetic - Characters on Earth - Terrible villainFinal Score: 7.2/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Hairy ordeal that is less Epic nonetheless fun!,"If there ever was one character from The Avengers that I was least interested in, that'd be.(No not HawkEye, cmon give that guy a break) Thor. Yes the Asgardian Odinson, the God of Thunder. And blame that on the 2010 movie Thor. Compared to other Marvel movies at the time, I found Thor to be lackluster. There was action, there were epic set- pieces, there was fish-outta-water comedy and most of all was the origin story of Thor and Loki who'd be seen more in the upcoming The Avengers. But while Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk set the perfect stage for The Avengers, Thor's origin story faltered at it. I could only see it as a companion piece to the Marvel Phase One and nothing else.Directed by Alan Taylor, who's directed a whole bunch of HBO Shows, Thor The Dark World's story takes place in Asgard and London, presumably coz New York was still in ruins post the incidents from The Avengers. And our world's once again at stake, all thanks to the Dark Elf Malekith and Thor is instinctively called upon by Jane Foster who, of all the people, stumbles on the very thing Malekith wantssome gooey evil thing called the Aether. We are once again counting on Thor to save the day (or save Jane). Thor The Dark World is as drab as the original but I was impressed with the pacing of the movie. It had a lot of fun moments as well touchy drama sprinkled around. Usually I'd be taking mental notes when the movie gets drab but Thor The Dark World didn't give a chance for that. Was it coz the movie was that good? NO! Was it entertaining? YES! I was constantly thrown around from one set piece to another. The movie also cleverly manages to incorporate several nods to The Avengers and its upcoming sequel as well S.H.I.E.L.D., as the story progressed.Chris Hemsworth once again dorns his Asgardian armor and cape as the Thor and he was very much in character and makes me wonder if he's always so. Then again, having seen his Red Dawn, I need not raise a bet. I was not a Loki fan, neither in Thor nor in The Avengers. But here he was just mind blowing. I'd say this one is one of his finest performances ever. A real show stealer! And a particular scene with a grief stricken Loki showed every bit of it. An immediate comparison would be to Heath Ledger's Joker but we all know that ain't so.To my surprise, the gorgeous Natalie Portman, once again takes up the role of Jane Foster. Is she being a good Samaritan not leaving the role for somebody else? Or is she really rooting to play the role again? An actress of such caliber does need her own break and I suppose Jane Foster makes for a wonderful one. Christopher Eccleston plays Malekith with admirable sincerity but I felt his character was severely underwritten and towards the end he felt lesser and lesser intimidating.Kat Dennings is just plain annoying. I don't know why. Despite the few smirks that her Darcy delivered, she felt more like a character which was being dragged onto this one just coz she was there in the first one. Other notable roles include Zachary Levi's Fandral, Idris Elba's Heimdall and an old but exceptionally well-acted Odin by Anthony Hopkins. And btw I feel Jaimie Alexander would make a spectacular Diana (Wonder Woman).If you can forgive the weak story and its tendency to inject humor at odd moments, Thor The Dark World is thoroughly enjoyable and will be entertaining even for people not keeping up with the Marvel Phases. I for one, was glad that as a stand alone movie, it entertains and excels more than its predecessor.PS: Stay back for two shawarmas after the credits roll.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The plot needs improvement,"The first Thor film was good, not great, this movie however is not so much. The plot/story was mediocre, the main villain Malekith was bland, not to mention he and his minions resembled rejected Doctor Who villains, in the comics they had medieval weapons like the Asgardians did and Malekith was a magician, but in this film, they have alien weapons and mount on space ships, I don't mind changes but this shoves the limit. The best parts of the movie was graphics, they were amazing, the battle scenes were also cool and Loki was entertaining.

A Storm of Emotions,"Hello everyone, I'm Mr. C Reviewer, tonight we are discussing the Movie, Thor: The Dark World. I watched it on Disney plus. The Movie first aired October 22, 2013. It has a runtime of 1 hour 52 minutes. Thor: The Dark World was rated PG-13. The Movie was directed by Alan Taylor and created by Christopher L. Yost, Christopher Markus, Stephen McFeely, Don Payne and Robert Rodat. The movie was loosely based on the comic books by Stan Lee, Larry Lieber and Jack Kirby. The movie's antagonist was created by Walter Simonson.Summary: Thor, faces a formidable new threat to the Nine Realms. An ancient race known as the Dark Elves, seeks to plunge the universe into darkness using a powerful weapon.Review: -I appreciated the film's opening and the effective use of voice-over narration, which clarifies the storyline for viewers. I found the casting to be excellent; the actors were well-matched to their roles, and their performances felt genuine within the film's context. I believe the film skilfully balanced serious themes with humour, and I particularly appreciated the comedic moments woven throughout the action sequences, especially those featuring Thor's interactions with Earth characters like Darcy Lewis. This combination of humour effectively lightened the darker plot points while keeping the audience engaged. I appreciated how the film explores profound themes such as the sacrifices made for loved ones and the struggle against insurmountable odds in pursuit of one's beliefs. These universal concepts resonate deeply with viewers, allowing them to connect emotionally with Thor's journey as he strives to protect those he loves while confronting formidable adversaries. I found the storyline to be intricate and somewhat lacking in coherence. The film's antagonist appeared to be underdeveloped and lacked clear motivation, which made it challenging for me to fully engage with the central conflict. The film seemed to struggle with balancing its various elements, resulting in a narrative that felt somewhat fragmented. I found the gore in the movie to be visually impressive; some scenes appeared quite realistic, while others were less convincing. As an autistic individual, I was especially grateful for the inclusion of subtitles, which made it easier to follow the dialogue. I was happy that it told us what was being said when it was in another language.I admired how the film's cinematography skilfully employed a variety of shot types to enhance its storytelling. Establishing Shots effectively set the scene and provide context, highlighting the grandeur of Asgard. Close-Ups capture character emotions during crucial moments, fostering a deeper connection with the audience. Medium Shots frame conversations, balancing body language and facial expressions while keeping the surrounding environment in view. Wide Shots offer a broader perspective on action sequences, allowing viewers to appreciate both choreography and scale. Over-the-Shoulder Shots engage viewers in character dialogues, creating intimacy and situating them within the scene. Tracking Shots enhance dynamic action and emotional moments, adding fluidity and immersion. While Aerial Shots provide sweeping views of landscapes and battles, emphasizing the epic scale characteristic of superhero films. Dim lighting was used strategically to emphasize key elements within the frame. In the film, we frequently transition between various locations, and I appreciated how the movie provided on-screen text to indicate our current setting. I found the film's soundtrack and sound effects to be particularly effective, as they complemented the scenes.I appreciated the ambition and scale of the visual effects; certain sequences in the film were particularly impressive, especially during the large-scale battle scenes and the portrayal of the Nine Realms. While the design of the dark elves was visually captivating, it occasionally felt overly artificial when compared to the practical effects utilized in other parts of the film. In some instances, I believe that an overreliance on CGI detracted from emotional engagement with the characters.-I appreciated the opportunity to reconnect with familiar characters while also meeting some new ones. I did enjoy how the film delved into Thor's relationships, particularly with his brother Loki. Loki's character continues to evolve, adding depth to his motivations and actions throughout the movie. However, I felt that the character arcs could have been a bit more developed.-I appreciated the twist ending, which left us in suspense. The illustrations during the end credits were impressive, and I was delighted to discover additional scenes after the credits-two in total, cleverly interspersed among the credits.I rate each Movie I watch out of 10 and for this one, I give it an 6.7 Remember this was what I thought about the film personally and I suggest that you give it a go for yourself.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The perfect follow-up,"A lot of sequels struggle to live up to their respective predecessor, this one not at all. Thor: The Dark World beautifully expands on the world building of the first part once again combining Norse mythology and sci-fi elements. It brings back the whole support cast in meaningful way and fleshes out the main protagonists in a believable fashion.Like in the first film the complicated relationship between Thor and his brother Loki is an important theme here and its nice to watch it one last time before the writers turned both characters into complete jokes. I'm aware that a lot of people see this as one of the weaker marvel movies but for me it sits comfortably in the top five and is without a doubt the best Thor movie. The only real criticism I have is that the main antagonist stays as pale as his make up and and only exists because plot has to happen.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Entertaining sequel brings Asgard to life,"Released in 2013 and directed by Alan Taylor, ""Thor: The Dark World"" stars Chris Hemsworth in his second solo movie as the Thunder God. Natalie Portman returns as an astrophysicist and Thor's earth babe, Jane Porter, who's infected by an eerie otherworldly substance called aether. After Thor brings Jane to Asgard, war breaks out when the dark elf, Malekith (Christopher Eccleston), comes for the powerful substance.The Thor comic was unique in that the stories regularly involved three realms: the mythical Asgard and neighboring areas, uncharted expanses across the universe, and Earth. I rarely appreciated the Asgardian segments, but I often enjoyed the many creative cosmic explorations and the Earth-centered stories. Like the first movie, this sequel is amazing in that it successfully recreates Asgard and its main characters for the screen, not to mention that it actually makes them interesting (I never found Odin, Sif or the Warrior's Three interesting).The bulk of the movie takes place on Asgard and the sci-fi effects are just mind-blowing; I particularly like Malekith's spacecrafts and the Asgardian ship-crafts. Thankfully, there are some Earth sequences, including the dynamic climax in London. Bottom Line: This is a thrilling sequel; if you like the first movie you'll appreciate this one too.ADDITIONAL CAST: Anthony Hopkins appears as Odin, Tom Hiddleston as Loki, Rene Russo as Frigga, Idris Elba as Heimdall, Jaimie Alexander as Sif, Zachary Levi as Fandral, Ray Stevenson as Volstaag, Tadanobu Asano as Hogan, Kat Dennings as Darcy and Stellan Skarsgård as Eric.The movie runs 112 minutes and was shot in England and Iceland, with additional studio work done in Manhattan Beach, California.GRADE: B+",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Give this a 2nd chance!,"I was stuck between a rock and a hard place when I had the choice to skip this movie or not, but I came to my senses and just thought ""why not sit through it again?""

This movie is actually that freaking good, I was in shock.I first saw the film in cinemas back in 2013, and distinctly remember saying to myself 'eh', but looking back on that now, what was I thinking?? This movie is so much more than what the reviews are saying, it is a proper, hardcore enjoyment-fest, and I implore everybody to give this movie a watch, or, if you have already seen it, please give it another chance.Some of the writing is a bit crappy but like 90% of the film is so awesome that I could not take my eyes off the screen.

Mediocre at best.,"Altho I like the MCU pretty much, it is obviously a fact that very often Marvel movies can get pretty easily overrated, which is the case with this Thor sequel. It is nowhere as good as the first one, it is empty, blank with little to show for, very little character development, especially for the antagonist from the Dark Elves, nothing spectacular happens in full 2 hours, expect for one fight that occurs on the planet of the Dark Elves and it is short. All in all, it feels more like an episode, than a whole movie which is the problem with me. Once you have the glory, it is easy to sneak some mediocre movie from time to time based on the success of the previous entries. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A lesser entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe,"While it still mostly on par with the first THOR, this sequel feels bigger while also losing a lot of the human connection which made the previous one enjoyable. There are some fleeting moments of humor, but there's also a lot of gloom and doom. In THOR: THE DARK WORLD, Thor has to save the universe (Avengers anyone?) from Malekith and the Aether. Sure, there's some half-baked scientific explanation for all of it but the end result is a little disappointing. Malekith was a cool-looking villain, but not very engaging or charismatic. There were also a few too many narrative conveniences, a couple involving Loki's ability to impersonate other people. Nevertheless, it was entertaining and kind of what I've come to expect from Marvel. The acting is very good, as is the action and visual effects. I still don't buy Natalie Portman as a scientist, but oh well. This isn't Marvel's best, but Phase 2 is going pretty good so far.

A great movie to watch to the fans of Mega-Marvel franchise,"The Initial parts were not that interesting. But the story progressed in a very good way towards the end. The mega-franchise sequels is getting interesting with each of the movies. Hope for more superb sequels for this one as this as a cliff-hanger on the mid-credit bonus scene at the end which will keep the audience intrigued to watch the next sequel very eagerly.The first Thor movie was not that good according to me as it looked like, along with Captain America, was done in preparation for the The Avengers Assemble movie. But this movie story moves independently continuing from that movie with only references to it.On the whole a great movie to watch to the fans of Mega-Marvel franchise.

Thor I bow to ye,"He may look like the washed up star of an 80's rock group, but Thor is definitely a Superhero. Look at him... swinging his hammer around, flying through the sky, saving countless lives in the Nine Realms he protects... What a guy. His brother Loki might be a bad sort (he's already tried to destroy the world twice) but good ol' Thor will always be there to save the day. And we need him now more than ever... Because some Dark Elf is going to blow up our planet with the aid of The Biggest TV Transmitter Ever.Sadly it pains me to reveal our long-haired demi-god has problems of his own. Ya see, the love of his life, the apple of his eye, (a human FYI, our friend Thor doesn't know the meaning of the word discrimination) has been infected with a rare life-form which will KILL her. For a crisis this big, What will Thor do? What's that you say? Team up with his despised brother on a suicide mission to save the girl and the Earth? I never would have thought...So, yeah. This is exciting. It's thrilling. It also has a naked dude roaming around Stonehenge, but seeing as everything is pixellated, let's not hold that against it too much. The highlight is Loki and Thor's enforced partnership, though it doesn't last very long. Seeing these complete opposites who don't trust each other one inch attempting to fight their enemies and each other simultaneously is great fun. Can you say 'The Odd Couple'? It's got all the popcorn crackling entertainment you'd expect from a Marvel production. Roll on the next one. Until then, I'll have to make do with my handcrafted puppets... 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Thunder and darkness,"I liked the first film Thor (2011) and thought it was a good introduction to the character with the lead role being played well by Chris Hemsworth for the first time, along with Loki played excellently by actor Tom Hiddleston being a great villain, but the Dutch angles in the cinematography was a bit distracting; so for the sequel that is the second film in phase two of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I hope it is as good or better than the first. The sequel Thor: The Dark World (2013) had good performances, entertaining action, some funny moments, beneficial effects, some interesting development with the characters, side things that are pointless to the plot, and an investing enough plot that made me interested in what was happening from beginning to end; what made the film not work was the weak villain that felt like a major step down since Loki from the first film, and moments in the film that do not make sense for certain characters or random moments.I still like Chris Hemsworth as Thor and that we get to see him try to be a good protector of the nine realms, but then reuniting with Jane Foster because of a situation with the Aether and the main villain, which leads to Thor getting the help from Loki and there being an entertaining brother dynamic between them that I wanted more of; Natalie Portman is still good as Jane Foster, with her being taken over by the Aether and reuniting with Thor to get it out of her, and I did like the relationship between Thor and Jane Foster in this. Once again Tom Hiddleston is fantastic as Loki, I like that he comes along with Thor to go against the dark elves, but also because he was in a cell because of the events of the film The Avengers (2012), he gets a chance to try to redeem himself along with having a good dynamic with Thor. Lastly, the rest of the characters include Darcy Lewis played by Kat Dennings who was not an effective comic relief, along with her intern that could have been taken out of the film without anything being missed, and Stellan Skarsgård had funny moments in this returning in the role of Erik Selvig; throughout the film Erik Selvig is treated insane because of his knowledge of other worlds or wormholes, which led to some funny moments and interesting moments involving what they know and how they can use these wormholes to their advantage.The film's villain is the dark elf named Malekith played ok by Christopher Eccleston, what was disappointing about this villain was that he was too generic, because he has a straightforward plan of getting the Aether to cover the world/the nine realms in darkness, and he does this stuff without motivation except for just getting revenge on Asgard because of a war long ago; his performance was fine, but in terms of being compared to the first film's villain, he was a major step down from Loki in the first film. The film has fun or entertaining action sequences and well-done CGI effects for the locations and how Thor uses his hammer Mjolnir or Loki using magic, there was also some effective Marvel humor but also some from the side characters/comic relief that did not work; other than the villain and some of the side characters, there was not enough of the brother dynamic between Thor and Loki and the stuff involving the war between Asgard and the dark elves or the Aether was more interesting, because the occasional moments with the human characters would sometimes bog the film down with too much exposition about what is happening without having you figure it out yourself.The sequel Thor: The Dark World (2013) had good performances, entertaining action, funny moments that go back and forth between being effective or a little awkward, beneficial effects, some interesting development with the characters, side things that are pointless to the plot, and an investing enough plot that made me interested in what was happening from beginning to end; what made the film not work was the weak villain that felt like a major step down since Loki from the first film, and moments in the film that do not make sense for certain characters or random moments. This sequel is not completely terrible, because I did enjoy watching from beginning to end and Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston are great as these characters, which is why I will say if you liked the first film then you might like this follow-up; not the best addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe or to phase two, but it is not bad.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Possibly MCU's worst?,"SYNOPSIS:
Jane (Natalie Portman) has been infected with a powerful elixir that causes Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) and the Dark Elves to return to Asgard in an attempt to retrieve the elixir.REVIEW:
This film isn't terrible, but when comparing it to a lot of the other MCU films, it falls a little flat. The whole ""Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård) is crazy"" bit that they play for a lot of the film came off quite random and wasn't necessary. Then this film really made me realize that the character of Darcy (Kat Dennings) is completely pointless. Don't get me wrong, I don't think Denning is bad as Darcy and there are even a few moments that I fount quite funny with her, however, absolutely doesn't help the story in any way. As a sorta kinda mannish character that doesn't work. It's also very clear in this film that despite being in a science group, she knows absolutely nothing about science. At least make the character worth something in that realm. Aside from that, I felt that we didn't see any progressive character arc for Thor (Chris Hemsworth) We had a less funny version of himself separate from his other film and The Avengers. Honestly, I felt there was much more to Loki (Tom Hiddleston) than Thor. I found myself wanting to get to the scenes with Loki. Other than that, I think the film was serviceable. The action was decent, good amount of conflict and some entertaining moments. I didn't mind the film as much as I was dreading watching it. 6.0/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Dark, trilling and amazing movie",This is by far my favourite Thor movie. I found this more a thrilling ride. And sat on the point of my seat. This movie had a better story and more darkness than Ragnarok. Thats why Ragnarok was a little disappointing for me. Because Ragnarok should be a thrilling ride. Because in mythology it was the end of times. Like Apocalyps. And this movie has some of the best scènes in it.

"Fun, witty and exhilarating.","Thor was a big gamble for Marvel in 2011. One of the campier Avengers who was surrounded by full-blown fantasy elements, the Norse God with a big red cape and hammer wasn't even being played by a well known star. What a difference two years and a box office behemoth in the form of The Avengers makes. This sequel comes with virtually no risk and a lead actor who is now a bona fide A-lister, but it also comes with much higher hopes. Swapping Kenneth Branagh's Shakespearian influence for Alan Taylor's Game of Thrones experience, The Dark World has decreased it's regality and amped up it's grittiness, yet thankfully retains its sense of fun. There's definitely a feel of greater peril here, with no-one but Thor seemingly out of Taylor's reach for a fatal ending, however for every scene of despair or Dark Elven malevolence, there's a hilarious gag (Loki's shapeshifting and any time Stellan Skarsgard's nutty scientist is on screen are highlights) waiting around the corner. The action set-pieces don't disappoint either; the climactic battle is inventive, if not mind-blowing, and a couple of earlier melees - including an attack on Asgard - are exhilarating and keep the pace moving swiftly along. What elevates this follow up though is the pairing of Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Loki (Tom Hiddleston), who, after two previous movies to build up their brotherly baggage and perfect their repartee, are scintillating whether in the process of a daring escape or just engaging in some general chit chat. Fulfils its blockbuster quota of action spectacle whilst adding a healthy dose of spot-on humour and sharply written dialogue - what's not to like?",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Nice second...,"""Thor: The Dark World"" is an Action - Fantasy movie and the second movie of the Thor franchise, in which we watch Thor trying to stop the Dark Elves from turning the universe into darkness while he is reuniting with Jane Foster.Since I had already watched the first Thor movie I knew what to expect. The plot was interesting and overall ""Thor: The Dark World"" was a nice movie but I have to admit that I enjoyed the first Thor movie more than the second maybe because it was something new and a hero I had not watched before. The interpretations of Chris Hemsworth who played as Thor, Natalie Portman who played as Jane Foster, Stellan Skarsgård who played as Erik Selvig and Tom Hiddleston who played as Loki were very good and their combination worked very well.

Terrible is too good a word,OK so I am going to get straight to the point.This movie is one I was really looking forward to watching.The first Thor movie was one of my favorite super hero movies of all time.This was NOT. For a big budget movie with a big budget cast it left me feeling like I had wasted my time watching it.I can't single out anything in particular that was bad as the whole thing just felt like filler material. The baddies are lacking any real threat and this time round I just found that both thor and Loki did nothing worth remembering.I am not expecting much from the next Captain America either but it cant be worse than this.For me this is up there with Catwoman and both Fantastic Four movies,3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Bhor,"This is definitely the weakest of the phase 1-3 MCU flicks for me next to Captain Marvel. It starts off strong but once it gets to the second act it goes off the rails a bit, gets a bit uninteresting and dare I say boring and tries to make up for it with an action packed final act but it's just all flash no real substance to me. It just feels like a complete and utter filler film post Avengers to serve its only purpose which is to showcase one of the infinity stones surfacing. Loki is always a good time though at least. His role was as mischievous as ever and a welcome reprieve to the monotony and forgettable nature the rest of the film. It did have some cool special effects though I'll give it that much but overall it's one of the more disposable films in the MCU franchise for me to date.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I loved the Film!,"Thor: The Dark World is a 2013 American superhero film featuring the Marvel Comics character - Thor who fights to restore order across the cosmos but an ancient race led by the vengeful Malekith returns to plunge the universe back into darkness. Faced with an enemy that even Odin and Asgard cannot withstand, Thor must embark on his most perilous and personal journey yet, one that will reunite him with Jane Foster and force him to sacrifice everything to save us all. It was really a great movie, thrilling, with humor, great visuals and highly recommended to watch not just by the marvel fans but definitely must watch by all. Chris Hemsworth as Thor was hotter, smarter and much powerful this time.

Marvel keeps delivering high level characters act which make us more excited on what to expect next.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Marvel takes a full-on sci-fi/fantasy approach with 'Dark World',"Most moviegoers probably didn't realize Thor was a comic book character in the Marvel universe before his big-screen debut in 2011. Flash forward just two and a half years later and Chris Hemsworth has portrayed the Norse god of thunder three times already. ""Thor: The Dark World"" looks to continue riding the post-""Avengers"" wave, but Avengers cameos and S.H.I.E.L.D references aside, it's not what most audiences have come to know as a superhero movie.This won't matter for the target audience of ""Thor: The Dark World."" I count myself among the many who get giddy over mentions of realms, Dark Elves and powerful Aether. These, however, are the hallmarks of sci fi/fantasy. So, let the record state that ""The Dark World"" falls most definitively in that category, because if that doesn't excite you, ""The Dark World"" most likely won't.Marvel Studios hasn't misfired since ""Iron Man 2,"" which — all superhero films ever considered — wasn't that much of a misfire. Thor's second solo outing more or less measures similarly to Iron Man's. The movie just doesn't have much going for it besides its geek-tastic charms, a charismatic leading man and one of the most complex and lovable villains in Loki (Tom Hiddleston).Anything that opens with a scene explaining a battle that happened long ago in which a villain and an evil power were thought to be sealed away forever better be ""The Fellowship of the Ring,"" otherwise it belongs in a video game. Unfortunately, that's the sour note ""The Dark World"" begins on, explaining how Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) and the Dark Elves of Svartalfheim tried to use a powerful dark matter called Aether to cast the nine realms in darkness exactly 5,000 years ago, the last time all nine realms aligned. Of course, such things happen every 5,000 years, and when Thor's love, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), happens upon the Aether, Malekith awakens to take his vengeance.""Thor: The Dark World"" shares a lot of characteristics with ""Star Trek,"" jumping between realms as ""Star Trek"" does planets, introducing new species with cool spaceships and cooler weapons. Asgard comes to life with the same aesthetic that original ""Thor"" director Kenneth Branagh and the Marvel Studios creative team dreamed up a few years ago, but ""Dark World"" director Alan Taylor (""Game of Thrones"") gets to play around in it. The film is almost unapologetic in the way it splashes around in sci-fi/fantasy hallmarks, and Taylor's fight sequences are a significant improvement from the first ""Thor"" in terms of style.Taylor was also a decent pick in terms of familial tensions in fantasy. The Thor-Loki dynamic was a highlight in the first film, and given that Loki caused all the mischief in ""The Avengers,"" it's twice as interesting watching Hiddleston and Hemsworth together. Hiddleston in particular continues to step even deeper into the role in this film, though Loki is mostly relegated to a subplot except for the film's most exciting sequence, when Thor and the Warriors Three enlist his help to try and trick Malekith. The script takes full advantage of his trickster powers, but also creates an intriguing character arc for him. It's hard to say if it's the writing and Hiddleston that make Loki a huge highlight of ""The Dark World,"" or the notion of his subplot also serving as a continuation of what happened in ""The Avengers"" and a precursor to what will come in ""The Avengers: Age of Ultron."" Either way, ""The Dark World"" has significantly more of a post-""Avengers"" component than ""Iron Man 3"" did.The script also shares the same sense of humor that gave the first ""Thor"" its charm. Hemsworth is such a presence that when he gets to deliver a subtle a joke it has an ironic twist to it that works every time. The humor revolving around the human characters, however, such as Kat Dennings (who needs to not appear in these films ever again — she isn't going to be the deciding factor for teenage girls thinking of buying tickets), tends to be corny. Predictably, Portman is a wasted talent yet again as Foster is further reduced to a damsel in distress fawning over Thor despite his tendency to run off to other realms and leave her for extended periods of time.Given Marvel Studios' pedigree, it's fair to call ""Thor: The Dark World"" underwhelming. Plenty to look at, laugh at and geek out over, but a film that will ultimately be seen as a gap-filler between two epic ""Avengers"" films. That's okay for Thor, because you don't necessarily have to give grounding to a fantastical character from such a strange universe, but some effort to make the film a bit suspenseful and prove a trial for the main characters might've helped stave off our wild anticipation for May 2015.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Simply amazing!,"Thor: The Dark World is definitely one of the best superhero films I've ever seen. The cast, led by Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman, did a great job once again. Supporting actors Tom Hiddleston, Idris Elba, Kat Dennings, Jaimie Alexander, Anthony Hopkins, and so many more really are amazing. I've heard a lot of complaints about the pace being too quick and difficult to keep up with. My response? Don't take stupid people to see the movie. I honestly don't see how anyone would have trouble keeping up with the pace of the film. I thought the plot development was actually one of the stronger parts of the film. Another strong element was the humor. Like the first installment, there was a lot of situational humor. However, this movie took it to an entirely new level and didn't feel forced and out of place. Most of this is thanks to the aforementioned Kat Dennings and her unique comedic flair. Also, watch for the Captain America cameo for maybe the most humorous scene in the film. The action sequences were up to par with the rest of the movies, meaning they were epic. Natalie Portman is as breathtaking as ever and the rest of the supporting cast adds a combination of depth and humor. The only negative in the movie, and I'm really not sure if it's a fair one, is that I wanted more Lady Sif. I'm sorry but you have one of the most beautiful women in the world, who happens to be a fantastic actress, playing one of the most badass and intriguing roles in the movie and she's barely even relevant? You've gotta do better than that. Supposedly she originally had a more prominent role even creating somewhat of a love triangle but the studio ultimately decided to trim that back, essentially eliminating a large chunk of her screen time. After some thought I decided it didn't really ""hurt"" the film so I won't let it affect the rating but I would've liked liked to see her more. Hopefully we'll get that in the special features when it releases on blu-ray. Overall, I'd say this is probably the third best Avengers film yet, behind Iron Man and The Avengers. Hopefully they continue to deliver because they've got one helluva series going.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Entertaining, but not without flaws","The opening scenes of Thor:TDW were promising and left me and my sister very excited! However as soon as those were over the movie started rather slowly and took too long to get on track. I felt like quite some time was wasted on comic relief and attempting to explain unnecessary things, instead of character development and the much needed spotlight on the motivation behind certain characters. This made the movie a little bit boring in some scenes and prevented before mentioned characters from truly flourishing, which is a pity. Thankfully the pacing went up a notch after the first act. The movie ended the best way possible and left me hyped for the upcoming MCU movies.I liked the villains. However, where the main villain was quite menacing in some scenes, I do think he was equally unimpressive in other scenes. Chris Hemsworth as Thor was good, although I wished the screenwriters had given him better lines and the director would push him to show more emotion in some scenes. As much as I like Chris, I do think his performance in Rush was better than here. I also wished that Thor's inner struggles were fleshed out a bit more. Tom Hiddleston as Loki was flawless, and without a doubt Loki stole the show in every scene he was in. Loki got nice character development in this movie, and when I look at his journey from Thor to the Avengers to this movie, I think the directors and Hiddleston did a great job with the character.Overall I liked this movie, so my rating would be 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

There is more action, larger stakes, lots of fantasy and plenty of battles. TV director Alan Taylor, best known for his work on Game of Thrones shows great confidence with transition to film. The action is bigger and a improvement upon the first film, getting massive battles and fights and more regular. Audiences can easily geek out as it blends medieval weaponry, magic and laser battles.Thor: The Dark World goes the whole hog with its blend of sci-fi and fantasy, from a Lord of the Rings style opening, the gravity anomaly in London looking like something from a Doctor Who episode and the use of spaceships. It is a film that is completely unashamed about its comic book origins and 10-year-old boys and the 10-year-old inside all of us will love it.The events on Earth and Asgard are juxtaposed by two different styles. The action in Asgard is treated seriously with the full embraced of the fantasy, whilst the Earth scenes are much more light hearted. Kat Dennings continues to be the comic relief and this time she has comedy with her own intern played by Jonathan Howard and Stellan Skarsgård's Dr Selvig is relegated to running around Stonehenge naked and being locked into mental hospital.Taylor does put his stamp all over Thor: The Dark World, making a visually darker film by using dark cinematography and the art direction for Asgard is clearly influenced by Game of Thrones. Asgard has more of grounded medieval look in Thor: The Dark World then the grand look of Kenneth Branagh's film.Thor: The Dark World is a strong continuation of the Thor series and this is illustrated with the relationship between Thor and Loki. The characters have learned from each other and their experience and the relationship has evolved into one of banter between the brothers. Loki continues to be the most interesting villain in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and shows growth with his tragedy and pain.Former Doctor Who star Christopher Eccleston took on the villain and he does the job well, giving a professional performance as Malekith, He may not have the depth of Loki and his motivations are stock, but he does a great job. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje and his large stature as Kurse gave Thor a big physical challenge that he needed and leads to a massive fight.Thor: The Dark World is far from deep or meaningful, but it's a fun ride and an entertaining fantasy adventure that raises improves on the action level and strong follow-up to the series.Please visit www.entertainmentfuse.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Great comic book adaption,"Thor: The Dark World is a great superhero movie which combines elements from fantasy and scifi movies. There is enough surprise moment and humor to keep it ongoing and sustainable. Movie lends shameless elements from Star Wars and Lord of The Rings movies and combines them together to an original adventure. Movie looks and sounds beautiful. Bouncing between different dimensions could easily be confusing but director Alan Taylor keeps them tightly together. Even the length of the movie is suitable, less than two hours, which is great remittance despite all the action and scenery. That ensures that you won't get bored and movie rumbles through it's duration like fast train. Balance between humor and drama is great in spite of some murky moments. It is good to see that Marvel takes good care it's movies and combines finely different productions. That ensures nice comic feeling in their movies. Unquestionably Thor: The Dark world is Marvel's elite in these comic book adaptions. The end of the movie promises more sequels for this sledge hammer hero. I just hope they have more courage to bring elements from Asgard mythology in upcoming sequels. That would make this even more enjoyable movie experience. Hemsworth is good choice as Thor but Natalie Portman's role leaves a little bit too easy. Great entertainment no matter what.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Weak Point in the Marvel Cinematic Universe,"When Thor's love interest gets cursed with a powerful object, Thor must protect her before an army and its ruthless leader try to get their hands on it to take over the remains of Earth.The strong points of this film are the continuing development of Loki as a villain (and perhaps a hero), Stellan Skarsgard, and Kat Dennings. The weak points are the over use of CGI, the use of Natalie Portman and the general way that Thor does not seem to fit in with the rest of the Marvel universe (even with the vague connection to ""Guardians of the Galaxy"").Not that this was a bad film, but it was probably the weakest in the series thus far, and there should be no surprise if we never see a ""Thor III"".",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Marvel Did It Again!,"I always go to every Marvel midnight premiere and I was really excited since Iron Man 3 was a bit disappointing. I was never a big fan of Thor when I saw the first movie but what really made me a fan was when i saw The Avengers. I was still a bit skeptical but after the first 30 min i was hooked. It was a rollarcoaster of action, drama, and a few laughs. It was so much fun watching this movie even though i just watched in 2D but i will definitely go see it again in Imax 3D. Loki is my favorite villain in the Marvel world I love him! Every scene with Loki was wonderful! Man hes a sick bastard but i love it.

not better than Thor #1,"the movie was OK and i wish i did not pay $13:50 to see it but i needed to kill time and since i liked Thor since it aired back in the 70's at 3pm weekdays after school along with iron man, the hulk, and spider man. but i was let down i don't understand who gave this over 7 it is a 6.5 maybe 6.7 at best. i guess i just expect more from a superhero movie especially after seeing the dark knight, iron man, man of steel, etc. i would wait for it to come out on DVD, and i wouldn't spend the extra cash for blue-ray. but don't get me wrong its not bad, but it's also not good enough, and the extra endings after the credits is getting real tired, real quick. i guess it'll piece itself altogether one the infinity gauntlet is together and probably a nice set up for avengers 2.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Not quite as compelling nor emotionally engaging as its predecessor, this post-Avengers sequel still packs plenty of jaw-dropping action and some well-placed humour","Like 'Iron Man 3', 'Thor: The Dark World' finds us reunited with the hammer-wielding Norse demigod in a post-Avengers world, where - for the benefit of those who may not remember - Loki was last seen returned to his home planet of Asgard in manacles after wrecking half of New York following a megalomaniac plot to take over Earth. And so, picking up right after the events of that movie, one of the very early scenes has Loki meeting his stepfather and King, Odin (Anthony Hopkins), expressing absolutely no remorse for his actions before being committed to a glass- walled whited-out cell in the dungeon.It's a huge pity we say, keeping Loki locked up for pretty much the first hour of the movie; indeed, the best moments of 'Thor: The Dark World' are when Thor and his vengeful adopted brother Loki share the same screen, forging a shaky alliance to take down a common enemy that has united them (surprisingly) in grief. Thanks to their combined charisma, this sequel defies the second-act doldrums of most movies, truly coming to life at the halfway mark - beginning with Thor's treacherous plan to spring Loki out of prison (with the help of his pals of course) and continuing on to the black dunes of Svartalfheim where the squabbling siblings confront their foe.Yet, not to get ahead of ourselves, there is of course a fair bit of scene-setting that needed to have taken place in order for our favourite hero and anti-hero to be brought together under those circumstances. Working from a story from Don Payne and Robert Rodat, screenwriters Christopher L. Yost, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely spin a Tolkiensque plot where the leader of an antagonistic alien race, Malekith (Christopher Eccleston), returns to plot the destruction of the Nine Realms using an all-powerful source of dark matter known as the Aether.Long story short, a once-in-5000-years cosmic occurrence is about to converge the realms across time and space, which inadvertently causes Thor's Earthly love interest Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) to fall into a different realm when investigating the phenomenon and be infected with the Aether. Malekith wants her, so Thor jumps to her rescue to bring her back to Asgard - though the price of his half-valiant and half-selfish (after all, he does want to be close to her) act is laid bare when Malekith arrives at the kingdom and launches a deadly assault on Odin's palace.Switching back and forth between Asgard and Earth, the trio of Yost, Markus and McFeely clearly struggle to find a consistent tone especially at the start. While the threat facing Asgard is treated with the utmost seriousness and solemnity, the proceedings back on Earth unfold with strained humour - whether the awkwardness between Jane's understudy Darcy (Kat Dennings) and her new intern Ian (Jonathan Howard), or even the odd behaviour of Jane's old mentor, Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard), who goes butt naked in public at the Stonehenge. Between the two, we are much better off at Asgard, where veteran 'Game of Thrones' director Alan Taylor is on more familiar territory.It is also at Asgard that Taylor will stage the film's first stunning setpiece, which culminates in the turning point that sees Thor and Loki form that unlikely partnership. Malekith's assault on Asgard is staged with impressive clarity, starting from their stealth crossing at the Bi- frost bridge to their aerial attack of Asgard's defences to their storming of Odin's palace. There is little doubt Taylor's experience on the HBO series has placed him in good stead here, and more than previous director Kenneth Branagh, he demonstrates a boldness and imagination to stage the action on a much larger canvas.That is also a nice segue into the reunion of Thor and Loki, which proves rewarding not just in the witty energetic banter that follows but also in yet another wowing setpiece that has the pair teaming up to outsmart Malekith. There is also crackling tension between them, especially since one knows better from the events of 'Thor' and 'The Avengers' than to trust the scheming Loki to have abandoned his insatiable thirst for power and position. Unfortunately, Loki doesn't quite have a place in the nonetheless outstandingly conceived finale set in Greenwich, London; that said, what adrenaline Loki's return brings to the film is still very much intact by the final showdown rolls around.Kudos to Taylor for putting up not just a thrilling, but also an extremely fun exercise in physical displacement at the climax, as Thor pursues Malekith across multiple dimensions in the midst of the convergence. Rather than just visual spectacle, there is good tongue-in- cheek fun to be had as the characters appear and disappear from one realm to another without forewarning - and we especially like that one which ends up with Thor taking the Tube three stations from Charing Cross to Greenwich. Unlike Christopher Nolan's superhero screen incarnations 'The Dark Knight' and even 'Man of Steel', Marvel has never failed to find humour in the midst of spectacle, and this enormously entertaining finale is a great example of that.And yet compared to Branagh's origin story, there is still something lacking in this sequel. For one, the narrative isn't quite as compelling this time round - especially as Malekith proves quite the underwhelming villain. For another, it lacks the humanity that made its predecessor something more - and by this we mean not just the bond between Thor and Loki, but also that between Thor and Jane. Still, you cannot fault the assuredness of the performances by Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston, nor for that matter the action, otherworldly grandiosity and occasionally well-placed humour that makes it an overall crowdpleaser - if anything, it proves the Marvel juggernaut continues to be very much in shape, no less evident from a mid-credit and a post-credit scene that will have its fans in rapture.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
It Has its Moments but Fails to Rise Above Mediocrity,"What can I say? Yet another mediocre output from Marvel, sure it's not bad, in fact, it's completely watchable but is that all we demand from blockbusters anymore?Though, that is not to say Thor 2 is without its merits. It's greatest achievement is perhaps it's absolutely flawless production design. I'll congratulate the fellow who could find a single fault within the sets, costumes, make-up and/or CGI and even directing and acting. Moreover there are more than a handful of Grade A action/comedy sequences that truly transcend the film and may I say, are completely kickass.But there are some major things wrong with the film and with a production this flawless, the blame can only fall on one spot... The writing.As a screenwriter myself I got a lot to complain about here, I'll try to keep it short but get ready for a roast...Character development is lacking with no real motivation for the Dark Elves actions and no significant growth in Thor or other characters by the end of the film.The pacing is uneven and sporadic, with way too many breaks for exposition. Which brings me to..Too many things set up and not enough payoffs, ex: whatever happened to the Asian guy in the beginning? I would have loved to see that tie together to something at the end.And lastly, there is a lack of momentum and sense of scale to the story. Instead of a slow build to a giant payoff the movie sort of meanders and wanders. Worst of all , even though apparently the entire universe is on the line it never feels that way. I mean what the hell?! the Dark Elf invasion of earth is like one ship and a few dozen soldiers..End roast.Long story short, Thor 2 is a beautiful film to look at but overall suffers from a script that doesn't do justice to the material. Though, despite the scripts numerous shortcomings it has just enough moments of brilliance to keep you watching all the way through. If you keep your expectations low you'll have a decent time with the movie, just don't expect much.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
... but it sure is entertaining!,"Those words were uttered quite often by myself (also to myself) as I walked home from the theatres after watching Thor: The Dark World. The story makes little to no sense and incorporates all the tropes one would expect: the monster of the week (Dark Elves this time around, the Frost Giants seem to be a distant memory), some enemies become friends and Chris Hemsworth takes of his shirt.However, even though I've never been a fan of 'accepting something for what it is', that is exactly what this movie forces you to do. It doesn't attempt to make any sense, nor does it even slightly attempt to take itself seriously. I think the last time I laughed out loud so much during a movie was watching Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and that says a lot.This movie truly is a stellar example of an action comedy, but could benefit greatly from a slightly more coherent plot. All in all though - well worth the watch.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
2013's best superhero franchise,"I have no expectation before watching this movie after a disappointment that 'Iron Man 3' had marked months ago. Unpredictably 'The Dark World' is above what I think it would be. 'Marvel: The Avengers' franchise has never been this much fun since first 'Iron Man'. Alan Taylor as director dares to take risks in storyline and makes it out from comfort zone. Some action scenes are entertaining and sometimes hilarious, especially when Loki involved. Thor character is shown much more development than the previous movie. In 'The Dark World', Thor is described more grown up and more responsible to save Asgard and Earth from villain's threat. Also the studio has succeeded to exploit Thor's power in this movie that doesn't happen in first franchise or in 'The Avengers'. The presence of Malekith has succeeded enough to give good impression as villain. Perhaps there's quite disorganized in plot and some jokes aren't in the right place. Overall, 'Thor: The Dark World' is one of the most memorable superhero movie this year, also great one from 'The Avengers' franchise. The IMAX 3D is worth to watch though.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Nearly Perfect!,"I heard a lot of good things before the movie came out, and it did not leave me with regret. Definitely a must watch film. A few things that I felt failed its justice I'm not sure could have been made better without making it a Lord of the Rings film. Firstly, I'm not sure the Dark Elves had enough screen time. They were awesome, and I think they chose some good actors for the part. I just feel they could have used their skills more. Secondly, they could have spent more time on the story about their past. It was good but they could have really highlighted this scenario to expand their fan base and create a cult of nerds. Again not sure if they could have been fixed, but as fiction fan who appreciates lore I have to express that. Lastly, not a big fan of the comedy, but I'm not a fun guy. Everyone else had a good time in the theaters.The acting was pretty good and I believe you felt the drama and emotion between Thor's family. To me that was the highlight of the movie. The custom, props and effects were great. That much said, I believe this movie makes you want to know more about the Marvel Universe and the scene after the credits leaves you handing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Quite the disappointment,"Thor the Dark World was quite the disappointment. Sure, it was fun to watch, but that was all, and the clichés were quite annoying. Frigga's death was perhaps the most glaring of them. And she dies for the only reason (if you can call that a reason) that they need Odin to loose control and prepare to go after Malekith like an enraged bull (which he never seems to get around to do, leaving everything to Thor once he and Loki get to leave Asgard. Also, Asgard's defenses and army were pathetic. Being caught unawares makes no sense, as Bor was supposed to know that Malekith was alive, and thus so should Odin. And even caught at unawares would not provide for such a ridiculously easy victory by the Dark Elves over Asgardian forces and such a horribly silly idea that Frigga could take care of herself (I mean, seriously, what is the good of having an army in the palace if they can't even guard the queen?). And all that so Thor could be shown as the only one that could fight the Dark Elves. And Odin only gets to kill one with Gungnir!! Of course the cliffhanger at the end was just silly. I believe we are to assume that Loki was disguised as the guard that came to announce the arrival of his ""corpse"" to Odin (considering the sidelong look the guard gave Odin), and thus managed to overpower him somehow (which should be very difficult indeed, but, hey, the movie is way less coherent than the comics, so...). Another thing that annoys me (that was somewhat present in the first movie, but not to this extent) is Odin's and Thor's insistence that Asgardians are not gods. They are! They are the Norse gods. Seriously, I can only think they were afraid of offending the sensibilities of Christians watching the movie, but, come one! Odin is called the All- Father because the is supposed to have created the Nine Worlds. And so on and so forth. Just boring. Ah, by the way, if Asgardians are mortal and not gods at all, why does Odin refer to Jane as ""mortal""? He should have used a term like ""short-lived"" or something like that. Of course the magical day-saving device Erik and Jane put together is not a problem: Marvel does that all the time, like when Dr. Doom manages to create a device that steals the powers of the Beyonder, a being so powerful and alien he should be beyond the understanding of any human without centuries of studies and scientific progress. But Doom, like Reed Richards, is supposed to be a genius, which apparently means, in comic book parlance, he is wiser, more knowledgeable and more intelligent than anyone (except Reed Richards, of course. :) As a final comment, no, the film did not have the promised wider scope: the 9 reals are barely shown, Hogun's village is just as bad as any cheap Conan-like under financed TV production, Svartalfheim is just a desert filmed through darkened lenses, we just get to see enough of Asgard to, as I said, see how badly organized they are, and then we come back to Earth... again! My perfect Thor film would be if they compressed the old Colonizers of Rigel Saga into a movie. No saving the Universe (which is also a boring cliché, like, Thor will only show up on the big screen when he is saving the world), but just fighting an alien race waaaay away from Earth.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Fun little mess of a movie,"Yes, Loki is fun to watch on screen. Yes, I like Kat Dennings character. Yes, there are some funny lines/scenes.

No, I don't understand what they hope to achieve with the thing they are trying to acquire. No, I don't understand the 'weapon' and what it does (other than, 'bad stuff'). No, I don't really care about the good characters. No, the climactic battle didn't make much logical sense at all. I suppose if you've been collecting Thor comics forever, then all of it would make sense and you would already care about the characters.

How to ruin a weekend ? answer is Thor: The Dark world,"Thor: the dark world drags you in to complete darkness, you will find not a single reason why the makers have made this film, no matter how much you juggle your Head. The story starts with history lessons about Thor's grandfather. You will never see him again for a single second in the whole movie. And the point was to create an enemy who is enormously strong but hiding out for centuries, another senseless thing. Well Loki is in prison and became a ""Family Guy""!! Is it possible ? Natalie Portman is in danger and she is not safe even in Asgard. Thor's entire contribution was to save the girlfriend and leave the people on their own. Things are happening on earth too, Erik Selvig runs without cloths not wears his pants, I don't know what was the reason behind that. Chis Hemsworth has done a terrible job, Tom Hiddelston over shadowed everyone else through his spectacular performance. Idris Elba and Anthony Hopkins are as good as they are. Action sequences has nothing new and quite boring at some places. Vfx and special effects are too heavy for this plot. Background sound is terrible and film's biggest drawback.You can watch Thor 2 only under one condition, You are a die hard fan of LOKI.

Nees A lot More Energy,"Thor: The Dark World (2013)** (out of 4)Thor (Chris Hemsworth) must team up once again with Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) as the two must battle something that could destroy Asgard. I'm really not going to waste any time going over a ""plot"" because there really isn't much of one. I'm sure die-hard fans of Marvel are going to love this film but to me it was just very pretty looking but rather hollow. I was surprised at how effective the first film was and looking back on it, it's clear that director Kenneth Branagh had a lot to do with that. The first film had a very strong story, great characters, good performances and an energy that not many action films have. This one here is pretty much missing all of that stuff and instead we're just given routine action scenes that are quite loud coming from the speakers but they contain very little else. You know you're in trouble whenever an action picture has non-stop action and yet you continue to yawn. The entire movie just seemed so flat from an energy standpoint and to me it was clear that director Alan Taylor just wasn't able to pump up any emotion. The action scenes are incredibly flat and even the better than average CGI effects couldn't make up for it. Even worse is that the characters are all rather one-note with no real surprises to be found. There's no question that Hemsworth is perfect for Thor and he manages to turn in another good performance. Portman seems rather bored or just doing the film due to a contract forcing her. Even Anthony Hopkins and Rene Russo appear bored this time out. Tom Hiddleston does a very good job in the role of Loki and he's without question the best thing in the picture. Kat Dennings offers up the only amount of energy in the film. Thankfully, unlike many other Marvel movies, this one here keeps its running time rather short and for that I'm very thankful.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

MARVELously entertaining.,"Watching Thor: The Dark World tonight, I got the feeling that Hollywood might have finally gotten the hang of it. In theory, a sequel should always surpass its predecessor, although as we all know, many have tried and famously failed. But a new trend seems to finally be breaking through. X2 was better than X-Men. Spider-Man 2 was better than the first. And now that I've seen it, I can tell you Thor: The Dark World is better than Thor. (And the fact that these are all Marvel productions, that's food for anther discussion.)I thoroughly enjoyed Thor, directed by Kenneth Branagh, when I only saw it for the first time just this spring. In fact, I watched it again the same week. Which is saying enough to imply that my hopes were high for the sequel. So I was really looking forward to tonight and I was not disappointed.Thor 2 was helmed by a different director, Alan Taylor, which typically always spells trouble in my book when they change the director, but I take my hat off to him. What I admire is that he managed to capture the tone that Branagh set in the first film flawlessly – even perfected it in a way. He brings to the table a duality which almost never works successfully in any film, but here, does so perfectly: Taylor made Thor 2 notably darker, yet at the same time more humorous. I take my hat off to the writers as well – they put in a ton of great jokes, all at the exactly right moment. Had this been done even a fraction less tactfully, the film would have sunk like a bag of bricks, like so many others have. I found myself (and the audience) laughing my butt off one moment, and feeling very serious and engaged with the on-screen emotions the next. Even when it happened abruptly, it still never felt inappropriate. Now that's good entertainment. Two thumbs up.The actors all wear their roles like a custom- made suit. It's obvious that Chris Hemsworth has really grown into his character, third time around. This guy IS Thor, hands down. The same goes for all the other actors, they were all perfectly comfortable in their roles and respective environments. The one that intrigued me most, however, was Loki – personified absolutely magnificently by Tom Hiddleston. Much like Hemsworth, it seems he was born to play this role. He captures all the slyness, all the arrogance and all the torment of a man almost unable to bear the weight of his own ego in a single flicker in his eyes. And then that grin Perfection. The way Hiddleston plays Loki is strangely captivating. You know he's totally wicked and cannot be trusted, yet at the same time you can't help but really like him – you might even end up rooting for this guy, and I'm not sure many other actors would have managed this.All the special effects were as good as one should expect them to be these days. I have nothing much to say there, except that it was all terrifically eye-pleasing, and Asgard looked even more beautiful than before. It was all convincing and very well done.Still, I have not completely explained why T:TDW is better than the first. Actually, I might not fully be able to. It's mostly a feeling. As much as I was entertained the first time, I was even more entertained now. It was more action-packed, more exciting, darker and it just had a great deal more adrenaline.The only thing that I think was weaker in this film, was the character of Jane Foster. Her character was just less interesting, kind of blank. I actually don't remember much of her at all, except that she slapped Thor a couple of times and she had all this creepy stuff coming out of her Also she was somewhat of a damsel-in- distress most of the time with the look of a scared kitten on her face, and that's not exactly how we like to see our ladies nowadays. It's so common to see women being perfectly independent now, that it's a little weird to see a grown woman with ""three degrees in physics"" (as Darcy so poignantly points out) scared and shivering like a little girl. Most of the time, Natalie Portman just didn't carry her scenes very strongly, and that's strange coming from such a fine actress. So maybe one of the actors was actually a little out of place after all, thinking about it.Having said that, that's pretty much my only complaint. Every other element in this film was very solid, the story was very good and they absolutely nailed the pacing. Those two hours went by in the blink of a eye.Thor: The Dark World is wonderfully entertaining and a definite must-see for every Marvel fan. In fact – at the risk of enraging the Marvel Gods – this might just be pretty stiff competition to X-Men Watch out Wolverine, I think I have a new favorite superhero.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Vidiot Reviews,"Thor: The Dark WorldThe upside to being the God of Thunder is that you have a solid excuse every time you fart.Thankfully, the fair-haired deity in this action movie isn't passing gas.When a cosmic event creates porticos between realms, Thor's (Chris Hemsworth) girlfriend Jane (Natalie Portman) travels through one portal and ends up being contaminated by an ancient weapon.Jane's contagion awakenings a Dark Elf (Christopher Eccleston) who wants to use her ailment to bring about the elves evil empire.To prevent this, Thor must collaborate with his greatest enemy - his incarcerated half- brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston).And it's solely that brotherly interplay that makes this sequel acceptable.While all the exciting elements of the original are present, Dark World lacks a villain with enough oomph to save a simplistic script that fails to venture beyond its comic book derivation.Incidentally, the Mighty Thor is the ideal Halloween costume for Jesus.Yellow Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Asgard is in danger and all of life hangs in the balance as Thor must find a way to defeat the monster.

Plenty of Action and Humor Throughout,"Before the reign of ""Odin"" (Anthony Hopkins) the Dark Elves were led by a malicious being known as ""Malekith"" (Christopher Eccleston) who craved an extremely powerful energy source known as the ""Aether"". In his attempt to get it (in order to destroy the universe) war broke out between the Dark Elves and Aasgard which ended up in the Dark Elves being annihilated and the Aether buried forever. Or so everybody thought. As it so happens Malekith managed to escape and due to a rare convergence of the realms the Aether has become uncovered. And Malekith wants it badly. The only problem is that ""Jane Foster"" (Natalie Portman) has not only discovered it but it has also infected her very soul. Recognizing Jane's serious plight Thor takes her to Aasgard for medical care. So in order for Malekith to acquire the Aether he now has to battle all of Aasgard in the process. Anyway, rather than detail the entire story and risk spoiling the picture for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this was a very good movie which had plenty of action and humor throughout. In all honesty though I thought there were some parts which seemed to drag a bit while other parts went overboard with the graphic action.

A sorely used Thor in a boring story,"#MCUrewatch. Thor 2 opens with a Lord of the Rings style sequence with a lot, and I really mean a lot, of incomprehensible mumbo jumbo that I couldn't care for at all. Hopkins delivers his silly lines as if Shakespeare himself wrote them...which is kinda funny. Several actors are once again underused (Russo, Elba), the villain is even more one dimensional than all the previous MCU villains. The story...ah well I just did not care one iota. Hiddleston is good, as always, but not as effective as in Avengers. Hemsworth as Thor is at his most entertaining when he is playing the slightly stupid hero on Earth. You do get to see some of this in his interaction with Natalie Portman during the third act on Earth. But it wouldn't be until Thor 3 before they would really nail the way they should use this character. All in all Thor The Dark World is rightfully seen as one of the weakest MCU films.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
It is the worst movie of MCU.,"THOR: THE DARK WORLD begins on the eve of the Convergence, when the Nine Realms are about to align, enemies from the past return to haunt and imperil the citizens of Asgard and everyone else. Thor (Chris Hemsworth), who has been away from astrophysicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) for two years, dealing with instability across the Nine Realms, returns to Asgard. Then Jane chances upon an anomaly that brings back the Aether, a mysterious force that once threatened Asgard and has awakened its long-time enemies, the Dark Elves, who are out for blood. Meanwhile, Loki (Tom Hiddleston), is languishing in prison, awaiting his next chance at glory.""Thor: The Dark World"" is MCU's worst movie ever. The character of the movie is not defined. Looks like you know this character but don't understand character traits. The movie was not strong enough like THOR's first movie. CGI and VFX were good.

Thor? More like Bore,"The Marvel factory rolls on, and the next widget down the assembly line is 'Thor: The Dark World'. Devoid of much of the wit, heart and character development that made the first 'Thor' a surprisingly solid stand-alone film, 'The Dark World' tries to skate along on its breathtaking visuals and the good will created by 'The Avengers'. It doesn't succeed. From its info-dump opening to its dull, drawn out finale, I never gave two Sifs about anything or anyone in this film.After this past Summer's dreadfully dull and lifeless 'Iron Man 3', Marvel's post-'Avengers' slate is now a big 0-2.

"Not Bad, Not Great.","After seeing Thor: The Dark World, I'm puzzled as to how it's scored 8.0 on IMDb, when the far superior prequel gained only a 7.0? What's noticeably missing is Kenneth Branagh's Shakespearean touch, the whole grandiose spectacle of it all. Everything which made Thor charming is missing from this and even cast changes (Zachary Levi as a replacement for Josh Dallas and surprisingly, quite a forgettable Fandral, seeing as he was the original choice.) Poor Ray Stevenson doesn't have much to do, and Jaimie Alexander casts a bitchy stare at Jane Foster, but nothing else ever comes out of it.Whereas in the first movie, we all gawped at Chris Hemsworth's magnificent physique, we now get a Loaded Weapon 1 moment, where I half expected to see one of those ""unmotivated butt-in-the-moonbeam walks."" Chris Eccleston isn't used to full villainy advantage as Malekith and wasn't really sure what his true motives were (nor did I actually care.) The first half is OK, while the second is more entertaining, if very far-fetched. Alan Taylor may have directed outstanding episodes for Game of Thrones, but here, he's delivered an uneven package with lacklustre action and forced, hammy dialogue for actors who deserve better. That said, Tom Hiddleston does have fun and seems to be the only one. Kat Dennings routine as Darcy should be getting stale by now, but does provide some comedic highlights.If Marvel wants to rival the greatest film franchise in history (James Bond of course) it had better pull its socks up. Sure, 007 has had its misses but it also knew how to reboot itself and stay fresh. I'm not convinced neither Stan Lee or Kevin Fiege have a game plan and this could be their downfall. This was a kiddies outing, but when you look at the richness of The Avengers and Joss Whedon's literary prowess, they need that kind of impetus to stay afloat.I'm now convinced that Captain America: The Winter Soldier, will be my most anticipated superhero sequel (as it's a surefire bet that Singer will mess up Days of Future Past and turn it into Wolverine 6.)More fun than kickass (with a great cameo in the middle) this gets 7/10.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Good film - i liked it,"I'm not a big MCU fan unfortunately.But I like Thor. The film has many great qualities. The effects are amazing.The effects in the first film were already great, but this film ups the ante. The effects are twice or even three times better than the first film, as is the world building. This film showcases more of the nine realms, and also fleshes out Asghard better than the last film did.The film spends more time in Asghard and in the Dark Elves' home world than on Earth which I was okay with. I did not dislike the time spent on Earth like many people did, but I just found the scenes on Asghard and the Ice Realm to be more interesting and fun. Lastly the action scenes are greatly entertaining, especially the Loki prison break scene. The action is another thing that is upped in this film. I also love the design of the Dark Elves. I also like the technology employed by both the Dark Elves and Asghard. This film does a better job at showcasing the technology and mythology of these different realms.However, where this film excelled in action and effects, it unfortunately drops the ball when it comes to character. There is really no character development in this show. Thor is now a wise leader that puts other first. Other than having to defeat the bad guy there is no conflict he has to deal with, and he does not change or grow. Granted, I would rather have a character remain static than regress and forget the lessons they learn from the previous film like in the Iron Man sequels. However, I would like some form of development for the characters, especially the main ones, but we really do not get that.Thor, as well as the other main characters are still likable and they never irritated me, but I felt that their characters never went anywhere.Solid 6+",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Still rocking' the God of Thunder thing....,"A fun fun movie from the first frame to the last (and by ""last I also mean the after the after credits scene...so don't walk out until the credits are all done).Even tho the story is your typical superhero fair, (bad guy wants to destroy the universe, good guy fights to stop him) it isn't typically told.There is a abundance of superhero action to be had, but also some really tight emotional moments as well,as characters grow, die, morn, go a bit nuts, and laugh together (and we with them).Christopher Eccleston and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje are virtually unrecognizable under their make up as the chief villain, Malekith and his henchman Kurse, but that doesn't stop them from oozing malice every time they are on screen.Chris Helmsworth is still rocking' the God of Thunder thing exceptionally well as does the rest of the returning cast in their respective roles (with some stellar work from Hopkins as Odin)....all except Natalie Portman. She is the one and only drawback to TtDW. Without going in to too much detail here, she was contractually forced to return for the sequel, and it shows in her phoned in performance.But the shining moment of the whole film for me was, of course Hiddles, who returns to his third go 'round as Loki with great scene-chewing aplomb.Every time Hiddles' Loki hits the screen we can see something working behind his eyes. Plot, scheme, love, or hate..we're really not sure....but you can't take your eyes off him.Loki's not the villain here..nor is he the hero...he is a live wire, or loose cannon, if you will, we never know what he'll do or say next, all we know is he's having more fun than a Norse god should be allowed to.But underneath all the bravado and anger Loki exudes, thanks to Hiddles layered performance, we are treated to moments when Loki's conflicted (after the death of someone he supposedly hates) and that he also has a protective side (puts his body between destruction and a mortal) for those he ""likes"".Loki will never be a hero like his ""big brother"", but TtDW shows he has the potential, if not the desire.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Technically superb Thor sequel that is missing a heart...,"1st watched 12/4/2013 – 5 out of 10(Dir-Alan Taylor): Technically superb Thor sequel that is missing a heart or a reason to care. Visually this movie has a lot to offer, but about halfway thru a realization comes that the fluff isn't enough to sustain a seasoned movie-goer. I had a similar reaction to the Harrison Ford epic ""Blade Runner"" and other movies that have a lot of style, but very little heart. The story revolves around a matter hidden deep beneath the Earth called ""Ether"" that can change compositions quickly and is sought after by an evil elf-like creature from a world before there was light, Aka. The Dark World. He believes this Ether has the power to bring back his world. Natalie Portman, plays Jane Foster, a companion of Thor and a scientist – who comes upon this substance during an investigation and it possesses her. The evil creature is then after her and Thor(played by Chris Hemsworth), and he, of course, wants to protect her. The settings in the movie consist of Asgard – ruled by Thor's father Odin(played by Anthony Hopkins), London, and the dark elves' world.the movie jumps back and forth between these worlds partially because of a weird warp found during the investigation that transfers items across these worldsbut Thor seems to be able to go in and out no matter what. There is plenty of action to be had, decent acting, and a little humor but other than the expected battle between good vs. evil there is no real reason or emotion to stay with the movie to the very end. The movie should probably win some visual effects awards, but I'm looking for a complete experience and in my opinion – this isn't one. It is a good try but not quite good enough for my approval.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

All action no substance,I think my one major issue with Thor is that he is so vapid. I'm also not entirely sure that a second movie was required to tell a nonexistent story. If Thor had something to say or even more substance then I could see the benefit in this movie. The whole thing is filled with arrogant one-liners and pointless statements. There are some brilliant action sequences but overall it's lacking in emotion. Even the actors seem a little lacklustre and not fully committed to their roles. It should be better as there is so much talent in this cast but a bad script will always hurt a movie.I know I'm going to cope flack for this but Thor is certainly the worst marvel superhero that has been turned into a movie. He's one-dimensional and barely deserves his hero title. Watch it if you enjoy an action movie with no storyline cause that is exactly what you'll get.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
About as flat as a lazy Saturday morning cartoon,"I'm not going into details about the movie because at the heart the problem Thor has is pretty simple: It ignores a lot of the motivations of the characters on a thinly laced plot.The first Thor took a while to grow on me, but it still outdoes the second installment. But why is it a better movie than the second installment? It's mostly because the motivations of the characters and villains are clearly laid out and establishes a better impetus with the story. Loki is struggling to find out who he is, Thor is trying to become who he is expected to be, and the frost giants work out the rough edges in the story arc, the same can't be said of The Dark World.You don't have any sort of interesting dynamics between the characters and instead get references to the first movie, or things that worked for the first movie, and try to play them out again. The movie never really picks up any identity for itself and just continues to harp on the events of the Avengers as well as the lead into new films of the franchise being its primary focus which makes the plot really spread thin and boring after a while.For the sake of not repeating myself, concerning the villain that is, I'll leave it at that. Save your money.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Teleported to the realm without fun,"The first Thor is the only one of Marvel's recent crop I take to. It got Loki wrong to satisfy the demands of a generic plot with evil squarely on one side. But up above it had a gilded astral world, and down below Branaugh had all sorts of fun at the expense of his Shakespearean setup.Why did they have to mess a good thing?They made a good early decision for starters. The whole cinematic world would be defined by (hypothetical) quantum physics that allowed all sorts of spontaneous fun with appearances and transportation, an illusory fabric that changes at whims. They could now graft on it the right Loki from the fables, which are from a pre-Christian time when evil was not yet neurosis and sin, where Loki embodied capricious nature, illusion, uncertainty, spontaneity, a deeper understanding than a simple duality.So this could be fun, inventive and revealing in the same swoop.It's easy to see where this went wrong, they wanted a serious dark saga. A serious saga demands no surprise really, allows no playing. Thor goes from goodhearted jock to Superman brooding about Lois and his duty as protector of worlds as he flies around fighting gods, the worst possible decision.Why do we need these to be serious anyway? The forces are no more comprehensible in this way, the heroes no more human, just archetypes of some inner conflict. It should be as baffling to encounter these worlds, a civilization which has mastered the quantum field but still fights with swords, as capricious to decide on their mechanics as the actual physics at play.Strangely, they got a better Loki. Their whole trip together with Thor to the elven realm has a bit of that scent of the sagas. This is not a matter of sticking to origin, but seeing the value. We have some of that playing and illusion around Loki, that is until the end when they unmask him again as malicious tyrant.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Watch it for Hiddleston, the rest is comical","As the ""pre titles"" - history section - to the story tells you, the bad guy - Malekith the Accursed - creates an ultimate weapon to rule the universe, gets stopped, and goes away plotting his revenge.That should give more than enough scope to have large scale battles between the protagonists, plenty of opportunity for Thor to run around smashing righteous thunder into anything he encounters. Like Gimli in Lord of the Rings, but with Legolas's hair. Yet the battles are more one on one. The acting may be strong in parts (which is to be expected with Portman, Hopkins and Skarsgård), yet it would have been good to see some more of Eccleston as the main protagonist. And you can tell that Malekith has spent his time not only plotting, but also in R&D, while the Asgardians haven't learnt much from the previous film. Not to mention the number of pillars that get destroyed, no wonder the world is dark!Hiddleston shines as the tricky Loki, with the rage of a son betrayed by his father, the despair of a son lost to his mother and the contempt of a betrayed and lost brother. He may have been the obvious figure head of evil in Avengers Assemble, but here he gets to play a full range of roles and comes out as the real star of the show. And despite knowing Zachary Levi was playing Fandral, if I hadn't I wouldn't have recognised him with the blonde hair!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

I still like it.,"Thor the Dark World was a major improvement from Thor 1 and Thor/Asgardian costume design improvements from avengers 1.TDW had a more elegant royal and viking feel. The sets felt were more organic. Asgard still seemed squished.The only characters to have any development were Thor Loki and Jane. Everyone else were just there. Simply just there.The effects were better. The fight scenes were also better. Although the fight scene of Thor getting beat up by kurse was lame. That one could have been better x60.Jane is just Jane. She teleports to the aether and that's how the story begins. Her stooges minus Erik. Were bozos. I like Darcy but she's a kind of a waste.Melekith the accursed. Many people don't understand his motives. I do. His people need darkness to function and live like man needs the sun. In order for his people to survive they plan on making the 9 realms dark (plus for revenge and because they are just bad elves. )
The movie doesn't emphasize this at all. That's where I think people go wrong with not understanding Meleikth the accursed. It's typical of mcu movies to not explain things and leave things up for countless fan theories. Or some times deliberate plot holes.Odin is there but wasted.Thors mom who we rarely saw gets axed. Her funeral scene was iconic.Warriors 3 and Hiemdall. Wasted talent and potential.Overall Thor 2 is a fun galactic mystical viking movie. If it were not for rushing for a connected universe. Thor 1 and 2 would be simular to Lord of the rings.
Thor mcu movies is basically one of a kind that isn't over the top spectacular. Still you can enjoy it.Verdict: can I get my shoe back?",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

It sure lives up to its title - a very dark film indeed.,"So a year on since the Avengers assembled and Loki has been in prison while Thor is making peace in the Nine Realms while the Bifrost was being rebuilt. So after all that is explained in the first 10 minutes we get to the story line which revolves around a Dark Elf known as Malekith and his search/revenge plans. Christopher Eccleston did a very interesting role although after watching I think he didn't own it, other people could have done it as well, if not better. That didn't ruin it though as another, unexpected, plot point revolves around Loki and the issues of trusting him which make for some very twisty and questionable scenes. I'd have to say I enjoyed the parts set on Earth more rather than in space for some reason, but all in all I liked how it looked although some elements I had seen before in other media. There were of course references to past films as the Tesseract got a mention as did New York. So my final thoughts are this: the special effects were great, the plot was OK but I've seen better, and all-in-all I have the same feel about it as the first, it didn't wow me but neither was I bored, it was just in the middle.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Unfavorable Thor 2 Review,"This movie's only saving grace was every scene with Loki, who sadly isn't going to be in Avengers 2 according to Joss Whedon. This film spent way too much time with Natalie Portman and her throw-away friend characters trying to dish out quirky comedic relief, which resulted in painfully unfunny scenes that dragged and dragged and dragged... I'm not sure what it is about Natalie Portman's acting but for me it was excruciatingly reminiscent of her Queen Amidala performance. Her acting tends to be pretty hit or miss for me but these Thor movies just haven't been doing her any favors. The relationship she has with Thor is so unconvincing and bland that the movie can't even be bothered to tack on a little farewell scene for the both of them when Chris Hemsworth goes back to Asgard at the end. It cares that little.Also, generic evil bad guy is more undefined than any other super villain the Marvel movie universe has come up with so far.

This will get even more interesting when we get the next sequel.,"Out of everything in the Marvel Universe, when it comes to paper (comics), Thor is about the dumbest character. He will always look like the California surfer guy smoking the second hand smoke. He's a character that is supposed to fit into Norse mythology but I don't see much of that in him whatsoever. Unlike someone like Batman or Spider Man, this character has only one weapon and that is a hammer and this is cheesy.That said though, Thor still has a lot of potential. The character is different every which way. Also Norse mythology is a very uncommon thing in the comic book world and also in the film world and this shows originality. Thor is also a character with an interesting history that breaks many norms and no doubt the series has an audience.After an impressive run at the box office with the first feature film, Thor: The Dark World is the sequel. The plot has Thor (Chris Hemworth) fighting Malekith ( Christopher Eccleston) who is a villain that is trying to destroy this world by making it darker using the weapon called Aether.Like the 2011 film, the cast here is a hit. Chris Hemsworth is the likable Thor who again brings a sarcastic tone. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman ) is Thor's love interest and is a character that goes with the flow and who along with Darcy (Kat Dennings) brings more humor than the first movie which was unexpected. After what he did in The Avengers, (Tom Hiddleston) Loki is the character we are most looking forward to seeing. Here Middleston plays Loki, Thor's brother, as the same type of character as before. Loki is silly and an un-credited villain though ironically he ends up being on the good side here. Odin (Anthony Hopkins) is the humble father who is trying to keep the peace between the brothers and also outsiders.This being a superhero film, the next biggest question that comes up is just what does the villain bring to the film. Even with the tired concept of trying to take over the world again, Malekith is the villain we want. With different makeup and being a dark character, the weapon of Aether brings a different element to the table. It's also not that hard to follow the story like some other superhero films plots that we have had in the last couple of years.Unlike the first movie, there is a big ending here presented in a joking matter that feels like something out of a David Lynch movie. There are so many turns in the third act and final scenes that it creates a lot of discussion coming out of the theater. Still though, it sets the Thor series up for what seems like an interesting sequel and it also shows that director Alan Taylor is willing to make some very risky moves. Call it a mixed ending at best.After the story, the next interesting side of Thor is the main world Asgard which is full of interesting colors, lights and tones. Nothing in the Marvel Universe really comes close to Asgard. As with the 2011 film, the part of the sequel in Asgard is a little thing of the film but it goes a long way and something I would enjoy seeing many more times.It is probably something we don't need but Thor: Dark World is still none the less a very solid sequel. It is so good of a sequel it shows that something of this depth can work again. This will get even more interesting when we get the next sequel.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The villain is also rubbish.I am a massive superhero fan. But Thor 2 wasn't that great. Loki was the only character that was actually interesting and hilarious.

"Good for action, but lacking the emotional depth of the first film","Thor: The Dark World has a lot going for it: charismatic leads, strong supporting characters, lots of great action sequences, and a straightforward story. It's entertaining and is a decent, solid entry in Marvel's cinematic universe.But it could have been so much more. I see in this movie yet more evidence of a troubling habit in Hollywood action films: cutting vital character moments for the sake of inserting more action.The emotional underpinning of the first Thor film was the title character's growing maturity and redemption. In its follow-up, the heart of the film should have been Thor and Jane's growing romance. In particular, we had the opportunity for a compelling love triangle (Thor-Jane-Sif) that would underscore the differences between Asgard and Earth, between making the safe, obvious choice (Sif, the practically-immortal warrior maiden) and the hard, risky one (Jane, the vulnerable, short-lived human). But aside from a few seemingly throwaway lines that hinted at what could have been a much better story, we get none of this. This is a problem, because what is it that's driving Thor in this movie? It's his quest to save the woman he loves, even if it means betraying the realm where he grew up and is destined to rule. At least it's supposed to be, but we never get more than token acknowledgement of Thor's inner struggle--unlike the first film.Instead, what we do get is a pretty standard action movie: seemingly unstoppable bad guys; the stalwart good guy and his spunky love interest; their quirky helpers; clever one-liners; and, of course, action, action, special effects, action. It all holds together well enough, but the first Thor movie had so much more of an emotional foundation. This one feels rushed, as though several important (quiet, emotional) scenes are missing. Apparently some of those will show up on the DVD; I certainly hope so.Marvel should learn not to be afraid of making its movies a little longer. Thor, with his basis in mythology, deserves a big, epic canvas, and if it takes an extra 10-20 minutes or more of screen time to fit in the whole story, then so be it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Probably not as dark as you might think it is, not bad though","The title of this second instalment of ""Thor"" may lead spectators to believe this is a dark movie and less humorous than the first one, but that is very far from the truth. Actually this second film is even more comical than the first, for the good or for the bad.I say this because the frequent humour in ""The Dark World"" bothered some fans while pleased others. As I was watching it I did think some of the comical scenes were a little over the top and others even unnecessary, but generally I very much welcomed the humorous touch. Some of the scenes that put a completely characterized Thor through trivial human situations were very funny. Cameos were also very well used (there's even a special appearance from one of Thor's colleagues from The Avengers). Stan Lee's cameo in this one was one of my favourites from all Marvel films.Another thing that some fans complained about was the motivation (or lack of it) from the villains, the dark elves. Well, it's hard to put in a 2 hour action movie too many explanations without taking the risk of spoiling the pace of the movie. However the explanation in the beginning seemed clear to me, even being quite superficial. I don't read comic books (so I don't have any reference from them), but when the narrator said that dark elves are a race born prior to the birth of light and they want to spread again the dark energy across the universe, their motivation was pretty clear. I mean, unlike humans or asgardians (who were born from light), dark elves were born from dark energy and they simply want that energy taking over light as the moving force in the universe. Dark energy, which is represented in the movie by the alchemical element known as ""aether"", is considered a natural force in many mythologies and philosophies and is also a widely accepted theory among today's astrophysicists. So asking what is the purpose of the dark elves is the same as asking what is the purpose of dark energy, and that is a philosophical question.The spaceships battle scenes in Asgard were also a point that raised complaints. The movie creators were definitely inspired by Star Wars here, even the spaceships designs are quite similar (X-Wings for the good guys and Tie Fighters for the bad ones). I was not bothered as I saw the movie because I am a big fan of Star Wars (especially the original trilogy), but I understand that crossing fantasy/mythology with science fiction might not please some people, even if this crossing has always been present in Thor. I also have no complaints about CGI or sound effects, I think the movie is technically great (as every other movie produced by Marvel).Lastly, characters and acting. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Loki (Tom Hiddlestone) are the movie's stars and they are perfect in their roles. Along with Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man and Chris Evans as Captain America they are the best casting in The Avengers, in my opinion. I have no criticism to their work. Anthony Hopkins is again excellent as Odin and Rene Russo is just average as Frigga (she certainly does not inspire majesty to me). Stellan Skasgard is again exceptional as Dr. Erik Selvig (crazier than ever) and Cristopher Eccelstone plays a just reasonably evil Malekith (I was much more afraid of the excellent Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as Algrim). Natalie Portman as Jane Foster does a good job despite her character being a little too bland; she plays much more the ""defenceless little girl"" type than in the first movie and that was a bit disappointing. The rest of the cast did well as they did in the first movie, some playing comical parts (Kat Dennings) and others more serious ones (Idris Elba).So Thor: The Dark World is one more movie from Marvel Studios that combines action, comedy and science fiction, but with the ""bonus"" touch of Nordic mythology. If you enjoyed the first one I recommend you to check this sequel.My rating: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Doesn't disappoint!,"Don't get me wrong, I loved the movie and will happily go back to the cinema to get it again but I definitely favour the first movie. It confused me a bit as in the first movie the Bifrost was destroyed? And now its suddenly OK again? Bit of a let down in the fact that I would of liked an explanation on how on earth they'd be able to fix that. Tom Hiddleson definitely done it for me though, I could stare as Chris Hemsworth all day if I could but my eyes were on Hiddleson this time, he is an amazing actor and suits the role of Loki Perfectly. I would of loved to have seen a wee fight between Jane Foster and Lady Sif, you can see them giving each other dirty looks but they do nothing about it? Quite pointless to add that jealousy in if nothing is to be done about it! Amazing special effects though and a lot of violence - the 2 things I love the most! I do recommend it, I just tend to pick out small things that get on my nerves!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Don't watch 3D Version,"First part was much better than this one. Title in review has quite weak plot and above all it lacks emotional intensity and thrill which first part had. Because of shallow plot, this movie will fail to take you along. In these kind of movies Villains are very powerful and invincible. But heroes look for out of the box solutions to get them down but in this movie Villain character is very weak and is without any convention. Villain doesn't look intelligent and dangerous to me. He was just a villain to fill space. Good news is there are 2-3 laughs as well though I didn't laugh as I found them not very laughable.Direction was OK. Acting was good as normally is in these kind of Films. Portman was bit better. This movie has high production value. Lot of effort and money used in creating stunning visual effects.So my suggestion to readers is that ""Don't watch it in 3D"" specially if you have watched Gravity in 3D recently. You will feel very bad like me. And will curse 3D technology which I think is mind blowing if used properly.Its OK for one time watch but nothing memorable.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Good,"This is a very enjoyable movie best seen on the big screen so see it while you can.The cast and characters are really good with them being very entertaining in their parts.There is great action but also great comedy at times and the balance between the two is very good.The special effects are obviously very good as well this being a Marvel summer blockbuster. Better than the first Thor I think, but I like the first movie better overall as far as the stories go, the rest is about even.Be sure to stick around after the movie too because during the credits and after the credits there are extra little scenes that you will enjoy. And there will definitely be more sequels to this movie, for sure.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The best Marvel movie after The Avengers & the best superhero movie of the year!,"Thor: The Dark World continues with the story of the God of Thunder, Thor(Chris Hemsworth). After Loki(Tom Hiddleston), is imprisoned for his despicable crimes in New York(these events take place in The Avengers) by Odin(Anthony Hopkins), Thor along with Sif(Jaimie Alexander), Fandral(Zachary Levi), Volstagg(Ray Stevenson) & Hogun(Tadanobu Asano) set about the task of bringing peace & harmony to the nine realms. However, when an ancient & extremely dangerous substance called the Aether gets unleashed into the universe it is up to Thor, to stop the Dark Elves led by Malekith(Christopher Eccleston) from laying their hands on the Aether. However, Thor can't do this on his own. So, he seeks the help of his estranged brother, Loki. Thor also returns to Midgard aka Earth to protect his love interest, Jane Foster(Natalie Portman) at any cost.I freaking loved this film! It was definitely the best superhero movie of the year. It was even better than Superman reboot, Man of Steel because even though it was action packed, there were humorous scenes as well. The 3D was effective except, in the scenes with dialogs. The special effects were out of this world. I loved the fact that there was more Asgard, this time. I also liked that they introduced us to more worlds like, Anaheim & Svartalfheim. The climax was so unexpected & mind blowing. This is the only Marvel film, to have such an unforeseen twist. This film was way better than Thor(2011). It was way more action packed & hilarious compared to Kenneth Branagh's watered down original. The performances was definitely one, of the many pros of the film. Chris Hemsworth plays the part of Thor, to perfection. Natalie Portman is brilliant as Jane Foster. However the standout performer in the film is, yet again, Tom Hiddleston as Loki. Hiddleston's cheeky & witty dialog delivery keeps the viewers guffawing for a good part of the film. However, Loki can turn terrifying in an instant. This shows what a versatile actor Tom Hiddleston is. No matter how despicable Loki is, I can pretty much guarantee that everyone loves Loki. This is the magic of Hiddleston. Anthony Hopkins is great as Odin. Christopher Eccleston is menacingly evil as Malekith. Jaimie Alexander, Zachary Levi, Ray Stevenson & Tadanobu Asano are impressive as Sif, Fandral, Volstagg & Hogun respectively. Idris Elba is spectacular as Heimdall. Rene Russo is outstanding as Frigga. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje is effective as Algrim/Kurse. Kat Dennings & Stellan Skarsgard are great as Darcy Lewis & Erik Selvig respectively. If I had to pick one teeny tiny flaw then that would be that, the film was too short. I would have loved an extra ten to fifteen minutes. Anyway, Thor: The Dark World is a must watch for pretty much everyone, even the Marvel haters.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Very Funny but not a perfect one,"Seems that Loki is so popular these days that each girl will be screaming about him when watching the movie,which makes Natalie Portman invisible and unimportant. The lines in it are very funny with great humor,visual effect is also fantastic. However,it remains a big problem that the descriptions of each role are not convincing enough for us to understand what they are thinking about or planning to do.Supporting roles show us great performances which are way better than Thor and Jane,especially for Darcy and Erik. Anyway,some incredible surprises still turn up now and then.And it is way better than the first one.You shouldn't miss those excellent moments.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Surprisingly Good Superhero Film,"I am usually not a fan of the superhero genre. However, I did watch most of the recent superhero films due to my sister being a huge fan of them. I'm usually unimpressed with superhero movies, even with the successful Avengers and the Batman trilogy. It is a massive challenge to create an entertaining storyline in a film that everybody knows the hero is going to win in the end. Recent superhero films (especially Man of Steel) failed at this and I was prepared to face disappointment upon stepping into the cinema hall.Thor The Dark World was one that I can honestly say was entertaining. Surprisingly. I think I was generally happy with it because of the realism of the conflict that they face. In the Avengers, when alien beings attacked earth, humans on earth somehow decides to do almost nothing. No appropriate military action by earth's governments. It's the same with Iron Man 3, US military did nothing when the president was captured.In Thor The Dark World, the threat was at Asgard. The whole of Asgard was ready to go to war. Due to the effects of the alignment of the Nine Realms, portals between worlds were opened but as it all happened too sudden, nobody from other realms was able to react on it. This is more believable than the Avengers' situation (where Loki was on Earth for a long period of time and Shield knew he was up to something having stolen the Tesseract yet no military action were taken when the aliens attacked).You still have to ignore some plot holes and ridiculous logics (like why Asgardians still fight with swords and shields when their enemy who were in suspended animation for the last 5000 years had laser guns) but it was still very entertaining for a superhero film. The development of the main characters were done satisfyingly. Thor, who were a rash, short-tempered Asgardian prince with a thirst for war, is now more mature and sensible in making decisions. We also saw the other side of Loki despite his continuous mischiefs.The balance of action, humour and ""superhero realism"" makes it fun to watch. It's not overly complicated but it's also not too dumb or predictable. Overall I'm quite happy with this film and I would recommend it to anyone who is starting to lose faith in the superhero genre.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The corniness of dialogue and convoluted elements don't keep The Dark World from being an entertaining and appropriately funny addition to the Avengers universe.,"""Thor: The Dark World"" has problems. Actually, it has a few problems. The battle scenes are generic. The editing is sloppy. There are moments of cheese, and the dialogue needs some spicing up. Most dubious is the confusing main conflict with the forgettable villain, Malekith. However, despite the corniness and the convoluted elements plaguing it, ""The Dark World"" is a highly entertaining, engaging, and surprisingly funny addition to The Avengers universe. In order to buy into these Thor films, one must be okay with Thor being a stupid, albeit fun, Marvel character. Sure, his entire lore is hokey, but it is intentionally so, and the filmmakers behind this installment are well aware of this, using it to their benefit in great humorous effect. And while Portman seems bored playing love interest Jane, most other performances are strong and lively. Hemsworth, Dennings, and Skarsgard are better fleshed out and play their roles with ease. However, the real winner here is Hiddleston, gleefully villainous as Loki, one of the most complex and sympathetic baddies in years. Outside of ""Star Trek"", this is the best big franchise film of the year. Even though Marvel slightly missed the mark with ""Iron Man 3"", they have returned to solid filmmaking form here through great cartoony graphics, unique superhero cinematography and a solid action movie score. So while it won't win over many new fans for Thor, it will satisfy old ones biding their time until the next Avengers movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Halfway through and struggling,Halfway through this debacle and struggling to keep my attention from wandering. Oh wait I'm writing this so attention well and truly on a holiday.The only thing good about it is Tom Hiddlestone. He says his lines as though he means them and understands them.The film is unengaging and I find the actors unconvincing. I saw the first movie and it was just OK. In this one however I find Idris Elba wasted and unbelievable as a character. Even Anthony Hopkins seemed to have just turned up for the cash. Loads of special effects and CGI especially in the Asgard scenes but if the story is not involving then they count for nothing. The female friend of Jane - can't remember her name- seems to have wandered in from some teen movie and is as irritating as hell! I just do not care about anyone in this movie at all.

Good!,"I actually liked the first Thor movie better, but that could be because when I saw the first movie it was in a huge theatre and we got to watch it in 3D which for movies like this adds a lot to the experience. It was great seeing the characters back, there is a lot of good funny moments to go with some really good action scenes. I'm not a huge fan of the comic book character of Thor so I obviously prefer other movies about super heroes but it's still pretty good. I went into the first one with low expectations and really enjoyed that movie a lot, this one I had higher expectations and maybe that's why I thought the movie was really good but not quite great. I would see another Thor movie if and when it comes out, fun and worth seeing for sure, fan of these movies or no you will find stuff to enjoy in them.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A visually stunning mess,"Gotta say, digital eye candy can be pretty astonishing. Wish I could look at the worlds they created all day. Screensaver maybe?But as for what's going on in front of all this stunning art direction, it's all pretty ridiculous and confusing. Honestly, by the end I just got tired of things smashing and breaking for no real reason, and found myself desperately hoping the thing would just end already. The scenes with Loki were the film's saving grace; while he was around, I found myself interested. But trying to make sense out of all the rest of this slop just made me tired and frustrated. I'd gladly watch about half of it again with the sound off, and I recommend the film highly to the deaf community.Surprised to see it's so highly rated here.

A surprisingly good movie.,"A good story told at a measured pace. Not a masterpiece, but probably the only Marvel Studios movie since Iron Man 1 that approaches being a 'great' movie (though its not there yet).A lot of Star Wars imagery, from the design of the ships to the framing of the shots; when the 'Alien Elves' erupt out of that hole thing, it feels like the opening of A New Hope! This could be my favourite Marvel Studios movie after Iron Man 1.I hope Marvel continues in this direction, but let the directors have MORE control, more vision and more passion.A very entertaining blockbuster, but the next one will be better.http://www.comicbooksyndicate.com/thor-the-dark-world/",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Superb Entertainer!,"The Second Thor Film after the 2011 hit, 'Thor: The Dark World' is A Superb Entertainer, that lives up-to the gargantuan expectations.

Cornucopia,"It's been a year since the events of The Avengers. Bifrost has been rebuilt, and the Aesir are only now done world policing the other realms back to peace. Things won't remain quiet for long - a primeval race, the Dark Elves, return, determined to bring all of existence back to the nothingness before there was light. An oft-used, abstract ""villain goal"" - here visualized well, and made quite literal; part of their arsenal(the only advanced weapon in this that isn't so bland that it's downright distracting) is a grenade that creates a tiny black hole, relentlessly pulling away those caught within the blast radius. To this end, the leader Malekith(Eccleston bringing out the big guns for the least compelling bad guy of the current cinematic Marvel-verse), with the aid of his lieutenant, Algrim(Akinnuoye-Agbaje, using his immense physical presence to bring a seemingly unstoppable force of destruction to life - a lava-infused bull-like being), seek the Aether, a powerful essence that enables the wielder to drain life and light.It has recently resurfaced - in fact, it infected Jane Foster(Portman, cute in her awkward social behavior and obsession with discovery; she and our titular hero are pining for one another - with that said, the romance was better in the first one). This makes her a target, and the Asgardians find that their old foe is extremely dangerous. The only way to save the universe(can you say ""raised stakes""?) appears to be for Thor(Hemsworth, charming, strong and, yes, arrogant - but now with an appreciation of planning and not rushing in) forming an uneasy alliance with Loki(Hiddleston at his most duplicitous, unpredictable... and vulnerable; in short, his best yet), who now faces consequences for his actions, and the two will come head to head over their on-going conflict - in general, this takes care to follow up on what has happened to these characters(in part by trimming the large cast some, not introducing many new faces, and, yes, less overall development for them) so far, a surprisingly personal story in this adventure of an epic scale.As this flies by with a pace that never overwhelms in spite of opening the until-now-only-ajar door to the vastness of space, the comic relief jokes and gags come in a steady stream, with the ""Terminator 2"" style humor - easing the otherwise heavy and bleak subjects, without becoming, well, T3, a parody. There is a ton of action(another of the many improvements on the great Branagh film), and it's much more varied - not merely(which doesn't mean they're gone) deities fighting creatures, we now have mid-air combat, jet fighters, chase sequences, even a major attack on a fortress! Aiming for Star Wars, this shows us more of the galaxy, defining the various areas as unique from one another. The grand orchestral score aids this tremendously, as does location shooting, solid FX work including prosthetics - with practical, suits and the like favored over CG. We go on an adventure - away from that which is familiar to either us or the protagonists. The plot is easy to follow, yet with good twists, and everything is properly set up and pays off.There is a lot of disturbing content, some mild violence and a little moderate language in this. I recommend this to any fan of fantasy, graphic novels and/or Nordic mythology. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
MY REVIEW: Thor Lights Up Again!!,"Thor is charismatic, ideal, no nonsense superhero as evident in his first outing played by Chris Hemsworth. In his awaited return after The Avengers, he takes the legacy further. His loved one is cool Jane Foster played beautifully by talented Natalie Portman. But the most lovable character remains his cunning, clever, cool, likable evil brother Loki played by Tom Hiddleston. In fact he is my second favorite villain after Joker of The Dark Knight in todays superhero universe. Visual effects vary from fantastic to excellent to mind-blowing. Stakes are much higher this time, but movie never tries to take them too seriously. In fact there are lot of funny situations and one liners but this fun was overdone in the messy climax. Nevertheless, it is a fun ride during which you would like to enjoy lots of popcorn. Please note that once movie is over, wait, there will a mid post credit scene to give you a clue for Avengers 2 and one at the very end showing the actual last scene of the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"The story is great, the casts are wonderful, and the movie is pretty funny","For me, between the avengers super heroes, Thor is the least interesting than the others. I think that the first thor movie is not that great, so I came to the theater with no high expectation. But this movie is actually awesome. The story is great, the duration's not too long, nor too short, it's enough. The casts are great. Chris played thor well. He showed the emotion, but still can keep his arrogance. The effect is amazing. I watched it in 2D (because for me, 3D just ruin the story), but I can still feel the effect. There are some little joke that actually made this movie better. The audiences cant stop laughing during the movie. So for conclusion, this movie is great, I think its better than the previous one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A lighthearted Rehash.,"The blithe and action-filled sequel to the solid and surprisingly interesting ""Thor"" from 2011, never quite unfolds the necessary emotional depth that would make you truly care for the characters as there is no character development like in the first part where the all shiny thunder god Thor made a remarkable transformation from an arrogant bully into a responsible hero whereas now he appears to be a rather one-dimensional beau who is good for some stunning stunts and few cool lines; with his roguish brother Loki as a welcome exception since his ambiguous motives have a sort of lurking sensation to them even though he is slowly turning into a Roly-Poly doll whose tricks are getting old.The rag rug of a plot is too unoriginal and therefore too predictable to be really suspenseful in spite of some more or less contrived twists. It's the ever same ""Capture the Flag""-formula, where the hero needs to wrest a ""Holy Grail""-like magical stone from the enemy's greedy claws in order to save the world, that we have not just recently seen in too many movies before; whether it's called ""Tesseract"", ""Allspark"" or like in this case ""Aether"", it may be a somewhat necessary plot device that brings forward the action, however, if it remains like here the only impetus, the only sense without a deeper meaning, without a humane message, then it is too little and trite to have a lasting impact. Nowadays, every episode of ""Game of Thrones"" offers much more excitement and drama than many a Blockbuster I've seen in recent years.What's missing plot-wise is compensated with great visuals and nearly breathtaking action sequences that come along as a Star Wars meets Lord of the Rings meets Viking mythology crossover fantasy/science-fiction mash-up which is definitely a plus. The invasion of Asgaard by the Dark Elves strongly resembles the great Battle on Naboo in ""Star Wars: Episode I"" especially since Bambi-eyed Nathalie Portman plays the dame in distress in both movies. The chemistry between her role Jane Foster and Thor is good although their kisses lack the fiery passion we saw in Spiderman for example; much more touching love stories have been told than this one for sure.""Thor: The Dark Kingdom"" is at least nice to look at.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Thor: The Lackluster World,"** out of ****While the first Thor generally received favorable reviews, it wasn't exactly met with acclaim. But I liked it a lot more than I had anticipated, so I thought lightning would strike twice (pun- intended), especially since this time around, reviews weren't too striking (pun-intended) for ""The Dark World"". With my logic, the reviews would REALLY not subside my experience of the film. Well... they were spot-on. The top critics that is.I'm not going to re-tell the synopsis for you. It's Thor. It's the sequel. There's a comic book to it and when you read a review for a blockbuster sequel, you just want to know the simple answer to a very simple question: Is the movie good? No... but let's not get too carried away with the fact it's not great, because it's not bad. So where does the problem lie?Well for starters, this movie was underwhelming as hell. With so many twists and turns, and changes in character motifs, you'd think the film would be very emotionally enveloping. But it just feels so dry, because the pacing is too abrupt to let you soak in the material. And characters just pop in and out of places, without a sense of cohesion or above-average scriptwriting.The first to me really nailed the chemistries between characters, but this one didn't make me care for anyone with the exception of- you guessed it- Thor. I found Darcy to actually be borderline obnoxious here, and Jane was just... Natalie Portman. Even Anthony Hopkins felt underused with his character.I understand being a sequel, you want to rush to the big action set pieces and show off every penny you've spent on graphics/effects, but what made the first Thor so great is while it was visually pleasing, it connected to its viewers on a more emotional level. This made for some truly epic moments and considering it took its time, the payoff was way more substantial.Also, while I viewed this in 2D, I feel it would be so unnecessary to see in 3D. No 3D moments. It doesn't seem like it'd have this grand depth of field. It just looks like a lovely 2D production.While ""The Dark World"" may snag an Oscar nom. for its art direction, there's a reason why the nominations stop there. I'm not saying ""Thor"" should aim at an Oscar (that'd be spectacular though), but just saying it should aim at least somewhat higher. With a more rushed pace, a lack of cohesion (feeling dodgy in parts), and a more than underwhelming resolution, ""The Dark World"" roped me into a lackluster one. It's not exactly a bad movie, but with the inflation of movie tickets, who wants to see an inferior sequel to a better-made original? (Which is cheaper to view by the way).",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
suffers from superhero saturation,"I was hoping that the second installment of Thor might be memorable, well it wasn't. This movie(and all of the rest of the Marvel trailers I saw) suffers from superhero saturation. Let's just face it how many times can an alien being destroy a city, put the hero and his friends in jeopardy before you just get tired. This is the problem with Thor, you just get tired while watching it. Thor just isn't drawn in this installment interesting enough. He was a great fish out of water in the first movie, a egoist brought down by kindness and guilt. In this movie he's just sad and mopey. It doesn't help that his lady love is silly and not very supportive. Jane Foster is window dressing instead of partner. Yes Loki steals the scenes, but in the end it's all for nothing but another chance to do it all again.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Comic book movie without much comic,"Chris Hemsworth as Thor is passable (definitely better than his Home and Away days). When he is being coy you can see the cheeky Australian come out of him and he is clearly more comfortable in this side of Thor than the tough stoic version. Thor appeared to be missing the old English type of speaking that was in the Avengers or Thor which at times was quite witty. This also means I couldn't walk around the house imitating his old English speech which was disappointing for me. Chris Hemsworth does provide a little bit of eye candy for the ladies (impressive back and shoulder muscles I say), in one scene an actress purposely falls on him just to see if the muscles are real.Tom Hiddleston makes Loki his own. He is broody, depressive, defiant and a smart alec. He pulls all sides off his character, one could say almost perfectly. Hiddleston and Kat Dennings were definitely the two actors who brought the most to this movie in both acting and giving the movie character. Without these two actors I might as well have been watching the Expendables but this time set in space.Natalie Portman was not acting to the quality she has done previously, for example the Black Swan. To me she appeared to be going through the motions or it could be just the depth of the character she was asked to play was quite shallow.Kat Dennings who is the main actor in 2 Broke Girls was a stand out for myself. Every time she walked on stage I think I found myself smiling or having a laugh.Christopher Eccleston whilst being the main ""baddie"" in this movie is not giving enough depth for you to feel ""yes this guy deserves to be beaten and is a real threat to the nine realms"". Instead you are left feeling yeah he provides good action scene fodder and special effects. This character needed to be more menacing.Anthony Hopkins and Rene Russo play small but important roles in the movie.The special effects of this movie are very good. There seemed to be scenes where the special effects was the main actor without the need for any human or dark elf actor to step in front of a camera.The movie was directed by Alan Taylor, he has mainly done big TV shows in the past like Game of Thrones and the script was led by one of Marvel Comics main writers Christopher Yost. I feel that sometimes the characters though lacked the depth for some of the big name actors that were obtained for these roles. But if you're in a $300 million movie within 9 days why wouldn't you act in this Marvel studios cash cow.A criticism I have of this movie is that it is following the trend of a 'serious' comic book movie where there seems to be more brooding than fun. Yes the movie has great special effects, good action and drama. Though comic book movies have seemed to forgotten the term comic relief. That is why I enjoyed Tom Hiddleston, Kat Dennings and at times Christopher Hemsworth when they had their moments on not taking themselves too seriously.Other moments I really enjoyed were the cameos of Chris Evans as Captain America and Stan Lee the creator of Marvel Comics.Overall as an adult, Thor: The Dark World was solid with great special effects, some solid performances and other actors going through the motions. I have a feeling that young teenage boys will really enjoy this movie. This movie is a popcorn movie built for the masses and definitely a movie that will not strain your brain. It is slow moving and at times it is appeared the storyline chucked together inefficiently to ensure it fully explains things that are not needed for an action movie. Time wise it goes for almost a full 2 hours.http://mondaysheroes.wordpress.com/thor-the-dark-world/",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Mirror,"While this is a continuation and some people might eventually get fed up with all the superhero movies, this really is a nice follow up, not only to the Avengers, but especially to the first Thor. Whereas you had Thor as fish out of water in that one, this time around someone else takes over that department.It's also very nice to see Natalie Portman back again, her missing out on the Avengers. There is always some reason why the other Avengers are not present and I guess you could question that, but you would take a lot from your own movie watching experience if you did. Plus you have enough on your plate here (or on your screen to be exact), that holds your attention.

"Bigger, bolder, darker and...better!","This is in no way a knock on the first Thor because I enjoyed it a lot, but, as said with Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Thor: The Dark World impressed me more. The look of the film is wonderful, Asgard is just as colourful as it was in Thor yet also darker too, matching the darker, bolder tone very well. The photography and editing are stylish and the locations, especially Iceland, are stunningly vivid. The special effects are even more dazzling than in Thor and the same can be said for the stunts. The music score by Brian Taylor is dynamic and never repetitive or pedestrian, adding to the action sequences rather than detracting. Speaking of the action sequences, they are packed with thrills with battles almost on scale of Lord of the Rings and smack-downs that are enough to crush the bones. But Thor: The Dark World is not just about action and spectacle, it has substance too(or at least it did to me), laden with humour that will genuinely make you laugh but doing so without over-powering the dark nature of the story or the tense sparring between Thor and Loki. The story is compelling with the right doses of action, humour and drama, it's bigger in scale and bolder in tone than the first Thor but also more expansive in characterisation. The acting is top-class with most of the cast getting more to do, Anthony Hopkins is always dependable and Natalie Portman brings a touch of class and Stellan Skarsgard has some very funny moments but the acting honours do go to Chris Hemsworth, who's more robust and poised than he was in the first Thor, and especially Tom Hiddleston, who is terrific as Loki and pitches his mellifluousness and serpentine-like malevolence perfectly. My only complaints here are Christopher Eccleston having very little to do so he gives a somewhat one-dimensional performance that exudes moody menace but not much else and Loki surrendering and Thor forgiving him too easily and quickly. All in all however, a truly excellent follow-up that improves even more over the first Thor. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Not spectacular, but still a noteworthy...","...addition to ""The Avengers"" canon of films.I recommend this movie if you are any of the below:1) You are a completist and would feel wrong to have missed an installment belonging to the Avengers series of films despite speculating that it is a filler movie made only to grab your money.2)You love to stare at Chris Hemsworth's bulging biceps.3) You love superhero movies, even if its plot is pretty standard with few or no surprises.4) You are single male and have nothing better to do.My gripes with the film may be more of a problem with Hollywood movie-making these days than with the film itself. Production feels uninspired and run of the mill. The plot, props, action, effects and gags are all neatly in place to generate just enough wonder and excitement for the average viewers so they don't fall asleep.During the movie, we are told that there are nine realms, but each one is nothing more than a snow globe when compared to the diversity of Earth. Apparently, in all the other realms, people can travel between dimensions but still fight with swords and axes. Whereas on Earth, we have all manner of weaponry but knows sh*t about the universe save a few super geniuses who like running around strip naked and whatnot.So there you have it.If none of what I've just said sounds like a major turn-off, I will say that this is good entertainment equivalent to regarding an extra value meal at Macdonald's being a good meal sometimes. Otherwise, please do yourself a favor and steer clear of the movie to save yourself from having to cry about it later on the boards.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A pretty forgettable entry in the Marvel catalogue,"I was a big fan of Marvel comics when I was a kid. The stories were always more sophisticated than these modern movies, so I usually feel disappointed. The first ""Thor"" was probably the best of the lot, but sadly the sequel fails short.This movie doesn't take itself as seriously as its predecessor. There are a constant stream of cheesy one-liners and occasionally one manages to be funny.Thor and Loki are well played as usual, but Portman's character is just annoying and uneven. Her romance with Thor is about as bad as 'Star Wars Attack of the Clones'. I don't think this is Portman's fault; I just don't think the producers of this movie were very ambitious.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Thor: The Comedy World,"I was very interested in seeing how they would up the Thor sequel and I have to say it was a great movie on the whole. Asgard was amazing and had a great feel about it, you felt you were there yourself. But I felt although humour in the marvel movies is great and they hit it just right in the first movie, it was to forced in this one. It almost felt like they should have run a canned laughter track and had some of the awful jokes written by the people who made 2 and a half men (the world most over rated crock comedy). Thor's use of flight was really great and had some great shots of him flying about. But like in the previous movie Loki stole the show! Christopher Eccleston did a great job playing the Dark Elf king. If you love Marvel you have to see it just to complete the set.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I absolutely loved it. Wonderful spectacle and story.,"Better than the first film in my opinion and simply a great sequel. The stakes were higher. The characters were mostly brilliant though I felt Malekith could have been developed slightly more. Loki was simply wonder and maybe the class of the entire effort. I loved the plot and the balance of action and story. That's where this film excels over the original. There's heart and humor but far better action and far more dire consequences.Honestly, If you're going to turn a comic book into a movie, do it with utter belief in your story and do it with the best talent and FX possible. That's why Marvel movies do so well and why they need to get ALL their properties back under their roof. We'd all love to see the Marvel Universe united if it's all to be done this well. Not looking ahead, just enjoy this movie for the wonderful spectacle and story that it delivers.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Thor 2 > Thor 1 - But is it still a good film, worth to watch?","I'm a really big fan of superheroes, I've read many comics and I've watched nearly every film, which is based on a superheroe comic. Thor - The Dark World is far better than the previous Thor but I have to admit that the sequel wasn't worth to watch in the cinema, on the release date.Even though we can see a film, which offers you far more action than the forerunner, you can't overlook the fact that Marvel-Studios has created this film.During the first 40 minutes I've experienced an immense entertainment because the director Alan Taylor was really successful at creating a great atmosphere, the plot was taken really seriously, because it didn't contain any of these typical small jokes which normally appear during a Marvel-film.In addition there were a lot of mistakes considering the logic of the plot.After the first part the film became more and more atrocious, especially in the end. I will give ""Thor-The Dark World"" 6 out of 10 points because the film offered me more entertainment than the forerunner but if it was only for the first part, I would give 9 out of 10 points.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
It's a decent Marvel movie.,"It's a typical Marvel movies. Like most of Marvel movies in recent years, Thor: The Dark World is presented in a light and humorous tone(in contrast to DC Comics movies that are darker and more serious). It's a straightforward fantasy/sci-fi/action movie. Some attempts on humor would seemed a bit desperate and unnecessary, especially when they are doing some serious sequence. The storyline is pretty standard, but it's pretty much what is expected. The visual FX is good, but the 3D version is still the Hollywood version of ""Show me the money"". All in all, I am not overly impressed, but it is a decent Marvel Superheroes movie, and it will continue to entertain a lot of fans. My ratings: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Technicality finds its happy medium with comic book storytelling,"It has been 2 years since the New York incident and wars are raging all across the nine realms. Asgardian warriors have the onus of restoring order and warding off all evil. Meanwhile back on Earth, Jane Foster has accidentally unleashed an ancient weapon of the Dark Elves that resurrects their race, threatening the very existence of the Universe. The Norse God of Thunder has a mighty force to reckon with and will need the assistance of his deceitful brother Loki. Thor must prevent the world from falling into darkness before the imminent convergence of all realms. With most of the events unfolding upon Asgard, some fantastic special effects were obvious devices to be used by the celebrated TV director Alan Taylor whose most recent works include several memorable episodes of Game of Thrones, Mad Men & Sopranos. 'Thor: The Dark World' is undeniably an exciting superhero epic that outdoes its predecessor and establishes Chris Hemsworth as a worthy Avenger.While the Asgardians police the realms and keep trouble away from their homeland, Thor's ambivalence is highlighted. On one hand, he has a role in protecting Midgard as an Avenger and being closer to Jane Foster and on the other, the responsibility of being the King of Asgard in the near future. As Jane accidentally becomes the host for the dark power Aether on Earth, Thor decides to bring her to Asgard. Darkness then draws onto itself and the resurrected Malekith (Christopher Eccleston – Who?) attacks the might of Asgard itself causing terror and despair. Thor must now seek the assistance of whom he wouldn't trust at all but retribution, has common enemies. Together with Loki (Tom Hiddleston), Thor must prevent Malekith from unleashing darkness upon the world before the convergence of all nine realms occurs. The common plane of this rare alignment falls in Greenwich, which then serves as the final battleground for an epic clash between Thor and the forces of the Dark Elves.At his third outing as the God of Thunder, Chris Hemsworth is more convincing and iconic than ever before. He effectively manages distinct relationships in this sequel, between his father, his conniving brother and his love, Jane. With more humor, action and evil, Hemsworth does a mighty job with his hammer. Natalie Portman has a better role that is suited to her talent and at Asgard, she feels just at home as she was on Naboo as Queen Amidala. Anthony Hopkins might look weary of playing Old Odin but his voice and persona still make him the most suitable King. The show stealer however, is Tom Hiddleston as Loki. His comic timing and charm simply add to his character's dishonest nature. The untrustworthy Loki is turning out to be the most lovable villain and that simply asserts how well Hiddleston plays the part.Alan Taylor's comprehensive background with major TV series does enable him to blend in several elements of the story in a fast paced, eventful and exciting movie of less than 2 hours. A seemingly uncomplicated plot does yet provide the grip and thrill. With some exemplary visual effects that not only showcase the fantastic realm of Asgard in vivid light and colors but also showcase the epic destruction in Greenwich, Taylor makes remarkable use of technologies to enhance the story's appeal. The best part is, he directs the screenplay in a seamless manner that keeps the audience engaged with the pace so the film isn't heavily reliant on its visuals but is merely aided by it in its storytelling. That is precisely how such superhero movies should be made. The cinematography is excellent even with simple scenes such as Thor's arrival upon Earth, London's aerial view and the action on desolate landscapes of other realms. The background score has the epic tone and sustains the darkness associated with the film's evil.Technicality finds its happy medium with comic book storytelling and Taylor deserves credit for enhancing Thor's presence in the Marvel world. As Malekith's evil grows with the power of Aether, Thor's strength increases with his loved ones around him. His definitive stance for Midgard's well being and for his love, Jane Foster will establish him as an Avenger and protector of all realms. Meanwhile, Loki's wile ways shall keep us entertained with the brilliant Tom Hiddleston. Thor: The Dark World isn't ground-breaking but it does everything right for a superhero movie and that, is the simple reason you should spend that money. Oh, and to watch the scene where Thor sheds his cloak, jumps off the balcony, catches the incoming mjölnir and flies away. Epic.8.688 on a scale of 1-10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The God of Thunder Strikes Again.,"Thor was not the easiest hero for Marvel to bring to the big screen. His mythical roots and overwhelming power never made him the most popular character out there. That all changed with 2011's Thor, and even more so in The Avengers. There definitely are stumbles along the way, but Thor: The Dark World gives another solid solo outing for The God of Thunder.As the second entry in Phase 2 of Marvel's Cinematic Universe (MCU), Thor: The Dark World is restricted to telling a story that will fit into the MCU, but that doesn't hold back the story one bit in this solo adventure. In fact, in ways you don't fully see until the very end, this movie undoubtedly pushes the entire MCU forward in high gear. The plot focuses around the Aether, an ancient weapon hidden by Asgardians thousands of years ago from a race of Dark Elves and their leader Malekith, who has since returned in pursuit of the Aether and Thor must stop him from consuming the universe in darkness. The plot is interesting and involving, but the pacing is a little all over the place, bouncing between a Lord of the Rings in space vibe to the fish out of water comedic tones on Earth. The narrative has some twists, turns and plenty of humor throughout the whole film, but sometimes things just fall out of place. The Nine Realms were also not expanded on as much as I had hoped, giving a lesser sense to the greater cosmos that exist in Thor's universe, but the film's scale still feels large enough to satisfy.Yet even more entertaining than the main plot, is the subplot created between Thor and his fan favorite brother Loki, now a prisoner of Asgard. This subplot almost takes the form of a villain redemption arc, and it is stellar to say the least. At many points in the film, it almost seemed as though Loki was the star of the show.With each new release in the MCU comes an expectation for high-level action scenes and breathtaking CGI. The Dark World succeeds in delivering both of these in the movie, and in top form as well. Large scale battles with ancient sci-fi tech make for some wonderful CGI and entertaining action sequences. Thor himself is not under powered nor is he over-powered, thus creating a hero who is a blast to watch in action, but also has his short comings against a powerful enemy. All in all, the action lives up to the expectations you'd expect from a MCU flick.The aforementioned enemy is Malekith, and along side him his army of Dark Elves and the powerful, Hulk-like Kursed who provides Thor with a re-incarnation of his Avengers tilt with the green machine. Malekith, played by Christopher Eccleston, is a pretty poor villain. Dark and evil yes, and that's the main issue, he's utterly one dimensional and unfortunately underdeveloped, as many MCU seem to be, not getting the chance to really evolve into a movie-changing baddie. Yes there are some moments of entertaining action featuring Malekith, but it can't bring him to a level of a top tier villain, and it hurts the film as a whole.The vast majority of the cast from the first Thor returns for the sequel, and mostly still in top form. Chris Hemsworth still proves that he his the perfect man to play Thor, while the supporting cast is very strong. Tom Hiddleston once again puts on a performance that captures him the essence of a lead role, cementing himself as one of the best characters in the MCU. Natalie Portman returns to portray love interest Jane Foster, a less than admirable performance while Anthony Hopkins provides some awesome star power as Odin. These names are just a few that have important roles in the movie, and the wonderful performance by most of the cast gives the characters depth, and in turn are exciting to watch.Since 2008, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been pumping out pure entertainment for hardcore and casual fans alike. There's no denying that this film has some problems with a lack of some character development, and sporadic instances of feeling too small, but Thor: The Dark World continues on Marvel's triumphant path by delivering a fun, flashy and entertaining movie with solid acting and action plentiful enough to keep the movie from ever coming to a complete halt. With a mid-credits scene that teases some potentially major plans for the MCU, this terrific Phase 2 entry seems to be just the beginning for what's to come from the ever-growing world of Marvel heroes.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Thor Strikes Earth With Another Blow!,"Thor has come back to earth, and other realms once more for a action packed joy ride that will leave you wanting the next film.I must say that I was a slight bit skeptical when I found that Kenneth Brannagh was not directing this film, and in the end the movie didn't have the same twist of the first one.I will say that i enjoyed Thor The Dark World just as much, or better then the first movie, even without the flow of the first movie. All I can say is they left a little bit to be desired with the villain, and the movie was way to short. The acting was fantastic on everyone's part, and it was a great movie.Join Thor and Loki as they travel between worlds, in an epic battle between good and evil.

God Of Thunder Strikes Out,"I was expecting to be impressed with this movie. Instead, along comes this endless battle royal that goes on and on and on with sword fights and battle scenes.

At the start the movie seems promising but as it goes on it becomes painfully obvious that little was invested towards writing an interesting plot line and script for this stinker.

The best of the three Thor films,"This movie has it all: the perfect blend of romance, comedy, action and mischief. It pains me to see how much the third film threw off the balance and became my least-favorite of all the MCU films to date.Worth noting is how complex Thor and Loki's relationship was, and how as a viewer you are often trying to understand how sincere is their bond, how problematic the interplay of altruism and hubris, and how layered and nuanced their sense of justice. I contest that none of the MCU films depict this complexity as effectively, and with so many layers, as this one.Unlike the third film, the playfulness in this movie always supported, rather than undermined, both the plot and the character development. In the third film, horrific death was treated as a joke, as was Jane's absence. But here you feel the weight of things.And the mystical elements in this movie made sense; you understood (at least with repeated viewings) how the physics of the trickery worked. Whereas with the third film, well, I still don't understand why weapons just went right through Hela, why such was depicted at the edge of the screen, with no characters seeming to notice or acknowledge her imperviousness, and why the filmmakers had the characters continue to attack someone unaffected by weapons, removing any sense of the stakes involved.This movie lives up to its name, keeps things dark, and it works: very, very well.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Good thoughtful film,"I absolutely love the character of Loki because there was so much texture to the character. He's the perfect Marvel villain. He was complex but with a tinge of madness mixed in and perfectly written for the film. The rationale for what he does and how he behaves is masterful. I truly loved how Loki was written and portrayed. Then again, I honestly can say that about all the main characters. Thor and Jane really are allowed to shine here as well.My main critique after watching the first film was the instance romance between Jane and Thor. After watching this movie, you buy the love at first sight scenario boosted by the situational intrigue. This time around, the pace of the film really worked well.

The unexpected journey,Thor 2 the dark world is an amazing film full of lots of unexpected scenes in it that i am going to let you find out for yourself. The film was casted extremely well as it is a sequel to Thor. Chris Hemsworth done an excellent job as usual fitting into his character. Tom Hiddleston who plays Loki was an extremely comedic actor in this film and i found that he was naturally funny with the script given and made it his own. Natalie Portman was not you're usual super hero girlfriend that continuously gets into trouble and screams at everything she sees instead she was a very perky character and brave she got her hands dirty helping Thor with his fight. I strongly recommend this film as it has some amazing graphics in.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"It's hammer time!!! No, I'm not referring to 80s rapper MC Hammer! Thor is back in another great adventure! Read on to find out more!!!","Thor returns in yet another triumphant adventure. When the original aired in 2011 it was perhaps the Marvel property that people were most skeptical about. The God of Thunder, wearing a red cape, Norse mythology and all, it sounded really silly.It was perhaps this low level of expectation, which I also had for Iron Man, which helped to make it such a success. It was fun and loud with a good heart at its core, not to mention introducing Chris Hemsworth and the outstanding Tom Hiddleston. Their chemistry helped to seal the deal and this continued with their adventures in Avengers.I think over the years, many of us have become quite endeared to all of the Avengers characters, they are almost household names and each new Marvel entry is welcomed with considerable fanfare. Thor: The Dark World is no exception.The story begins by introducing us to the Dark Elves led by Malekith in a time before Thor and Odin. Bor, father of Odin, managed to stop Malekith from using an energy known as the Aether to return the universe to the darkness it once knew before there was creation. The Aether was hidden and the story fell into legend and fable.However, as the alignment of the planets approaches once again, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), now residing in London, inadvertently makes a discovery that is going to draw her straight into the heart of Thor's latest adventure. Thor is forced to return to Earth and even bring Jane back to Asgard where the Asgardians are given something of a rude awakening. They soon realize that the Dark Elves they remember from their bedtime stories are very real and have once again returned to try and throw the universe back into darkness.This is a great adventure with real consequence. We are reminded that although perceived to be gods by people on Earth during the time of Vikings, Asgardians can be hurt, can be injured, and they frequently do. Thor has to muster more than just physical strength to try and defeat the Dark Elves and it is not without some dire consequences. More than once I found myself wiping away a manly tear from my eye. Thankfully, Thor has the assistance of all his friends from the original movie and they play no small part in helping him try and restore order to the nine realms.I enjoyed once again seeing these characters that I've grown to love and I was happy to see that this movie can be enjoyed as a complete story in its own right, not serving to be just a set up for the next Avengers movie.There is a healthy dose of well-timed humour, which helps to balance the otherwise dark overtones of the story. Performances are great all round, continuing the old world Shakespearean style of banter we have come to expect from Asgardians.I particularly loved some of the imagery seen on Asgard, seeing their world, how they live, watching Thor and Jane meander around the charming streets of this beautiful alien world.I felt Thor seemed somewhat underpowered in this outing, especially after seeing him topple cities with his hammer Mjolnir previously, but this may simply be a reflection of how powerful his adversaries are this time.What I did feel was weak were the 3D effects, so save yourself a buck or two and just watch it in a standard 2D digital screening unless you really want to see the extended Captain America Winter Soldier trailer which is attached to the 3D screening.Another homerun for Marvel, I strongly recommend you catch this on the big screen and, it goes almost without saying, stay right to the end of the credits as there may be more than one golden egg waiting for you.Check it out!Rating 8 out of 10FOR THIS AND OTHER REVIEWS CHECK OUT MAXIMUMEXTREME.NET",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Disappointing sequel,"After The Avengers, Marvel upped their game with their choices and started with some interesting storylines.

It's standard Marvel; I don't understand the hate,"From one-liners, to uninteresting villains, to throwaway side characters... This is the formula of most Marvel movies.

It's not particularly offensive in anyway, nor did I come out of it with a sour taste in my mouth. It's visually high budget, and the story is decent. I'd say Loki makes it for me, as every movie he's in I'm always interested to see what he does.

"Great action, hilarious comedy, and character improvement make this a hit","Thor: The Dark World is, in short, a hit. With a new and different threat, the battle takes place behind the lines, in wastelands, and on metropolis Earth, rather than the cold world and small town scene of the first film. Trickery, subtlety, and cunning take the place of brute force this time, and it's a good direction to take.The characters, for the large part now established, were furthered well. Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) was played well, but could have spoken up a great deal more near the end. It should have been more shocking when he finally spoke English, in fact I don't recall the exact moment he started.The action in this film was great, but skipped a few beats at times, which is forgivable this time with Loki's interchanges with Thor. Marvel did meet my expectations with intermittent comedy, once again. This sequel was full of it, and each time it was written and performed very well, and got a laugh from the whole audience.The movie is family-friendly except for fantasy violence, two moments of direct violence, partial nudity (a character is shown in public on television, but is thankfully censored), and less worrying details seen here. See it in 3D, see it in 2D, either works. 3D doesn't stand out, for better or worse. All in all, Thor: The Dark World is worth seeing in cinemas.P.S.

Now, the Dark Elves are looking for the Aether and plan to have a better attempt at conquering all. Can Thor and Jane stop them ? This film has very fine visuals and effects.

I liked it and a good addition to the saga but I thought the first one was better. This one just had something missing.,"""It's a different world. Maybe they were different for a reason."" Two Years after saving New Mexico, Thor (Hemsworth) still thinks often of Jane (Portman) and vice versa. After receiving familiar signals on her equipment Jane and crew check out the source. What they find not only reunites them with Thor but also endangers Earth, Asgard and the entire universe. Having no other choice they all must unite with the enemy they most despise in order to save everything and everyone. As many of you know by now I am not a huge comic book movie fan. I will say that of the entire Avengers saga the first Thor was my favorite movie. Due to that I had pretty high expectations for this one. I won't say I was disappointed because I did like it but I didn't think it was as good as the first one. They can only do the superhero saving Earth story so many times so with this one they added the threat to Thor's home world as well. Most of the movie takes place on Asgard so that aspect was nice and it did have a fair amount of comedy to keep it entertaining all the way through. There was just something missing in this one that the first one had. I don't know if it was because my expectations for this one were much higher then the original but I didn't have the same enjoyment from this one the other had. All that said though this is a good movie and worth watching, especially to continue the complete story of the saga. Overall, good movie but I didn't think it was as good as first one. As always don't forget to keep watching through the credits...there are two extra scenes! I give it a B.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Mindless entertainment at its best,"This movie is ridiculous, illogical, hollow and all that (as was the first one) but is simultaneously extremely well made, funny and entertaining. It has some better references to Star Wars (lasers, sounds), Star Trek (cloaking device) and Chronicles of Riddick (ships, SFX effects). It is all that a movie of this genre should be in the first place (and, for example, Green Lantern was not): an illusion of reality that entertains. No morals, no subtle messages. Plain simple, yet intelligent, script, fun, action (with destruction, of course), very good acting (considering the ""circumstances""; the casting was excellent), direction, editing and music. SFX is really superb and very convincing. This movie sort of sucks you in, relieving you of all the bad mood or frustrations you had before watching it. It delivers. It makes you sleep well afterward. Highly recommended for those moments when you need something to make you feel - ""this was made for me"". Now grab what you usually do before a (really) good movie and watch it. And have fun. People that made this movie did it for you, not just themselves :)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I liked it,"While definitely not better than the first one it has its moments. I'd watch this over the 3rd installment any day. Not sure why people are so down on this movie.

'MARVEL'lous,"When I saw the 1st part of Thor, I didn't have much knowledge of Greek mythology and I thought, since it was building up for a much bigger film(the Avengers), I liked it pretty much though it was like just another superhero film.Now that we have already seen The Avengers and also Ironman3, we know how big the things are going. And MARVEL does nothing wrong while bringing out this new Thor movie. It has all the fine elements of a MARVEL film. Comedy,suspense,action and also a surprise cameo(I'll say no more).This movie's story focuses on the power of Aether which was hidden from Black Elves by Odin's father. Then the story goes on about how Thor stops it from reaching the hands of evil Malekith when the Aether re-surfaces. The best part in the movie is the wry humour, the action of course and a little sentimental touch. And Loki also has a very interesting role in this one. The earth part adds a bit of scientific element to the mythology, thereby making it a complete package.MARVEL's bringing more and more great films with The Avengers franchise and also a good TV series (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D), so we fans are definitely not going to miss this one. And for those who haven't started with this, I advice you people to get MARVEL'D.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Loki: The Dark World,"For the Dark World, eight stars seems a bit high, however seven stars is definitely too low. Let me put the weakest elements of this film out first. Emotionally, this film rarely connects as much as the first film. Thor does not receive any noticeable development. Characters like Siv were underutilized and the villain was forgettable. The comedy dosage is a bit too high as well. In these ways, it falters behind the first movie.In other ways, in most other ways, this film is actually an improvement over the first. It's an all around solid film with good pacing and memorable scenes. I'm sure many people were glad to see a fully powered Thor for so much of the movie. The main attraction though is Loki, who, in tradition, steals all the scenes. In fact, Loki's character is written better than ever in this film. The rest of the movie which is at least good, pales in comparison to any scenes with him. There is a noticeable spike in writing quality when Loki is on screen. Thor is also at his best when interacting with Loki.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The visual effects are fantastic.I actually got the subtle homage(probably not intended) to Dr Who since Chris Eccleston was Dr Who once after all.I expected to be surprised, and was.

The World's in danger; let's laugh about it.,"As much as the action is intense and the special effects are stunning, the film - in my opinion - was ironically rather dull. There where a few things that made me lose concentration and interest in the film. For example in the middle of a big destruction filled scene, they try to make you laugh. Why? the whole purpose of an action scene is to become fixated on the screen, to hold your breath while chaos ensues. Not to make you laugh. But OK, the action scene resumes and it build and builds and then....yes they try to make you laugh again. And why? Well because when you strip back everything; when you retract the unnecessary comedy; when you holster the money making action scenes; the story is dull. So, they inject a lethal dose of comedy and romance to try and distract you. And hey, there's nothing wrong with adding comedy to give a more varied experience for the viewer, but doing it in the midst of a Malekith (the so called villain of the film; played admirably by Christopher Eccleston) attack is preposterous; all it does is undermine the fear factor that the villain is supposed to carry; he may as well have been wearing a t shirt saying ""i have no chance"". And it was constant; no real focus on the villain, just little bits here and there. Him and his cronies may as well have been at Santa's workshop preparing for Christmas.Let's build a ""monster"" of a villain and laugh him to death. The World's seemingly beginning it's end and unless you are a scientist you are running for your life. That's basically the story of the film, with also too much happening in it. In order for a superhero film to succeed it has to focus; although profits would disagree with me. But it is because of the special effects that people empty their pockets, to be in the cinema and hear the roar of Thor's hammer, the rumble of explosions. Not the story. Look at Batman's latest outing, three films focusing on the darker side of a superhero; it was simple, the villains where built to be feared. It stayed on track, and apart from one or two one liners in each film, there wasn't any need for comedy because the story was so good. Thor, like Iron Man, Like Avengers will always make money,they will always be blockbusters. But they are not solely superhero films, there is always another character who is just as important as the hero and that should not be the case; unless of course it is the villain and in this film there is no sign of that. The villain is vanilla and when you don't have a great villain, then the hero cannot reach greatness.Action was amazing but everything else was uninspiring.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"The Dark World finally marks the establishment of Thor as a true hero, facing an imminent threat in a darker context, without leaving aside the humor","While Iron Man 3 started the second phase of Marvel, with Tony having to deal with the consequences of the New York battle here on Earth and still having to face the scientist Aldrich Killian and the Extremis technology, it is time to see the god of Thunder having to deal with events after the first meeting of the Avengers. In this sequence, without having to worry about introducing the main characters, director Alan Taylor has the chance to go deeper and explore several aspects. The script continues to explore the relationship between the brothers Thor and Loki, since when Thor hands over Loki to become a prisoner in Asgard and especially when Thor is forced to convince Loki to ally himself to avenge his mother and save the universe from the threat of Malekith. The provocations, the anger, the rivalry, the lack of confidence and the action carried out by the brothers moves the film in several crucial moments.Other characters have more space, specifically in the core of London, such as Darcy (Kat Dennings) and Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård). Another one with greater prominence is Frigga (Rene Russo), wife of Odin and mother of Thor, with a much bigger participation and with extreme importance for the unfolding of the plot, we even see its potential using a sword. Even Odin (Anthony Hopkins) also plays a major role. Natalie Portman has a fundamental role in the plot. The actress manages to do well in humorous scenes and finally reunites with Thor, whom she had been waiting for two years. Jane Foster has the chance to go to Asgard, meet the beloved's parents and be the key to a great threat to the universe. Chris Hemsworth, even more at ease in the character, concludes Thor's maturation, from inconsequential to hero (it is noted in the lines of his final scene). Meanwhile, Tom Hiddleston is flawless again in Loki's shoes.Even more at ease, sarcastic, unpredictable and probably the biggest highlight of the feature, taking a little of the highlight including the antagonist Malekith, played by Christopher Eccleston, just correct in the character. Once again the Asgardian warriors were misused, especially Sif (Jaimie Alexander). A mention was even made of the love triangle between her, Jane and Thor, but this sub-plot was simply left out.Other characters have more space, specifically in the core of London, such as Darcy (Kat Dennings) and Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård). Another one with greater prominence is Frigga (Rene Russo), wife of Odin and mother of Thor, with a much bigger participation and with extreme importance for the unfolding of the plot, we even see its potential using a sword. Even Odin (Anthony Hopkins) also plays a major role. Natalie Portman has a fundamental role in the plot.Well-designed action scenes. All the scenes that show the convergence between the galaxies through portals are well elaborated, in addition to great action scenes, such as the invasion of the Black Elves in their spaceships in Asgard that originated great sequences with the escape of Thor, Loki, Jane and his allies, thus disobeying Odin's express order. We also have the action sequences in the Dark World and even the final scenes in London (Greenwich) when the alignment of the universes was about to occur.On the technical side, production designer Charles Wood and photographer Kramer Morgenthau also did a great job, especially in rebuilding Asgard. Previously shown as a technological society, with a clean and futuristic design, but very artificial, being built almost entirely in computer graphics, it has modifications, especially in scenes with more closed plans. With a bigger budget in hand, the team can portray Asgard being a little more realistic, more medieval and more ""dirty"" in his look, giving the kingdom a more realistic look, giving the impression that people really live there. Even due to the threat presented, other kingdoms can be seen, unlike the first film. In addition to Asgard and Midgard (Earth), we see the dark world of Svartalfheim, the original home of the Black Elves, Vanaheim (home of the Hogun family, lived by Tadanobu Asano), and yet Jotunheim (home of the first giant ice giants) and others from the Nine Realms.Thor: The Dark World finally marks the establishment of Thor as a true hero, facing an imminent threat in a darker context, within the most magical and fantastical universe of the character, without leaving aside the humor, a hallmark of Marvel's productions . And there is an important post-credit scene for future Marvel films, with a character present in the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" universe, which promises to be one of the most electrifying films to come.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
great fun and exciting superhero movie,"Dark Elves are an ancient nemesis to Asgard. Their leader Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) tried to use Aether to send the universe into darkness. In a great battle, the Dark Elves were routed, Malekith managed to escape and Asgard buried the Aether beyond use. It's many years later in the present day. Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is imprisoned. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is fighting to bring order back to the nine realms. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) is alone on Earth since Thor left her in New Mexico 2 years ago. She's now in London with her intern Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings) who in turns has her own intern. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård) has gone a little crazy and very naked. Jane is doing research on an anomaly which Asgard and the Dark Elves call Convergence. She gets sent through a wormhole to Svartalfheim where she's impregnated with all the Aether. Thor brings Jane back to Asgard despite Odin (Anthony Hopkins)'s disapproval.This is a lighter and jokier affair. Its broad jokes delivered mostly by Kat Dennings playing the traditional best friend rom-com role to Natalie Portman. Portman continues to be a weak point in this franchise. It's more her Jane Foster character who really lacks consistent chemistry and reason for their love affair. This is a love that spans the universe and I can't explain it other than they're both played by really gorgeous human specimens.The best parts are that the world of Asgard is expanded more. It's not just a set but a real place now. The movie gives a real sense of it. Also Thor and Loki expands their relationship. Their brotherly rivalry is deeper this time and Loki is set to become a big Marvel character in the future. Malekith is a slight disappointment as the villain. Quite frankly, all the usual fun villainy characteristics are given to Loki while Malekith is merely a one dimensional plot device. Malekith is really only a secondary character and maybe that's a good thing. The battles are great. The final battle is thrilling with a lot of fun. That's how I would describe the movie as a whole.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A Marvel Masterpiece,"Having watched Thor and The Avengers I was curious to see what they would come up with in Thor: The Dark World. Having watched the movie I can only say, the filmmakers did not disappoint. Thor: The Dark World is an epic, action-filled roller-coaster ride from the beginning to the very end. The film does not take itself too serious which is why the story works so well and is such fun to watch. After now three movies Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston seem to live and breath their characters and Hiddleston once more steals the show as Loki.

Thor and Loki show,"With the main Marvel players established as film franchises. Marvel turned to their second tier with Thor and Captain America, if their desire to make the Avengers film was to become a real possibility.Kenneth Branagh was entrusted to get Thor of the ground. The Shakespearean actor and director was a left field choice that turned out to be an inspired and bold move.Now with the sequel, we go back to the land of Tolkienism with elves and the age of darkness. Before the reign of 'Odin' (Anthony Hopkins) the Dark Elves were led by 'Malekith' (Christopher Eccleston) who craved the energy source called 'Aether.'Although Malkieth was initially unsuccessful a rare convergence means he can begin his task again to grab this energy source so he can destroy once again.It is up to Thor to stop him and he might need to get Loki to assist him. The action moves from Asgard to Greenwich which seems the London location of choice for many US blockbusters in the last few years. Loki making his third appearance in a Marvel film get the best lines, Eccleston the actor responsible for the relaunch of Doctor Who gets little to do or show his skill because Loki has all the focus.The film despite its action, special effects and CGI is just average.

"Tons of Fun, But Just as Boring as Thor (2011)","Thor: The Dark World journies into mystery as the Marvel Cinematic Universe expands throughout Phase Two. Replacing Kenneth Branagh, Alan Taylor takes over as director to helm Thor's second solo adventure.Working to restore peace among the nine realms following the destruction of the Rainbow Bridge, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) finally puts an end to the chaos. Paying for his crimes on Asgard & Earth, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) finds himself locked in an Asgardian prison. After stumbling upon the Ether, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) awakens the leader of the Dark Elves, Malekith (Christopher Eccleston). Forced to team up with his brother once more, Thor & Loki have to put their differences aside to save the realm they love.For years, Thor: The Dark World claimed the unfavorable spot of 'Worst MCU Film' and, while one of them has to hold that unfortunate position, I do have a soft spot for this film. Thor: TDW is a lot of fun and although it does make jokes at nearly every possible moment, most of the land. There are some great emotional moments, that truly feel emotional and they are given the proper time to breathe rather than rushing to the next gag. While it starts rather slow with more expositional narration, Odin (Sir Anthony Hopkins) is reliably enjoyable in his role. Thor & Loki's relationship is always a high point of any film and the side characters get fleshed out a bit more than they were in the original. The action sequences are fun and exciting, especially the climax and its utilization of a 'Portals' scenario.Staying rooted in its serious and slightly boring nature, the issues with Thor (2011) echo in its sequel. I do believe there are improvements here, but I believe they don't do enough for the franchise. Thor: The Dark World provides memorable, emotional moments, but being held down by its tonal issues, it falls into the same problems as its predecessor.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Mediocre movie that is somehow the most essential,"Thor: The Dark WorldMarvel continues their Post-Avengers team up movie phase with Thor: The Dark World. After Iron Man 3 before, this movie allows us to resume Thor's solo story, but with some continuity to the other films thus keeping the audience aware of the larger story.The problems with mysticism and magical abilities from alien creatures are there are no rules to go by. When we last left Thor, he was unable to travel back to earth of see Jane again, yet he was able to inexplicably go there for the Avengers. There was a half hearted attempt to show that Jane was kept out of the way for that movie, but her character returns in The Dark World, still trying to reconnect to Thor.After locking Loki up after the events in the Avengers, Thor and the Asgardians have already repaired the Bifrost so traveling between the realms can happen, yet he still does not go to Jane, as he claims to desire. Jane, with D'Arcy and her new ""intern"", accidentally discover a way to travel between the realms. Jane, also accidentally, absorbs a substance known as the aether when on said travels. Dr. Selvig, after the Avengers, is now in a psych ward.In the standard ""people don't talk to each other therefore here's a plot"" trope, Jane is now infected with the Aether that is naturally desired by nearly everyone in the 9 realms. Had Thor returned to earth when he could, none of this would happen, and a very serious death could have been avoided.Loki gets a very fun piece of character development, but it still enacts a toll on him that always leaves the viewer guessing as to how he is dealing with it. His work with illusions makes it difficult to know what he is truly feeling.I think the problem I really had with this movie is that a ton of negative consequences come about simply because Thor is too much of a wuss to go back to see Jane after the events of the first movie. Literally none of the Infinity War would have happened if not for that cowardly act. If the filmmakers intended to use a metaThor (see what I did there?) to explain that minor choices could lead to catastrophic consequences, then they were certainly successful. However, at the time, those consequences would not have been obvious, and may not have been planned out yet, so I don't want to give too much credit.This film finally brings up the terms ""infinity stones"" and uses them to describe both the Tesseract and the Aether. Both of these artifacts are then deposited with ""The Collector"", Taneleer Tivan, a name more associated with the Guardians of the Galaxy.Stan Lee's cameo happens in Dr. Selvig's psych ward, and it involves a shoe.It's one of the more forgettable films in basic premise, but it is single handedly the most important film in the Infinity War saga. This is a dichotomy difficult to wrap one's head around.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Thor: The Dark World,"Alan Taylor picks up where Sir Kenneth Branagh left off and delivers a dark, more menacing, action adventure with ""Thor"" (Chris Hemsworth) having to thwart the aspirations of the dark elves led by ""Malekith"" (Christopher Eccleston). The elves are desperate to obtain the ""Aether"" - a source of unspeakable power. Meantime, ""Jane"" (Natalie Portman) and an increasingly off the rails ""Selvig"" (Stellan Skarsgård) are on Earth continuing their search for a way to communicate with Asgard again. When she accidentally gets sucked into a wormhole, she becomes a target for the evil elf, and after he conquers Asgard, all nine worlds are at risk of being subsumed into perpetual darkness. As with the first film, there is humour here - there is chemistry on screen between Tom Hiddleston's untrustworthy ""Loki"" and Hemsworth, as between him and Portman. Skarsgård seems to spend a fair amount of the film in his underpants, and it all happens under the sparingly delivered gaze of Sir Anthony Hopkins. The story is good, and forgetting for a moment that Eccleston is not (remotely), this makes for an enjoyable to watch film that remains completely detached from the Marvel/SHIELD series and it should be appreciated for that too.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Good for a Sci-Fi Channel StarTrek Knockoff,"I thoroughly enjoyed the first Thor. It was better than expected and was not an entirely by the numbers hero movie. This one, on the other hand, is not only a cliché soap opera movie, but confused as what it wants to be.Half the beginning forces rom-com background music on us & the other half is full of ironic quips & other shenanigans that belong in a Jim Carrey film.The story, villain, and connectivity to The Avengers is laughable and the cliché humanoid 60's Star Trek aliens take you out of the movie.This should have been a home run but it's quite disappointing if looking at it objectively and not as a drooling Avengers fanboy.I admit some plot twist had me excited for moments and the acting was solid.Too much Whiny sidekick girl & black swan chick but 4/10 is being generous either way.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Tries to be too much like Avengers and Iron Man,"Lightning does not strike twice with the follow up to 2011's THOR. Thor The Dark World does not live up to the standard set by its predecessor. Although it ups the ante with the action, it lacks that personal focus of the first movie. Thankfully, a stellar cast and amazing chemistry saves the movie from falling into mindless blockbuster territory.With a combined movie universe, it begs the question of how come other heroes do not appear to intervene in the various world shattering crises that other heroes face in their individual movies. THOR: THE DARK WORLD provides just such an explanation by setting most of its action off earth. After the events of AVENGERS, Thor leads an Asgardian force to bring peace back to the 9 realms. On earth Jane Foster, Thor's love interest from the first film, stumbles on an anomalous place with portals that transports items, and herself, to another world; the so called ""Dark World"". There, she unwittingly bonds with an ancient weapon of tremendous power called the Aether. This alerts the evil Dark Elves, technologically advanced ancient enemies of Asgard, and their leader Malekith.As villains go, Malekith and his Dark elves are no where as memorable as one would have hoped. Like a crossbreed of LORD OF THE RINGS's Uruk-Hai with STAR WAR's Sith Lords and Clone Troopers. They have superpowered ""Kursed"" warriors, who are like Berserkers on steroids, they have space age technology centered around the manipulation of gravity (and novel use of mini-black hole grenades); all these are quite cool but seem to clash with the more fantasy-tech of Asgard. Malekith himself is a one note villain who is out to destroy all realms. Zero depth, zero development. Then again, what do you expect? He is not the star of this movie.What Thor The Dark World succeeds very much in is its world building. It crafts and expands upon the Marvel movie universe, adding much needed history and depth to the people of Asgard. This depth extends to the characters; this time focused mainly on the relationship between Thor, Loki and their parents. While Chris Hemsworth does a marvellous job as a heroic yet humble Thor, Tom Hiddelston is magnificent as Loki. He just oozes nuance in his performance, portraying the trickster as a truly tormented soul torn between the love for his mother and the hatred for his brother. You never know his true intentions or where his loyalties lie. If anything, this is more of a Loki movie than a Thor movie where your tragic villain outshines the titular character, stealing every scene he is in.Sadly, this leads to all the problems inherent in the movie. THOR: THE DARK WORLD has a great story. Yet its execution is muddled in direction and its general look and feel. Also, its character development is almost non existent except for Loki. As it opens up the Marvel cinematic universe into the far reaches of space age science fiction, the whole thing feels very much like the ""Star Wars"" prequels. High speed chases in space ships accompany the ever present laser guns, cloaking technology and plasma turrets. That sequence where Thor and Loki escape a blockaded Asgard with Jane just reeks of a similar scene in STAR WARS EPISODE 1.Then there are the romance and comedy. For most of the movie you have Thor and Jane pinning for each other like teenage love birds. Once together, they clearly look like they should be in love yet there is feeling of ""fakeness"" to their romance. Thankfully such scenes are few, with the focus on bigger action. In this department, the movie does not disappoint. The action is clearly of an epic scale and the stakes are high. Yet the movie sees fit to throw in as much inappropriate humor as possible into such heavy scenes. The humor just does not fit and in fact pulls us out of the moments. Moments where reality itself is crumbling and a character cracks a joke just feels like Disney at work again, killing another chance to take comic book superheroes seriously.Alas THOR: THE DARK WORLD is not a bad movie, it is good. It is just not as good as the first THOR movie, and this is likely due to executive meddling trying to get all new Marvel movies to follow the tone of Avengers. In trying to squeeze different types of stories into a single mold (no doubt to further cement their shared universe concept), you kill what made the concept great to begin with. Gone is Patrick Doyle's unique and spirit lifting symphony replaced by Brian Tyler's disappointing rehash of his CHILDREN OF DUNE soundtrack spliced with LORD OF THE RINGS and (believe it or not) Marvel's AVENGERS.In a similar vein, gone is what made THOR unique to begin with. It may not be a typical mindless blockbuster, but it is becoming a typical Marvel movie. Like Iron Man 3, like Avengers, and quite possible like all subsequent marvel movies; chock full of comedy, big action and cartoon style dialogue with no effort to try and take superheroes seriously or to craft a deep themed tale of costumed vigilantes gifted with awesome powers.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Perfect Follow-up,"Thor: The Dark World is an ideal example of how a super-hero sequel should be done, it steps up the action, the emotions and the stakes.Thor 1 was a good super-hero film it was the minimum it should be but Dark World steps it up a notch it has an excellent story showing more of the Asguardian universe than ever before. It, like Iron Man 3(which i personally didn't like), shows the affects the Avengers had on the hero and their supporting characters.Now when I saw Loki in the trailer I thought that he wouldn't play any part at all in the story and he was only there to bank in on his likability but I was wrong he does belong in the film and wouldn't be right without him.I would recommend seeing this film massively to anybody who loves adventure (my second favorite Marvel film after the avengers)P.S Christopher Eccelston, yet again, makes an excellent villain.P.P.S If you do go and see it heads up there is 2 after credit sequences so make sure you sit through ALL of it",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A cosmic battle with mixed results,"""Thor: The Dark World,"" directed by Alan Taylor, attempts to expand the Marvel Cinematic Universe by delving deeper into Norse mythology and cosmic conflicts. Chris Hemsworth returns as the mighty Thor, facing off against the ancient dark elf Malekith (Christopher Eccleston), who seeks to plunge the universe into darkness using a powerful weapon known as the Aether.The film offers visually stunning landscapes and impressive special effects, particularly in the otherworldly realms of Asgard and Svartalfheim. The action sequences are grand and engaging, showcasing Thor's strength and heroism. However, the plot feels somewhat disjointed, and Malekith, as the villain, lacks the depth and charisma seen in previous Marvel antagonists.Tom Hiddleston's Loki continues to steal the show, adding layers of complexity and charm to the story. His dynamic with Thor provides some of the film's most compelling moments. Despite its flaws, ""Thor: The Dark World"" delivers entertainment and sets the stage for future Marvel adventures, but it doesn't quite reach the heights of its predecessor.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Style Over Substance: The Movie,"Oh was that not the name of the movie? Could have fooled me that's for sure.When people talk about this movie they often talk about how great it looks, well the budget is 170 000 000 dollars so OF COURSE it looks good.It would take the biggest idiot on earth not to be able to make it look good with that big of a budget, just hire a great director of photography, set director and CGI artists and everything will fall into place... Visually.To get it right story-wise and acting-wise of course requires a little more finesse which in reality is not the movies strong parts if we're being realistic here.The plot is messy and throw random sci fi logic (with very little actual logic) and events around like they are sprinkling an ice cream and not really seeing the full picture of what story they are trying to convey, random transportation ports and monsters for instance is very convenient to say the least.And the acting, oh no, Nathalie Portman who I usually like a lot does the definition of a phoned in performance clearly just doing the movie for the money and the rest of the cast is not that much better.But who cares about plot and acting in a Marvel movie right? Clearly not that many considering the high rating (of currently 7.1).If people asked for more than just a stylish movie and didn't sucker in just because a movie looks good and has cool action scenes then perhaps we would have gotten a little more substance to it, but clearly that is not a lot of people's priorities which is unfortunate.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Surprisingly good,"Let's start by saying that I'm a big Marvel fan and I'm loving what they are doing with this film series. Having said that, the first Thor film was a little 'meh'. I'm glad to say this one improves on it in every possible sense. It starts off slow but builds into an engaging and thoroughly enjoyable story.The story is pretty good for a film that makes no logical sense, the characters are well-developed, the action is excellent, the script is good and the jokes are amusing throughout. There is less overacting and the overly Shakespearian language has been toned down a bit, but still present as it should be. And I'm glad to say that there is only one moment for girls to swoon over a shirtless Chris Hemsworth.The CGI and effects were excellent but, for an effects-driven film, they were almost overshadowed by the quiet intense moments between Loki, Odin and Thor. The acting was solid throughout from pretty much every cast member, Hemsworth doing a good job as the hero, Tom Hiddleston and Anthony Hopkins with solid performances and Ecclestone excellent as the menacing villain, even if his motivations and plan don't make much sense.The most surprising thing about this film was its successful attempts to be funny. It could almost be called an action-comedy, with many laugh- out-loud moments. A film that is fairly dark, hence the title, but still doesn't take itself too seriously. There are missteps; I might be the only one who didn't realise that Charing Cross isn't 3 stops from Greenwich, and frankly I didn't care, it was still an amusing sceneThe film itself is littered with Easter eggs and references to other Marvel characters and films, which make it very enjoyable for fans of the comics. The best part of this film was the ending, with a few huge reveals, teases and WTF moments for anyone with knowledge of the comic books. This is simply a well-made superhero film, possibly one of the best ever. Certainly one of the best films of this year.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Brings togheter all the MCU's problems,"Usually when someone wants to criticize the MCU they turn to this movie. Thor the Dark World brings together all the usual problems of the universe's repetitive formula: the forced and dreadful story, the annoying humor, the bland villain, etc.While in the previous movie we saw a lot of character development this time arround Thor barely has an arc, although it was kind of cool to watch him as a badass. The best aspect of the movie is Loki, literally every scene he's in he absolutly crushes it. Thor's relationship with Jane was satisfying to watch but not explored enough. Much of this is due to the misuse of Jane's character.Despite all the narrative problems this film has great action as well as a good soundtrack and effects. It's safe to say that you're on to a decent adventure.All in all, this film shows us the problem of producing movies just for contractual duties, it can be fun and exciting at times but the substance will always be lacking...",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Superior Fun,"Chris Hemsworth again becomes the focus of the Marvel saga. This is a delightful feast for the eyes and a masterful story. I'm an old guy and my tastes run all over the place, but I was taken in from he start As I've said before, people are taking their times with these films, not throwing out some cheap sequel to get a quick buck. Once again the setup is very well done. Loki is in prison in what looks like the city zoo. He rests in squalor, waiting his turn to return to power. He is a master of misdirection and disguise, so we never know when we can trust him. The answer, of course, is never. Still, for me, he is the most engaging of all the characters. He is a perpetual thorn in the side of everyone. He is the incarnation of the true Norse character, the trickster. The plot is really interesting. Ultimately, we must get to earth because all the adventure above the ground becomes a bit distant to us mortals. The researchers, including Natalie Portman's character (who has fallen big time for Thor and he for her), continue to try to figure out a way to understand the workings of this netherworld. An array of fun characters, most carried over from the first film as well as the Avengers, parry and thrust their way. Despite the grave consequences of their actions and those of the gods, there is a great deal of tongue in cheek humor and surprising twists that make it more than a bunch of characters trying to beat each other to a pulp. This is a very engaging film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not that Good,"The movie offers a great fictional realm (Asgard) it is so rich and unique, but the improper cast of the movie often remind us that it is fake. I'm not talking about Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddelson or God forbid Anthony Hopkins those guys are well casted and did their jobs well. The story of Thor is based of the scandinavic myths and songs and in the movie Thor more or less acts as a viking and looks like one too everything in Asgard is made to mimic the Scandinavian culture or perception of Asgard after all thats where the sourse is from and it is such a bummer when you see that Heimdall is cast as black nothing against Idris Elba great actor but thats not how Scandinavians describe it in their songs thats not how it is even in the comic book sourse and what about Thour's gang one of them fights with rapier the other one is Asian thanks god he does not fight with nunchaku although that would make more sense.

"""Well done, you just decapitated your grandfather!""","A powerful, ancient force known as the Aether is uncovered on Earth and finds its way into an unsuspecting host, Dr. Jane Foster. Thor takes Jane to Asgard for answers and help. Unbeknownst to anyone in Asgard (or in the rest of the Universe for that matter), the reemergence of the Aether has woken Malekith, a Dark Elf intent on gaining the Aether's power. He'll destroy all of Asgard if need be to get what he wants. As expected, it's up to Thor to save Jane, Asgard, and all of creation.Overall, Thor: The Dark World (or Thor 2 as I'll call it for the rest of this) is an entertaining film. It has a few problems that keep me from calling it one of Marvel's best, but it's not a bad movie. Despite most of what I'm about to write sounding negative, I'm rating Thor 2 a 7/10. I honestly like the movie.There are at least three things in Thor 2 that could have been better. First, the relationship between Jane and Thor has about as much life as a dead fish. There's no spark or chemistry that I could feel. It reminded me of another ill-fated on-screen romance featuring Natalie Portman - Padme and Anakin. The on-screen chemistry isn't helped by Portman's acting. It seemed obvious to me that Portman would have rather have been just about anywhere other than making another Thor movie. She looked disinterested in the whole thing. Second, the plot is thin and never really drew me in the way I'd hoped. Maybe others felt different, but it just didn't work on me. Maybe it was the villain that I didn't find engaging or Portman's off-putting performance or events I the movie that required huge amounts of exposition - whatever, the plot was a weak point for me. Third, Thor 2 could have been better with more Loki. For me, the highlight of both Thor movies has been Tom Hiddleston as Loki. He's so good. I'm not sure what kind of plot the MCU folks could come up with, but I would love to see a stand-alone Loki movie. How awesome would that be!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

You also see that Loki has true heart felt feelings for his mother and brother which is not seen in Thor 1 or the Avengers. I laughed several times during the movie which was great considering the heavy subject line.The only drawback to the movie is the overly ""comic book"" and ""superhero"" feel to the story.

A Worthy Sequel Full of Action and Intrigue,"""Thor: The Dark World"" is a worthy sequel that picks up where the first film left off and takes viewers on a thrilling adventure filled with action and intrigue.Chris Hemsworth once again delivers a standout performance as Thor, bringing both strength and vulnerability to his character as he faces new challenges and battles to save the Nine Realms.

"There's no color left, nor fun","They took all that was good of Thor, sapped all of the color out of it, clothed it in darkness, and grounded it in a more recognizable reality. That process made it so much more boring.Gone are the operatic tones and performances. Gone are scenes of father and son yelling at each other over big things in large sets with bright colors. Instead we get father and son arguing under their breaths about things in dark rooms with ""realistic"" performances. It's such a drab drag of a film.First we get a prologue about the Dark Elves who fought Asgardians five thousand years before when the Dark Elves tried to put the entire universe into darkness. They, of course, failed, and will surely never be mentioned again. Just ahead 5,000 years, and it's two years after Thor had visited Earth, and some undetermined amount of time after Thor had his little adventure in New York, the nine realms have been thrown into chaos and Thor helps to tamp down on rebellions and plunderings. Thor has succeeded enough that now there is talk of him returning to Earth for the first time since the last time he went to Earth and didn't see his sort of girlfriend Jane Foster.Jane Foster, in order to justify her mere presence in the movie, falls into a random hole that takes her directly to where the aether is, the mystical substance that was going to darken the universe at the hands of the Dark Elves five thousand years prior. The aether inhabits her and sends her back to Earth. It is unclear if this was a random occurrence or if the aether is somehow intelligent with agency (I'm leaning towards random since the aether does nothing else on its own in the film). Thor takes her back to Asgard where the Asgardians are amazed by the aether's presence but have no idea what to do. The only one who knows what to do are the Dark Elves (Surprise! They're back!), who have been in hibernation for the past five thousand years and wake up that very day. Probably because they have some sort of aether detecting peace of fantasy tech that can detect the substance across vast distances instantaneously. Or, they came out of hibernation a couple of days before the event from five thousand years before is going to repeat. Or something. The Dark Elves and their motives are really unclear.I'm sorry. This movie was tough to sit through. It's garbage from beginning to end. The plot doesn't matter because it makes no sense. Much like Iron Man 2, I was left constantly asking myself as I watched, ""What is the story of this movie?"" I mean, what's Thor's emotional journey in this? It seems like it's actually about his relationship with Loki, but Loki disappears for more than an hour, having nothing to do with the movie at all for almost two-thirds of the film's runtime. The Dark Elf plot feels like a serial adventure while the stuff with Loki (which was added late in the process after people loved him in The Avengers) is the actual meat of the emotional journey. It's a rather stark juxtaposition. But even then, the ""meat"" is given almost no real time to develop before Loki ""dies"" again and we're off to the film's climax.Now, I'm not one to nitpick things not conforming to reality, or even to a film's own established rules on smaller things. My focus is on character and theme. If those things are going well, I tend to be more forgiving of stupid nonsense. However, when the basic tenets of storytelling are being shredded through sheer incompetence, these bits of idiocy bug me more and more. For instance, the portals that seem to follow no rules whatsoever and become so important late in the movie. Well, they don't follow any discernable logic. I think that's the point, but when fights to the death turn based on this randomness, it doesn't feel like randomness, it feels like a screenwriter trying to be clever while also giving his characters easy outs of tough situations.This makes me kind of sad. Thor was one of the bright spots of Phase 1, and Thor: The Dark World is probably the worst movie of the franchise.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"I've got the aether, nothing can stop me now. Oh...","I can't lie, I enjoyed watching the film. The great special effects, especially at first when the dark elf (yeah, that happened) space shuttles attacked Asgaard, the ridiculously cool Idris Elba, Loki's tricks, Thor's pathetic heroism and Stellan's craziness, the native brutality that Eccleston can radiate with so much ease (screw Doctor Who, I'll just destroy everything, LOL!), they all had something to do with it.But the story was not good, there so many holes in it that Swiss cheese would laugh at it. I don't want to spoil the movie, but in retrospect, Odin's plan was a lot better than what Thor did, not to mention the effect it had in the end. Jane's character is a helpless damsel in distress, although considering the other protagonists, it actually made sense. Thor's friends started cool, but then they ended up less than support characters. Thor himself does nothing but speak with a really deep voice and look pretty. Odin seems fickle and mean, I guess being king of the universe does that to anyone. Renee Russo is a queen, her character made the most sense to me.If one character stole the spotlight, it had to be Idris Elba's. He freaking destroyed an invisible space shuttle by jumping on it and stabbing it! Thor just swung his phallic symbol around. It was nice to see science triumph (after all, it always does) but the mambo jumbo spear like thingies that detect and also cause stuff were really too much.Chris O'Dowd is in this film, too. He is right in his element, as Malekith wanted to restart the universe to fix things, as it were, but has a really small role. Benicio del Toro appears as the mysterious collector at the end (wait until after the first credits to see him). He looks really cool. And if we are to praise the support characters, Zachary Levi looked interesting as the calm gentlemanish swordsman with great skill. Perhaps an offshoot of Thor, featuring Thor's friends rather than himself, would be a good idea, no?Also, after all the credits there is a funny scene with the Gwoemul- like monster that people forgot on Earth. Yeah, kudos if you were wondering what happened to it in the end :)Bottom line: you can make a thousand How It Should Have Ended parodies after this film, but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it. It hurts to think of the exquisite beauty the graphics people created for a movie that had the story of a fairy tale book for three year olds and how much more coolness a great story would have gotten out of the film. Too bad three year olds seem to be a target demographic for the American film industry.

Why Such a Low Average Rating?,"""Thor: The Dark World"" surprised me. I hadn't seen the movie in forever and was just getting around to it while rewatching the MCU. This movie is underrated. The only real problem I have with it is the villain. In my opinion, this would have easily been the standout of all eight MCU films that had been released to this point. Excellent performances by Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Anthony Hopkins, and Tom Hiddleston. The best special effects in the franchise to this point. A great cosmic plot that follows up immediately after the events of ""The Avengers."" Some great character development for Thor, Loki, and Jane Foster.Again, it's the villain that sours the movie for me. Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) does not have a character at all. I love the idea of his scheme, colliding the Nine Realms together to wipe them out. A god hero needs a cataclysmic event to stop; this isn't Tony Stark or Peter Parker we're talking about. It's just a shame that Malekith and the Dark Elves get next to nothing, very similar to the Frost Giants from the first ""Thor.""Could have been much better, but I still think even then that it's severely underrated for what it delivers on.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Thor: The Dark World - 6.3/10,"1. Overall Plot - 3/10
Focusing a lot more on Jane Foster in this is what killed it for me. It's just not anything exciting that makes you care about it. And the idea of Jane finding the Aether is just stupid and unbelievable. This plot is very forgettable.I really love how we get to see Thor and Loki working together. They're dynamic is super entertaining to watch.2. Entertainment / Engagement - 5/10
The overall plot is super boring and not entertaining at all. The big fight scenes also aren't that cool and entertaining. The last fight has some very interesting stuff to watch with all of the portal things.But Thor and Loki working together is very entertaining to watch, and I enjoy that bit a lot. I also enjoyed watching Thor interact with all the other characters, since they've all been previously introduced.3. Emotion / Investment in Story - 6/10
We see a lot of emotion in this. All if the characters relationships with each other are developed a lot in this movie.The story kind of coming out of no where and not really being believable makes it hard to get invested in it, even a little bit.4. Theme and Depth of Story - 4/10
I really couldn't think of a good theme in this one. Maybe just Thor's relationships with other people. Jane Foster especially.The movie as a whole isn't very deep. But there is a lot of depth with Loki and his relationship with Thor. And also they develop Thor and Jane's relationship a lot more.5. Characters - 6/10
I love how they gave Loki more of a role in this. His character is very intriguing. I also enjoyed how they gave the warriors three more screen time. They are very cool characters. I also love how we get more Heimdall in this movie. He is a very cool character.Jane Foster is just not anyone to care for. And Darcy is even more annoying. I also think they ruined the character of Erik Selvig. It does make a little sense why, but not completely. Because Clint Barton is just fine after being controlled by Loki. But to be fair, Selvig was a being controlled a lot longer.6. Acting / Writing - 9/10
All the acting is very good. Especially Tom Hiddleston as Loki. He is very good. I also love how Zachary Levi is in this film as Fandral. And wish we got more of him. And Natalie Portman is pretty mediocre.7. Cinematography - 6/10
There were some very cool shots in this that I actually really liked. And the big, grand shots of Asgard are very cool.I just don't like how dark this film is. The whole film just feels cloudy, which makes it less entertaining to watch.8. Score - 10/10
I really enjoyed the music in this. It was really good. It sounded very similar to the music in Avengers. It has a very epic feel to it.9. Editing / Pace - 8/10
The editing is very good. Especially the last fight scene. It is edited in a very cool and entertaining way.The pacing is OK. It is already a shorter movie, but at times feels like it is dragging on.10. VFX/Practical Effects - 7/10

Hammer can't break the anvil.,"I wanted to give this sequel a shot as the two attempts I tried with the first movie failed miserably to please but I had heard from a friend that this one is different, I know not how..From the beginning we have a poor plot, like most Marvel movies. For some reasons, Dark futuristic space Elves want to wipe out the world that they failed eons ago. Taking too much out of the great battle of the Lord The Rings, the Elves are broken and exiled, promising to return with a weapon to destroy and rule all life *cough one ring*Meanwhile somewhere else in the space time spectrum, Thor and his cliché mundane battle brethren who seem as out of place as the swords and axes with their stupid cross over space ships, grenades and guns, are waging war with other.. things not explained.Returning after certain victory with Thor on their side, our Northen hero in space gets an itch that tells him that whats her face, Jane I think, comes into danger by stupidly touching an alien and obviously evil substance. Oddly enough she isn't abducted by a secret American syndicate, something I thought was definitely going to happen with this plot but alas, it's more simple.Jane is brought to Valhalla as they are the ones to remove said evil substance where we are sadly subjected to Hokins horrible over acting( a shame), Loki being as ordinary as ever( really we have seen this character in a lot of movies, The black sheep of the ruling family intent on taking it over)Loki is in jail, Loki is suddenly not in jail, fight between siblings, more fights, more fights in more stupid sword and gun cross overs, fights on Earth and some professor without pants, obviously a Stan lee cameo ( the only laugh) and more fighting with a nice little boring love moment, all wrapped up in a foreseeable and weak excuse for a plot twist.Pretty visuals... that's really about it that's worth it. I was sad to see Chris D in it. I really just wish movies with such a huge budget put money to novels or more thought out comics with better plots and less stupid content.Thor had great visuals, Decent enough typical blockbuster action and an Australian. 3/10",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Thor just ain't that magical,"While it's not the best of the Marvel movies, it's still pretty fun. Loki has a bigger part and 90% of the movie takes place on Asgard. The sets are just amazing. While the opening sequence and most of the movie feels like Lord of the Rings in both cinematography and plot, that's not necessarily a bad thing.It definitely helps with the mythology elements of the film. The plot is a bit slow, though.

""","From the superb minds of Don Payne, Stan Lee and director Alan Taylor comes this next chapter in the life of the Mythical Norse God, Thor (Chris Hemsworth). We learn that Odin, (Anthony Hopkins) the King of the Viking Gods has discovered the Dark Elves have once again retrieved their Ancient power called the Aether and the Elves believed it's time to destroy Asgard with it. Thor believes his love interest Jane Forter (Natalie Portman) safeguards the power within her and it's up to him to want it destroyed before his new enemy Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) can use it to kill his father, destroy Asgard and Earth too. So with the unlikely help of his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) Thor confronts his enemies and engages in a gigantic battle. The movie is a lot easier to follow this time and all the best of CGI and the Special Effects teams do their utmost to entertain the audience with tremendous Action, adventure and magically moments. It a high flying movie and one which does it's level best to keep us glued to the ground while it goes whizzing around the world. It succeed in many way and I concur. It's fabulous in its story and marvelous in it's result. It trill us to the max and well worth, time and effort. As a result, it becomes a high flying, world destroying, titanic battle Classic of the first caliber. Recommended to all. ****",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Boring and mediocre,"Thor The Dark World is a very boring MCU flick. The villain is boring and forgettable, the plot is meh, and the scenes on earth are very uninteresting. However the action sequences are fun and the special effects are good, and Anthony Hopkins is fantastic in this film. But overall Thor The Dark World is boring and mediocre.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Marvel does it again!,"After MARVEL'S THE AVENGERS, IRON MAN 3 aired into theaters. My friends thought it would be a disappointment. I had different thoughts. IRON MAN 3 looked very different than the other Marvel movies. I went to the theaters to see if my friends were right.IRON MAN 3 was amazing. Shane Black did an amazing job. Robert Downey Jr. was remarkably great in this film. He did something that he didn't do in the other IRON MAN movies. Overall, the movie was unique and funny at some moments. Then, THOR: THE DARK WORLD came out...I didn't get to catch it in the theaters so I downloaded it. I jumped on my couch and turned the TV on.The movie was absolutely spectacular and just plain awesome!! I mean the effects were so revolutionary that it feels like I'm actually in one of the Nine Realms. I loved the performances by Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman. But Tom Hiddleston did an incredible job portraying Loki. Alan Taylor did an amazing job here. The story was good and unique as well.Hang on, though.

TA-DA!!!,"Was this sequel better than the first one? Well, no. Honestly it wasn't quite as good as the first,, but it's still plenty enjoyable. I'd still give it a 7.5,, so just a lil less good than the first.Thor brings Jane back to Asgard (after she comes into contact with what we later find out to be an infinity stone), only to be closely followed by an ancient enemy.

The Worst MCU Film,"Thor: The Dark World is a boring film that doesn't justify its existence as a movie. It offers hardly any insight into the characters and just acts as an unnecessary stepping stone in Marvel's chain of films ranging from Incredible to to bland. With no real care put into anything, and an even bigger focus on some of the annoying characters from the first Thor, there's not much reason to watch Thor: The Dark World.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Did not disappoint,"Yes, there are loopholes, like why don't the Asgardians fight with better technology than swords, since they have other fantastical technology, but other than that and one out-there moment when the portal throws a cell phone into the most unlikely of moments, this was so much fun. It even managed to keep too much silliness from happening in the romance department, which was a bonus.Great special effects, loved the new angel of old mythology meets technology, meets other worlds, meets star wars, meets flaky human existence. Great movie! If you love loads of action, the fantastic Loki, a great cast and good storytelling, I would totally recommend this.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not as good as the first,The 1st Thor film was good this was average. The story of the film was okay and the screenplay was pretty slow. The ending was good though. The direction was good.

"I love this movie, dark vibes, no unnecessary comedy","""Thor: The Dark World"" shines in the Marvel Cinematic Universe with my resounding 8/10 rating, and I absolutely loved it. Chris Hemsworth's portrayal of Thor continues to be a captivating force, balancing strength and vulnerability. The film editing seamlessly weaves together cosmic battles and human drama, creating a whirlwind of excitement. Its strength lies in its exploration of the convergence and the potential consequences of disrupting the balance of the Nine Realms. The music elevates the epic scale, and the cinematography paints a visually stunning world of Asgard and beyond. While it may not be the most heralded entry in the MCU, ""Thor: The Dark World"" brings a cosmic charm and showcases the importance of heroism across the realms. My love for it is as vast as the universe it explores.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
One Of The Weaker Marvel Movies,"Just finished Thor 2!! I thought it was possibly one of the worst second halfs to a Mavel movie, if not THE worst!!It has a few good tricks up its sleeve and once again Tom Hiddleston steals the show, Rene Russo is given more to do this time around too, but despite strong performances from Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman who I love (and I think she can make any movie at least watchable) and Anthony Hopkins, there is no getting away from it being one of Marvel's weaker movies.

More Thor,"Really enjoyed the movie, it was different to the first but I think the films are still on par with each other I think I like this one better because Chris is well and truly perfected playing Thor, in the first I thought he was a little stiff in his acting but since then in avengers and Thor 2 he has been brilliant.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Very Good: 8.0,"The first Thor film was something of an oddity, possessing much more of a comedic element than Marvel's other cinematic offerings. This gave it personality, and made it the better of Marvel's two 2011 films (the other being Captain America). The sequel, though by no means lacking in the laughs department, takes a darker approach to the continuity, with considerably more action than its predecessor. The acting is still commendable across the board, but it is Tom Hiddleston who delivers the breakout performance, perfectly showcasing the pent-up rage Loki has against the world that has exiled him. This time, Asgard is under seige by an ancient enemy known as the Dark Elves. The action has a sort of stormtroopers-vs.-Ewoks vibe, as the Dark Elves cut down the sword-wielding Asgardians with energy-based projectile weapons. While it's obvious that Asgard will not be destroyed this early in the storyline, it does indicate that forthcoming Marvel tales might not be as light as they were in the past.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
So boring,Alr keeping it a buck. That was so boring I can't and on top of that they keep having things with the Thor lore that could be cool but instead of doing something with it they just kinda cover it up or ignore it and it annoys me so much. Like I just finished it and I can't tell you a thing that just happened and I hate when movies try to be cool and have the antagonist speak a made up language cause all it does is separate them from reality and makes their cause one that I don't care about and if I don't care about the villains motivations than how am i supposed to care about anything else the only saving grace of this movie is Loki honestly like he was the only thing that I think legit had me entertained but other than him I have no words I'm glad I pushed through this though so now I can continue on.,3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Not that great, so-so (I liked Thor 1 better)","I had a lot of expectations, because I loved the first Thor. I was disappointed--it seemed a lot longer with too many fight scenes (found them boring).There just seemed to be more hollow action scenes and less story/depth.Too many fight scenes/political conflict scenes in ASGARD. I wanted to see more scenes where Thor interacts with earth people (Natalie Portman character).The acting was GOOD. Thor was amazing as always and LOKI was a scene stealer--such a fun & colorful character (actor Tom Hiddleston was brilliant).",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Cool CGI. Different MCU movie. 7.5,I liked the first one a lot and this one was pretty good too. I do prefer the realism of the marvel characters like spider man and iron man. Thor was too other worldly for me. It would definitely appeal to some but I just would rather things take place on earth with normal villains. Still a great movie.

"A Strong, Fantasy-Powered Alternative to the Avenger Family Standard","Continuing the second phase of Marvel's cinematic onslaught, begun several months prior with Iron Man 3, Thor's encore solo performance is a markedly stronger, more focused effort than his first. Though Earth still factors into the mix, particularly in the clever, gripping climactic fight scene, there's no mistaking that this is Asgard's story and that clear emphasis, missing from the original, makes a big difference. As a distinctly fantasy-laden epic, it also benefits from a fresh, authentic flavor that its stable-mates just can't match. There's more to see than smashed skyscrapers and flattened taxi cabs in Thor's world, and that brand of open possibility makes the realm an absolute delight to swallow up. As visual feasts go, this is at or near the top of the pile - it's gorgeous, innovative and generally unlike anything else in modern cinema, a stuffed bagful of sensory treats. The acting, too, has taken a grand step up since our last trip across the rainbow bridge. Surprisingly, this time Natalie Portman comes across as a clunky third wheel: Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston provide the real intrigue, hammering home Thor's complicated relationship with his conniving adopted brother, Loki. A fantastically imaginative flick, well-paced and triumphantly acted, that does something its precursor couldn't: whet my appetite for a sequel.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not good but not bad,"It's the most ""meh"" Marvel movie ever. It'll help to watch it before you watch Endgame. Judging by the trailers I think it'll help to watch before Thor: Love and Thunder. Not terrible and you'll still enjoy it. Somewhat worth the watch.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Solid Improvement Over the Original THOR,"I may be alone in this opinion but I believed Kenneth Branagh's THOR was the weakest film in the first phase of Marvel films. Yes, even weaker than IRON MAN 2. It wasn't that I hated the film but it failed to leave any sort of impression on me. Thor was always going to be one of the more difficult characters for Marvel to bring to the big screen. As opposed to characters with more ""grounded"" (in the loosest sense of the term) origins, Thor is a more mystical being. He's a demigod from another dimension who's near invulnerable to most forms of damage. So, right off the bat, he's not the easiest to relate to. So the first film went the route of a ""fish- out-of-water"" scenario as Thor loses his Asgardian powers and is banished to Earth to learn his lesson. So he spends a nice portion of the movie without actually being a superhero and we spend it on Earth. You know, that place we've spent every other Marvel movie to that point despite Marvel having a rich mythology with countless other possibilities. So, yeah, THOR was enjoyable but forgettable. But THE DARK WORLD corrects for these past weaknesses and actually brought us a Thor movie that I really enjoyed. The movie begins following the events of THE AVENGERS, with Loki condemned to the Asgardian dungeon for his crimes and Thor struggling to clean up the mess his brother's defiance had created across the Nine Realms.So, for starters, that's a major bonus in this film. We get a nice glimpse of realms other than Asgard, Earth, and Jotunheim. We even get to visit Vanaheim and Svartalfheim. So finally, the Thor films spread their wings a bit and we spend very little time on Earth this time around. It gave the filmmakers opportunities to have some fun with the production design. We get a much grander view of Asgard. It doesn't necessarily look as polished this time around. The first film made Asgard out to be very polished and shiny while THE DARK WORLD gives it a more tactile appearance with stone constructs and shady taverns. Svartalfheim is nothing more than a desolate wasteland with dark sands and a bizarre greenish atmosphere. It is the home of the film's villains, the Dark Elves. With their ruler, Malekith (Christopher Eccleston, the Dark Elves have been around since the creation of our universe and once thrived in the darkness before it's creation. Since the arrival of our universe and the light it brought, the Elves have been fighting for a means of eliminating it to return the universe to ever-lasting darkness. They'd been defeated once before by the Asgardians, under the command of Thor's grandfather Bor. They are awaken from their slumber once again when Jane Foster (Natalie Portman, returning) stumbles across the MCU's latest mystical artifact, the Aether. We never really get a good idea of what the Aether does. We're just told that it's incredibly powerful and Malekith can somehow use it to bring darkness across the Nine Realms during a cosmic event known as the Convergence when all of the realms align.There's our first misstep. The Aether is poorly explained. We see that it has some pretty nifty powers but their never really defined. It's just a shapeless mass of red liquid that provides its owner with seemingly unlimited power. We know these films are bound to have MacGuffins but do we need to treat them so shoddily? Give us some history, some detail. Malekith is obsessed with it and, again, that's about as much detail we get on another important aspect of the story. There have been a lot of complaints about Malekith being underdeveloped and I can't say I entirely disagree. We have a basic motivation and that's about it. He wants to return the universe to darkness and he'll stop at nothing to accomplish it, but give us some more. There has to be more to him. He seems like such a cool character. He could've easily been one of the better MCU villains with some extra time spent getting to know him, but he's relegated to a single mindless goal. The Dark Elves seem to be a very proud people and their talented warriors. There's some history there, so give us a bit. I love their visual style. The black and white color scheme and emotionless face masks give them a wicked creepy appearance. And Kurse is probably the best creature design in any of the films. Director Alan Taylor and his team nailed it with the film's visuals.The cast is mostly fantastic as well. Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston inhabit their roles at this point better than I can imagine anyone else would. There's a great brotherly chemistry between them and each of them have grown over the MCU series. Thor has become the noble warrior he was destined to be, surpassing even his father in his tact and strength. Loki continues to reign as one of Marvel's best movie villains and he's given a chance to show a more compassionate side when tragic events give him a reason to fight alongside his brother. Natalie Portman continues to prove that she's just not quite meant for comic movies. I know she's got talent but she always comes across as wooden as Jane in these movies. Kat Dennings returns as unnecessary comic relief and, while I was fine with her excessive goofiness in the first movie, it wasn't really needed here. THE DARK WORLD is a more serious film than it's predecessor and I would've been fine with the little bit of humor that comes through the Thor/Loki interactions. Christopher Eccleston and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje are wasted potential as the baddies but they do the best with the limited material they're given.In the end, THE DARK WORLD is a great sequel to a decent film and helped solidify Marvel's second phase of films as an improvement.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Mostly excellent, if you know why you're watching it","Having watched it a second time and checking out the reviews here, I'm amazed how many people didn't like it. I thought it the strongest in the Marvel Universe series after Avengers and Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Yes, better than Iron Man (all of them).Casting is solid, with a great bad guy, the storyline is appropriately over the top, without too much attention to character development, and the whole feel of the move is that of an epic myth, in a comic context. Those are traits of many comics, and not necessarily bad ones.Maybe it's my interest in Nordic mythology which gives Thor the edge, or the astonishingly great, epic scenes in the movie. Or Loki, who is mostly great, as before.Highly recommended - don't pay too much attention to reviews!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Best enjoyed on auto-pilot,"One of the surprising successes to come out of Marvel's (now Disney's) ever-increasing catalogue of superhero CGI-fests, was 2011's Thor. Somehow Kenneth Branagh managed to avoid any possible silliness in the story of the super-powered, bleach-blonde Asgardian God battling against his greasy-haired brother and save Earth from destruction. Thor tended to stay away from the gold-plated, computer-generated tedium of Asgard and told a slightly comedic fish-out-of-water tale that was both charming and, even surprisingly, emotionally complex. The sequel, directed by HBO veteran Alan Taylor, spends less time on Earth and more time zapping around the other worlds that make up the universe's Nine Realms.In a backstory-heavy introduction, we learn that a powerful 'Dark Elf' Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) was the leader of a powerful race that tried to use an energy source called the Aether to plunge the Nine Realms into darkness, but was overthrown by Thor's (Chris Hemsworth) grandfather, Bor. With Malekith defeated, Bor hides the Aether in a stone column, establishing a new era of peace across the Realms. On present-day Earth, Thor's old flame Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) accidentally discovers the Aether, which is absorbed into her body. Malekith, who has being lying dormant for years, is re-awoken by this event and seeks the Aether for himself, but not before Thor manages to whisk Jane back to Asgard.It's a typically McGuffin-riddled story that Marvel have managed to turn into a multi-billion dollar franchise, that simply allows the superhero to get from point A to point B in order to face the new big baddie in town. The Dark World is a loud, convoluted and epilepsy-inducing mess of huge battles and CGI landscapes, but, even if you can't get your head around the ridiculous, head-spinning plot, it's sure entertaining. But what The Dark World lacks is the tongue-in-cheek charm of the first film, insisting on making the story and tone 'darker', and moves the action to the sickly world of Asgard.What it does boast, is the return of the superb chemistry between Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston, the latter as the imprisoned Loki, forced to reflect after the near-apocalypse of The Avengers (2012). It has been reported that Loki's involvement was beefed up significantly post- production, and his sneering, malevolent, yet wounded presence is welcome, especially when Thor is forced to team up with his brother to tackle Malekith. This, however, came at the expense of Eccleston's pointy-eared menace, whose back-story and screen-time were reduced so harshly that you almost forget he's there. Portman's Jane Foster is still, unfortunately, a bland bore, mad at Thor for not calling in two years. He was saving the world, love.Ultimately, Thor: The Dark World is sporadically fun, punctured by moments of CGI tedium and head-spinning exposition (usually delivered by Anthony Hopkins' bored-looking Odin), that often evoke the unnecessary complexity of the rather painful Pirate of the Caribbean sequels. When the portals start appearing and the wrestling Thor and Malekith begin to throw each other between different worlds within the Nine Realms, I held my hands up and just gave up. And maybe this is the approach to take - just simply let it play out in front of your eyes, enjoy the charisma of Hemsworth - who delivers another delightful performance - and pray that someday Marvel will give Loki his own movie.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A Good Sequel,"Next on my list of MCU films to watch is Thor: The Dark World and tonight I did that and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees an ancient force looking for a powerful weapon that forces Thor to return to Earth and reunite with Jane Foster.Main Character
Chris Hemsworth is always good as Thor, for me this is probably the weakest he is playing the role but he is still good here. After the events of the first film it is pretty cool to see Thor in a solo film with all of his powers and he has plenty of time to throw down and does it well. The film also has clearly showed the development of the character from his first film through The Avengers to The Dark World and it is one of the better elements of the film. He starts to show some of the comedic timing we know he has and it leads to a pretty decent lead performance.Supporting Characters
Tom Hiddleston is back as Loki and for me he is easily the best part of this film, he is so charismatic and has the best lines here. He is more of an anti-hero in this film and it is a nice development of the dynamic between Thor and Loki that we had seen at this point in The MCU. Anthony Hopkins was always a good choice as Odin and his character has an interesting character arc here, in the first film he seems to be the all knowing wise king but he has some issues in this film that requires Thor to sort them out and it provides an interesting wrinkle. Idris Elba, Rene Russo & Jaime Alexander are all decent in their roles but they are much smaller so seems a bit unfair to talk about them too much. Natalie Portman is back as Jane Foster and she didn't work for me here. I thought their romance worked in the first film, but here it feels like she is just a damsel in distress and no a well developed character and just a really bland element here. Christopher Eccleston plays the villain Malekith and this is one of the most boring villains in The MCU. He has nothing interesting and unique about him at all, he is so forgettable and the film does a terrible in making him a threat to Thor and it really hurts the film. I also wasn't a fan of the use of Kat Dennings and Stellan Skarsgard here and felt like they annoyed me, especially when everything is going down in the final battle.Story
The story feels like a pretty natural sequel to The Avengers in how it treats certain characters and that is nice to see. I liked how the development between Thor and Loki was handled and the fact we got to spend more time on Asgard, also the film has a great pretty clifhangery ending. But the film lacks real weight to it, the bad guys plot is generic, half the characters are useless and there is a romance I didn't care about. The film just doesn't have great storytelling and overall it shows despite it doing some things okay.Script
The script is similar to the story, there are some fun exchanges and a few dramatic moments but overall it lacks bite and a real sense of scale and intrigue. There is just too much of the film that I found boring and actually make no sense which on this occasion really hurt the overall product.Style
Along, with Hiddleston and Hemsworth, the other best thing about this film is the style. The action scenes are great and feel very grand and exciting with a fresh feel to it. Also the film is paced well, with the film not having too much downtime which is effective.Overall
Overall, this is a good film that is an entertaining watch. I don't think it is as good as the first Thor film but if you like super hero films then this is a decent way to pass 2 hours.Rating - 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
It was okay. Watchable,"The Dark Elves want to destroy and shut out the light from the Universe. Their leader, Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) searches for the Aether, an indestructible force and finds it in Jane (Natalie Portman). Say what? Thor (Chris Hemsworth) must find a way to save Jane and defeat the Dark Elves. Thor needs the help of his brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) who is in prison by order of his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins).This was okay, but the CGI sets showcased all you see and they are spectacular. The action scenes are very good. The only comedic lines were uttered by Loki and to be truthful Loki steals the show. I suppose the professor running naked at the Stonehenge site was funny to some, not to me. It wasn't funny and didn't add much to the story. Why have it? Not much happens between Thor and Jane although she had been waiting for his return for 2-years.This was okay, but the Convergence when the 9-Realms line up to a point when Malekith can use the Aether to destroy the known universe should have made us pause and be concerned, but that didn't happen. Things happened too fast and we knew Thor would be triumphant. It's really not good to say that we just didn't care, but we didn't.This was okay, but for a civilization as advanced like the Asgards their weapons of choice only seemed to be knives and swords and we did see the Dark Elves use what looked like ray-guns. Oh, yes, Thor has his Hammer. Knives and swords? Give me a break.This was okay only because of the action scenes and sets design and they were very good.Now for the dilemma: Two people die in this. What will a sequel bring us without them? One is kind of important to the Thor story. Huh? However, there is that scene at the very end that confused me and may confuse you too. (5/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Return to Asgard,"Chris Hemsworth returns as the god of thunder for Thor: The Dark World, in only what a can describe as a quick fast food rollercoaster of a ride with a script lacking substance and choosing style. So, you got a date with Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and you are given the choice of wooing her by taking her to a fantastic top of the range five star restaurant, or a Ronald MacDonalds clowning around mess of a fast food outlet, it's a no brainier to me! Even the IT crowds (Chris O' Dowd) manages to get this right, unfortunately for him he is up against broodingly dashingly handsome muscled heartthrob most women want, in Chris Hemsworth, the poor guy don't stand a chance!What does Thor: The Dark World get right? It manages to entertain within the nine realms of the galaxy, as well as balancing well timed humour with action sequences. It realises the popularity and the importance of Loki, especially after (Tom Hiddleston) extravagant performance in the first Avengers. He is outlandishly charismatic as a villain and obnoxious at times but it works so perfect. The reason it works is because he is bold enough a brave enough to stand out amongst his peers, and stand out he does. Much like (Robert Downey Jr.) Tony Stark, Loki is the flip side of that coin, consistently making himself a nuisance, yet unlike Stark is unable to choose the right path. However, The Dark World leaves the audience and Thor with hope that not all is lost within Loki, and buried beneath the surface are some redeeming qualities.Returning once again as Odin (Anthony Hopkins) attempts to guide his son Thor once again only to be facing defiance again. Alan Taylor pieces together a worthy sequel for the god of thunder without taking any risks leaving a mostly satisfying outcome. However, I can't help thinking this could've been better had they spent a little more focus on the plot, as too much seems to happen for convenience rather than being well thought out.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"An improvement on the first, a fantastical return to Asgard","Most importantly, The Dark World felt like a post-Avengers story, both plot-wise and in the characters' arcs, whereas Iron Man 3 felt like it could have been told before the Avengers with little difference. Hemsworth again vanishes into his role, and Hiddleston is as slimy as ever. The humor was probably some of the sharpest and least forced of all Marvel's movies so far, with everyone really upping their game. I loved the change from Shakespearean drama to Lord of the Rings-style fantasy; it really allowed for some epic locations and battles, while overall showcasing some new sides to Asgard and the universe in general. The use of various color palettes was genius, changing from greys to greens to oranges and browns really differentiated the worlds and tones. The plot mechanisms also gave way to some of the most inventive and thrilling battle sequences I've seen. If Man of Steel dragged a bit for you in the battles, you'll probably feel the opposite here. In fact, the entire film clips along briskly and could stand an extended cut. I was just sad when it ended; I wanted more. Some clever twists and turns kept me completely invested in the characters and story. Unfortunately, an undeveloped villain left a lot to be desired, and prevents it from ranking as Marvel's best for me. But for sheer exhilaration, it parallels Marvel's The Avengers and Man of Steel, earning bonus points for the change to outright fantasy genre Thor belongs in, as well as some brilliant tie-ins to Viking culture. There were also some very appreciated nods to the first film, and a scene that will take you so off guard you'll need the movie to pause just to recover - in a good way.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Flawed , yet reasonably fun","In theory Thor: The Dark World is a great movie. In this theory it's a great sci-fi epic about beings that look like viking gods. In practice though it is not a great movie as much as it is a deeply flawed movie with some very nice individual scenes in it.The biggest problem T:tDW has is, that it is a Marvel movie and just like very other Marvel movie it does its best to make the viewers remember that they are in fact watching a Marvel movie. This leads into nudges and winks towards the other movies in Marvel's arsenal, which in this case make the movie feel a bit disjointed as it assumes that the viewer has already seen those. It also means that the characters don't really get that much flesh in their stories as the writing clearly seems to assume that someone else is going to flesh out the characters more in somewhere else. That's why the movie is filled with familiar faces whom a casual viewers might have very hard time identifying with, as they have no inkling who those many faces are and what is their significance.TtDW is a fun movie none the less. It is more or less forgettable sequel to a relatively forgettable movie in the first place, but just like the first movie it is reasonably well done to fill its purpose of entertainment.

Earth is the center of the universe after all!,"I enjoyed this better than the first Thor movie!Cool, actionful, and humorous. Of course, Earth must be the location where everything converges to. Where else?Though the movie is predictable - as all Marvel movies are. That Loki attacking Thor was just a plan was to be seen from thousands of miles away. Of course, it was just a cheap trick. Of course, it would fail. But it was convincingly acted! The plottwist at the end of the movie I did not expect, though... Curious about the next Thor movie.Sometimes in these Marvel movies, however, I wonder where all the Avengers are and what S. H. I. E. L. D is doing. You would imagine that a threat which could potentially destroy the entire universe wouldn't be a minor threat. You would imagine that SHIELD knowing Sevik might expect something is up. But no, they're just slumbering, waiting for others to fix the crap.Also, the kissing was the intern was a bit unfit. If someone of the opposite gender saved my life, my first action wouldn't be to snug them. (I think.)I complained a lot, and yet I enjoyed this movie quite a bit and was drawn into it.

Thor The Dark World: Three words: TOO MUCH COMEDY!,"Thor: The Dark World. Now with most new movies I review this review may contain SPOILERS so read at your own risk. Thor: The Dark World improves on many flaws of the first Thor, like probably my biggest problem with the first Thor was that the 9 realms were way to polished and neat in this movie the realms look more like actual places that have dirt and muck. And also Asgard looks much more Viking-like and that makes a whole lot of sense considering the Norse mythology was created by Vikings. In this movie Thor got to do more Thor-like things with his power, and be more of a hero. Thor The Dark World also threw in more creatures they all looked pretty cool especially the secondary villain Kurse, he was big, and violent a real Challenger to Thor sadly I felt he didn't get enough screen time. Thats one of the problems with the movie, the villains were really cool but had no were near enough screen time, like Malekith, great design from adapting a comic to a movie, cool powers, good threat, worthy enemy, threatening but in the end he was only on screen for like 17 minutes, I fell they should've cut out parts of the Earth scenes and replaced it with more Malekith and Kurse scenes. On Earth there were two characters in particular that the whole movie could have doe without, the two interns (I know they probably have names but I didn't care enough to remember them) they annoyed the crap out of me, I hated them really took the movie down a notch. But out of the negatives there were some positives that outweighed them, the character of Thor was much more heroic and godlike, Loki's back and he's good in the movie and doesn't overstay his welcome, the fights were great very imaginative especially the final fight with portals and realm jumping. Now some cameos that I noticed of course Stan Lee had one and it was great as all the rest, and the one that's probably the best is a Captain America cameo, I wont tell you when were or how it happens but man it's cool. So in the end Thor: The Dark World is better than the first but this is still a flawed movie, but even with the flaws Thor The Dark World gets an 7.5 out of 10. Stay during and after the credits there's two scenes",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Disappointing,"Chris Hemsworth is wonderful as Thor and Tom Hiddleston's Loki is the best.

Much better than people give it credit for,"I see a lot of hate for Thor: The Dark World and that people say it's one of the worst MCU movies, and I honestly don't understand, it doesn't deserve it.The story is different from the basic Marvel and it did a great job with the love interest, Tom Hiddleston shines in his role and there were many character arcs that I didn't see coming, it's also a very funny film, the writing felt self-aware but it still felt serious, lots of character work happens and it's one of the most serious early Marvel movies.Also, Thor: The Dark World has to be one of the most thrilling films of the early MCU, with some of the best vfx Marvel ever gave us, I think it does an even better job than Captain Marvel.The villain was pretty terrible but it didn't feel cliched and it was all complimented by intense, epic music, it's a quality piece of Marvel entertainment.The film looks phenomenal, and while a betrayal happens that I did see coming a redemption happens that came out of nowhere.Thor: The Dark World is the most unnecessarily hated Marvel films, but I really liked it and I'm gonna give it an A-.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Much better! MORE NATALIE PORTMAN!,"It started off strong. The whole first 30 minutes were perfect. The battle for the Aether was really good with quite some dramatic moments.

Marvel Cinematic Universe Marathon 2019 #9,"I thoroughly dissatisfied and disappointed with this film at it's entirety. It's even terrible than Captain Marvel.

The Hammer wielding superhero is back,"Thor: The Dark World is a comic book superhero movie that although maybe not containing the most thrilling of plot lines, still manages to churn out a fun film. With a lot of humour to add to the plot it could be said this is one superhero movie that doesn't always take itself so seriously and shows that Thor can do more than just one film. I felt by the end that it was a firmly OK movie and here below is why so.The story is kind of confusing like at times, it jumps from one thing to another and although you won't be lost, some scenes are fairly quick and dialogue can be missed. I did enjoy the action side of the film and the scenes shown containing fights etc are well laid out so that the film never gets to dull for the viewer. It tries to crack a few jokes here and there and they can be funny at times, if anything it lightens the movie up in parts.I found Chris Hemsworth to be good, not great but he does the job he is supposed to do and it has to be said he is well choreographed all the way through. Natalie Portman is OK but can maybe seem just slightly under acting but is usually saved by fellow cast members. Tom Hiddleston well I wasn't too sure on him in this second instalment, I felt he tried too hard to be the big sinister guy in certain scenes and although by the end he has done an OK job, still just a little over the top.It is well directed and to say the effects are so big and expansive in this movie, Alan Taylor seems to finish this up well. I wasn't always too keen on the script whilst watching and although I think it improves as the movie progresses, it still could do with a few tweaks here and there. On the point of effects, they are everywhere it would seem but not bad at all and contribute very well to the thrills felt throughout the film.The main negativity coming from this is the way in which it has too much a complicated plot that isn't a smart one, I mean that in the sense that it could be intelligent and well thought out but by the end the story seems to be only about attracting box office receipts. Wasn't also always too keen on the acting side but people such as Hemsworth really start to regain control of that part of the film and stop it fading badly.For the fan of superheroes or comics, this could be said to be not the best of them but still highly recommend if you really want a lot of action with an epic back story. If your not a fan I would still say go and see, it has a certain air of comedic charm which kind of make it feel a bit different to other such films and not always trying to be too serious.Overall I felt It to be Firmly Pleasing and a film that never quite loses the aim of the game. My review may seem very negative indeed but in many cases it is not bad, hugely enjoyable in parts, confusing but fun in others this is one Superhero movie that could by the very end, very much split opinion among people.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
desperately silly but quite hilarious,"i don't generally mind silly clichéd stories and try to ignore them, but gave up and went to the cinema mostly to see some fancy FX. there were some, and some more and then even more - pretty much apart from the shallow story, it is no wonder that the visual effects make this movie, but then there was the astonishing surprisingly good humor! i guess it's the weather in London that helped inspire some crazy little jokes that simply saved the movie.you wouldn't expect that a heroic fantasy movie would be saved by jokes, but here it is, so many little moments that were delightful and helped forget the rest of the nonsense.this and Tom Hiddleston who is the superstar in this episode of Thor, he is incredible and hopefully will be given even more space in another followup. it was he who helped sustain some kind of a story throughout the hollow graphic scenes - what an excellent actor! apparently marvel have realized that the universe of the avengers is what keeps people going to the theaters, so it was really nice to have scenes with ties with the other superheroes, and even continuity with the Avengers movie. i wonder what Disney will do with the star wars franchise, kinda scary that the cashflow is guaranteed with only a mention of some of the iconic characters there...anyway...Thor...quite fun(ny). i wonder how the first episode actually did in box office, but might be there will be need for a new superhero movie soon. because a super hero movie cannot be sustained by jokes only... the original batman somewhat proved it - it was the Dark Knight that made me really consider this a great story.so...Thor...well... :)",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"A Welcome Addition to ""Phase 2"" to the Marvel Cinematic Universe!","Last summer's ""Iron Man 3"" turned out to be very disappointing, but ""Thor: The Dark World"" does a much better job of kicking off this second phase of Marvel movies. I did enjoy the first ""Thor"", but this movie does a much better job of exploring some of the other worlds and raising the stakes.The original cast returns for this second film and they are great! Chris Hemsworth is still a great Thor and Tom Hiddleston really gets a chance to shine as Loki. Natalie Portman is still hot and plays a good Jane Foster. The rest of the original cast is good, also, though I really wish that Kat Dennings was not in these movies because she's annoying and pretty pointless. Christopher Eccleston is Malekith, the new villain for the film. He's a bit boring and is honestly pretty forgettable, which is a shame because Eccleston really is a good actor.The story for this movie is very fun. No, it doesn't always make sense, but like other successful Marvel movies, it keeps you entertained and wanting more. The film also does a much better job at foreshadowing ""Avengers 2"" than ""Iron Man 3"" did, so that's an added bonus that all fans should look forward to.The effects are sort of hit and miss. Asgard and the other realms that are shown look spectacular. The action sequences are well choreographed and make for an exciting time. But some of the costumes look a bit silly and fake.Final verdict: ""Thor: The Dark World"" is exactly what it is meant to be. It is an entertaining thrill ride from start to finish, with good characters and great, action packed scenes. It is not a great Marvel movie like ""Iron Man"" or ""The Avengers"", but it is a worthy entry that will leave you entertained and wanting to see it again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Very enjoyable, but not flawless","This is certainly not a movie without some questionable parts. We have the standard bad guy who doesn't really have much motivation other than to consume everything in darkness because... well, evil?The great positives of this movie are firstly... surprise surprise, Tom Hiddleston as Loki. Certainly my favorite part of both the first Thor movie and The Avengers, he's still fantastic in this movie. At one point his one-liners became rather tiresome, but for the most part in this movie, he's a greatly enjoyable character with the greatest character arc.
Secondly, Asgard is still just as beautiful as in the first Thor movie, if not even more beautiful. Tons of great VFX work throughout this movie makes it look gorgeous, I bought the blu-ray for this movie for the visual aspect alone.Some negative parts of the film would be firstly as mentioned before, the ""bad guy"" who carry as much depth as a kiddy pool. The script overall feels a bit ""meh""... with some poor dialogue throughout. Direction is also a tad messy and you can expect this whole ""9 universes"" thing to make up some confusing and messy scenes.I must admit that I was afraid a huge triangle-drama would occur when Jane and Thor's female warrior buddy, Sif exchanged looks, clearly indicating Sif's jealousy towards Jane. Luckily, they never went further on this.To conclude...
Enjoyable movie with great visual effects and most importantly, Loki.
Some negatives can be found, but overall I consider this to be among the better Marvel movies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Poor 2 - The Dull World,"This was a big disappointment for me. If Loki had not been in it the movie would have been dull beyond belief.The main antagonist, played by Christopher Eccleston, was terrible; the most one-dimensional character I've seen in a long time. There's some spaceship battles straight out of the Star Wars prequels as well.Apart from some nice visuals and some decent fights, a couple of cool cameos and some funny moments, this one fell flat for me and poor in comparison to the first.It was only when the battle came to Earth that things got interesting, I think prior to that there may have been too many CGI backgrounds and special effect fights which made me switch off. I did start to get into it towards the end but it was not an enjoyable journey.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
By Asgard this is fun!,"If you haven't seen one of the recent crop of 'Marvel comic book movies' then 'Thor: The Dark World' is probably a bit of an odd place to start. So, assuming you've already enjoyed anything from Thor 1 to Iron Man 3, then you'll probably enjoy this, too. It follows the whole 'Marvel superhero formula' pretty closely and, if I'm being harsh, doesn't really bring anything new to the table. However, when a movie is this much fun, a lack of originality isn't that much of a problem.It's a fun, action-packed romp and, even if you haven't seen the first one (or any other Marvel film of late) then, as long as you understand the basic concept of 'good vs evil' then you should have no problem picking up on what's happening.Chris Hemsworth is great as Thor. Tom Hiddleston is equally great as Thor's nemesis 'Loki' and the rest of the cast all play their parts well, too.So, all you need is a big bucket of popcorn and an hour and forty-four minutes to kill and you should enjoy some seriously fun 'hammer time.'

Thor: Journey to the Dark Side,"A Marvel movie from Phase 2, and it shows: bigger budget, polished special effects, and a well-timed pace. But let's be honest, the villain is a dark elf with the charisma of a character from a cheesy sitcom. You're left wondering if he's here to avenge his people or audition for Frozen. Fortunately, the action is well-balanced, keeping boredom at bay, and the special effects are solid.Loki is the master manipulator and the anti-hero everyone loves to hate. Tom Hiddleston leans into the role with his dark humor and sly grin, practically carrying the movie like Atlas with the Earth. Without him, we'd be watching Thor stuck in a cosmic soap opera. If there's one reason to see this film, it's to watch Loki in action, not Thor lecturing on chivalry in his armor.When he's not busy saving the universe, Thor plays the romantic with Jane. Unfortunately, we expected a bit more spark. Instead, the scenes feel more like a teenage love story than a dark saga. It's sweet, but for an action film, we'd like more edge. Jane could be more than the classic damsel in distress, but character depth doesn't seem to be on the agenda just yet.This being Marvel, the humor is sprinkled in liberally, for better or worse. Sometimes it lands; other times, it feels like a bad joke at a family dinner. There are some funny moments, sure, but some fall as flat as Uncle Gerry's New Year's jokes. A bit less humor wouldn't hurt, especially when the dark elves are supposed to be bringing the destruction.Ah, Malekith! A villain who should have been the scourge of the cosmos but ends up like a background actor searching for some credible menace. He's supposed to be an ancient threat, yet he feels less scary than a summer storm. The potential was there, but the execution fell short. A truly charismatic villain could have made this film a must-see.Thor: The Dark World is still an enjoyable film with solid action and an unbeatable Loki, but it's far from the epic high we expect from Marvel. Fun, energetic, and entertaining? Yes. Unforgettable? Let's just say we hope for better in the future.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Thor rising,"I really enjoyed this movie, although it was a bit over the top. But that's what sold the film for me. The effects and lighting set the perfect back drop and mood. Some of the best parts were worked into the effects as well.....like Thor flying to the scene and holding his arm up waiting for the hammer......some of the space scenes .....I also thought the fight scenes were realistic for this film and done well. The anger that turns to rage seem logical and acted well. The costumes fit the characters and were done very well. Loki and Thor really sold the action for me. Driving in the space mobile through people.....trees.....buildings......great stuff. I wasn't too sure about this movie before watching it, but I thought it was exciting and action packed and a wonderful use of effects/CGI. I'd recommend this to fans of this genre and almost anyone else. They may be as surprised and happy you did.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Kind of a throw-away movie.,"I think that the ending saves this movie (the very last scene and the mid credits scene), but not even those two things amounted to much in subsequent films. The villain was underwhelming with no depth and while the action was pretty cool, much of it got tiresome. I always like Tom Hiddleston as Loki and Chris Hemsworth as Thor no matter what, plus even Natalie Portman.

The first real disappointment of the MCU.,"I am going to skip my usual format and just have an open dialog about this film. I found it incredibly hard to come up with any ""The good""s let alone some ""The great""s. Simply put, I think this is the first MCU film that I don't like at all.If you read my review for Thor (2011), you will know that I really loved that film. I loved the cast, the humor (in particular the physical comedy), the redemption story, the introduction of Hawkeye, pretty much everything about it. The Dark World trashes everything that was great about the first movie, and I don't even know why.To start, the comedy of the first movie is almost entirely around Thor and how he doesn't understand the world he has been thrust into without his powers. He is hit by cars and subdued by orderlies. He smashes cups and drinks his new found friends under the table. His ego is the joke and we laugh and smile along with him as he finds his feet (and his place) in a new world. In TDW, the jokes are much meaner and, to me at least, far less funny.One of the principal sources of supposed humor in TDW is Dr. Erik Selvig's mental breakdown. We see an absolute shell of the brilliant scientist we saw in Thor. He runs around naked, gives lectures to a group of disinterested mental patients, and takes off his trousers to think. This is funny how? His mind was almost destroyed by being forced to create a device that killed thousands and practically caused the downfall of his own planet. Har Har.Another source of ""humor"" is Darcy's Intern...cause picking on/abusing people is funny.Unfortunately, the fantastic ensemble cast is entirely wasted. Sif is turned into some sort of love rival and the Warriors Three are turned into mindless, characterless drones who do what Thor tells them, no matter how dumb. Darcy is a joke, a caricature of her character in Thor, and the chemistry between Thor and Jane is as flat as ever.There are so many other problems with this movie. The plot doesn't make sense and relies on so many outrageous coincidences. Death happens too easily and with little real emotional impact. Unnecessary twists happen for no reason. It treats the viewer with such little respect, I could go on for pages.In summary, did not like, won't watch again anytime soon.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
#Movie Review,"Thor : The Dark World (2013) has its flaws but despite all that it still manages to keep you entertained.

Only the names are from Norse mythology,"Thor: The Dark World. Had to watch it over three days, since I kept getting distracted by other things. E-mail, Facebook, coffee, BOREDOM.Any relation between this and Norse mythology is merely in the names. Thor could not fly; he rode a chariot. His hammer only returned to him if he wore magic gloves. Frigga was not Thor's mother, Jörð was Odin's love and Thor's mother. Loki was not evil, merely a particularly annoying practical joker and mischief maker. Odin was not a peace keeper, he was a pure warmonger always willing to start a fight. Sif was not a warrior, she was goddess of the harvest and grain--and blond. Of all the characters depicted in this movie, only Heimdall was fairly accurate. Natalie Portman is always pleasant to see, but her limited role in this film was not enough to salvage this pathetic excuse for a movie.IMDb viewers gave this movie a 7.2, obviously because they have more familiarity with Marvel comics than Norse mythology. Very sad.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Decent yet probably the worst of the Thor lineup,"A more intense version of the original that focuses more on it's theme and has a more in-depth story. Thor finally reunites with Jane again and saves the fate of Earth, the other such known worlds, and especially his own known as Asgard. His brother Loki leaps into good fate, but can still never be trusted. The overall film had some good action, cool battle scenes, and the usual touches of humor that Marvel always brings (Captain America LOL). The film also brings some references from the first Avengers movie, as this event happened chronologically after the New York battle in which the other movie took place at.

Not a bad movie-just a bad marvel movie,This is a fun movie with nice special effects and action but it's very forgettable and the story is weak.

The worst Marvel movie so far,"Thor: The Dark World is the worst film Marvel has done in their Cinematic Universe. So far. And it still means that, by any objective standard, it's a good film with plenty of great action, phenomenal visual effects and good actors.It's just that the story is boring. We get to see Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) once again as she continues to unravel the mysteries of the universe with her band of plucky sidekicks. Meanwhile, an old threat awakens to cast a shadow over the peace of Asgard, the Realm Eternal. And thus Jane and Thor (Chris Hemsworth) meet once again to protect the Nine Realms. Sounds exciting? It could have been.Unfortunately, whereas in the first Thor movie we had an extremely interesting and dynamic villain in Loki (Tom Hiddleston), here the villain is about as interesting as watching a cattle drive. It sounds and seems exciting at first, but the monotony settles in very quickly. Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) has no edge, and quite honestly no personality either. He wants to take over the world because... he wants to take over the world. All the Marvel villains before this film had been huge. They were individuals, larger than life, always scheming, plotting, usually with a smirk on their face. This... man... elf... emo band reject, on the other hand, is only distinguished from his troops by the fact that he speaks a bit more and has a snazzier uniform.The rest of the movie is fine. It's not as good as the first Thor, or any of the other Marvel films, but the returning actors are on the top of their game, it's certainly nice to see Jane, Darcy and Erik once again, not to mention Loki - who still absolutely steals every scene he's in - and the visuals works splendidly. It's only that the story cannot be as captivating as it needs to be without an effective villain.Thor: The Dark World is not the first bad Marvel film, the coming of which we fearfully still await and hope to avoid completely, but it is the first Marvel film that can only be described as average on the whole. Which makes it disappointing, but ultimately still worth a watch.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A misleading?,"In the opening moments of ""Thor: The Dark World,"" the 2013 installment in the Disney/Marvel comic book factory's swiftly entertaining, elaborately pointless 3D entertainment, an evil Dark Elf reveals his nefarious scheme to ""unleash the Aether."" However, under Alan Taylor's direction, this powerful, impersonal visual-effects extravaganza is peppy and unpretentious enough to counteract its concoction of generally trite fantasy/action themes.Even while the film's formula of catastrophic mayhem combined tongue-in-cheek humor remains pure essence of Marvel, the fact that much of the action takes place in Asgard and other far dimensions allows for an enlivening change of scenery at the very least.An old prologue describes a conflict between the valiant Asgardian troops and an evil race known as the Dark Elves-so called less for their fair skin than for their passion for all-consuming darkness. The Aether is buried down underground in a location where no one would ever find it, while the remaining Dark Elves, commanded by the supervillain Malekith, are sentenced to millennia of dormancy.Of course, Jane Foster, Earth's most attractive astrophysicist and the mortal soul mate of everyone's favorite hunk with a hammer, Thor, should discover it centuries later. The Dark Elves' plan to activate the Aether, however, could have disastrous effects on all Nine Realms, so the coronation will have to wait.Unbeknownst to most people, Earth is one of those Nine Realms, despite the fact that, if ""Thor: The Dark World"" is to be believed, it is such a dull planet that it is difficult to feel any grief at the idea of its extinction. Things become stale nearly every time the movie returns to earth, where Jane's perpetually sarcastic assistant Darcy and new intern Ian attempt to come up with a scientific solution with the assistance of Dr. Erik Selvig, Jane's former mentor, who appears to have added crazed nudism to his list of eccentric pastimes.Fortunately, Asgard rarely features the forced humor and uninteresting scenery of the Earth sequences, so it's generally enjoyable to visit with Thor and Jane, who looks especially lovely dressed in the finery of the realm. Director Taylor creates some of his most captivating set pieces in this ethereal realm, beginning with the Dark Elves' lethal attack on Odin's palace and ending with a rather breathtakingly gorgeous mass funeral scene.Also in Asgard, we discover Loki, Thor's scheming and power-crazed brother, who is currently incarcerated there for his involvement in the events of ""The Avengers."" When it becomes evident that the two will have to work together in order to stop Malekith, the brotherly rivalry between him and Thor takes a genuinely exciting turn. This development is cleverly handled for chuckles as well as tense emotional drama.In the end, the film's humor is essentially its saving grace since it keeps the action interesting and energetic enough for viewers to not notice how rehashed the plot is or how low the stakes feel. And several clever turns are based on the Asgardians' prowess at shape-shifting, which here serves as the magical equivalent of people taking off latex masks like in ""Mission: Impossible.""",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Not Thorful, But Not Thorsome Either","Thor: The Dark World expands on the beloved Marvel Cinematic Universe, quite literally, this time with one of the least exciting Avengers taking the spotlight for Hammertime.Despite the devoted fan-base of this incredible world of Marvel superheroes, you can't help but feel that Thor: The Dark World is the first instalment in the franchise to feel most contrived and out of place. Yet, this sequel is still a mild improvement on its predecessor, though together they combine for the weakest in the series of superhero films, even though Thor is probably the strongest out of the bunch. The film finds Thor doing his thing in Asgard, before his lady love Jane Foster conveniently stumbles upon a weapon known as the Aether, which the Dark Elf Malekith intends to use to destroy the universe. Asleep yet?Negativity aside, Thor: The Dark World is a mostly enjoyable comic-book flick with some superb action, actors and, I can't think of another word that begins with 'a' so, humour.For an incredibly cheesy character, Chris Hemsworth still has the oh my demigod factor to bring a great balance of confidence, charisma and physicality to the role of Thor. This can be said of all of the Asgardians, including Anthony Hopkins as Odin and Tom Hiddleston's fan- favourite portrayal of Loki. While narratively Thor: The Dark World is predominantly yawn-inspiring, the presence of Hiddleston's Loki compensates as fans are genuinely interested to see his current personality and relationship with Thor following the events of The Avengers in 2012.It is the human characters that are the dull, annoyingly cheesy and unnecessary obstacles that often get in the way of the overall pleasant 112 minute sequel. Notably, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) is used as a pathetic damsel in distress signal masquerading as a character with any significance, while Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings) is pretty much the idiotic joke machine waiting for her cue. These characters, along with the contrived villain Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) are really the Aether to what could have been a very promising second outing for Thor. With no disrespect to these actors whom deliver fine performances, it is their characters that suppress absolute enjoyment of Thor: The Dark World.Apologies for this tennis match I am having with myself in complementing and then hammering Thor: The Dark World's qualities; still I'll continue to play. More positively, the film is possibly the greatest comedic achievement for the superhero squadron on screen to date. One moment had the audience in an uproar of laughter; those that have seen it will know the moment, and those that are yet to see the film will know when they bear witness to its hilarity. Even during other scenes where the humour feels slightly inappropriate given the circumstances, you'll easily yield with laughter, or at the minimum, a low-key grin.It's almost superfluous today to commend a modern blockbuster for its CGI quality. However due to its stark visual improvement over its 2011 predecessor, Thor: The Dark World is certainly worth mentioning as an aesthetically potent force which makes the movie a Thorful lot of fun!Whilst the Thorsome Asgardian actors, humour and visual effects are enough to keep Marvel fans entertained for two short hands around the clock, it doesn't take too long to realise that Thor: The Dark World is probably the most forgettable and forced in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, though by no means the first for Marvel (I'm looking at you 'Amazing' Spider-Man). Thor's lack of character development since the end of Thor, along with the villain out of nowhere and no care Malekith make this sequel feel pretty purposeless in the grander scheme of things. And that's not even mentioning Jane Foster: Marvel's version of Daphne from Scooby-Doo, except more pointless, boring, unconvincing and no fun for anyone.After a Thortless and needlessly dull opening 45 minutes, Thor: The Dark World has plenty of surprises along the way to amuse the fandom inside of devotees, that'll shadow its flaws until you really start to think about the film, but it's some fun while it lasts.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I wish I appreciated this more at the time...,"After watching the insult to everyone that was Thor Love and Thunder, watching back the old marvel movies (y'know, when they were actually good) is a bit bitter-sweet. They won't get that magic or sense of wonder back again.I always thought this was a bit slow and forgettable for a marvel film. But compared to everything post- endgame (maybe except no way home) this is top quality. Loki at his best before the silly tv show, Thor a serious resourceful leader, a great supporting cast of warrior crew and characters and Natalie Portman looking great most of the time. Even the jokes hit more than these days. This wasn't a poor film, I wish this had more success, just so we never got to love and thunder, Fat Thor and a female king of asgard. And I loved ragnarok.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Pass the Popcorn review,"The first Thor was a fun, entertaining movie, that featured interesting characters and a very interesting story (I simply love myths and legends), along with good acting and a great villain. It wasn't a masterpiece, but nobody should expect too much of a superhero movie: they are all made to entertain with enjoyable sci-fi mumbo jumbo and some fan service for the female public – which is kind of unusual, since men are the main target audience of superhero movies, and we haven't had any relevant/good female superhero movies recently (or even ever?). But I digress; the important thing here is that the first Thor was good and – according to the superhero movie rule – the sequel should have been even better: was it? Thor: The Dark World starts by telling a myth about Dark Elves, their lord Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) and how he wanted to send the whole Universe into darkness by using a strange substance called the Aether, but was defeated by Asgardians. In the present, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) is still waiting for Thor (Chris Hemsworth) to return after two years, and investigates all anomalies she encounters. Such an anomaly makes her invisible to Heimdall (Idris Elba) for some time, so Thor, worried, comes to take her to Asgard, where they discover that the Aether runs through her veins and is slowly killing her. Chaos ensues as Dark Elves attack Asgard and Thor has to team up with Loki (Tom Hiddleston) to stop them.The first thing that you might notice about this movie is that it is laughably silly, but also very entertaining: it is almost 2 hours long but it doesn't feel like it, and it doesn't bore. Actually, the ending almost feels rushed and I wish it were a bit longer and more developed. Action and non-action scenes alike are entertaining and interesting. But it is very silly: the Dark Elves, the exposition, the story itself – everything feels as if it was made for really dumb people who, hadn't the movie been so simple, would have flooded the internet with ""I don't get it"" threads. But still, I found it enjoyable and laughed at the silliness a few times, especially at that one scene – that goes nowhere – where we see Thor shirtless, washing his hands and then staring at the distance. It lasts a few seconds and is completely useless – except for maybe making girls faint/stare in awe. A truly good movie feature is the villain: Malekith is quiet, ruthless, dangerous – he doesn't joke around, he truly wants to kill everybody.Christopher Eccleston, who plays Malekith, is great (and maybe that's why he never looked good as The Doctor: he's much better at playing villains!), and I want to congratulate him for being able to stand 6 hours of make-up every time to look like Malekith. Tom Hiddleston is simply amazing as Loki, he stole the show and fit his role perfectly. Too bad he got so little screen time, especially considering the other actors. Hemsworth is still good, but Anthony Hopkins and Natalie Portman are just awful. I can understand Portman's horrible performance, since she wanted out of the project (but wasn't allowed) when Patty Jenkins, who should have directed this Thor, dropped out due to creative differences. I still have to find a reason why Hopkins looks so bored and tired the whole time. I sure hope one of them gets a Razzie for Worst Supporting Actor, because they really ruined the movie – just like the awful green screen in some scenes, which is shameful for a movie that has such a big budget. In conclusion, Thor: The Dark World is an entertaining popcorn flick that could have been better but that you'll enjoy nonetheless.Rating: 7/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.com/",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
beautiful movie,"Though the closed captioned Star Trek like elves detracted from the quality, the rest of this movie was wonderful. The rejection of Loki by his family causes the audience to truly sympathize. On top of this, he faces threats by Thor and his friends, as Thor just assumes Loki wants revenge for the death of their mother merely because Thor does. The part where we see the brotherly interaction as they argue over how to direct the spaceship was adorably accurate and hilarious. I think this movie is being rated so poorly due to the closed captioned elf scenes, which were boring, but I loved everything else, especially the end where Loki winds up on the throne because he is disguised as Odin.

I like fun movies,Give Hemsworth a nod. Anthony Hopkins is always good. Tom Hiddelston is good in that role as Loki. Both this and Ragnarok were fun romps. Great to see Natalie Portman in this. Of course the Aether goes after her in the movie. Also that gal who played her friend was a natural. Like to see the that kind of excellence. At first I didn't realize that was Rene Russo playing the mother. Guess it's been awhile.

"A different, better and more confident film than the original","Fresh from his ""New York"" gig (The Avengers), we have the second solo instalment for the man god with the Hammer, ""Thor"" (Chris Hemsworth).Back on his home world Asgar, his brother ""Loki"" (Tom Hiddleston) is languishing in a cool ""Apple style"" prison, whilst Thor and his merry band mop up the last few elements of unruliness. This will ensure the nine realms live happily ever after, under the benign rule of ""Odin"" (Anthony Hopkins) and his much loved wife Frigga (Rene Russo).Meanwhile in an ancient flashback we get acquainted with Aether, a very dark power the Dark Elve warriors ""Kursed"", led by Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) are keen to get their hands on. They are frustrated in this endeavour by the armies of Asgard, led by ""Bor"", Odin's father from many thousands of years ago.Back on Earth, Astrophysicist ""Jane"" (Natalie Portman) is led by her intern ""Darcy"" (Kat Dennings), equipped with her own PA, to an abandoned warehouse where objects appear to act oddly, disappearing to another dimension when dropped from a staircase.Separating from the group, Jane is suddenly teleported to another realm as you do and becomes possessed by the ancient super weapon Aether, an easy mistake to make whilst out taking a stroll.Concerned for Jane's safety, after being alerted to her plight by Fandral (Idris Elba), Thor brings Jane to Asgard. It is obvious her presence in Asgard is dangerous, as it lures the Kursed like a moth to the light, or darkness to the Aether. Following events, Thor is obliged to trust Loki and Fandral to find a way to leave Asgard against his fathers wishes, leading to an attempt to trick Melkith and destroy the Aether.Can Loki be trusted, is the fate of the world's safe, will the foretold alignment of all nine realms lead to a cataclysmic event, all good comic book questions to answer.The film is an obvious upgrade from the original film with a budget to match, Hemsworth and Hiddleston play their parts with consummate ease and obvious glee. Hemsworth retaining his almost Shakespearean style of delivery, which remains a source of amusement to the audience but is largely accepted by the earth bound characters. Both lead actors star wattage is much higher than before and clearly are enjoying every scene and one-liner. It is now difficult to imagine either part being played by other actors.As before, the film seemingly represents a hybrid of earlier movies, stealing like a hyperactive magpie from new Star Wars and Lord of the Rings. Occasionally the slim story and movie Macguffin (Aether) is exposed and the film skirts close to Game of Thrones (GOT) without the sex and gore. All huge throne rooms, fabulous cities and dark portentous events hanging over proceedings. Director Alan Taylor, previously directed 6 GOT episodes which may explain the similarities.However, if you treat the film as pure entertainment, as you should, there is much fun to be had. Buoyed by the lead actors having a blast and not taking themselves too seriously. However Hopkins looks somewhat uncomfortable, perhaps not getting the ""do not take this too seriously memo"" and Rene Russo gets little to do. However gate keeper Elba, obviously a much bigger star than before, gets his role beefed up accordingly.Back on earth, Stellan Skarsgard as a scientist helping Jane, gets ready for his ""Nymphomaniac"" Lars Von Triers directed role, by spending much of the time in a state of undress or in an institution, presumably the pay was good. Portman, understandably performing heroine in distress duties most of the time still manages to be attractive, strong and vulnerable as required. We also get a brief cameo from Chris O'Dowd as Jane's prospective boyfriend post Thor, good luck with that endeavour.There is plenty of humour to puncture the preposterousness of a man/god with a big hammer smashing stuff up, which is almost a pre-requisite in our post-modern, self referential movie world.Watch out for two post credit sequences, a neat cameo and of course Stan Lee, all now well established Marvel studio trademarks.SummaryA different, better and more confident film than the original and continues to expand the Thor universe in an interesting way.Hemsworth and Hiddleston are on fine form, if you like comic book superhero films with state of the art effects and enjoyable characters, this will do very nicely.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"More like a Star Wars retread, only with the Marvel label.","Following the fast-paced and adrenaline-pumping Marvel film Thor, this sequel pales in comparison. It features the return of super god Thor (Chris Hemsworth), who tries to save Dr. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) after she gets cursed with a powerful entity known as the Aether. However, an evil race called the Dark Elves wants the Aether to conquer the universe.This movie was rather slow and at times, boring - just a lot of talk that really goes no where. The overdone special effects made the movie look like a Star Wars retread and a story appeared it couldn't make up its mind if it's a drama or comedy. At certain poignant moments, the characters didn't really show any emotion, with the plot not allowing time for the audience to generate any sympathy. And, much of the comedy were very corny and lame, making you not wanting to take this film seriously.Hemsworth and Portman still had some good chemistry and did their best in their acting with what they were provided. Thor's fellow warrior comrades, Sif (Jaimie Alexander), Fandral (Zachary Levi), Volstagg (Ray Stevenson) and Hogun (Tadanobu Asano) were great in the film, but sorely underused. I could have really done without the corny Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings) and her clueless intern - really lame jokes and dialog offered by them, and they served no real purpose in the movie as a result from their dumb performances.There were dabs of exciting action scenes here and there, as well as a suspenseful plot point where Thor have to rely on his not-so-friendly brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) for help. But overall, there's really nothing new in this movie - just another hero vs. villain-who-wants-to-conquer-the-world story with messy CGI effects.Grade D+",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Great fight scenes, but a weak villain.","Thor: The Dark World is packed with great action scenes, which is what you get when you add Alan Taylor to the mix. There is no shaky cam, which I find tends to get a bit disorienting, and the camera has you right in the middle of all the battles. There is also a lot of humour, more so than in the first instalment of Thor.But I do have a couple of gripes about this film. At the start of the film, which deals with a bit of Asgardian history, Thor's grandfather hides the Aether where ""no-one will ever find it."" You'd think then that some human scientist wouldn't stumble across it very easily not even half an hour into the film.Also, the villain Malekith was very disappointing. Christopher Eccleston did a good job, but there is no back-story to Malekith, his motives are never fully explained, the audience doesn't get a true sense of who he is, his power is underplayed (I thought) and all in all he's just a rather weak antagonist.Finally, Darcy. Annoying, not particularly funny, adds nothing to the film, I just don't know why she's there. And the intern has as intern? Okay, whatever.But apart from that, I really enjoyed it, great action, and a rather satisfying ending.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Space Elves: The Movie,"Thor: The Dark World has become one of the MCU's black-sheep; and for good reason, because this film forgot to focus on character and decided to go too bombastic without a consistent storyline throughout the whole thing. Needless to say, this is the weakest Thor film because it takes all its set-pieces for granted, the story beats are more or less the same as the first movie, and one of the twists of the first Thor is ACTUALLY repeated (won't say what exactly, but it should be pretty obvious as to what I'm talking about).Thor: The Dark World doesn't know the intimate stuff from the universe-encompassing stuff and the story becomes a mess real quickly, even with Thor and Loki's admittedly fun chemistry on-screen. The film's weighed down by its placeholder villain the Space Elf Malekith: a villain so one-note and uninteresting it's kind of a cinematic miracle he exists at all. A baddie's only as good as the hero he's starring opposite; and Thor 2 doesn't know how to treat Malekith as an equal to the film's co-villain Loki. This is a film that wants to leave you in awe: but it ends up doing the opposite and feels surprisingly empty because of it.Thor: The Dark World gets 2/5 stars. Aside from some good stuff, this film's a forgettable 'blockbuster'.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
UnTHORgettable - http://joshwhitnallfilmreviews.blogspot.co.uk/,"YES! He's back for a third time on our big screens, but this time things appear to be a bit darker and Thor becomes more desperate for help. I felt the first Thor movie was good, but could of been a lot better as I felt it lacked in the action side of things and concentrated more on humor. The Avengers movie showed more of Thor's strength and abilities but I still felt like he was holding back.The story of the film shows Thor (Chris Hemsworth), making up for Loki's (Tom Hiddleston) mistakes by clearing up the nine rounds 'planets', and shows that he doesn't feel like he belongs anymore and misses his mortal lover, Jane (Natalie Portman). He soon manages to reunite with her, but an evil elf named Malekith returns from the past to destroy everything in his path. Thor soon realizes he cannot do this alone, and takes desperate measures by asking Loki for help but the question is can Thor trust him?This new film is the definition of awesomeness. This time we get to see a lot more action, which is both clever as well as fun. We see the hammer used a lot more and we see more of Thor's strength, which helps to prove that he isn't a god to mess with! Marvel have always been clever with there humor and I feel this film is the funniest so far, yes even better than Iron Man 3! It manages to make you laugh even in the more serious of moments. Christopher Eccleston I felt brought a lot to the role of Malekith, despite the face he was unrecognizable, his voice managed to bring originality as well as the sense of darkness that was needed. In the first movie I felt it was hard to connect with Thor, as he is obviously a God, who is hard to be beaten. However in this film I felt more connected, as you could sense his emotional pain, which is mainly loneliness.If you like action, a good laugh as well as a good story, then please go and see this amazing film!

Best Marvel movie of the year.,"Thor 2 - The Dark World , I believe is the best Marvel movie of the year.

Well, I cannot simple say its a flawless film but it emerges our expectations in a good way. Attractive Asgard is a beautiful realm made, and the special / visual effects in the movie are possibly the award winning feature.Good mixture of comedy and drama. Thor with his usual knack humor has done extremely well (*phew* there was lot of hype on Loki).THOR! WOW! The character is perfectly drawn, his strength is depicted very well from the comic Thor. Plus Hemsworth is perfect for the character and I believed it since previous Thor.Little ambiguities in terms of story line especially Jane getting affected by the Aether as if it was simply made to make sure Thor will have a girlfriend beside her, but thanks to Natalie, she gives justice to the character.""Another"" - Thor missed saying it though. *giggles*",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Thor: The Dark World is an enjoyable superhero movie. If only it were more...,"Thor: The Dark World is a movie I have been waiting for a long time. I really enjoyed the first (no matter how average people thought it) and the trailer for the sequel looked awesome. And I hoped it was awesome. Was it awesome? Almost. This movie takes place a few years after The Avengers. The nine realms are at peace until all of a sudden, evil is released. Best synopsis ever. As plots go, it's pretty good. It stays true to the superhero formula and has a couple of plot twists. One is a complete surprise, one is completely predictable. However, there are a lot of plot holes in this movie. Often in the movie, I was scratching my head thinking, ""Wait, how would that work?"" That kind of detracts from the movie a little. Now, I'm going to be straight with you. For the first forty minutes or so, I was thinking, ""Okay, this movie is having a hard time going anywhere."" Yeah, it starts out rough. The beginning of the movie starts out rather dull. It had a hard time pulling me in and keeping me invested. But, when things started going down and punches were thrown, that's when things got interesting. It turned out to be a fun movie, but I wish it had the same charm from the beginning. Speaking of charm, this movie is very funny. It's the funniest Marvel movie since The Avengers (which isn't saying much because the only other Marvel movie that came out after The Avengers is Iron Man 3, but it's still the funniest). There were chuckle moments and even moments that had me laughing out loud. However, there were some jokes that felt stale. Most of them came from Kat Denning's character. I think she's very cute, but she didn't really have that much of a point in this movie. The action is what you'd except in a superhero movie; action packed awesomeness. And that's what this movie has. It was just cool seeing Thor wipe out a bunch of people with his hammer. IT'S SO SATISFYING! Overall, this movie is good. It isn't quite as good as the original Thor, but I still enjoyed it. It's definitely a worthy successor to The Avengers and it's definitely worth checking out. And it has not only an awesome Stan Lee cameo, but also an awesome cameo of a certain Avenger. No spoilers, just saying.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A let down to a improved sequel,"Thor: The Dark World follows Thor, Son of Odin, after the events of The Avengers with the tension between his brother and him still tense and a new issue caused by family a long time ago affecting his current life with his love and the world he has grown to love too.Alan Taylor does a very good job directing. Improving on the first film with its overuse of dutch angles and keeping the filmmaking more simplistic and stylistic. The best part of the film is the action scenes are very well filmed and beautifully designed with special effects, great direction, and fantastic acting. This is though not Taylor's best film in his career and it sadly is the weakest Thor film in the now trilogy with a lot of issues from the script and some questionable acting choices as well that could come from Taylor or the casting director.Getting to the writing, it feels like each act in the film is written by a completely different person and has a few times that I felt like I was watching a different film completely with each act change. The script portrays the main antagonist as this one sided generic villain that has just one job and it is to destroy the universe, heard of that one before?, yeah me too. And especially with Iron Man 3 having a very rich villain, it falls short on the writing. Besides that the characters written are all good. But I do feel like they were trying to cram in as much as they can into this film which was completely unnecessary for this aftermath film. Then the tone change, with it going from extremely dark and serious scenes to awkward comedy doesn't transfer well at all in this film and honestly doesn't feel like a Marvel film when rewatching it.The acting is overall amazing. Hemsworth drastically improved in this stand alone film compared to the first in his acting. Hiddleston is once again amazing as the god of tricks and his manipulation and use of great plan developing to get what he needs. Even minor characters like Thor's warriors and his mom and dad all are so much stronger than the first film and have a lot more useful parts and more defining roles than the first film which is nice. But the main villain once again comes off bad compared to the rest of the film. It could've been from the prosthetics but his acting comes off so bland and feels like his voice is one of those computer text-to-speech things. But one character compared to an ensemble of amazing actors can be forgotten.With a huge issue of storytelling and a single character that could've been better written and acted.

Fun yet predictable action/superhero movie,"When the original Thor was released in 2011 It came out in a midst of wondering as to whether it would connect with audiences. Was the public ready to take to an actual hammer wielding God played by a then virtually unknown Australian actor in a setting that seemed ripe for parody? In 2014 the answer is an overwhelming yes with Thor and in a real world sense Chris Hemsworth becoming one of the most popular Marvel screen incarnations but with this popularity comes more expectation. The original Thor was a pleasantly entertaining surprise directed with a stately manner by Brit Kenneth Branagh so how does the sequel match up? The worst thing about Thor: The Dark World is just how achingly predictable the whole plot line is and if it were not for that there is much to enjoy in this sequel that doesn't take itself too seriously and features a rampant pace that is missing in many middling Blockbusters of recent times. Most scenes in the movie feel well paced and edited with barely a moment in between set pieces to catch your breathe. It's perhaps thanks to Game of Thrones mainstay and now Dark World director Alan Taylor that the film plays out in such a manner and produces some at times highly impressive visuals and vistas. With all this highly polished production and behind the scenes wins going back to the story is what makes the movie sadly such a forgettable one.Thor's original casting was a major win in the beginning and again the leads in Hemsworth, Portman, Hiddleston and Hopkins all do a fine job with their respective roles with predictably banter between both Thor and Loki a particular highlight. Eccleston as the lead villain Malekith is sadly a complete non-event with what is perhaps the most lame and uninteresting Marvel screen villain we have yet seen (that is saying something when you look back to The Sandman). In concerns to the story it seems like an afterthought with the melodrama that plays out within it and there is never any real sense of the stakes as the film just doesn't try enough to have that dread that worked so well with the Avengers or even the original Thor.To criticise a story in a Marvel movie may seem trivial but to go with your bang for your buck you want your brain engaged also with a story that feels somewhat fresh and original and sadly despite spectacle and an easy going charm The Dark World misses this mark badly. In saying this characters within the film remain interesting in their own right and with such a brisk pace the film truly never outstays its welcome.3 convenient cave time travel portals out of 5P.S – as per usual with a Marvel jaunt make sure your stay through all the credits!For more movie reviews and opinions check out -www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Thor: The Dark World has a few decent ideas and solid performances from Hemsworth, Portman, and Hiddleston, but overall feels a step down from its predecessor.","Sometime after the events of The Avengers, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) has returned his villainous adoptive brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) to Asgard where to face judgement at the hands of Loki's adoptive father and Thor's father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) who sentences him to imprisonment within Asgard's dungeons mostly due to the intervention of Odin's wife and Loki's adoptive mother Frigga (Rene Russo). While Thor leads victorious battles across the nine realms seeking to bring about peace, he often remains distracted his thoughts of astrophysicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), the human woman he met and fell in love with when last he was on Earth. When Jane finds an anomaly in London that bears a similar energy signature she stumbles into a void where a malevolent force attaches itself to her. When Heimdall (Idris Elba) tells Thor he can no longer see Jane, Thor goes to Earth to find Jane and bring her back to Asgard to help her. Unbeknownst to them, the force attached to Jane is an ancient weapon that is sought by Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) the king of the Dark Elves, an adversary of Asgard long thought to be dead who seek to plunge the universe into eternal darkness.Following the decent success of the first Thor movie, Marvel and Disney eventually committed the resources to develop a sequel to the film. While director Kenneth Branagh had initially intended to return for a sequel, he didn't feel he could deliver a film in the quick time Marvel and Disney wanted and bowed out. This lead to a scramble for a new director with choices such as Brian Kirk and Patty Jenkins briefly attached while also bowing out for various reasons until eventually Alan Taylor took the reins. Upon release the film received mixed but positive skewing reviews and made $650 million against an estimate $150-170 million budget but is often seen as one of the lesser entries in the early days of the MCU. While I maintain that Iron Man 2 is still slightly worse, Thor: The Dark World is a film I often struggle to remember with only a few highlights sticking out.In terms of character I like how unlike the Iron Man films it does feel like Thor has evolved and undergone development with his experiences across both the first film and The Avengers. The movie also dives a little further into the love story angle present between Jane and Thor in the first film and while Jane isn't the most interesting character as she's essentially there for reactions to the wonder of Asgard, the chemistry between Hemsworth and Portman is really good and the romantic scenes feel like what George Lucas wanted to do with Attack of the Clones only with better chemistry and dialogue. It's no surprise that Patty Jenkin's intention was to frame the story as a ""forbidden romance"" narrative inspired by Romeo and Juliet because that element of the story does feel like the most substantive and resonant part. The movie also gives us some good scenes with Hiddleston's Loki very enjoyable in his return with a unique way in which he factors into the plot, and Rene Russo who was barely there in the first entry is given some more meat to chew on characterwise that it's unfortunate more wasn't done with it.Where Thor: The Dark World faulters however is in the actual superhero aspects of the story, especially the villains with Christopher Eccleston's Malekith being one of the most boring villains in both design in writing that I've seen in the MCU. While Eccleston is a solid actor as anyone who's seen Let Him Have It or the first series of the Doctor Who revival can attest, Malekith feels so generic with no real character besides universal domination and a character design that makes him feel like a forgettable villain of the week on Star Trek. It's been about 10 years since I've seen this movie before my second viewing, and upon watching it I remember very little about this character with no standout quotes or deliveries to the point I'd forgotten what he even looked like. The stuff with the human characters isn't all that great either with Stellan Skarsgard's return as Erik Selvig doing a lot of strange things who's behavior is explained by events in the Avengers that don't make sense if you remember Hawkeye, and while Kat Denning's Darcy is still unnecessary, at least she's dialed back a little bit.Thor: The Dark World seemingly has all the right pieces to make a good story and I did legitimately like Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman together including Thor's character development, but the rest of the movie feels lacking in that same level of personality and it's only made worth the viewing thanks to the inclusion of Loki. Not terrible, but also not an MCU movie I plan to revisit anytime soon.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Good Thor movie, Great Loki movie","This entry in the MCU did much more to advance Loki's character than Thor's, and I'm fine with that because Loki is the most loved/hated, complicated and misunderstood villain/anti-hero in the MCU. In Dark World, Loki had the greatest character arc, from being imprisoned and indifferent to his family, and of questionable loyalty and trustworthiness, to agonizing the death of his mother, and ultimately saving Asgard although remaining mysterious and mischievous throughout. We last see Loki on a great setup for the opening of the third installment. Good humor throughout the film, especially from Professor Selvig. The romance between Thor and Jane Foster was unfortunately a little flat but honestly I think that has less to do with the screenplay and a lot to do with Natalie Portman's acting (she's gorgeous, just not exactly the most convincing actress). I'm not sure how Thor's love life plays out in the comics, I'm sure he ends up with Jane Foster, but I think they should have kept things more interesting with Sif, somewhat of competition for Thor's heart, except Sif never even had a chance which is really a shame, script-wise; a missed opportunity. We don't see anything new from Thor in Dark World, just some additional humbling-down that we saw from him in the first Thor movie when he started off so arrogant, spoiled and entitled, and now he's decided that he'd rather be a superhero than king.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A bit of a letdown...,"Ah yes... ""Thor: The Dark World"" Personally a big let down for me. I didn't have as much fun with this movie as I did the first ""Thor"". This was so bland that even Natalie Portman was visibly bored in the movie (I mean just pay close attention to her face throughout the film and you'll notice it too).I'm not saying it was atrociously bad or anything, just not on par with other Marvel movies.

(As usual loved the chemistry between Loki and Thor, pretty much the only highlight for me in this sequel).",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Loki Rules,"Greetings again from the darkness. While this is the second Thor movie, we feel a bit more familiar with the Norse God thanks to The Avengers. It's not surprising that Chris Hemsworth can hold his own with the character given his looks and physicality, but this time he gets a run for his money thanks to Tom Hiddleston as Loki.The film's real villain is Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) who rules the Dark Elves and is trying to re-capture the all-powerful Aether, a substance of infinite energy. But the whole battle for the 9 realms is really just a sideline to Thor vs Loki, and Thor's touch of humanity and eye for Jane Foster (Natalie Portman). Most of the key characters are back: Anthony Hopkins as Odin (even more over the top this time), Rene Russo (Thor's mom), Ray Stevenson as Volstagg, Jaimie Alexander (Sif), Idris Elba (Heimdall), Kat Dennings (Darcy), and Stellan Skarsgard (Erik Selvig).This sequel is kind of interesting to analyze. It's certainly bigger than the original ... the special effects are huge and much improved. Light comic moments abound, but luckily the snark from Kat Dennings is minimal. Chris O'Dowd shows up for a couple of pretty funny, but slightly out of place scenes. There are a couple of cameos including an off-beat appearance by one of the The Avengers. Rene Russo even gets her own sword fight! Though it matters not to me, I assume there are many who would choose a Skarsgard other than Stellan to run around Stonehenge sans clothes. So while it has all of that going for it, the story is certainly fails at engaging the audience.This one is directed by Alan Taylor, who is quite a successful TV director, and there was clearly some upfront concern over the script as Joss Whedon was brought in for scene doctoring. I believe what we learn is that the fish out of water story works when Thor is on Earth, but it loses impact when Jane Foster visits Asgard. Still, Tom Hiddleston is such fun to watch as Loki, that none of that really matters.It's a superhero movie that will entertain the fans and provide plenty of ammunition for the critics looking to bash. If you see it in the theatre, you should know to stay for BOTH post-movie scenes. A rare Benecio Del Toro sighting makes it worthwhile.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Entertaining but with flaws,"Pros: Its Thor and it will always be entertaining. Comic scenes are perfect and make you laugh. The second half has some great visual effects and good action. The climax fight is what most of the people dint like in the reviews but I loved it. Chris Hemsworth has owned the character and I can't imagine anyone else in that outfit now. Loki is funny and intriguing. Overall a good package but not as good as the first installment.Cons: Comic scenes were good but there were too many. If you wanted it to be dark, you will be a bit disappointed. As a character, Malekith was not developed properly. The story does not revolve much around him even though he is the main villain of the movie. The first half was a bit dull as compared to the second half. The 3d effects are not up to the mark and i was feeling irritated watching it in 3D as there was nothing so great about them that I had to watch everything with a tint of black.Overall if you like Thor, you will like the movie. He is my favorite Marvel character (of course after Tony Stark). Natalie Portman has nothing much to do except being a mess or the source of problems for Thor and Asgard.The post credit scene reveals a bit about Avengers: Age of Ultron and was worth waiting for.The post post credit scene is something you may as well skip as it's definitely not worth the wait.I liked the movie but wanted it to be better.7 on 10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

What I enjoyed was the incorporation of Loki. Tom Hiddlestone is just amazing, but what we get a real glimpse of is his wit and 'younger brother' persona. The chemistry between Thor and Loki is amazing, and their brotherly bickering if delightful.The choreography is terrible how, and it didn't match up with the music at all.

'Dark World' more of the same - with a weaker plot,"2013's follow-up to the Chris Hemsworth-starring Marvel film 'Thor' is one that didn't excite audiences the way other films in the genre have, and has become somewhat overlooked in the studio's library. It's true - 'Thor: The Dark World' was more or less a ""bridge"" movie to get from the bigger hit that was 'Iron Man 3' to the superior 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier,' but it served its purpose.At the center of 'Dark World' is an ancient force called the Aether that takes hold of Thor's love interest Dr. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman). What ensues is a multidimensional cat-and-mouse chase in a race to save Jane and put an end to the destructive plans of an evil elf named Malekith (Christopher Eccleston). So, pretty standard plot for a superhero movie, and much less interesting than the previous film's plot.While the 'Thor' franchise boasts some memorable characters who have good resumes, including Loki (Tom Hiddleston), Odin (Anthony Hopkins), Eric (Stellan Skarsgård) and Darcy (Kat Dennings), their performances in this sequel feel just like a continuation of the first movie - nothing new or special. This applies to the dialogue, as well - it's well written considering the genre, with enough cheekiness and wit to go around, but again, it's same old, same old.As per usual, the special effects are great. The world of Asgard comes to life through the CGI, as do the barren lands of ""the dark world"" (which was aptly filmed in Iceland). But other than these elements, the film is fairly forgettable.'Thor: The Dark World' was a necessary entry in the Marvel film universe, and should be seen as a ""cross off the list"" kind of movie, but it's not near the top of the list when it comes to quality.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A dim light in a dark world...,"The best way to describe this film is....hmmmm? The plot was indecisive for me, and scrappy! It was as if there was never meant to be a sequel to Thor...but they had success in the last one so asked Stevie wonder to knit a movie together...and this was it!The action scenes were impressive as always, and the beautiful Natalie Portman is always a plus...but I can't help feel this may have just crossed the line of too much fantasy!On the other hand..certain elements of the plot did impress me. The emotional scenes of a family torn apart, and the introduction of new creatures and mythical relics seem OK to me...This really is a film which I think needs rewatching to fully grasp the elements...the cliffhanger ending is always a Hollywood classic but can't help but that was a bit farfetched...judgement on this film will be more concise once I know the true depth of what is to come

This Movie Could Have Been Great But Sadly It's.....Low-Key,"To be truly honest there were a lot of neat elements and scenes in this movie, however they were bogged down by several other groan-worthy elements. First let me point out that I thought that Thor (2011) was one of the more impressive of the recent Marvel movies, mostly because of my liking of Norse mythology (no matter how Hollywood-ized it may be). Going into the theater I expected a great movie, though I had some small doubts deep within myself after seeing Avengers. Let me first start with what was good:Tom Hiddleston once again steals the show with his top-notch performance as Loki. Thankfully I was glad to see that they once again made him an in-depth character instead of a one-dimensional cliché boring villain like he was in Avengers.The scenes taking place in the Nine Realms were really breathtaking and unique, I commend the art department for their world design.A lot of the action scenes (outside of Earth) were well choreographed and directed, with enough elements to keep things interesting.The dynamic between Thor and Loki was particularly interesting in this movie, and I was glad that it went beyond ""I hAtez yoi for-eva cause you waz da bad gui in Avengers"".The villains had an interesting dark ascetic too them, almost a strange medieval Gothic mixed with HR Giger and just a splash of Elder Scrolls daedra. At first their ""Teletubbie"" masks were a bit distracting to me, but over time I sort of ignored it for the sake of the movie.Now then, we shall unfortunately go onto the elements that brought the movie down (at least for me):The constant Avengers references got old really quickly, I mean REALLY quickly. Yes we get it, the Avengers happened, now can you please shut up about New York and focus on the current bad guys?A majority of the Earth scenes were slow, boring, dull, and took away screen time from the rest of the film. Perhaps the English tourism council paid Marvel tons of money just to film a majority of the scenes at famous landmarks in England.Jane and the scientists, to me, REALLY bogged this movie down and took away precious time that could be given to other more interesting characters. The constant cussing science assistant and goofy ""were are my pants"" jokes got old pretty quickly.Not harp on Anthony Hopkins, but his portrayal of Odin felt somewhat ""phoned in"". Almost during the entire movie he looked bored and detached, perhaps it could just be the writing and script though.The main dark-elf villain, Malekith the Accursed, seemed to have something lacking to his character. This however is true for most villains in Marvel movies, seems like DC movies get all the well developed villains....The final battle and climax! Oh goodness, I could not take that seriously whatsoever. I mostly blame the lame ""paradox"" gimmicks and the fact that it was taking place *SPOILERS* in the middle of an English university where a bunch of uniformed British students are hanging out by the library windows saying ""By golly! That's bloody daft right there!"".In conclusion I would say that if you want to watch this movie, give it a try, but don't expect a great movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Thor- a bore...?,"Given the possibilities, it's more than a little disappointing that the makers of THOR: THE DARK WORLD would opt to do a story about ""dark elves."" For one thing, there WERE no dark elves in the original comics- not ONE, that I can recall. (Granted, ""this ain't your daddy's Thor,"" but it IS, just revamped for today's less discriminating moviegoers.) Why not do a story about Ulik, mightiest of the Rock Trolls...? ('Cause this ain't your daddy's Thor...?) To see the mighty troll marshal his army to invade Asgard itself would've been great. Consider: We see an Asgradian outpost on the edge of the Troll Lands. Battle-armored trolls attack the outpost (using the widest array of weapons imaginable, forged in their underground furnaces). Cut to another outpost, as trolls emerge from underground to attack and capture it. Thor (wearing his trademarked helmet, which he DOESN'T in THOR: THE DARK WORLD) gathers his men for a counter-attack. The armies battle to a standstill- at which point Ulik steps forth to challenge Thor to a one-on-one slugfest (no cgi, just breakaway boulders and such). Here, we discover that Loki has had a hand in the troll invasion, giving them strategic information every step of the way. Thor, to overcome superior numbers, calls forth a thunderstorm that wipes the troll army back from whence it came. Compare THAT scenario to what we see in THE DARK WORLD. I don't think I've seen a movie with so many clichéd lines in quite a while. While the makeup effects and the cgi are better than in the first film, the story is every bit as ponderous: scenes drag on interminably at times, with pompous characters hammering the point(s) mercilessly- and the attempts at humor, while they might garner the occasional chuckle, are sophomoric at best and are used more often than not to undermine the ""seriousness"" of the situation(s). And am I the only one more than a little tired of the post-credit ""tag"" scenes?

Not great but not terrible either.,"The only reason I am writing this review is because the reviews I have seen here are either someone hated it totally or thought it was the best movie they ever saw. The truth is somewhere in the middle, Thor will never be the best movie you ever saw, nor will it be the worst ever, if you think its the worst ever then you haven't seen Dragonball evolution.What can i say about this movie, There was far too much going on to connect with the characters in too short a time.Yet still, the acting scenes and action were solid. The movie just lacked emotional substance, which you would expect from a Thor movie. Things could have been explored a little differently especially when it comes to romance and some other of Thor's relationships including Natalie Portman's character, Jane. There was a lot of one dimensionality to the characters with the exception of Loki. Other than that this movie was solid fun.I would suggest renting it or having it in your DVD collection, for that boring Saturday.

Very forgettable,"This one finds itself lost in the shadows, unable to spark. Directed by Alan Taylor, this Marvel installment struggles to distinguish itself, delivering a rather average superhero experience.Chris Hemsworth continues to embody the God of Thunder, but the film doesn't provide substantial growth for the character. Thor's internal conflicts lack the depth seen in other MCU entries, making him feel somewhat stagnant in comparison.The narrative attempts to explore the cosmic consequences of the Aether but falls short of creating a truly engaging storyline. The dark elves, led by Malekith played by Christopher Eccleston, serve as forgettable villains with minimal impact. The lack of a compelling antagonist diminishes the stakes and weakens the overall narrative drive.While the film maintains the visual spectacle expected from Marvel, the realms of Asgard and the dark world of Svartalfheim lack the innovative flair seen in other cosmic MCU entries. The visuals, though competent, don't leave a lasting impression.Natalie Portman's Jane Foster is given a central role, but the romantic subplot with Thor feels forced and doesn't resonate emotionally. The chemistry between the characters lacks the charm seen in other Marvel pairings, making it challenging to invest fully in their relationship.The film does have its moments of humor, largely courtesy of Tom Hiddleston's Loki. Hiddleston's charismatic performance injects much-needed energy, providing some relief from the otherwise lackluster elements.Overall it is entertaining enough to watch it once and forget about it so you can get on with the rest of the saga.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Like a mediocre episode of Stargate Atlantis.,"As I was watching this movie, I kept getting the feeling I was just watching a television show, with flat camera angles, blandly staged shots, and not great CGI.

I think I could have looked past it eventually if the story was interesting, but it really wasn't.

THOR 2 enters my ALL TIME FAVORITE list,"The second installment of the saga of the God of Thunder is rocking awesome!!! I haven't had so much fun in a movie theater since THE LORD OF THE RINGS. It's that good. The Hobbit on the other hand isn't near close. Thor is nothing like the other Marvel movies about super heroes. This one is a totally different animal. It is up there with the big boys-Star Wars, Star Trek and The Lord of The Rings. I could tell that the movie crew spent a good amount of time to make it right. This is not a fast production for easy cash ins. This one is The Real Deal-A True Movie Magic! I was a bit afraid that the second one is not going to match the quality of the first one. I mean how do you top the scene where Thor is being cast out of Asgard by his father Odin. The level of acting delivered by Anthony Hopkins was just awe inspiring! Well, the second one has few of those scenes and it just keeps delivering. How long has it been since I wanted to see a movie over again. Thor and Thor 2-Tthe Dark World are an instant classic and as I love to say: Do yourselves a favor and see those two movies! I recommend regular projection over 3d screening since the film was originally shot in 2d and was meant to be viewed in 2d. It is cheaper too. Actually if you go to a morning projection in any theater you will pay close to nothing. I payed only $6.00! If you don't want to pay that you can always rent it off of the RED BOX kiosks for a dollar and some cents(the movie will take a few months to be available to rent). Always pick the blu-ray over DVD for richer colors, greater resolution, crisp details, supreme audio quality and that cinema feel that is bigger than life.I want you to know that my review is totally independent.

Marvel Universe Season 2 Episode 2,"""You must be truly desperate to come to me for help.""The second phase of the Marvel universe began this summer with Iron Man 3 which was a film I enjoyed very much, but really hasn't seemed to stick with me. I'm afraid the same problem can be said about Thor: The Dark World, which was an entertaining movie but I don't think I'd enjoy it as much on a second viewing. Most of these films are fun and exciting as you experience them for the first time, but the magic seems to vanish for me after a few weeks. Perhaps The Avengers was so great that these sequels don't seem to live up to the standard set by Joss Whedon. I still had a great time in the movies and enjoyed the sequel to Thor considering I wasn't blown away by the first film either. By now Thor knows exactly who he is and doesn't have to prove anything to anyone, so we get to see him in action with his might hammer quite a bit. At times the film has a sort of Star Wars vibe to it mixed with The Lord of the Rings (with Jane reminding me of Frodo), but the final action scene suffers from something we've seen in way too many superhero films recently: buildings getting completely destroyed and blown up. It also mixes some elements near the end that we've seen in Jumper, but all in all the film succeeds thanks to the great chemistry between Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston. The way they played off each other and interacted was the highlight of the film, and Hiddleston was extremely funny here. I wasn't a huge fan of his in the first Thor, but after The Avengers I began to enjoy his performance, and his character in this sequel is better than ever. I wasn't blown away by the action scenes, but I did like the smaller comedic and light moments which the film had to offer. The film is entertaining enough to garner at least one watch.The film picks up after the events of The Avengers with Thor (Chris Hemsworth) back in Asgard serving his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) trying to restore peace to the nine realms that his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has altered. Loki is sentenced to prison after his mother Frigga (Rene Russo) insists he shouldn't be killed. It turns out to be a good decision because Thor will need his service after the city is attacked by a race of beings known as the Dark Elves. Their leader, Malekith (Christopher Eccleston), is searching for a weapon known as the Aether which had been taken away from him thousands of years ago by Odin's father. Since the aether couldn't be destroyed, the Asgardians had to hide it. In the meantime Jane (Natalie Portman), who hasn't seen or heard from Thor since he left two years ago, along with her assistant Darcy (Kat Dennings) discover an anomaly very similar to the one that had brought Thor to Earth in the past. When she goes to investigate she is sucked by some sort of wormhole and ends up right next to the place where the aether had been hidden. After Heimdall (Idris Elba) warns Thor that Jane has disappeared, he goes after her, but somehow Jane has awaken Malekith which is what provoked his attack in Asgard in the first place.Thor: The Dark World is pretty generic and follows a similar formula of most superhero films. That is the reason why so many scenes remind us of other scenes we've seen in other action films. I was never at the edge of my seat during any of the action scenes, but I did have a great time with the light and funny moments. Some people actually enjoyed the action sequences in this film, but it really didn't do anything new for me. The highlight of the film for me was Tom Hiddleston and the scenes he was in were probably the most memorable of the movie. Jamie Alexander, Zachary Levi, and Ray Stevenson all return for their supporting roles here as Thor's soldier/warriors but their characters aren't really developed too much. It is strange to see a summer blockbuster film in November but I guess that the timing was right considering all the superhero films that came out this year. Thor doesn't stand out (and I guess none really did this year), but it is still an entertaining movie. This Marvel universe is growing so fast with all these films that at times it feels like a TV series. So I guess it was a good idea that they brought in the Game of Thrones director, Alan Taylor. He has made an enjoyable film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"The little girl who loved Thor in ""Adventures in Babysitting"" (1987)...","My biggest complaint with that great British thespian/director Kenneth Branagh's take on ""Thor"" (2011) was that its titular character, Thor (Chris Hemsworth), the God of Thunder in Norse mythology reinterpreted as a Marvel Comics superhero, seemed to adjust to life on Earth fairly quickly after being exiled here by his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) as a lesson in humility.That problem can be forgiven here (since in the grander scheme of things, my overall opinion is hardly consequential to anything), since two years have passed and Thor has spent that time on his home-world of Asgard, rather than on Earth, even though he still longs for his mortal would-be girlfriend Dr. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), and she for him.And that's one of the things to take away from ""Thor: The Dark World"" - the resolutions of various relationships - with Alan Taylor replacing Kenneth Branagh (who brought some Shakespearean-styled drama to a superhero movie with the first ""Thor"") and he takes the series into much darker territory, even though there's still a variety of well-placed humor here to liven things up a little bit; imagine even a smidgen of humor in Christopher Nolan's ultra-serious ""Dark Knight"" movies - oh, the horror!To be fair, I enjoyed this picture more than I did the first one, if because the changes in the director's chair also resulted in a change of direction into a darker one. So again, Earth is in danger from an other-worldly threat that is beyond human comprehension. The Mighty Thor is forced to not only save our planet, but his own as well, from the genocidal warlord Malekith (Christopher Eccleston), a Dark Elf who sacrificed his entire army to try to defeat Asgard in a thrilling a prologue, only to go into hibernation for 5,000 years so that he could once again try to wipe out Asgard, something that requires the life of the human Jane Foster for him to do.So Thor is forced to do the unthinkable: he must team up with his traitorous adopted brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston, a ""Thor"" film's best performer, once again), who is now currently imprisoned for his crimes against humanity in ""Thor"" and ""The Avengers"" (2012), if they are to save both Earth and Asgard.The focus in ""Thor: The Dark World,"" aside from the various superhero battles, are the relationships - chiefly Thor's romance with the human Jane Foster, and his complicated familial relationships with his parents and of course, Loki, who still vies for the throne of Asgard. And it's also about how Thor must juggle all these if he is to save two worlds from a threat that not even he can defeat all on his own (hence the teaming up with Loki).I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I did ""Thor."" Here is one of those rare sequels that performed better than its predecessor.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Bland and forgettable but has its qualities.,"The movie is all over the place. Possibly the worst pacing of any movie I've ever scene, with random scenes that slow down the film while not actually having a purpose of being there. Some of the characters have been improved upon since the first thor film while others have had a major downgrade. Thor, I believe, had an upgrade, he is much more likeable in this movie and continues to make the right choice and shows how his character has developed since the fist film. Loki was probably the biggest disappointment, he really played no role in this movie and was just thrown in at stupid points in the story. Loki also had an unnecessary amount of comedic lines which really does not fit his character at all, especially in a movie like this. Jane Foster was awful. The dark elves were awful. The scientist guy that runs around naked was awful. Even the mothers death was awful. The soundtrack for the movie was good though...yeah. Not marvels finest work.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Sequel curse sets in,"Some powerful force that was hidden by the Asgardians ages ago is discovered by some kids in England. Jane shows up and is infected by the force. Thor takes her to Asgard and Odin finally reveals what all this is about. The evil Elves who want this force invade Asgard and close all exit portals trapping the gods. By using this force, the Aether, they can destroy the universe and let nothingness rule. That forces Thor and his sidekicks to join forces with the imprisoned Loki. But can they trust Loki? Long CGI carnage ensues between the Asgardians and the Elves, Loki, Thor and the main villain. It's no mystery who wins the battle. We get several instances of Asgardian politics- Thor's insecurity of being the ruler, Loki's ambition, and Odin's wisdom. At the end we're left with...questions to be answered by part 3 I guess.Thor I was beautiful, captivating, fascinating, visually and story-wise. Thor II just falls flat. Almost entirely without charm, it teaches us nothing new about the Norse world. Relationships don't matter here all that much and Loki gets slapped by some girl. It took 3 writers to come up with this weak story that's just there to justify hundreds of millions wasted in dull CGI battles. And what better way to ruin a good thing than by hiring a director with near zero experience in movies and hand him the (formerly) strongest of the superhero franchises so far. Thor II is disappointment. These movies have gone into industrial mode, are being cranked out by the dozen now without regard to quality, anyone who's got time is hired to direct. A shame, but typical greedy cynical Hollywood behavior. Hopefully someone who actually cares will take control of Thor III before they start hiring rappers and Bruce Willis to act, try to sell us some lame soundtrack, and let Thor become a copy of Transformers 8.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Thor can be better superhero,"Marvel has made a terrible machine for earning money, and it is still today a priority at the movies. I'm not saying that they recorded a very bad films, but to me they are just average (except for Iron Man and The Avengers). So record a movie and give a teaser to another, recording another, giving a teaser for the third, and so on ... What concerns the film itself, I was somewhat impressed. They're great cast assembled for this movie, but we know who will spend most of their time on the big screen. Fight scenes and CGI are superb as expected, but I still want something a little more than a movie. I liked Loki, who confirmed his class. The effects are excellent, although I felt a little robbed Star Wars, but alright. Of course, there is a scene after the credits, and then patience for a minute, if a little track you will see they announced another film in the world of Marvel. The new machine for printing money. DC what are you waiting for?!?!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
What the hell?,"This was made when Marvel movies were really hit or miss, and this was one of the last misses before Age of Ultron. They made almost all of the characters unlikeable and the villain? I don't remember his name let alone his morals or motivations. Just another forgettable superhero movie that no one really asked for. If you're gonna have a movie be forgettable, at least make it fun in the moment, y'know?",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
