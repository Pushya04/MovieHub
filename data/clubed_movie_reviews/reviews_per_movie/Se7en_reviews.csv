Very grim and disturbing but you can't stop watching,"Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire. He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Meanwhile Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed.Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.If you have trouble with blood, gore and disturbing subject matter stay far away from this movie. But if you can handle that, watch this one. It's depressing and unpleasant but riveting.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
An out and out classic.,"A retiring Detective and a young rookie are hunting down a serial killer, a killer with a dark MO, murdering his victims using the seven deadly sins.As I watch this, it's coming up to its thirtieth anniversary, and it's as fresh now as it was back in 1995, it's an intensely macabre take, crimes that are infinitely macabre and depraved, and intensely twisted.The combination of Freeman and Pitt is incredible, they work immensely well together, we have the fresh zest of Mills, and the unshakable, but battle weary Somerset. Paltrow and Spacey are excellent in support.Two hours flashed past, there is no lull, no moment to switch off and boil the kettle, the intensity is immediate, the pacing designed to keep you glued.I have always thought there is a shade of Alfred Hitchcock about this movie, such is the intelligence of the plot.Very good visuals, the macabre and gruesome bodies look shocking still, nothing is spared or hidden away.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Still manages to astound after 20 years of repeat viewings,"After his calamitous experience working on his d√©but film Alien 3 (1992), David Fincher took on a small genre picture that, little did he know, would revitalise his career and become one of the greatest films of the 1990's. Se7en appears to begin as your typical detective neo- noir, with the cynical veteran and the naive rookie taking on an elusive serial killer seemed hell-bent on turning the sin against the sinner. But, set in an unnamed and permanently drizzly American city, Se7en is a meditation on evil and a pessimist's depiction on the modern world, climaxing in one of the bravest and most memorable endings in Hollywood history.Detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is on the verge of retirement, where he plans to leave his inner-city life behind him after years of fighting on the side of good. His replacement is the brash Detective Mills (Brad Pitt), an optimistic young recruit eager to learn, who Somerset takes under his wing. Their first homicide investigation involves an obese man who has been fed at gunpoint to the point of causing his stomach to rupture. With Somerset ready to leave the force, Mills takes on his first solo case in the murder of a rich attorney, a man forced to cut a pound of flesh from his own body. The murder scene has the words 'greed' written in blood. Somerset eventually finds the word 'gluttony' etched in grease in the apartment of the first victim, and he becomes convinced the murders are connected, and that the killer is murdering under the guidance of the seven deadly sins.The genius of Se7en is rooted in the way the movie keeps the audience as clueless as the detectives. Normally in genre pictures such as this, we either know who the killer is and eagerly wait for the investigators to put the pieces together, or we have a line-up of suspects and red herrings to decide from. Here, apart from brief glimpses during a thrilling chase scene, we are devoid of clues. The killer is always one step ahead of Somerset and Mills, alluding to the idea that the mysterious 'John Doe' is indeed having his work guided by a higher power. Of course, he is not, he is merely a man, but this helps gives Se7en dramatic weight, rather than it becoming a nihilistic exercise in cruelty.When, three-quarters of the movie in, the killer hands himself in, the movie becomes a masterclass in writing, slowly building into one of the greatest climaxes in film. Somerset, a decent man who has devoted his life to the side of good but has had the fight slowly drained out of him, meets his nemesis in John Doe (Kevin Spacey). But as they talk, Doe's reasoning becomes clear and, shockingly, almost sympathetic. ""Wanting people to listen, you can't just tap them on the shoulder anymore, you have to hit them with a sledgehammer,"" he says. It's about a world gone to s**t, a view shared by Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow), who talks to Somerset in a diner about allowing a baby to be born into the world after discovering she is pregnant. Cerebral and Gothic, Se7en transcends the genre on so many levels thanks to some bleak yet stylish direction by Fincher, and it still manages to astound after almost 20 years of repeat viewings.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"A brilliant postmodern film noir that is grim, intelligent and disturbing","From David Fincher, Se7en is a compelling and brilliant postmodern film noir. It is grim and disturbing but it is also very intelligent and daring. What I did love about Se7en especially is that it is incredibly stylish, beautiful dark cinematography and dazzling landscapes really do add to the atmosphere. Very little of the murders are shown but we are appalled and shocked by what we hear of them, the action is tense and the climax is shattering. There is also an intelligent screenplay, a clever plot telling of a vicious serial killer who murders his victims in a gruesome way to atone for the sins(gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy and wrath)he deems them to have committed and excellent direction. The acting is also superb, Morgan Freeman gives another brilliant performance as the disillusioned detective and Brad Pitt is great as Mills in a more meatier role than he has ever done. Gwyneth Paltrow makes a small yet significant appearance as Mill's uneasy wife, while Kevin Spacey superbly delivers equally superb dialogue as John Doe despite the fact he isn't in the film much. Overall, a brilliant film, with adept performances, direction, style and ambition. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Probably the greatest murder story ever,"Seven's quality puts it so far beyond most of the ""cops on trail of deranged killer"" genre that it comes out as a true jewel of cinema. Everything about seven is perfect. It is art captured on film. This movie is a bright spot for all of the stars who worked on it.Brad Pitt never gets the credit he deserves for his acting because he's a pretty boy and the press is a lot more interested about how he and Jennifer are doing. That's a shame because he is a talented actor that isn't afraid to take chances with both the roles that he picks and the characters that he plays. That is quite rare in the A-list world. Morgan Freeman is a great actor. You can always count on him to do what he does best which is play a wise veteran that has seen it all. Kevin Spacey is another great actor that has great range and really puts life and personality into his characters.The real talent of this movie, excluding the actors that brought it to life, is the director David Fincher and the writer Andrew Kevin Walker. Fincher's talents for making a visually stunning film are now well known and he often brings a dark patina to his work. Andrew Kevin Walker must have some incredible demons living inside him. Either that or one hell of an imagination for bringing the intricate story of Seven and the plan of John Doe to life.John Doe's plan really is twisted and I won't be spoiling it here. Suffice to say I have never seen so evil and complicated a plan in a movie before or since. The cinematography of the film is dark but beautiful and throughout the film it is either night or raining or both except for two very brief moments. It is such an emotional movie that you can't keep from being caught up in what is happening. Do you understand and sympathize with what John Doe is doing or do you think him a mad killer that must be stopped.Bottom Line: If you haven't had the opportunity to see Seven yet then you must at least rent it. It is so damn good that I know you will like it. The only reason you wouldn't is because you're just too damn fragile to take something this hardcore.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Somerset's World,"Seldom does a film elucidate the culpability of our culture,of our society, in the mayhem and madness we often find in everyday life. According to Se7en, our culture is drifting through darkness. The mouthpiece for this thematic undercurrent is Somerset, a literate man who also happens to be a detective, a man who can read a clue (""This isn't going to be a happy ending"") or Dante's Inferno with equal aplomb. He even provides the film's final thematic statement with a quote from Hemingway. His quirkiness, perhaps the outgrowth of a brilliant mind, is no worse than that of any prophet or seer of old, those harbingers of Biblical insight whom others always find kooky and offbeat. He is not well loved for his cynical, pessimistic outlook (such that his consuming motivation is to retire and get out of town). However, by the end it becomes clear that it is Somerset who sees our dark world with the prophet's particular clarity. (It is left to his partner Mills to find this out the hard way).Working on us to reinforce this world as Somerset sees it is the film's astounding mise-en-scene, a disturbing film-noir setting developed by director David Fincher and cinematographer Darius Khondji. Flashlights barely illuminate the slimy walls of the roach-infested tenement of one victim and the dark bedroom of another. Rain pours down in buckets. Bird's-eye-view shots of downtown (the city is never named- a generic, everyman's kind of place) show dingy, sooty rooftops and grimy streets. Only the film's closing scene is in bright sunlight, which by then only serves as ironic counterpoint to what we see happening.This is Somerset's vision; both inhabited and described by him. He finds a surprising fellow traveler in, not his partner, but the elusive killer John Doe. Doe shares the vision and provides an unsettling echo to the rumblings and teachings of Somerset. If one looks at life through the Somerset lens, one must admit that John Doe has a valid point. He and Somerset have arrived at the same conclusion, the difference between them being how they have responded. (Somerset longs to escape to some otherworldly realm in the country. Doe has taken action.)Though gripping and fast moving, this is not an action film. It holds our interest through the workings of horror and mystery: a stark, film-noir detective piece. Except for one tense pursuit through halls and alleys in pouring rain, as well as the bit of ending action, there is surprisingly little violence. We see each murder, save two, after the fact, as a crime scene. This only makes the final act that much more suspenseful.This is a very tight film. Elements within: dialogue, actions, lighting, setting, all of these tend to reinforce one another to paint a solid picture. It is a perverse logic that makes the final and seventh sin complete perfectly the circle of events begun with the first.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Dark and disturbing thriller that will stay with you for ever.,"Rarely there has been a movie with such a good dark and chilling  atmosphere. I even see this movie more as an horror movie than as a  thriller because of that.  ""Se7en"" is unique in many ways. The movies mood is already set right  from the beginning on. The movie starts dark, intense, chilling and  mysterious, a mood that is present throughout the entire movie. It's  very depressing to watch and I mean that in a positive way of the  meaning of the word. The mood is set by good camera work and lighting,  or better said, the lack of it. The music from acclaimed composer  Howard Shore also adds to the chilling atmosphere.  Unlike many other movies from the same genre, the movie is slow paced  and takes it time to develop the characters without falling into some  obvious clich√©'s. The two main characters played by Morgan Freeman and  Brad Pitt are presented as an unlikely police-couple that are different  in many ways from each other but in a way that is also what makes them  such a great couple. Brad Pitt for once has the opportunity to play  more than just the pretty boy and he does it with success. Kevin Spacey  truly plays a bone chilling character, almost just as legendary and  chilling as Hannibal Lecter. I would very much like to see the two of  them put in the same room, just to see who would make it out alive.  Further more it was great to see R. Lee Emrey again as the police  captain.  The movie is filled with some truly gross, sickening and horrifying  scene's, this seriously ain't no kids stuff! The movie has some of the  most sickening murders I have ever seen featured in a movie. But it  aren't just only the gross scene's that are good, there are also some  scene's that are made with lot's of beauty and profession such as the  library scene.  Dark and chilling movie that you will never forget also thanks to the  ending which I will not spoil for you. A real must see.  10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Modern Masterpiece!!,"Gothic, shocking, suspenseful, disturbing and clever, `Seven' marked a new beginning for director David Fincher's career. This dark tale of murder and crime revolves around two detectives in present New York city played by two brilliant actors `Brad Pitt' and `Morgan Freeman' who are paired together to solve a puzzle of murder that is at the hands of a man who kills regarding to the seven deadly sins. Both actors displayed striking performances that are so sharp and realistic sometimes you have to remind yourself that's its all acting.David Fincher's masterpiece really gives us an opportunity of a lifetime, maybe it's one that we don't all wish to share, but by seeing this movie you will experience a glimpse of the horrors that this world is filled with, and a small piece of mind of a man who you only prey you never have to meet.Brad Pitt successfully proves to us that he's not just a pretty face on screen, and that he sinks into his character so well, that you can walk off after the film finishes classifying him as a pretty darn good actor.You wouldn't expect anything else from Morgan Freeman because it's perfectly obvious that this guy was born to play the roles of the smart detective.David Fincher's timeless directing and memorable filming captures all the goods that this film has to offer and will undoubtedly leave you shocked and begging for more films like this. Seven is a step into the harsh realities of life, a realistic portrayal of two detectives investigation into the un-describable horrific world murder, and the darkest realms of the human soul.We can only prey for more classic memorable work from Mr. Fincher and for those future directors who are intent on making a gothic, psychological thriller, make sure you sit down and watch Seven with a pen and paper ready to take notes.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Outstanding Performances / Great Storytelling,"This movie is from start to finish a well produced and directed film.  The performances in this movie are outstanding. Brad Pitt, once again, makes his role a stand-out performance by putting his versatile acting skills into his interpretation of Detective David Mills. Morgan Freeman is well-cast. His brooding acting style fits the character (Detective William Somerset) like a glove, and Gwyneth Paltrow gives her best performance EVER in the role of Brad Pitt's supportive wife/lover (Tracy Mills). And of course, Kevin Spacey who plays the diabolical yet misunderstood serial killer.The movie is suspenseful and in parts very exciting.  There is a ""Pseudo-Noir"" quality to this movie that really fits in well with the content of the film (Serial Killing). It has it's philosophical moments that anyone who thinks a lot about the state of the world today can appreciate. It makes subtle moral judgements without insulting any beliefs that the viewer may have and it also generates debate for any post-film coffee/drinks gathering.Andrew Kevin Walker (Screenplay) has taken the subject of the Seven Deadly Sins and he really puts a great new twist on these themes.  As a writer, I really could appreciate the depth that he goes into with these ideas. The movie gives us just enough information to be entertained and informed yet not bombarded and made bored with too much philosophy.  In this respect, the film doesn't ""preach"" any special meaning even though the film's moral statements are still maintained.  This film can be enjoyed on so many levels and I really enjoyed the third act. One of the best pieces of storytelling and scriptwriting ever.Outstanding performances from everyone involved (And yes, of course, David Fincher does a wonderful job) Say no more. *****",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
one of the best-made films of its era and genre,"Despite clich√©s, and a very depressing finale, this is one of the best-made films of its era and genre.The strengths of the film include an odd relationship between the two lead cops, who seem loosely based on the two lead cops of the ""Lethal Weapon"" series, but who (thankfully) never play for laughs, and never really become ""buddies"" - the young cop is too arrogant, and the older cop has too much experience, which the young cop refuses to acknowledge. The two characters are also brilliantly acted by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt (probably his best performance).There's one odd flaw in the film - about half-way through, I found that I had learned to ""expect the unexpected"" from the film, which meant that the rest of the film was predictable in a bizarre way - simply decide where the expected move would be, and then expect the unexpected move instead. The most obvious instance of this is in the finale itself, which could be guessed at least 5 minutes ahead of time.Normally, this would be a formula for disaster - but fortunately, the high quality of the film-making twists the film into an edge-of-the-seat suspenseful waiting game as we watch with horror the one cop's encounter with the insanity of pure evil.I didn't want to admire this film (to be honest, I dislike Brad Pitt something fierce), but I'm afraid I must - very professionally made, it delivers its promised suspense all the way.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Se7en is a Sinfully Enthralling Thriller!,"Se7en is a nerve-jangling thriller, hauntingly shot by visionary director David Fincher, who crafts one of the most iconic films of all time.Se7en tells the tale of a grisly serial killer who is twisted on delivering a sermon against modern depravity. He murders his victims to atone for the sins he deems them to have committed; his crimes echo the seven deadly sins namely gluttony, greed, sloth, envy, pride, wrath and lust. Tracking this gruesome killer (played with a quiet insanity that makes your flesh crawl, by an actor par excellence ‚Äì no spoilers here!) is a clich√© pair of cops. There's the jaded veteran Detective Lieutenant Somerset (Morgan Freeman who brings great depth and dignity to the part) who is in the last week of his employ with the police department. Partnering him is a young, eager-to-kick-some-evil-butt cop Detective Mills (Brad Pitt whose callowness works perfectly for his character). After killing an overweight man by force-feeding him to death in the name of gluttony and bleeding to death a lawyer for greed, the anonymous killer is now turning his attention to the five remaining deadly sins. As the two men investigate, the gulf between their respective world-views begins to inform everything about how they respond to the savagery of these crimes.It is impossible to deny the potency and artistry with which Fincher executes the material. Although very little of each murder is shown, the director expertly allows suggestion to lead the appalled viewer towards the truly cataclysmic climax. Fincher's sepia-toned gloom successfully lends the film the knock-out punch it intends to. Purposely draining his landscapes of color, and setting all the tense action against rain-washed streets and under-lit interiors, Fincher evokes an atmosphere of nightmarish proportions as he unfolds a gripping tale of urban horror.Se7en is riveting in a gut-twisting way. It plays out at an engaging pace destined to entrance you with its abject horror. The film is as dark and brutal as a film can be, without showing much actual violence. Most of the stuff in the film is implied, but it's so damn disturbing that you feel like you actually saw it. And that is the beauty of Se7en!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Superbly crafted drama delves into darkest corners of the psyche,"David Fincher's bleak, relentless, and ultimately terrifying crime thriller Seven transcends other films of the genre with incredible plotting (the sort Hitchcock might employ were he alive and making films in the 1990s) and scalding intelligence.  With only a small handful of minor flaws -- the overly familiar retiring cop/young cop pairing; the awful ""I'm taking you off the case!"" cliche seemingly required by the genre; one giant lapse in logic in the downward spiral toward the conclusion that cannot be revealed without ruining the script's gruesome surprise -- Seven typically keeps its viewers imprisoned in their seats with a combination of morbid fascination and abject fear.  Despite attempts by studio executives to alter Andrew Kevin Walker's ending, the filmmaking team prevailed and audiences experienced that rare treat of mainstream cinema: an uncompromising vision.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

"Dark, grisly, and highly intelligent edge-of-your-seat thriller","David Fincher has been one of most thoughtful directors in Hollywood for many years, and his ingenious filmmaking all started in the mid- 1990s with this grim, but intelligently crafted psychological thriller. This film follows David Mills (played by Brad Pitt), a newly transferred police detective in an unnamed crime-ridden metropolitan city, who is partner with an old veteran detective William Somerset (played by Morgan Freeman) who is on the verge of retirement, to investigate a string of gruesome murders all around the city. These murders happen to correlate with the seven deadly sins which include: gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy, and wrath. Mills and Somerset take in matters in their own hands to hunt down the sadistic serial killer (played by an actor who I'm gonna keep a secret) responsible for the grisly murders, only to be faced with a scarring truth about his intentions.This David Fincher masterpiece is not a horror film, but it certainly sits directly at the borderline of one. Complete with eerie visuals and near non-stop suspense from start to finish, this film pulls audience into an unflinchingly grim atmosphere that leaves shivers down their spine and rarely lightens up. To add more to the dark tone, it rain in nearly every scene taking place outside to give them a more somber look. As the plot progresses, the audience are treated with nauseating afterviews of the serial killer's murder. But instead of having the camera linger over the gory details of the victims, we are giving heavy implications of how they particularly occurred. These scenes do just enough without the suspenseful music score to leave viewers at the edge of their seats. Then there is the serial killer himself who is portrayed as very sadistic, almost Lecter Hannibul-like, and creepy in appearance. His way of outwitting the main characters are quite shocking. The actor who plays him does an incredible job on his portrayal. As the story continues on, it builds up to one of the most haunting conclusions ever put to film, an ending that really pushes the boundaries. Ultimately, it works pretty well.Se7en is one of the well-crafted and twisted thrillers I've ever seen and one of the spine-chilling films Hollywood has to offer, thanks to the incredible camera-work, brilliant direction by David Fincher and fantastic script by Andrew Kevin Walker. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman who play the main characters show amazing chemistry on screen together and their performances work pretty well. While the film is really great, it is definitely not recommended for the faint of heart.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Se7en,"'He is preaching¬Ö.punishing'.Serial killing with clues from killer is not a new thing to Hollywood but David Fincher's Se7en exceptional. Its evil genius. Se7en opens with a homicide where a fatso is killed in a very strange manner. We meet Detective Somerset(Freeman) who is about to take off and detective David Mills(Pitt) has just fought to get assigned there. Somerset is calm, mature and has achieved mastery over his job. He probably seen so much that now he badly wants to go far away from this bloodshed. David appears cocky first but turns out amiable character of the film. Tracey(Palthow) is David's wife who hasn't got used to with guns even after so many years of their marriage.It begins. Each killing is shockingly repellent. Like an artist's signature every victim holds a note, a sin highlighted with lines from Dante Alighieri' s 'Divine Comedy', Shakespeare's 'Merchant of Venice'. And his name is John Doe(Kevin Spacey). Those lines are screaming that this not just some insanity. He wants to make a point.Each murder is done by reaching horrific extremes of those deadly sins. A fat man is fed until he burst. Then there is an infamous lawyer got gun stuck on his head, handed a knife -a weighing scale is in front of him and he has to cut 1 pound of flesh from his body by himself. A druggist tied to bed for a whole year!! A famous model, her nose is cut and bandaged again and gave a choice- phone in one hand to call help n sleeping pills in other one to die rather than live deformed. A whore is punished ruthlessly that you should see on screen only. John says, ""The world is so shitty¬Öand we get used to them"".This Script is sumptuous. It mirrors today's society skillfully and boldly. Nothing is hidden by the camera. All we watch is naked truth that we hate to admit and most of the time that we hardly care. The spirituality woven in has its impact all over. Most of all ending is a blow. It is stunning.There are number of memorable sequences in Seven. One especially is breath-taking when Somerset and Mills reaches John doe's apartment and Doe directly starts shooting at them and chase sequence followed is absolute fabulous. On other hand dinner party at Mills house we feel wine mixed in the air. Tracey and Somerset's meeting at coffee shop is the finest ones I ever seen. The intensity of that conversation can't be described.This is a very dark film. It is all time raining. All environment surrounding Se7en is so grim and ghastly it clouds viewers with the same. Music refuse to leave us even when it is over. I must mention titles and credits rolled, one of the best I ever seen.Se7en comes out with strong performances. Morgan Freeman is truly outstanding. Brad Pitt made me his fan from this movie. The way he says ""Ladies and Gentleman we have a homicide here"" and same David when taunted by Somerset ""You are saying you care for these people?"" says with assuring impulse ""Sure I do¬Ö.!!!"". Gwyneth Paltrow 's Tracey doesn't have much screen presence but when she is there, we just can not stop love her character. In final half an hour we are introduced to Kevin Spacey's John Doe. The preacher. What can I say about this chilling work? Spacey gave such a performance that stings. We hate to admit with this man but somewhere we know he is right. Somerset asks him, ""So you are saying some higher power tell you to do this?"" Just watch John Doe reply ""Lord works in mysterious ways.."". Interesting thing pointed out by one of the fan is Somerset and John Doe both observed the same facts about today's society but responds in different ways, Somerset want to run away and Doe takes action.No matter how many thrillers I shall see but this will always one of my favorites. It affects deeply. That's the power of Se7en. Se7en is a terrific thriller and a modern classic.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

I promise you'll leave the cinema shell shocked.Freeman is excellent as Somerset ¬ñ so good that it's a role he's tried to do again in `Kiss the girls' etc.  But here he is the perfect foil for both Mills and the killer.  Brad Pitt is also superb....he isn't allowed to trade on his looks here and does very well in a film that has little opportunity for him to pander to his female fans ¬ñ he spends a lot of it looking beaten up.  Paltrow is OK with what she has ¬ñ but this isn't really a film that focuses on female roles.  R. Lee Ermey is as good as ever and it's a sign of how good the cast is that actors of the stature of Charles Dutton and John C McGinley are basically in roles that barely count as cameos.However the best performance is from Kevin Spacey in the years before he became an Oscar lovie and stopped doing bad guys or dark characters.  He is only on screen for a small portion of the film but his dialogue is superb and he delivers it faultlessly.  In the scene where he shares a car ride with Mills and Somerset you literally hang on his every word.  However alongside Spacey Fincher stands triumphant with his dark vision given the perfect story and perfect actors.At heart this is a cop thriller ¬ñ but excellent performances, excellent mood and a moral lesson from an excellent Spacey make this quite simply the most jaw-droppingly excellent thriller of the 1990's.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Urban decay has never been so slickly photographed.,"Se7en is one of those films you watch in between long intervals. For me, this was my third rewatch and my last. I don't think I have the stomach for another.It is essentially a buddy cop flick, but the script touches on deeper issues of the future of human society, sin, apathy, and predestination. The Noir trappings are beautiful to behold, the constant rain, squalor, grimy city that feels like every dystopian metropolis combined into one. But it occasionally veers into fantasy with a plot that relies on a few too many gimmicks to make it flawless. The villain is simply an omnipotent being at times with almost magic powers.There are moments of genuine humanity that doesn't make it completely hopeless, but the atmosphere is filled with so much despair and nihilism that the grunge attitude of it does begin to wear as the clock ticks by. And by the time the villain of the piece makes his grand entry, I kept expecting him to appear with a leather mask on his face and gloating evilly about eating a census taker's liver with fava beans and a nice Chianti.Still, the dynamic between Freeman and Pitt is still enticing to watch, and the story works as a parable or even sadistic fable at a rudimentary level. But sometimes I wish the story hadn't been so manipulative and fixed just so that it could punish these characters and push them to insane lengths. I felt like character motivations and development were being engaged at the behest of the plot progression, so certain events begin to seem contrived just so it can reach the shocking conclusion. I assume the writer was trying to teach a lesson, albeit in a clumsy fashion.I would call it a minor 90s classic, and the dreamlike, twilight zone-esque environment adds a nice surreal atmosphere. For those willing to ignore plot conveniences and the dingy weather, this film will take you along for a horrific trip into the darkest recesses of what men are capable of.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Man vs. Society,"Rarely does a thriller murder film draw in the audience from start to end without presenting predictable foreshadowing. From the opening credits leaving out Kevin Spacey's name to the consistent ""one step behind the killer"" storyline, Se7en accomplishes a dramatic theme of leaving the audience in a dynamic na√Øve state through the eyes of Mills and Somerset. Although the acting was emotionally and physically precise, it was the cinematography and lighting that generated the dreary setting and interactions throughout the film, often evoking the appropriately timed tension and emotion. Presented beyond the surface, however, Se7en calls upon a society accusation through the thread of Dante's ""Seven Deadly Sins."" Se7en indirectly advocates that society, as a whole, is migrating towards an inevitable abyss filled with specialization in many of these deadly sins. Even though humans may be ignorant to this path, it continues to occur all around us until we become dragged into it, just like Mills in the ending. The only individual within Se7en that posed a dichotomous relation was Somerset; as he continued to logically view the world in awe of the irrevocability. Somerset and Doe both saw the world in this 3rd person perspective, but their actions represented their individual commitment to the change of society. Doe was willing to take action in an upsetting demonstration, but Somerset continually wanted to escape the world in a hopeless fashion. Therefore, Se7en displays multiple protagonists and antagonists throughout the movie. On the surface, Mills and Somerset are the protagonists trying to stop the killer, John Doe, who is the antagonist. Indirectly being argued, however, is that Doe and Somerset are the protagonists with opposing plans towards the change in societal nature (being represented as the antagonist through the seven deadly sins characters including Mills). That is why I give Se7en a 10/10 for its ability to draw in the audience through cinematography, lighting, plot, and controversial character dynamic throughout the entire film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Atypical ... Disturbing ... Haunting ...,"""Se7en"" is one of these cinematic rarities that elevate themselves to unsuspected levels of depth after each viewing, in the greatest tradition of film noir and detective mysteries. Like ""Chinatown"", it reinvented the noir genre with its own particular atmosphere, both were and are still atypical for their time, and both end with a case solved, yet a puzzling conclusion.""Se7en"" is less about the series of crimes committed than the two men who lead the investigation, and the way their relationship evolves and highlights their respective approach to life, to death, to the world they live in, with an implicitness that respects our intelligence enough so we can respect the film in return. This intelligence (or subtlety) is not immediately palpable, and the opening scene can mislead some viewers by falsely establishing the sort of odd couple we'd expect in a cop team: the wise veteran and the hot-headed youngster. Of course, you can trust David Fincher's directing and the cleverness of the script because there's much more to say about Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt in these two roles, among the best of their careers.Morgan Freeman is Sommerset, a cop in his last week before retirement but not THE typical cop about to retire, (as a matter of fact, nothing is typical in ""Se7en""), he's a law enforcer who never fired in 34 years of service and never got shot either, quite an achievement for someone who doesn't work in the most secure neighborhood. Sommerset incarnates the typical noir protagonist, whose optimism was eroded by years and years of facing and fighting the most sordid crimes. Although he's not the most likely to have faith in humanity, he's not cynical because he still respects his job. However, he's lucid about one thing, as long as there will be men, there will be rapists, killers, and criminals of the worst species. Sommerset is lucid and competent, he's like a spotlight of hope in a gloomy darkness, and that's enough to gain our respect, he's calm even when facing the most horrific and gruesome crimes, like the poor obese man forced to eat to death.This opening crime is spectacular and graphic, but Fincher restrains himself because the horror is sometimes more efficient when it's suggested. The horrific aspect of the first crime is also distracted by the first interactions with Mills, Brad Pitt, as the replacing Detective. Mills is not a rookie, he's got his share of thrills and he knows his business. The problem is his temper: too cocky, too hot-headed, too sure of himself, he can't stand Sommerset's patronizing attitude. The progress of the investigation depends on the partnership between Mills and Sommerset, so they do their best to accommodate each other but it's only when Sommerset is invited to dinner by Mills' wife Tracy, that the ice is broken. Tracy here is essential, and not just as a simple plot device, she's a sweet and caring housewife, beautifully played by Gwyneth Paltrow. Tracy loves her husband and provides the extra level of depth needed to appreciate Mills' character who's more one-dimensional in contrast with Sommerset.Tracy is the emotional connection between the viewers and Mills, and consequently between Mills and Sommerset, she's the heart of the film, and plays like an efficient counterpart to the gloomy atmosphere we're plunged in since the very start, it's no wonder that she 'hates the place', she embodies hope, family, marriage, loyalty, the best in humanity. And that's the most brilliant aspect of ""Se7en"", especially from a 29-year old director: David Fincher, with a remarkable craftsmanship, establishes all the elements of the puzzle in the first half-hour, setting the atmosphere: a rainy, dark and totally unappealing little town. It's a hellish, nightmarish world where we're plunged, where only feeble spotlights can penetrate a nightmarish darkness, it's one of these places, you're afraid to walk like in a dark room where you can accidentally put your foot on a sleeping cockroach. Talk about a hostile atmosphere.But this atmosphere is perfect because it fits the nature of the crimes committed, and creates the disturbing urge to establish a peaceful relationship between Mills and Sommerset, which coincides with the discovery of the first two murder's links: a fat man is killed by eating, a successful lawyer forced to trade parts of his body to (temporarily) spare his live, two words written in various parts: Gluttony, Greed ¬Ö an obvious 'to be continued' message to the cops. So, everything leads to the conclusion that the crimes are related to the seven deadly sins, and this time, it's not a killer who kills, but, as states Sommerset: a killer who preaches. But Mills calls a spade a spade, and by labeling the unknown man as 'demented' and 'crazy', he lamentably clouds his judgment while Sommerset is more rational and tries to think like the killer. Mills is all about emotional reactions, Sommerset thinks before he acts, impulses and reason, interestingly, it's the former who believes in love and family, as if 'passion' could work like a double-edged sword.The atypical nature of the crimes and their author elevate the film, Sommerset goes to library to try to find out hints in Saint-Augustin's books, Dante's Inferno and other medieval and metaphysical classics. Though ""Se7en"" doesn't necessarily go deeper in the subject but it touched them enough to carry a sort of pedagogical value. We might not read all these books after, but I'm sure many of us, would question their approach to some crucial religious notions like faith, forgiveness, innocence and passion. On that level, the film is not just a cat-and-mouse thriller; it's also a descent into the most hellish aspects of humanity, incarnated by the villain's face, what's more with a perfect conclusion, leaving us with a truly awkward and uncomfortable sensation, free enough to see the half-full or half-empty glass.Again, ""Se7en"" is a film that respects the viewer's intelligence.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Perhaps the greatest ending in movie history.,"Se7en - for the most part is a procedural thriller/ mystery featuring detectives young idealist ( Pitt) and cynical and experienced (Freeman) together. They are chasing the clues of a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as the denominator of his kills. You don't actually see the murders- only the aftermath. Throughout - the movie delves into themes such as banality of life, evil and humanity intelligently. And at the same time doesn't deviate from the story moving along. There is a lot of dread throughout which is fitting. What elevates this film to ""greatness"" is the final 35 minutes- featuring discussions between the villain ( Spacey) and the detectives after his voluntary surrender- and then the final denouement which will test the viewers faith in this world we live in. It is extremely rare that a film builds you up to expecting a great conclusion - but then actually delivers on this promise. The acting is first rate by all and is masterfully directed by Fincher with great score throughout- especially the last scenes. A truly life changing experience. An absolute must watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"""What's in the box?""","Se7en remains one of the most disturbing movies I have ever watched. Unlike many other movies made during and since its release, Se7en refrains from gore and somehow becomes even more appalling because of it. Over time, general audiences have been desensitized to violence and gore. What may have been considered absolutely horrifying back in the 50s is nothing nowadays. So instead of showing the results of the crime, director David Fincher uses a somewhat Hitchcockian technique; by refraining to show the results of the horrible acts committed, and instead of revealing it through dialogue and acting, notably in the 'LUST' scene and 'SLOTH' scene, Fincher lets our brain do the heavy lifting and figure out what happened, and what it must have felt like. Fincher also goes out of his way to come up with the most disgusting ways a person can die, although some are admittedly tame. ('PRIDE' had it easy) The acting is incredible, featuring one of Morgan Freeman's best performances as an old, broken-down police detective, and Brad Pitt in one of his finest roles, and his acting skills are on display in his explosive acting during the finale. However, the best actor in this movie is the actor who plays John Doe. Observe his acting. Smug, self-satisfied, intelligent, analytical. His composure and fearlessness. The movie rests on this one actor to say every line perfectly. He does. His performance is just as affecting as Anthony Hopkin's in Silence of the Lambs. But the most impressive feat of all, David Fincher does something impossible: he makes the villain seem like a hero. It is hard to explain, but there are some villains that give us a glimpse into our deepest, subconscious desires. And that's terrifying. We all have parts of ourselves that we try to hide and pretend don't exist. These types of villains hold up a mirror and say, look. This is you. It's like watching a perverted car wreck that you can't look away from that hits you somewhere deep and hidden.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

The acting was stellar, directing was spot on and the use of the city and rain added so much atmosphere that it was almost another character in the film. I did see the end coming even though I was hoping that I was wrong.(I think I knew what was coming not because this movie was predictable, more so that after this movie lots of movies and TV shows have stolen from it, so it kind of easy to see where it was going, I am sure if I had seen this when it was first out I would have been surprised) This is a five star movie that I think will still be great 50 years from now. 5 Beards Out Of 5 Check out my video review. http://youtu.be/WCVDBOziSrM",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Best Of Thriller Genre,"Se7en is a movie that really sticks with you, not just because of its intense story but because of how it makes you feel. From the moment it starts, you're pulled into this bleak, rain-soaked world that feels almost suffocating. It's not just a movie about catching a killer; it's about confronting the darkness that exists in the world-and within ourselves.Morgan Freeman as Detective Somerset is the heart of the film. His character's weariness and wisdom come through in every scene, and you can feel the weight of all the years he's spent dealing with humanity's worst. Brad Pitt's Detective Mills, on the other hand, brings a raw energy that contrasts with Somerset's calm demeanor. You see the toll the case takes on him, especially as they get closer to unraveling the twisted mind of John Doe.Kevin Spacey's portrayal of John Doe is terrifyingly calm and calculated, making him one of the most unsettling villains I've ever seen. The murders, each representing one of the seven deadly sins, are horrifyingly creative, and the film's dark cinematography only adds to the sense of dread.The ending-wow. It hits like a punch to the gut, leaving you questioning everything.

"""What's in the box"" - Still sends shivers down my spine!","Although this film is 9 years old now it hasn't dated in the slightest and has more than likely been the influence for other serial killer films over the years; such as Taking Lives (2004) for that sheer twists value.I was only 14 when this film came out so I didn't get to watch it straight away, however after being blown away by it's storyline the first time I saw it (in about 1997, I think), I've since watched it several more times over the years and have been impressed every time. Be it by it's fantastic score (e.g. the library scene), it's sharp witted humour (e.g. when the police captain answers the phone with ""this isn't even my desk!"" - a phrase I'd love to use at my own desk at work everyday), or brilliant acting in the form of Morgan Freeman as Det. Somerset.The only part of this film I didn't enjoy was the ""SWAT"" team scenes. If David Fincher was aiming for OTT from the actors here, he certainly got it (especially from that bloke from Scrubs)The most compelling part of this film for me, and what stands out the most, is the relationship between Det. Mills and Somerset. Two detectives both with completely different lives and agendas both thrown together to solve the most disturbing case either of them will ever face. It's not a case of good cop/bad cop in this movie; it's more like overeager cop/retiring cop and by the end shocked cop/shocked (no longer retiring) cop/shocked audience.A truly great film, 9 out of 10 from me!",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Most of them are at a 6 average mark or below and quite short (not so many over 1h30 min). Se7en has, almost everything that a thriller needs: action, emotion, curiosity, a good screenplay, good actors, unpredictable end and it is not a short movie.

The interplay between Pitt's intensity, Freeman's restraint, and Kevin Spacey's chilling portrayal of the antagonist creates a brilliant counterbalance that enhances the film's moral and psychological weight.Over time, Se7en has become even more significant as a rare example of Hollywood's willingness to tackle grim, existential themes with sophistication-a rarity in an era of lighter, more conventional thrillers.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Brad Pitt is very convincing as a young new detective running his first serial killer investigation with all the nerves and ambitious recklessness you'd expect from having to partner with a veteran on his last case before retirement. The duo face a witty killer who kills based on the seven deadly sins.

The assignment of roles in the movie is excellent, and I especially need to emphasize Brad Pitt's acting (as in ""Fight Club"") which proved that he is not just a beauty figure whose main task is to lure women to cinemas, but also showed that he knows to act! Freeman is excellent in the role of a veteran detective - like it was made for him, and Spacey in the role of the killer was, as usual, brilliant and gravely.

just how I like'em,"Thrillers are either a hit or a miss. They can be awesome while many can be awful. Seven is in the Very awesome category. Basing the film around the seven deadly sins is an concept that everyone can relate too. We have all sinned meaning we can be put ourselves in the shoes of the victims ( not all victims mind you ) . When you imagine a film in which it always cloudy and overcast with rain pouring down 24/7 , you would think it going to depress you . Truth is , you don't actually notice the weather , but instead take huge interest on what happening in the homes of the city.I'm not an huge fan of Brad Pitt but it seems that when he teams up with Fincher , he always puts on an good performance. Then there's Morgan Freeman, which is fairness, is playing Morgan Freeman. He fun to watch but you know what type of performance he going to act out. Both are very good but the one who steals it is Kevin Spacey. He may be in it for 20 minutes, but his role is extremely memorable. His character is well made and maybe deserves a bit more screen time . The film is very well made and an joy to watch. It keeps you awake and leaves you to wonder about the next deadly sin.

Mills is eager to investigate.Director David Fincher has filled with beautiful darkness. It's more than just the gruesome murders. It's the rain, the music score and the grungy setting. Fincher has weaved together an artistic masterpiece. Freeman is the perfect grizzled veteran. Brad Pitt is a terrific eager newcomer. There are surprising comedy sprinkled in. The final twist is simply cinematic history. The big line is awesome. Pitt delivers it perfectly with so much heart aching pleading. Some do deride its grotesque gloom but that's like complaining about a movie being too funny or too exciting. This is suppose to be dark and it achieves it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A must see!!!,"I went to a friends house last night and rented movies. I picked Se7en to rent because I've always wanted to see it since I saw David Fincher's masterpiece, Fight Club and his well made thriller, Panic Room. People have always said this movie was good so I wanted to see it if they were right and they were sure right. Seven is an insanely brilliant film from start to finish. The performances by Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey, and especially Brad Pitt are all phenomenal in this chiller. The movie was just plain out suspenseful and left my heart beating fast til the movie was done. The twist at the end was very intense and you never knew it was coming. Totally unpredictable. Overall, a fantastic film and David Fincher is a pure genius when it comes to smart films and Se7en deserves to be one of the greatest thrillers that has ever been made. I highly recommend it.Hedeen's Outlook: 9.5/10 **** A",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Methodical, Calculated, Brilliant","This story takes you where it wants you to go.The proof is that while there are some gruesome acts in this movie (you only see the aftermath, no action), the most disturbing crime in the movie is the least gruesome.There are very few movies that pull-off a mix of repulsive crime and psychological involvement as well as this one.The character development was done very well with while not distracting you by burying you in the personal life of each characterInitially, I felt the main detective character was a little unbelievable a bit too methodical. As the character developed though, you start to see that as a part of his personality, the element that levels the playing field between him and the criminal. In the end, I found him to be as diabolically analytical as the criminal.The chess game between the main detective and the criminal was flawless. Had they got the criminal into custody any other way than they did.. it would have ruined the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
My 2nd favourite movie of all time,"I remember walking out of the cinema at the end of this film in a daze, my brain incapable of computing the audacity it had been subjected to by the unhollywood ending and stylish bleakness on display for the previous couple of hours.
It hits you like a sledgehammer and won't let go. I love a movie that makes you FEEL, and seven does that every time I've watched it in the 25 years since.
It's not for the faint of heart or people who need to see a sunny outlook on humanity, it's far too real for that.
Fantastic acting, pitch perfect direction and screenplay combine to make a true classic of cinema.

oh yeah!,"Se7en is great. Need I go on? Alright... Se7en starts off nicely making it look like another day at work. Well it is, but it's the beginning of something big. Not 5min into the movie and we're introduced to the first murder scene which is a obese man with his hands tied together under the table and his face smashed into a pile of noodles. He's obviously dead. The killer in this movie picks his victims according to the seven deadly sins, which if you don't know are: greed, gluttony, lust, pride, wrath, envy, and sloth. The killer is very original in the style he kills his victims, which are often times very gruesome. Although they don't really show any killings in here just the way they implied lust was enough to turn my stomach. The movie does a great job with its dark setting and bad neighborhood. Symbolic that this city sucks and is run down. The acting by Mordan Freeman and Brad Pitt is sensational, as well as Kevin Spacy's acting, whom I praise for his role. Overall this is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and the ending... oh buddy, the ending will getcha.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
It doesn't get much more influential than this...,"Two very different films about serial killers ruled Hollywood in the 1990s: 1991's SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, featuring Anthony Hopkins as the infamous Hannibal 'the Cannibal' Lecter, and this, David Fincher's masterpiece about a pair of New York cops tackling a perverted killer inspired by the seven deadly sins. SE7EN is an extremely stylish film that ended up inspiring dozens of copycats like RESURRECTION and THE BONE COLLECTOR: all of the films share a gritty-grimy style with depictions of unflinching violence, seedy backdrops and sleazy characters.Whichever way you look at it, SE7EN is a great movie. It has a pair of sterling performances from relative newcomers Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman, playing stock clich√©d characters: the young rookie and the older, wiser cop on the verge of retirement. Both Pitt and Freeman overcome their characters' conventions to make them believable people. Their quarry is Kevin Spacey, giving one of his traditionally disturbed portrayals as a sociopath with no inklings of good or evil. Much of the film is made up of police procedural elements, with the investigation of crime scenes, the following of leads and at least one fantastic chase sequence halfway through in which Fincher's direction is top notch. It's also blessed with a gruesomely dark twist ending which stays in your head forever afterwards.For what it's worth, I'd pick SE7EN over SILENCE every time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Awesome performances,"The main actors of the film deliver hard on this one, bringing the stakes to another level and making the movie quite thrilling to watch, even when I have seen it multiple times.The movie of course is very dark, but considering when this was made, I can appreciate that because it must've been a very risky choice at the time when cinema was overall a more positive environment when it comes to the themes and imagery of film. This film won't hold back on its grittiness, but also doesn't show you stuff just out of the need to be dark, and that I also appreciate quite a bit with shows like The Boys around which do the polar opposite. Dark for the sake of being dark is never an appealing thing for me, and never will.So much has already been said about the movie that I'll end my review here, movie is solid 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Nice,"Director David Fincher's dark, stylish thriller ranks as one of the decade's most influential box-office successes. Set in a hellish vision of a New York-like city, where it is always raining and the air crackles with impending death, the film concerns Det. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman), a homicide specialist just one week from a well-deserved retirement. Every minute of his 32 years on the job is evident in Somerset's worn, exhausted face, and his soul aches with the pain that can only come from having seen and felt far too much. But Somerset's retirement must wait for one last case, for which he is teamed with young hotshot David Mills (Brad Pitt), the fiery detective set to replace him at the end of the week. Mills has talked his reluctant wife, Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow), into moving to the big city so that he can tackle important cases, but his first and Somerset's last are more than either man has bargained for. A diabolical serial killer is staging grisly murders, choosing victims representing the seven deadly sins. First, an obese man is forced to eat until his stomach ruptures to represent gluttony, then a wealthy defense lawyer is made to cut off a pound of his own flesh as penance for greed. Somerset initially refuses to take the case, realizing that there will be five more murders, ghastly sermons about lust, sloth, pride, wrath, and envy presented by a madman to a sinful world. Somerset is correct, and something within him cannot let the case go, forcing the weary detective to team with Mills and see the case to its almost unspeakably horrible conclusion. The moody photography is by Darius Khondji; the nauseatingly vivid special effects are by makeup artist Rob Bottin, best known for more fantasy-oriented work in films like The Howling (1981). ~ Robert Firsching, Rovi",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

"You Will Be Thinking About This For Days (Really, you do)","The 7 Deadly Sins: Gluttony. Greed. Sloth. Envy. Wrath. Pride. Lust.""Se7en"" is definitely a movie no one will forget after watching it. The story follows two detectives: Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and Mills (Brad Pitt) tracking down a serial killer who murders his victims according to the seven deadly sins. Seriously, this movie kept me at the edge of my seat the first time watching it. I was too young to see the movie when it came out in 1995, but I managed to watch this on DVD just recently. This movie is told from the point of view from the detectives, trying to find the motives and reasons why the killer is taking out random victims. We see them in a frustrated situation (Brad Pitt's character is a fine example of this along with his F bomb dialogue).The performances from the cast are superb. The majority of the film focuses on Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt's chemistry - how their relationship builds up as the two are desperately trying to solve the case. Gwyneth Paltrow is placed third in the top billing as Detective Mill's wife - a woman who loves her husband but has a dislike for living in the terrible city they live in. Her performance sells, but I feel she did not have enough screen time.There is one other actor's performance I really want to talk about. But I can't. You'll have to see the movie for yourself and you'll know who I am referring to.The movie never fails to lose your interest. You are invested in these characters solving a murder mystery that is (to them) not common, yet very disturbing. Each kill has been done off screen, and we are left to our imagination of how each murder went down. What we don't see is much more effective than if we do see...And I believe director David Fincher has done a great job at this. There are plenty of twists and turns throughout, and it's executed unexpectedly which works for this kind of film.""Se7en"" was a movie ahead of its time. I can't imagine what would it be like had the film been made in let's say 1989-90. Definitely recommend this thriller if you're into surprises.

How to make a Great Movie even Better,"In honor of the 30th anniversary, Fincher released a restored version of one of his best films. At first glance, it may seem that the quality has not changed. In addition, the 4k version made with the help of AI has been around for several years.It's funny that Fincher used this tool himself, but it doesn't matter.The differences are especially noticeable in dynamic scenes, where movements have become smoother, while in scenes with artificial light it seems to be clearer and less diffused.As the author promised, the film has not changed dramatically. It is clear that he is not 5 or 10 years old. There's nothing you can do about it.And these changes are noticeable only if you want to find them and you haven't watched the movie for the first time.At the initial viewing, it will still not be up to this. Yes, the picture is juicy, but the plot will distract from looking at the screen.There is no point in talking about the film itself.

Philosophical inquiry about human nature packed as a criminalistic mystery thriller,"Why is Se7en so good? Well, one of the reasons is because it was directed by none other than David Fincher who is well known for his perfectionism. Other reasons include amazing cast and interesting concept with religious main premise. Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow, Brad Pitt and one I won't mention because Fincher decided to kip him as a surprise all delivered amazing performance. How can you not like Freeman's relaxed and gentlemanly attitude (he loves books) as opposed to Pitt's sort of angry and action type character (he loves chase)?Do you think that people who commit deadly sins deserve to live? Of course you do, but this serial killer doesn't. He thinks that the world is better without them. Theologically speaking, deadly sins are called deadly because they have been identified as a root cause to other sins and separateness from God. As a result, one who commits one of those, shall find nothing but darkness in his life and will eventually loose capacity to be happy. If one doesn't want to end like that (spiritual death) one has to firstly turn away from his sin, ask God for forgiveness and then expiate his sin. This serial killer is not merciful. He positions himself as a god who doesn't forgive or give chances to turn away from them. Since spiritual death is a final result from consistently committing deadly sins, this serial killer delivers physical death by murdering his victims in a way that particular sin harms them. He had given himself a right to deliver justice; but justice without love becomes cruel.After this short theological reflection let me now turn my attention to detectives Somerset (Freeman) and Mills (Pitt). As I mentioned earlier, they stand opposed but somehow complement each other. Together they discover frightening and bizarre murders and react in a way specific to them. This is important when you consider the ending. Everybody knows Se7en has one the most shocking ending ever made (other being Requiem For a Dream). Since committing deadly sins influences character as well (not only spirit), carefully watching both detectives actions ads to your understanding of Se7en. This movie is not about chase or little evidences analyzed by technology; it's about seeing people behind the mask, the way we truly are. That's at least what I think.So why did I give Se7en a symbolic seven? I don't have any particular reason. Se7en just lacks that something some other movies have. Apart from being shocking, it didn't stick with me. It's predictable as well, but it seems to me that Fincher decided to make it that way on purpose. We know what is going to happen and that gives us more ""space"" to focus our attention on characters and the way they'll react and not on story itself. Soundtrack could be somewhat better as well. Se7en also lacks that noir feeling that would've made it better.So to conclude: Se7en is a shocking and cleverly made movie with great cast. Underneath the hub is a lot of material for reflection about human nature. Those of you more philosophically oriented are surely going to enjoy this one or should I say seven.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Cool, stylish, but still sad","""Se7en"" is a police drama about two cops trying to find a mysterious killer who is knocking off victims according to the sins they've committed.  The plot is intriguing, the acting is emotional, and the thrills are incredibly creepy.Though, this film wouldn't be as disturbing as some say it is.  Sure, the ending is sad, but aside from that, it's just as 'gross' as every other forensic movie.  In fact, movies like ""The Bone Collector"" are more disgusting than this.And, of course, there's Fincher's excellent directing talent.  The camera angles are cool, the chase scenes are suspenseful, and the investigation is clever.  Morgan Freeman plays the grizzled old cop well, and Pitt delivers a more comedic performance than a dramatic one as the young Det. Mills.The best part of ""Se7en"" would be Kevin Spacey's creepy role as the deadly killer.  Sure, Spacey looks like your regular nice guy, but that's what makes him so evil.

WHY is this considered a good movie????,"I'm sorry for those of you who think that a watered-down pseudo-sadistic murder spree makes for compelling or an intelligent film.  It doesn't.Let's set aside for the moment the miserable lighting and cinematography in this film -- half the movie is so monochromatic that it's difficult to tell what you're looking at, and the 'artistic' angles compound the problem.Let's set aside the absolutely rotten characterizations -- Freeman tries hard with his portrayal of the absolutely-cookie-cutter jaded soon-to-retire cop, but there's nothing there, and Brad Pitt's scenery-chewing over-the-top ""look at me, I'm sooooo mad!"" rookie-detective turn is, frankly, laughably silly.  Gwyneth Paltrow has absolutely nothing to do, and Spacey's character is...well, he's not a character.  He's a bit of hackneyed dialogue, without motive, without charisma, without even a semi-consistent tone (we're supposed to believe that this infinitely careful killer is also so ramblingly incompetent that he leaves evidence all over his apartment?  That he's so confident he knocks off cops' wives, but so easily frazzled he loses his cool under light questioning in the police car?Let's instead focus on plot holes so wide you could toss a horse through them.What kind of police department is this?  There is not ONE ATTEMPT to answer some of the obvious questions that would be asked in any murder investigation (is there surveillance video of the lawyer's offices (there would be)?  Where did the killer get his antibiotics (those things are tracked, numbskulls)?  Why aren't the cops even TRYING to predict the killer's victim pattern, after they've been given ridiculously explicit hints?  Most importantly, the entire ending is completely implausible...under no circumstances would any department, anywhere, EVER, send two detectives off with the high-profile confessed murderer like that. When Spacey proposes his little 'deal,' the cops would have said ""tough. Rot in jail, sicko.""I suppose the success of ""Se7en"" proves that if you shower an audience with enough slickly-produced gore (not even that imaginatively rendered), they'll buy it, particularly if you layer on some random pseudo-literary quotation to give it a sheen of ""art.""

Calling this film 'Terrific' would still be an understatement.,"Calling this film 'Terrific' would still be an understatement.Engaging right from the word go, and shocking at the end, this film is an epitome of writing and shows that if a well-written script is directed well, then everything becomes great. David Fincher was not a great well-known when he was making this. His first film Alien 3 was supposedly panned by most people. Then, he took on directing this cold blooded murder mystery film, and boy he did the job extremely well.The dialogues are extremely important and they have a lot of weight. It's rare to see a thriller filled with such nuances and have a deep meaning to words. The action is minimal and yet has a very high impact. The culmination or finale is a shocker. To say the least, the last 30 minutes are riveting and spine chilling.The nearly 130 minutes film becomes highly action packed after 90 minutes. In the last 40 minutes, actually, there is a lot of dialogue that's very provocative than action. Yet. it's so very engaging that it takes me to the edge of seat each time I see this film thus, I call it as action-packed. I must say, I have seen this film multiple times, with multiple people as my viewing partners, and each time I like it more. So this film just keeps growing on me.The cinematography is amazing and so is the editing. These two departments technically are supreme. Other departments did their job well too. Of all, it's the direction that mattered. Fincher gave us a glimpse what he is capable of with this supreme film, his next one was ""The Fight Club"" which is a cult in itself.It's a 5/5 for a great film that surpasses time to stand out as a classic thriller. I have not named the actual supreme character in this film, so go and find out who it is and what he does.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A Gripping Masterpiece of Justice and Darkness,"Se7en is, without a doubt, the best film in its genre. It hooks you from the very beginning and doesn't let go. The performances are incredible. Morgan Freeman brings a calm and wise presence to his role, while Brad Pitt captures the emotional intensity and frustration of his character perfectly. Kevin Spacey is haunting in his role and really leaves an impression long after the film ends.While Law Abiding Citizen shares some themes with Se7en, this film takes things to another level, especially with its unforgettable ending. It's not just a twist-it forces you to think about human nature, morality, and the harshness of the world we live in. It's an ending that leaves you speechless and questioning everything.What I love most about Se7en is its simplicity. Unlike a lot of other detective movies that get too complicated or hard to follow, Se7en keeps things clear, yet never loses its depth. It feels like it's always building towards something bigger-something philosophical. The movie really makes you think: What is justice? How far should we go in trying to right wrongs? And how do we keep our humanity in a world full of pain and corruption?Se7en isn't just a great thriller-it's a movie that makes you reflect on life and the darkness that exists in the world.

Another great performance by Kevin Spacey,"Anyone else think that Kevin Spacey is being type-cast as psychopathic serial killers?

His portrayal of the serial killer is chilling, unnerving and powerful. Se7en delves well into his backstory and fleshes him out as a character.Although I did think the film was a little anti-climactic in terms of its scariness.

Frighteningly beautiful thriller,"I watched Se7en assuming it would be a regular detective movie. I am happy to say that I have been proven wrong to a great degree. First off, I'd like to gush over how perfect the cinematography is for this movie. The intense downpour of rain present throughout (most of) the movie adds so much to the noir atmosphere the film evokes. The lighting is quite minimal throughout the movie. This choice was obviously made to create a more claustrophobic and creepy ambience and I would say it works. Howard Shore's score is not too noticeable in the film, it does add tension and in the final act it does help with freaking out the viewer even further.The disgusting murders shown in this movie are what set it apart from other crime/thriller films. Not to spoil anything, but the people who made this were certainly creative. Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey are beautifully cast here.

Dark masterpiece of the genre.,"David Fincher's breakthrough Se7en is one of few movies that deserves to be called a masterpiece. An incredibly dark movie (for mainstream that is) about cruelty and human depravity that hooks it's fangs into the viewers spine like a bloodthirsty beast and won't let go even after the movie's over. This is both very wellplayed and wellcrafted. Gwyneth Paltrow, Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey all do top-notch performances, the script is one of the strongest in years and the ending must be on of the best I've seen. It's strange that a movie that doesn't rely on shock effects can be this shocking. After I saw this I was amazed by the pure cleverness of it all and the way I felt.

If Lethal Wepon Was Realistic,"I think the greatest strength of Se7en is its opening twenty minutes. The first twenty minutes makes you think that you're in for a decent, gritty, detective movie. But nothing worth the 250. It's sort of what Summerset and Mills thinks they're getting into. They think that this is going to be a hard case, but not scarring. They keep their heads high and don't think much of it. But after those twenty minutes, it becomes a tale of self worth, moral ambiguity, guilt and everything that'd usually be fluff in any other movie, turned into a disturbing look into what we can and have become as a species.The film is hard to write about because it does everything in a bad buddy cop movie and makes it realistic. How would Mel Gibson and Danny Glover function outside of the job? How would the world react to absurd James Bond like plans? How would a basically criminal master mind make his plans make sense? The film is like a satire that went all of the way. It makes everything that'd be nonsense in any other film, and I mean any other film, work. The dialogue works, the acting, the camera, the story, the plan, the makeup, everything works. And the best part is, you don't expect it to. By all means, this film should've been awful, and it's brilliant.This the first time I'm truly recommending a movie. Unlike a lot of good movies, this one you want to suggest to others. It's hard to recommend something like The Good, the Bad, the Ugly or Citizen Kane because of one reason or another. It's too long, some things don't make sense, but Se7en is a film that's enjoyable and for reasons that can't be explained. It's a watchable movie.The only problem is also the greatest strength. The first twenty minutes are a bit, well, ""slow"" because they're necessary and without it the film wouldn't work on an emotional or logical level. But, even then, it so much more watchable than a lot of other first twenty minutes. It's a ""good movie"" no matter what.If nothing else, everything about this film WORKS. What that means, I still don't know. But it's a working movie and make of that what you will. Please, watch this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Se7en: detective with the best ending,"Se7en is an absolutely incredible movie in its genre, one of the best movies directed by David Fincher. The movie is about detectives who investigate crimes based on the 7 deadly sins.Let's go through all the points to adequately rate the movie:1) Plot - I give 1 point to the movie for its idea. The theme is quite off-the-beaten-path, especially in 1995. At that time, I'm sure, ""Se7en"" made a real sensation.The second point goes to the movie for the smooth development of the plot: from incident to incident the heroes get more and more buried in the investigation, and each next crime is tougher than the previous one. Dialogues are also worth mentioning: they are perfectly written, meaningful, and there is no sense of any na√Øvet√©.The third point is definitely for the logical ending. Nothing is broken - neither chronology, nor the original idea. The scenes ending the movie fit perfectly into the general plot and logically conclude it.2) Actors' performance - the actors have a psychological correspondence with the characters. The main actors played their roles admirably: Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt showed the highest skill. They are really unconditionally believed throughout the entire timeline. Kevin Spacey also coped with the role 100% - moderately calm and cold-blooded, moderately cunning, moderately painful. Also +1 point.One more, already the fifth point should be awarded to the movie for the stunning appearance of the characters. Each character corresponds to his clothes, behavior, atmosphere in the scene. As an example we can cite one character from the very beginning, this image is so memorable that it even found an echo in the music industry: German band Rammstein re-shot this scene for their Haifisch music video (2009).3) The music - not much can be said about this one. It is concise, keeps the tension at the right moments, and otherwise skillfully accompanies the awesome video. A well-deserved sixth score for the movie.4) Visuals - a lot has been said in the paragraph about the actors, and now we should mention their surroundings. All the sets, makeup, lighting, color correction - everything fits perfectly with what's going on. The movie is moderately dark, and this is to its advantage. The seventh point in the piggy bank.The camerawork is marvelous. The angles, framing, shooting of dynamic scenes are flawless. The editing does not strain, the frame does not shake, there is a clear understanding of what is happening. There are also a lot of incredibly atmospheric scenes in the movie. +1 again.5) The finale - oh, it's an absolute masterpiece. It is unpredictable, until the very beginning of the denouement the viewer has no idea what the antagonist's plan is. It shows a very emotionally powerful scene where the mind confronts the animal's anger and feelings. For the unobvious denouement I give the movie 2 points at once.10 out of 10Well deserved.

A mind twisting tale,"If you will see this movie the first thing will come into your mind will be""Oh my god"". This is a tale of a serial killer and let me tell you this one is quite different from other you seen. This guy (kevins.) is looking so intense in the movie. Though the story seems fit to the characters but the creepiness of the main idea is very unique....!! And like always brad pit is looking handsome and morgen is intelligent but kevin is a winner in this movie. when i saw this movie last night i wasn't thinking that it will be so intense like its review says on IMDb but just after watching it for 30 min. it gripped me in such a ways which words can not define. this is movie which you will remember for a lifetime and discuss with 1000 people and everyone will have the different theory for the characters but i bet on that - everybody will be agree on the idea and the intensity of the movie.

"Good, but not very good IMO","First off let me say that the direction and acting is very good. I don't recall having any major complaints and can't recall many minor complaints. To me this film just didn't have a 10 out of 10 script which is why I give it 8 stars. For me, the story is the most important part of just about every film. This movie's story was very good for the most part. However I had 2 big complaints. 1: for the first murder, they mention receipts for the food he bought. They mention that there was food bought twice the same day. Why didn't the cops investigate the store on the receipt and see if there was any video footage from either/both purchases? 2: I was able to predict the end right before it happened, which really is less than ideal when it was clearly meant to be a shock. I might have ranked the film higher if I hadn't just watched: Witness for the Prosecution. And that film pulls off the surprise ending better and more dramatically than just about any other film. So I had a high bar of expectation prior to seeing the film and I had really high hopes for 7, seeing how it has an 8.6 ranking. I think following my viewing i won't leave as a fan or hater of the film. I managed to see a lot of impressive components in the piece, and it's still well worth a viewing if you can handle the disturbing content. And maybe I was a rare case in predicting the end.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

"Complete and Utter Suspense,","Se7en is an amazing movie with an incredibly well developed plot and a stunning cast. It had me glued to the screen for the entire run time, as we follow two detectives struggling to catch a serial killer who has been murdering people as a representation of the seven deadly sins, the images this killer makes the bodies in to are literally some of the most brutal things I have witnessed on film. David Fincher and writer Andrew Kevin Walker did a stellar job developing detectives Somerset and Mills, who Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt bring to life flawlessly, their relationship is a complicated one that becomes more layered as the film continues. However, the highlight was Kevin Spacey, who steals the show as the man we were waiting to see from the very beginning, and is not one bit disappointing, he is sinister, absurd and a straight up creep, he chilled me to the core, I do not think any other actor could have portrayed this psychopath better. Thrilling, engaging and incredibly well acted, I can not find a single flaw in Se7en, highly recommend to anyone looking for a good mystery or thriller.Two detectives search for a serial killer who plans on taking seven victims as a way of exposing the deadly sins.Best Performance: Kevin Spacey",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Perfect and consistent theme, amazing cast....","This film has many indelible moments, an amazing cast: Morgan Freeman as Detective Somerset is impressive and real. The Charlie Parker soundtrack with the blues sung by Billie Holiday ""I Cover the Waterfront"" captures the dark mood and underlying violence which exists in the city. Being from New York, the street scenes at night are 100% accurate, executives, harried workers, hookers and dealers all intermingle in a pastiche of chaos.We see the early scene where Freeman first meets novice detective David Mills (well portrayed by Brad Pitt) and he asks him what NYC homicide is like, and won't agent Somerset regret retiring? Freeman answers tiredly ...""I am moving....anyplace...far away from here""...Sloth, Greed, Lust, Pride, Envy, Gluttony, the seven deadly sins as proclaimed since Medieval era. Each murder is precisely carried out. John Doe is creating his masterpiece, an artwork of perfect murder. Kevin Spacey is superb as John Doe. His presence and diction are cutting and menacing. I would love to see him in more of these roles. The quote from Morgan Freeman at the end of it all resounds true: it is the quote from Hemingway. The theme is ""ask not for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee""....Everyone is affected by violence. Best thriller and suspense, other than Hitchcock. Kudos to David Fincher and the cast The screenplay is amazing, I have bought that as well as the DVD. Highly recommended. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Incredible Movie and Pacing,"This movie is incredible for a multitude of reasons. The acting, the premise, but I think one of the things that really sets this film apart is the pacing and deliberate cinematography to create a sense of dread. During the scenes at the crime scene they light the scenes and have the camera follow the lead characters in a way that enables us the viewer to discover the true horror of the acts committed as the lead characters do. We as the viewer are along for the ride and experience the sheer horror and rising terror that the characters experience in the moment.Also, Brad Pitt's line ""What's in the box?!"" might be my favorite line he's ever spoken in a movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
What's in the box?,"David Fincher directs Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman. Kevin Spacey and Gwyneth Paltrow in a hunt for a serial killer, slowly knocking off innocents based on the 7 deadly sins.Pitt does his usual head scratching, hair fluffing as seen in Fight Club and Twelve Monkeys, Freeman is as calm and slow speaking as ever, almost sounding like narrating in The Shawshank Redemption. Spacey is as creepy as ever.They quickly work out the killer is basing his kills on the 7 deadly sins as the murders add up until only one is left.The climax is unforgettable as Spacey turns the tables on Pitt.

One of the best crime thrillers ever made,"This is one of the most horrifying movies ever made. But it doesn't just consist of violence. It has amazing performances, tense scenes, and a nail-biting finale which you won't ever forget for a very long time.2 detectives try to hunt down a psychopath as he kills people in grotesque ways based around the seven deadly sins.This movie contains several memorable scenes which have the tendency to knock you off guard. Besides the ending, another amazing scene is when they investigate the sloth victim. The gore is amazing but we get the jumpscare of our lives in it. I'm not going to spoil it though because otherwise I'll ruin it. Many people will agree that the ending is the best part by far. It is tense and suspenseful and it is completely unpredictable. It is one of the most memorable movie endings by far.Also, the acting is amazing also. In my opinion, Kevin Spacey and Brad Pitt both give one of their best performances yet. Morgan Freeman's also gives as amazing performance and it is rivaled only by his performance in The Shawshank Redemption.The acting worked real well because this movie did a great job with its choice of casting. Fincher probably looked at previous works of Freeman, Pitt, and Spacey's roles and he knew that they would be perfect for these roles and his casting choices really paid off.As much I want to give this movie a 10, there are a few scenes which I felt carried on a bit too long or were more slower-paced than the rest of the movie. There weren't too much that bothered me too an extensive degree though. However, I do think that this would've been a masterpiece if it weren't for those few scenes.Nobody thought much of Fincher when he directed Alien 3 and he was originally dismissed as just another style over substance director. However, he looked at the mistakes that movie made and he showed moviegoers with this movie that he is a talented director. Since then, he has made several more amazing movies (especially Fight Club) and he is now one of the more appreciated directors working today.In conclusion, Se7en is a near perfect movie. Sure, the pacing can be a bit slow at times but this is still an amazing crime drama and I think that this is one of the best crime movies ever made. It will keep you on the edge of your seat the entire time and it contains one of the best finales to a movie ever. I understand why some people disliked this movie but none of the reasons affect my opinion of this movie and I think that it is a must-watch for everyone as long as you don't mind realistic violence and gore.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Real-World Scary,"Put your goblins and monster films away: This one's based on the horrors humans commit, and therefore hits home in a real-life way.The performances are incredible.

Excellent Movie,"David Fincher reveals a masterpiece of a movie in his film Seven. The movie follows the process of two detectives, Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and Mills (Brad Pitt) as they attempt to track down a serial killer (Kevin Spacey) who is choosing his methods and victims based off of the seven deadly sins. The film is high quality for two main reasons: its complex characters and its moral commentary.The most intriguing character is easily John Doe, the killer. Rather than creating a stereotypical mindless killer, Fincher makes Doe a serious, soft-spoken man, whose power comes from his brain rather than his brawn. Doe is extremely logical and methodical in his approaches, as his killings require intense planning. His character poses as a striking contrast to Mills. Although he is the ""good guy""-the cop, the detective, the one trying to stop a killer- Mills is not likable. Unlike Doe, he raves and constantly shows frustration, and often reverts to physical violence to try to accomplish his mission. Although the watcher probably will still root for Mills, when Doe speaks, they will be more apt to listen. Somerset serves as the voice of reason, reeling in Mills when necessary and respecting Doe's genius as he tries to catch him.These characters, especially John Doe, perfectly display the film's social commentary on the seven deadly sins within our culture. More importantly, they raise the moral question of what is evil, and what is good. There is a clear clash between good and evil within the film, but the reason it is so successful is that it makes the audience ask themselves questions. Are evil people able to be victims? Is society harming the killer or did the killer harm society? What is a just price to pay for evil doings? Therefore, I highly recommend Seven to anyone who is not too squeamish and who enjoys a perplexing film that will leave you thinking. I enthusiastically endorse this film with an ""A"".",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
What's in the box?,"Here I go on my mission to find the seven deadly sins in this David Fincher mystery crime thriller, Se7en. It focuses on dark and brutal themes of mystery and horror and it has that very evocative story that'll keep you on the edge of your seat whilst Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are witnessing the horrors of the seven deadly sins, Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Envy, Wrath, Pride and Lust. Whoever uses those sins as motives in murders is John Doe and he cut his own fingertips so that the police and two detectives, David Mills and William Somerset won't know who killed these victims but Mills and Somerset do know it's John Doe who committed these horrible crimes. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman have great chemistry together on-screen to have the mystery to solve the seven deadly sins in this creepy cruel world where sins and crimes are committed including in bad weather 'cause the filmmakers wanted to make the atmosphere look gritty and dark. David Fincher has his reputation for making his films and cinematography look gritty, brutal and dark as I said in his previous films. The twist at the end is brutal, it's amazing. The box has something inside and Mills know that someone's head is inside and he says that one line that everyone knows about is ""What's in the box?"" and he has the great chase scene between him and Doe. Both of these scenes are suspenceful. I love Se7en and Se7en is an brutal and dark edge of the seat neo-noir crime thriller that will keep you invested for some mystery and thrills by David Fincher. There is another films that stars Brad Pitt and directed by David Fincher is Fight Club and I am interested in checking it out because of David Fincher's directing style and cinematography. If anybody hasn't seen Se7en, I would recommend you go watch it and if anybody who hates the film, they are totally sinned. I know that's just a catchphrase but that's just the way it is for people who hated Se7en.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Solid,"Took a look at this again after 27 years. While the whopper of an ending has stuck with me, I recalled little else other than that I wasn't super impressed by this back then and I think a lot of that had to do with my then not very high opinion of Brad Pitt. It's a well made, unusual, sometimes gruesome serial killer crime story about with a solid performance from Morgan Freeman. I always had a problem with Pitt when he was young in that I didn't think he was all that great of an actor. I still have some issues with him here, but he's better than I remembered and has some moments that are interesting. This was a big year for Kevin Spacey with this and The Usual Suspects, but it's hard to look at him now in this creepy role that he plays so perfectly. Seems a lot of people on here love this good movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Amazing Film,"Se7en is a 1995 Crime/Thriller directed by David Fincher that stars Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman as two homicide detectives on the hunt for a serial killer who is committing various dark and gruesome crimes based on the Seven Deadly Sins. This movie is very well filmed and tells a haunting yet realistic story. In the sense that there could be a serial killer who does things like this in real life, because nothing is too extraordinary in the film to the point where it's not possible; so, that's what makes the brutality of the crimes so impactful and horrific.The film has great direction by Fincher. The movie does a good job at keeping you interested throughout. It is written well and Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman really bounced off one another. I was surprised with their chemistry on screen because I have never seen them together like this in a film before.The films aesthetic throughout the runtime is dark, gritty and filled with dread through the use of production design, composition, color and cinematography. The colors in the film were always murky. Stylistically the film is beautiful in a sick way with how Fincher manipulates what's on the screen and how it's on the screen. Although, there were times in the movie where I didn't even want to look at the screen, but there were also times where Fincher doesn't even need to show us and we still know something horrifc is on the other side by the way it is suggested through the mise-en-scene. (The Lust sin in particular). There is a clear vision that is being executed. However, the focus is not all on the violence, but on the setting and the people as well. The characters all have depth and they feel like real people that we have to spend time with. The scene with Pitt, Paltrow, and Freeman having dinner together is an example of one of these scenes we get that are character driven. The setting is constantly shown off through the mise-en-scene.Overall, I thought Se7en was an amazing movie. I thought it was written well. There were some great dialogue scenes in the middle of the movie as well as the end. The end was really good one of the best parts of the whole movie. The entire third act is pretty insane to be honest. It was very well written and executed; totally had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. The cinematography, writing, acting, and direction were all very well done. The film was disturbing and gritty yet in a way very real which makes it all the more shocking and the climax is one of the best I have seen in a while. I really liked it and I recommend checking it out especially if you're into darker movies.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Fincher's Best Film,"If Fincher didn't invent the convention of the brilliant serial killer always being just one step ahead of the police, he unquestionably perfected it here. This is the twisted psychopath unleashing his vengeance upon the deserving, avaricious world at its absolute best. And this remains Fincher's best film.Two cops in New York are hunting a serial killer. The presence of the killer is momentous even before the detectives track him down, once caught, the killer is channeled through Kevin Spacey with a disturbingly authentic evil calm.Written by Andrew Kevin Walker, this amazing original script that was almost never made. Walker wrote it as an original screenplay around 1991. Apparently he was quite depressed at the time. New Line Cinema bought it, but it took years before it went into production Walker went to work on other projects thinking the script would never be made, but it was. It was released Sept 22, 1995. By using the seven deadly sins as the basis for justifying the killer's prerogative, the film's plot is definitely one of the best around, added to this amped up, excellent performances by Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman, the production comes off flawlessly, but Seven is so haunting and goes down as one of the best Thrillers of all time because of Fincher's vision of a hellish New York. This world is poison and Fincher makes it seep.The grit and grime of the crimes scenes combined with filth of the city streets, alleyways, rooftops, constantly being pounded with rain, darkness engulf even the few happy moments of the film. So much of this film's beauty is in the compilation. The sets and lighting are so complex that making Seven must have been the result of a finely tuned crew, each member bulked up on their own creative genius. It is how everything, every element aligns perfectly that makes Se7en such a phenomenal filmmaking achievement.More at getthebonesaw.blogspot.com",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
The perfect thriller,"This is the best movie that i have seen of my life. The acting of brad pitt and morgan freeman is amazing.

It has many scenes that will be in my mind forever. Kevin Spacey do a work awesome doing of murderer how also morgan freeman like detective. Without a doubt it has a plot interesting of the beginning until the final. I'd like to watch more film of this style.

The Quintessential Psychological Thriller,"What can one say that, I'm positive, hasn't already been said about this film? That taken into consideration, I will review this title regardless.Seven, from start to finish, is a film that ""Will Be Puzzled Over, Studied, and Followed... Forever."" That is a quote used in the movie to describe the crimes that ensue(d), but I feel it works quite well as a tag-line for the film itself. The Film is set in semi-modern New York and revolves around two characters - Detective David Mills & Detective William Somerset. (David being a transfer/""rookie"" and Somerset, the hardened veteran) The plot consists of Mills and Somerset trailing a serial killer by way of varying but distinct clues left at each scene. I personally believe that Seven lacks in no definitive aspect or area; it is (in my opinion) perfect in every way and a true classic that should be enjoyed by everyone - and I would be more than willing to debate this statement any time, any day.

Divine Murder!,"Throughout history the Bible and its wisdom have been used as an excuse for murder. The director in ""Seven"" cleverly makes use the seven sins as Kevin Spacey's Divine permission to commit the biggest biblical sin of them all; murder! While Spacey is sacrificing his victims in the name of religion and punishing them in graphical behavior for their weaknesses; Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt appear as the prophets defending and protecting all that is good by trying to catch him. The director David Fincher keeps you on the edge of your seat as you watch each brutal murder appear across the screen and as you watch Freeman and Pitt getting closer to their killer. Freeman always appears the wiser while Pitt gets more and more engulfed with rage as the killer taunts his pursuers while punishing his victims. We the viewers, are filled with anger and wrath (one of the sins themselves), as we want the killer to be caught but we realize at the end that he wants more than that! At the end the shocking revelation takes over our minds and fills us with even greater anger as we want Spacey punished! We also want him dead for his last brutal act! We also want Pitt to kill him!

"Okay, but a bit overrated IMO","Maybe I've just seen too many movies. Maybe my expectations were too high, having seen this movie highly praised here. Maybe the story seemed a bit too predictable to me. Maybe I just found some of the gore a bit over the top. Or maybe I've seen so much gore in films already that I simply wasn't that impressed.Whatever it was, this movie struck me as okay, certainly not bad, but not the masterpiece others have praised it as.

The McDonald's of Horror Films,"Wow. There are a lot of bad films out there, but even with the worst of the worst there is some redeeming quality, like that neato big wave in the Perfect Storm. But Se7en? The acting is flat (Brad Pitt's opening lines seem like they're coming from someone acting for the first time, his moaning at the end, when he gets his special gift, just seemed pathetic); the script is not at all inventive and unsuccessfully covered up by hyperbolic special effects and redundant gore. The ""twist"" at the end is hardly disturbing because the writer/ director have been shoving gimmicky horror effects down the our throats for the entire movie.People who like this film- the dark, urban atmosphere, the pseudo-noir elements: please watch some David Lynch films and see how this should be created, i.e. not by using video game titles, not by relying heavily on special effects, make-up, and yet ANOTHER plot with biblical references, but instead by a careful selection of actors, beautiful cinematography, and incredibly original stories.Stop funding this director so that he will go back to making TV commercials instead of two hour long theater commercials.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Vile and exceedingly wicked,"This film truly haunts with its darkness. The crime at the end of the movie is shocking and full of chaos. I couldn't have guessed that the villain would do something so wicked. The ending is truly haunting, but that's what makes it intriguing. This film is the true definition of a thriller. Se7en doesn't play around with excessive philosophy, but instead presents extreme and terrifying nihilism. Director David Fincher successfully creates a terrifying atmosphere that surpasses the supernatural. It's a horrifying nightmare of terror, and its mystery holds the audience until the end. Despite being incredibly frightening, this film shows no mercy for a cruel world. I don't support nihilism in this film, but I see it as an extraordinary work. Without Fincher's chilling touch, this film wouldn't succeed. The screenplay writer is also remarkable, as they manage to present morally unsettling questions from beginning to end. It is relevant to the horrifying real world.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

detective thriller masterpiece,"Let's start with the basics. Which, in this movie, aren't as simple as the term implies. There is mystery to be had, thrills to experience, chills down your spine, the wrinkling of your nose in disgust, the unease in your gut, and oh yes, even a handful of chuckles. Mostly thanks to the dark humor and sarcastic manner of Brad Pitt's character, while Morgan Freeman's is the much more solemn, except that one scene where he's laughing more than I've ever seen him laugh in any other movie. Their polar opposites help engage different parts of your brain, and emotions, as the movie progresses. It's a rollercoaster of sorts, but mostly stays in the ballpark of disturbing this after disturbing that, yet all the while you're immersed in the bleak atmosphere, you're simultaneously glued to the screen. The score is haunting, the cinematography just - I don't know the word, I just love it - and the performances superb from one character to the other. Aside from the main two stars, all the supporting roles throughout execute so naturally that half the time it feels like a sordid documentary. Then of course there's Kevin Spacey, in a notorious role that was a shocker to people watching it for the first time. Given that I only write spoilerless reviews, I won't touch on the details of what I consider one of if not my favorite movie ending of all time. Back to the beginning, I love that the movie opens with a scene, and then runs the credit sequence, which is unnervingly perfect in itself, and from there the movie proceeds. Sure, it has some slow moments, but to be expected, and ultimately I am still too enrapt to have any of that detract from my rating. Even though the movie strictly follows the detective side of things versus the actual murders, the riddles and intrigue suffice to keep you far from bored.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Se7en: One hell of a creepy movie,"Se7evn once again proves David Fincher is the master of composing a story that perfectly balances drama with suspense, and it then finished off with an excellent twist ending. Major credit also goes to Andrew Kevin Walker who creates a story that is creepy, compelling and above all original. The progression of Se7en is significant as it starts out with an insignificant investigation that evolves into an extremely intense encounter. The movie keeps a good pace whether it's giving the reader time think through what's happened or forcing them to predict what's going to happen. The constant chase makes for a great movie pace, which is further enhanced by the detective duo. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are perfectly cast as Detectives Somerset and Mills. The progression of the relationship between the two characters is done perfectly as the viewer sees the ups and downs both characters go through. The introduction of Tracy then introduces a huge wild card, which has a huge impact on the mentality of both characters as well as the ending. Se7en's villain John Doe is what ultimately makes this movie. The brutality, as well as the meaning behind each of his murders, is both fascinating and disgusting at the same time. The scene where Mill and Somerset question Doe as they drive to the location of the final two victims is the best scene of the film. Doe finally reveals his motives behind his murders that while they are rather disturbing, do actually make sense. The creep factor of Se7en is comparable to that of a scary movie. It's frightening visuals, themes, and the villain makes the movie much more suspenseful and frightening than many would expect. However, its the relatable characters and setting keep the movie grounded. Top that all off with one of the best twist ending that leaves the viewer jaw dropped throughout the credits, and you get one of the best thrillers of all time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A damn good movie,"Seven is a crime, thriller following a rookie and a hardened, retiring detective as they try and solve the case of the mysterious murders, one per day for Seven days, finding that the victims also follow a pattern, they all represent one aspect of the seven deadly sins. The duo must find this killer before he finishes his grand masterpiece.I love this movie, the grimy and dark atmosphere, almost rustic in nature. Beauty in imperfection. David Fincher is a masterful director, choosing to rely on the weight of the scene, allowing it to hold, over fast cuts and fancy camera movements. The movie hooks you in most with it's disturbing nature, everything is so graphic and or disturbing in context. Right there, seeing what the detectives sees, trying to solve this puzzle with them.But outside of that, the story is simple yet deals with complex ideas, while also keeping it in a 2 hour runtime, which is impressive, knowing how long it needs to be and not over staying it's welcome.The only real issue i had with the movie is that i didn't feel that much of a connection as much as i should have to the story, until John Doe finally comes into the picture. From there, the movie is tense and had me hooked the entire time, the building music and the overall feeling that the characters are not in control. This is Fincher's true start into cinema. Though i prefer fight club and zodiac, this is by far his best original project.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Seven,"A dark, gloomy and hideous masterpiece.From start to finish this movie grips you tight and doesn't ever let go. The storytelling is perfected with the narration extending throughout the whole film. The film creates a chilling and disturbing atmosphere perfect for the plot of the film. The acting carries this film to what it is, it's shuttle but realistic and manic. The movie shows the perspective of a maniac , how he thinks, believes and acts and how hard it is to fully understand what's going on in their head.

"Predictably gruesome, less predictably formula-bound...","There's a serial killer on the loose in rainy New York City who's modus operandi is to stage seven grisly crime scenes modelled after the Seven Deadly Sins. He is soon aware of the two homicide detectives on the case and becomes enamored with their drive and determination. Hit thriller from director David Fincher and screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker is mostly left vague and unexplained. We learn precious little about the psychopath except that he's highly literate and educated, with too much strict religion in his background. This is all hoary police-movie fodder, as is the set-up with the detectives: the wise codger about to retire and his cocky new partner with the short fuse. Fincher mounts the tension well, with staccato glimpses of corpses and gore, but can't escape a fatigued sense of d√©j√† vu (it has ""The Silence of the Lambs""-itis). Brad Pitt gets off to an awkward, hesitant start in his role, but does improve. Freeman is sensational; whether throwing his knife at a dartboard or studying up on literature at the library, he is focused and gripping. The lust-and-death-soaked atmosphere is wallowed in--it's the Big Apple as a Gothic Hell--and, certainly, the grimy vibes are palpable and captured successfully, but they're also off-putting. Words written in blood on the walls...it's too much like ugly crime scenes from the evening news, and Fincher and Walker aren't clever enough to distract us nor cunning enough to help us distinguish the difference (the killer does leave clues, but they are quickly solved). The narrative is a mix of derivative movie-thriller ideas and new-fangled ways of making the viewer as squeamish as possible. It's the old pulling-wings-off-flies number, but on a larger, sick-making scale. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A Gr8 film!,"Morbidly intriguing, disgustingly fascinating.  I was deeply shaken by what I would call ""my favourite film"".Forget Brad Pitt, I found Morgan Freeman's acting amazing.  He is calm cool and collected throughout the whole film.  A complete stoic.Some good jazz tunes are part of the soundtrack and the film has style.Watch carefully, the ""lust"" scene.  I didn't understand what had specifically happened, the first time that I saw it.I would like to compare the film with the psychological personality inventory called the Enneagram.  ""Ennea"" is Armenian for 9ine and I guess gram means...chart?  It is based on 9ine different personalities which, according to some sources corresponds to the se7en deadly sins + 2wo more.1ne = wrath2wo = pridethr3e = deceit4our = envyfi5e = greed6ix = fearse7en = gluttonyei8ht = lust9ine = slothThere is a theory about the enneagram (which I don't agree with) that states that a person will transform from 1ne personality to another in a particular order to become more psychologically healthy as a ""whole"" person.  The order is this:se7en: becomes fi5efi5e: becomes ei8htei8ht: becomes 2wo2wo: becomes 4our4our: becomes 1ne who becomes se7en to complete the cycleThis is the same order that the ""sins"" are mentioned throughout the film. It's basically the same order as above.se7en gluttony is mentioned firstfi5e greed is mentioned secondei8ht lust is mentioned.  9ine sloth is mentioned, which is next door to ei8ht and breaks the cycle in half2wo pride is mentioned4our envy is mentioned1ne wrath is mentioned.In both cases The order is 7-5-8-2-4-1.  I was obsessed by this fact in 1995 when the film came out because I was studying the enneagram at the time.  Obviously, someone needed a life :)",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Why do people watch this movie?,"I always take the trouble to write an IMDb review when I think a movie is too horrible to watch - the good ones, I am sure people can find them without me.This movie is rotten to the core. It does not entertain a sensible mind. It does not uplift. It has not humor, no fun, no moral. It is morbid, depressing, meaningless. But it is not meaningless like, say, life. Life's meaninglessness has a depth, it is somber. The meaninglessness of this movie is like a small child killing a white rabbit - wanton, senseless, rabid.What did you learn from this movie? What did you enjoy? What moved you? Nothing unless you admire gore and violence per se. Yes, the acting, especially of KS, was superb. But I do not see any glamor in superbly acting the part of a mad killer. The mad killer can do it himself.Anyways, I am rambling; but after a movie like this, you are at a loss for words.

MY REVIEW: It will be Eighth Sin not to Watch This!!,"Se7en. An unpredictable serial killer plot, the great storytelling of ace director David Fincher, performed by always reliable Morgan Freeman, star actor Brad Pitt and if it was not enough Kevin Spacey who does not how to do bad acting, all these give you one of the darkest and chilling thriller of all time. From the word go, you find yourself solving the case with two detectives played by Morgan and Brad. At one moment, they are very near to solve the case and then everything is turned upside down with a heartbreaking climax. Another movie that comes this close to perfection in serial killer plots is another David Fincher classic Zodiac. Gwyneth Paltrow as Brad's wide does well in her small part and provides lightness to otherwise heavy setup. Se7en although questioning the morality still maintains the good side of morality. I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for Se7en. You will enjoy it best when seen in total silence or undisturbed environment. If you love to be thrilled, then don't miss it!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Se7en is a beautiful film and worth watching. I agree with both parts.,"Getting into the film noir genre was probably one of the best things I've done for myself as a person who loves film. Deep, moody stories all the while being stylish and evoking a despondent atmosphere are definitely my type of movies. Movies that ask important questions of us dealing with our humanity or depicting the ugliest parts of the human psyche that is disturbingly relevant to our modern society shows that movies are more than just mere entertainment. This is everything that makes Se7en a great movie, in my opinion.I could go on and on about the film, but first I have got to talk about the atmosphere that makes the movie so effective in many ways. It is just pure grit and grime and I love the film's consistency in its tone. Not just through its sets, but also the color tones that were used to enhance every scene makes each scene moody and ominous. These aesthetics definitely make for a lot of great cinematography and there is quite a number of memorable shots in the film. A key scene for me would be all the scenes taking place in the library, which are definitely some of the most beautiful cinematography I have seen in film thus far.What also makes Se7en stand on its two feet are definitely great performances from Morgan Freeman who makes each movie I've seen him in have depth and character. While Freeman delivered a performance to compliment the film's story, Kevin Spacey was definitely the one to steal the show. To deliver such a disturbing performance that elicits just as much fear as watching Hannibal Lecter on screen was a feat that I didn't even know could be accomplished. I was holding my breath in every scene he spoke to another character. He was that captivating in his acting performance.I don't know what else to say without spoiling this great movie, other than that anyone who is a fan of the noir genre or just a person who enjoys a good story should definitely watch Se7en. The film is so good that I had to include this on my personal list of my top favorite movies of all time. A pure classic in every way.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A disturbing yet great film,I really liked it suprisingly. Seeing it is not the type of genre I would normally watch and that I generally like but this film was really well done. It has a gripping and interesting storyline. I think the whole plot around the seven capital sins was really ingenious and made the story great. I love the beautiful dark cinematography and the screenplay is really intelligent. To add on top of that great performances from Morgan Freeman playing the detective and Brad Pitt as Mills. I also like how the film talks about a lot of murders but really not much is shown. Overall a disturbing yet really good film.,8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Words cannot describe the unmitigated nastiness,"I know there are many reasons to like or dislike any movie, and that most people who rate a movie 1 or 0 simply don't 'get it'. I feel a great sympathy for those who cannot find anything to praise in a film. Se7en is not an especially bad movie; it creates and maintains a particular atmosphere most of the way through; it is deliberately grungy, nasty, and brutal. The extreme lack of lighting serves a purpose - Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now seems bathed in floodlights by comparison - and the film achieves its ends efficiently enough.I am relatively OK with gore and violence (either on-screen or implied.) Many plots have holes, many movies get very clunky at the end, many actors share features with cardboard, and Se7en is no exception. If this film were in any way critical of the human capacity for the sheer unbridled brutality which it portrays, I might forgive it. If it had any redeeming qualities whatever, I like to think I would be prepared to try to acknowledge them, however grudgingly. Many dark movies manage to evince a knowing smile at some point, or succeed through technical brilliance or gripping acting.But I came out of this film wanting to throw myself under the nearest bus. It was as if everyone involved with the making of this film had spat (I think I spelled that correctly) in my seat. My experience of this film exactly matched that of another reviewer: it raped my soul. What worries me most is that there are quite so many positive reviews for this movie. I think this would have been one of H.P. Lovecraft's favourites, since the guiding hand behind it is most obviously that of Cthulu.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Brilliant, not a formulaic mystery","It's a psychological crime drama set in the 1990s in a large American city. It follows two detectives tracking a serial killer basing his murders on the Seven Deadly Sins.William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is an older, unmarried African-American homicide detective one week from retirement. He is thoughtful and highly educated, with a clear religious base. His replacement and partner for a week of overlap is David Mills (Brad Pitt). Mills is a young, impulsive high school graduate with limited literary interests. He and his wife, Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow), have just moved to the city from ""upstate,"" where Mills previously served as a detective. Tracy is less than enthusiastic about the move.Somerset's and Mills' first case is a bound, obese man found at his kitchen table. Then, a prominent lawyer lawyer dies. At the crime scenes are the words ""gluttony"" and ""greed."" The two detectives realize they're pursuing a serial killer and, at one point, almost catch him. Later, the highly literary John Doe (Kevin Spacey) reveals himself and offers to lead the detectives to two more bodies. There is a horrendous ending.""Se7en"" sifts through the life views of both Somerset and Mills and their struggle to analyze the killer's motivations. Freeman and Pitt pull wonderful characters from an excellent script. Though there is one memorable chase scene, their dialogue is much more important than the action. Paltrow and Spacey are good in their more limited roles. The cinematography includes much rain and dark, grimy interiors, making this outstanding neo-noir. The ending is twisted and unforgettable, reminding one of ""Silence of the Lambs."" The display of the murders is horrific but not overly gory. ""Se7en"" is not a formulaic mystery.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Review on seven,"Are you afraid of the deathly sins? By Dionne van der Nat, Floris van Hoogdalem and Myrte TjoaThis review is about the film 'Seven', directed by David Fincher. The film is set in 1995, the year in which the movie was released. In which city the film is set, is unclear and unmentioned in the film. The two main characters, detectives Mills and Somerset are played by Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman. It is a thriller which is very well directed and acted.The film se7en is about two detectives who try to solve a series of brute murders. Detective Summerset is retiring in seven days, the seven days relate to the title of the film and the seven murders committed. Mills, the young detective, is desperately willing to do a case on his own. Every murder committed relates to one of the deathly sins. When the two detectives discover after the second murder they are dealing with the seven deathly sins they know there are some more horrible murders about to happen. Summerset and Mills try and do their best to catch this guy, but are they able to stop him in time? We thought seven is a very good film and enjoyed watching it even more than once. The film is really catching and moving. While watching the film you have the feeling you are really in it and everything in the film is really happening around you, you can feel the terror and fear of the characters. Unlike other films you can relate seven to reality, without knowing everyone sometimes feels or acts like the deathly sins, what if you would be murdered if you did again...?Firstly, what makes this movie brilliant is that the acting is very convincing in Se7en. The character of William Somerset is brilliantly played by Morgan Freeman. His facial expressions, the way he talks and even his body language makes us believe in the character of William Somerset and he develops throughout the film. The connection between him and Brad Pitt is great and also shows us what a great actor Brad Pitt actually is. David Mills is the young gun in the movie, he is eager to learn and Pitt sells this really well. The two completely different detectives develop their 'bromance' throughout the film and you develop a form of sympathy towards the two. Another great acting performance is from Gwyneth Paltrow, who plays Mils' wife. The young actress has to make David Mills feel comfortable in his new surrounding and she tries to do that, although she herself is very insecure. Paltrow might be one of the most important characters in the whole story.Secondly, the editing plays an important role in the movie. On the DVD version of the movie they show how and why they have sometimes edited the light and shots. When a scene with a negative mood is filmed, they edit the light in such a way that it is very dark at the set. When a scene with a positive atmosphere is filmed the set has been edited much lighter. The head-space of the actors has been chosen with care, e.g. in a serious scene they want to show the whole face of Morgan Freeman to show how serious he is and they also do this in the opposite way to create suspense. The use of the reverse shot is used quite often in this kind of movie, especially when there are interrogations. Se7en is not an exception, this technique also creates suspense, and you can clearly see the intentions of the one who talks. The average shot length in this movie is different per shot and this makes you think about it. The director has done this sometimes to create suspense, sometimes to make things clearer for the viewer. The use of parallel editing is not used that often in this movie, but when it is used, it is very effective and sometimes it shows a surprise.Thirdly, the use of camera-work is from big importance in the movie. The director sometimes does not show things to manipulate us into thinking nothing is there. The use of reverse shot has been discussed in the paragraph above and this is vital in the movie to show the emotions from the characters during conversations. The way we see the corpses for the first time in this movie is also very well done. The camera is moving very slowly and you will see the grossest thing first. This creates a form of disgust and sometimes leave you breathless. The close-ups are mainly to show that the characters are worried and you can see the desperate look in their eyes. The movement of the camera when the detectives are chasing someone makes you feel part of the action and is therefore used effectively. The angle of the camera is sometimes used to make one of the characters look heroic (low angle) or to make a character look weak and vulnerable. The low angle technique is effectively used when the detectives chase the serial killer and it stocks your breath at that point.We think this film was really well thought of and very well casted. Everything said in the film really makes you believe the serial killer could stand right behind you. The camera-work is very well done and the music well-chosen. The suspense keeps up throughout the entire film and at the end of the film we were breathless. We think this was a very good movie, and although is was made almost twenty years ago, the special effects are used effectively and the actors are believable. We really recommend watching this film!",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Meaningful serial killer movie,"one of the best film about serial killer...

Decent film making, universal subject, overall good performance, David Fincher is at the top of his form with Seven, one of the darkest, creepiest, and most brilliant serial killer pictures in American film history, far more interesting, handles the violence with sensitivity, announcing its obscenity in spoken analyses and briefly glimpsed post Morten shots, but never showing the murderous acts themselves.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Masterpiece made better by incredible acting,"As a 15 year old, I did not know what to expect from the movie. All I knew is that it was supposedly good and that the actors were the best there are. The storyline takes the viewer on a journey along with the characters. The viewer soon begins to empathise with Brad Pitt's seemingly over- confident character. This is similar for Morgan Freeman's cool, calm and collected camera. This turns out to be significant towards the end of the movie. This movie is no murder mystery like any other, and perhaps not much of a murder mystery at all. This is due to the difficulty that the detectives have when attempting to solve the case. With any other actors, the movie may have been unbearable as it is often slow paced. However the acting was so real and, well, brilliant that you can't take your eyes off the screen for one second.

"""Seven"" or ""Four point five?""","There is no doubt ""Seven"" is a superior film in every way, so far as crime dramas/psychological dramas go, Fincher is indeed a visionary director. This film however has achieved an unrealistic and totally unsupportable ""aura"" of brilliance that is simply unjustified. Having seen it now five times, the latest last night after my son bought it for my birthday, I have to declare it to be as boring and pretentious as the first night I saw it.Without anything but praise for everyone's performance (Spacey, especially) I still have nothing but blank indifference to every character presented here. What in Zeus' butthole was the point of the film? Any half competent lawyer would have gotten Pitt a suspended sentence (justifiable homicide...temporary insanity..whatever) Who cares what the hell Freeman decided to do...hang around a few more years, go shoot a few chickens? As for Ms Paltrow - the most boring and one-dimensional actress yet paraded on the silver screen (though Nicole Kidman isn't far behind)...HER fate was the highlight of the movie.Shamelessly exploitive crap though it was, I found RESURRECTION (A ""Seven"" clone) way more interesting and given that starred Mr ""Wooden"" himself (Christopher Lambert)....maybe I need therapy.Quite frankly for all its social comment, upmarket direction, cinematography and set-design, I think ""Seven"" is a modern ""Kings New Clothes."" Great film....shame about the entertainment factor. ANY film that feels like you've just donated four hours of your life has at its core, a problem.As for those who even MENTION this in the same breath as SILENCE OF THE LAMBS - you HAVE to be kidding! That sequence between Hannibal and Starling during their first meeting alone, blows everything this film has to offer out the window.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"""It seems that envy is my sin.""","Seven is a very disturbing thriller about a serial killer,John Doe (Kevin Spacey), killing people via examples of the seven deadly sins - gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy and wrath. The story begins with Detective Mills (Brad Pitt) being assigned to Detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman). Detective Somerset is due to retire at the end of the week, and Detective Mills is moving up in the world, and is to take Somerset's place. This is a very disturbing movie. It will keep you enthralled and glued to your seat for the entire 127 minutes. Indeed, I was staggered that I never once lost concentration or was bored with this movie.This is a movie with an unexpected ending that is absolutely unpredictable and which is not at all a ""Hollywood"" style ending. ""Seven"" is symbolic of several things in this film: Of course, the seven deadly sins (Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Lust, Pride, Envy, Wrath) are the killer's inspiration; Somerset has only seven days to retirement and he was given this assignment as his final investigation; seven is the also the amount of days that transpire between the beginning and the ending of this case; and seven are the amount of victims that are at John Doe's mercy in that time span.Gwyneth Paltrow portrays Mills' wife Tracey, and there is a certain sadness to her character, something she reveals to Somerset one day while they are having breakfast in a diner. Even though her role is not one that is major throughout this movie, she is a crucial element that plays itself out in the climax of the film. One of the most haunting ironies I find in Walker's script well portrayed by Fincher's cast is the uncanny similarities between John Doe, the antagonist and Somerset, the protagonist. If you watch that one scene in the car, you will realize that Somerset agrees with Doe, yet although realizing that their consensus does not justify Doe's irrational, yet seemingly rational killings. With Doe's philosophy explaining his intolerance for the prevalence and trivialization of the deadly sins, Somerset's continuous argument that we are becoming too apathetic of a society, only motivated by such things such as our temptations and self-indulgence, there is admittedly a strong parallel that exists between the two characters. Yet, they stand opposed to one another, because while Somerset, although discouraged, managed to keep his faith in mankind, Doe did not, and could not tolerate the injustice any longer. The film has some gory and graphic scenes that might turn some weak stomachs, but it has everything you'd want from a thriller: mystery, suspense, a great plot, great acting and a great, shocking and surprising ending.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

A Masterpiece of Crime and Suspense,"David Fincher's ""Se7en"" is a grim, unrelenting journey into the darkest corners of human nature and morality. From its haunting opening credits to its shocking and unforgettable climax, this film remains a benchmark in the thriller genre.The story follows two detectives, the seasoned William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and the brash rookie David Mills (Brad Pitt), as they hunt down a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his modus operandi. Freeman and Pitt deliver powerful performances, their contrasting approaches to justice and life providing a rich, emotional core to the narrative. Freeman's portrayal of Somerset's world-weariness is a masterclass in subtlety, while Pitt's raw intensity captures Mills' youthful fervor and desperation.Kevin Spacey's chilling portrayal of John Doe, the methodical and philosophical killer, is one of the most compelling antagonists in cinema history. His calm demeanor and twisted rationale make for a deeply unsettling character that lingers long after the credits roll.Andrew Kevin Walker's screenplay is tight and meticulously crafted, each sin-related murder scene more gruesome and thought-provoking than the last. The dialogue is sharp, often poignant, and imbued with a sense of impending doom.The film's cinematography, by Darius Khondji, is visually arresting, utilizing a desaturated palette to emphasize the bleakness of the urban landscape. The relentless rain and perpetual gloom heighten the sense of decay and hopelessness that permeates the film. Howard Shore's haunting score further amplifies the film's eerie atmosphere, blending seamlessly with the visual elements to create an immersive experience.""Se7en"" is more than just a crime thriller; it's a profound exploration of human depravity and the complex nature of justice. The film poses difficult questions about the nature of sin and punishment, forcing the audience to confront uncomfortable truths about society and themselves.The climax of ""Se7en"" is one of the most shocking and powerful in film history. It is a testament to Fincher's directorial prowess that the tension remains palpable, the revelation both horrifying and inevitable. The final moments are seared into the viewer's mind, leaving an indelible mark that sparks reflection and discussion.In conclusion, ""Se7en"" is a cinematic tour de force, a film that excels in every aspect of storytelling, performance, and technical execution. It's a dark, disturbing, and unforgettable journey that stands the test of time. If you haven't seen it, prepare yourself for a relentless and thought-provoking experience that will stay with you long after the screen goes dark.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Brilliant,This is an excellent serial killer thriller.Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt play police detectives who together are tracking a serial killer who kills people who have each committed one of the seven deadly sins in a way that's relevant to the specific sin. Kevin Spacey plays the killer.,9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Excellent,"This great thriller is about a serial killer (Kevin Spacey) and his Se7en victims who represent the Se7en deadly sins. Two cops (Morgan Freeman & Brad Pitt) have been assigned to investigate this case.This is the best movie of the 90's, it has great thrilling moments, Morgan Freeman & Brad Pitts performances are excellent. Se7en has one of the best but shocking and surprising endings of all time. The end is something nobody would expect, i kept rewinding over and over again to see them 3 short seconds where you see... (im not going to spoil the movie).Kevin Spacey's role in this movie was a surprise for everyone, well except for the people who use IMDB, it said who the killer was played by.The most shocking moment for me was when you see that body on the bed and everyone thinks that person is dead because of the state of the body, but its not, that scene shocked me alot, i never forgot it and never will.Overall i gave Se7en 9/10, everyone that likes thrillers should go see this movie, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Must see.,It's very hard to talk about this movie without spoiling it so I need to keep it simple. Thinker/mind bender. Its insightful/disturbing nature is the only reason why I can see that it only has 8.6 rating. It's a movie you have to pay attention to. A movie you can watch over and over and always find something new. If you don't agree with that... watch it 5 years from now.,10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
David Fincher and the Se7en deadly sins,"David Fincher's great style of directing, a movie that's brilliantly dark and it's superbly acted. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are a pairing couple or opposite personalities and Kevin Spacey is the villain we all love and hate, such a great performance. Intelligent writing with no clich√©s and the imagery of the grotesque never descends into thoughts unnecessary gore or sensationalism. Brilliant cinematography with a bleak tone, the film has a sense of dread and some moments are climax. Se7en sticks with you in your and it's really unforgettable. The plot keeps you hooked until the most terrifying final moments you will ever see. It is scary because it uses your imagination against you in a deep, deeper level. A classic crime thriller that remains uncompromising no matter how many times you watch it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

"Gritty, Disturbing Thriller - One of its Kind","Incredibly gritty, very fluid, and most disturbing are all ways that one might describe David Fincher's Seven, a film, as all of these reviews on here will attest to, is about a serial killer-maniac killing people based on the seven deadly sins. There is little need to rehash the plot here then but what makes Seven such a good film and one of the best thrillers of the last few decades? 1). Two strong, key performances by Brad Pitt and, in particular, Morgan Freeman as New York police detectives just united as one, Pitt is coming, and the other is about to retire. Freeman and Pitt have some chemistry between them and let's face it - Freeman is just plain good at just about any role he assays. Add to this strong supporting work from Paltrow and R. Lee Ermey and especially Kevein Spacey as the killer. Spacey's voice and looks sent chills down my spine each time he was on screen. 2)David Fincher knows how to direct. This film is gross and really is selling a very seedy product as something more. Fincher makes that happen with the crisp dialog between Freeman and Pitt, the very low lighting effects throughout, the quick pacing of the film, and the depth of characterization that he allows his characters to have. 3) The story is well-conceived, well-written, and just crazy enough to be believable. The film has many scenes which are shocking and designed to be so - they succeed. But behind all that blood and seedy atmosphere lies a chess game between two police detectives - each good at what he does in a different manner - and one crazy but brilliant sociopath killer. The journey they take us on is one scary ride.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Se7en is Going to Freak You Out With Its Mind-Blowing Plot and Intriguing Characters,"As I was watching Se7en, I was both shocked and fascinated, this movie surely can be used as a mirror to other suspense films to show how they should be made. The anxiety and apprehension grows along the film for having such a captivating story, even if some scenes are very disturbing to watch, you can't take your eyes off. Another big contributor to make it more hypnotic is the soundtrack, when it's needed does an incredible work to elevate even more the breathtaking feeling. The director, David Fincher, did an amazing job in crafting this movie, it's proved how talented he is and something noteworthy is in some particular scenes, how they were shot regarding the style, angles of the camera that make you feel like you're in the scene.The cast, both leading and supporting, did a marvelous work in performing the characters. They're so consistent and believable, we really have the chance to know the identity of every single one in terms of dreams, emotions, regrets. Morgan Freeman plays an old detective, Somerset, who is fed up with his detective's life, because the city and the world as in general are too hateful, the apathy is present in people's everyday life and he can't take any longer this. He's methodic, pragmatic and due to his long career in the police, he's very meticulous in a crime scene. Detective Mills is played by Brad Pitt, different from Morgan Freeman's character is a young detective with a lot of stamina, enthusiasm but he's reckless and very emotional too. The contrast between the characters is pretty perceptible and is very well explored to show a man already marked by a tough and cruel world, Somerset, and other still untouched and a bit naive about the cruelty of the society.The murder scenes are so realistic and disgusting, they really make you feel uncomfortable and revulsion witnessing them and passing how sick the serial killer is. The murderer, John Doe, is played by Kevin Spacey. The tension drastically grows when he's speaking, his performance succeeds in portraying a person mentally disordered, a psychopath. No Doubt, John Doe after such a remarkable acting gained a sit among the most famous psychopaths of the cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Very good movie with shocking ending.,"Se7en is an undoubtful masterpiece concerning suspense, locations and camera. The actors are also brilliant and the story is one of the most thrilling and intelligent of our time. Really great: none of the killings are shown and are left to the mind of the viewer. So, why should someone like me who has just written so nicely about this movie rate it with just se7en stars? It is because of its ending. Surprisingly indeed, but... I think, a little too surprising. In the ending this movie seems to lack in logic. The characters Pitt and Freeman are playing make some progress in the story and they get to know each other better and better. Freeman's role is the one of a very intelligent cop who often has to calm down the hot-headed character Pitt is playing. But in the last minutes of the movie - I cannot imagine why - he doesn't calm him down and absolutely underestimates the danger. It seems to me that this movie just wanted to have a surprising, shocking ending (it really doesn't need to have!!!) and spoiled it a little bit to me. But anyway, this is a brilliant movie everyone should have watched. Once again, se7en out of ten!",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
One of the finest films ever made...,"I first saw this movie when I first visited America, I knew nothing about this film (as it had just opened) so I paid my money and gave the film a chance. It simply blew me away. The ending is just unbelievable. The performances are fantastic, the direction and art design are exceptional and Kevin Spacey (my fave actor) popping up towards the end was the icing on the cake. Plus every time I watch the film now it reminds me of being in America... it's my favourite movie, for so many reasons. :)",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
David Fincher does it again!.! ^__^,"Se7en is a reflection of our everyday life, we live in a world filled with media & information technology which makes people often live beside each other instead of with each other, even though the serial killer is portrayed as the devil in this movie i can empathize with his feelings/opinion about seeing sins on every corner of the streets. The intellectual, patient personality that's Sommerset & the young rebellious ""let's dance"" Mills really contrast each other, creating interesting character development.We as the audience are confronted with biblical/religious statements throughout progress of the film concerning homocide cases, if Sommerset had to choose a playing card then he'd retire as soon as possible, he's been doing detective work for way to long, but however he does get motivated by the unusual case of 7 sins that are about to unfold including all the plot twists & turns.Se7en has been directed with unusual grimmy & dark look, during the film it's constantly raining, as if time never seems to change the mood is captured with great directorial vision, the dark & wet apartments that seem to be abandonded for ages, a combination of brown & black colors recreating a new kind of innovative film noir, consciously leading us to unique cinematographic history.Sommerset comes to terms with our serial killer John Doe & even though they might agree on certain points when it comes to the subject of everyday life, these 2 characters are worlds apart at the same time, in a sense that John Doe murders his victims using the 7 deadly sins.Pacing of this movie is nice but if you're expecting a big action movie, perhaps you're better of watching a vin diesel (XXX) movie. We're invited by the director to be intellectually stimulated, while the story develops we must think along, asking ourselves new questions about every single horror murder committed as we go.With that said the film is in my humble opinion highly recommended, especially if you're a fan of the acting skills of Brad Pitt & Morgan Freeman, it's got quality(not much though)action, dark mood, acting, story development, character development, mystery, among others. Even though not for the faint hearted, since some scenes of the committed murders are visually shocking to say the least (adult rated), Se7en is a great police drama by director David Fincher. * * * * * * * * * 9 OUT 0F 10 STARS !",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
loved it,"i love this film, it is the ultimate thriller film, everything about se7en is brilliant. the cast are well picked and make the best contributions, the main characters Somerset and Mills are portrayed perfectly through Freeman and Pitt. in my opinion this is both Pitt and Freeman's best film, they still have not outshines there fantastic performances. Paltrow as mills wife was a good choice though there are a few other actresses that could have played this part, though i think that what paltrow brought to the role was the fragile emotional side of the character, so i am pleased that she played this part so well. the director is my favourite of all time, Mr David Fincher! he is a fantastic director, not just for this film but for his other films like fight club. he gets fantastic results from his cast and crew and makes the perfect film. and as i'm a budding editor myself i have to mention the fantastic edit on the film, by the editor Richard Francis-Bruce, i do love the edit on seven as he cut at hit points and generally did well.if you haven't watched it watch it, if you've seen it seen it again! i certainly will.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Almost Too Much to Bear,"I was totally taken with this film. It's not The Usual Suspects, but it is really something. Unfortunately, I felt almost sick when I was finished watching it. The madness of the murders and the general philosophical sickness that carries it along put it out of reach for some of us. I can't imagine the world portrayed here. Great cast. I really thing Brad Pitt is excellent; and, of course, Morgan Freeman is his usual complex self. Once again, however, in a relatively brief appearance, Kevin Spacey steals every scene he's in. It's that unflappable delivery of his. No matter what is said or done, he anticipates it. The murders are hideous. The camera doesn't show the most gory details (which I appreciated), but they are sold to us through outside factors. I missed this the first time through and wanted it to be part of my movie-going experience. I don't think I could ever watch it again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
One of the 90's best movies!,"David Fincher has become one of Hollywood's most wanted directors since this film and this is a fantastic film.

The actors of the film are of the highest calibre. Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, Gwynith Paltrow and Kevin Spacey are all fantastic, Freeman and Spacey in particular. The film has plenty of twists and is involving while everything comes to a shocking and stomach churning ending.

#42 of all time? Not a chance.,"I had been waiting a long time to see this movie and I finally had the chance. #42 all time? 8.4 on IMDb? Man it must be GREAT.Instead, what I watched was a slow, almost boring movie. Where were the great twists? It was amazingly predictable. Guys print on a wall? Bet he's missing a finger or hand. Guy starved to death? Bet he's still alive, why else would they so lovingly pan over the body? Friday the 13th did that, too. Nice serene music and BAM! I wasn't counting on Seven being a ""slasher film"" but it sure seems to have followed many of the ""tricks"" of cheaper slasher films.There was some character development, I guess, and i'm sure that slowed things down a bit, but that hardly made this a great film.And why was it so damned dark half the time!

Se7en - a second viewing 13 years later,"Thinking back, I do believe this was my first 18 certificate film I watched at the pictures and it left a real impression. It's always been a favourite even though for some inexplicable reason I have only seen it just the once.So it was with some trepidation that I bought the 2-disc DVD on ebay recently and decided to watch it the night before last. I wondered if knowing the dramatic outcome already would spoil the viewing pleasure of what goes before.....It didn't.I wasn't wrong as a 15 year old in my assumptions that it was the best thriller I'd ever seen and while I've seen some great films over the last 13 years I'm pleased to say that this one is right up there with the best of them. It's also weird how I seemed to remember every single detail from every scene, even with my notoriously dodgy memory.I just can't fault this flawless film, Fincher was on top of his game here and it's definitely my favourite of his and I am a fan of Fight Club",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"It's great, but you'll want to jump in the shower after it's done","This is exactly why I hold fast to the idea of a second look, particularly when it comes to movies. ""Seven"" is Exhibit A, and what I'd remembered about it over the last twenty-odd years was the mindscrew ending - as well as the omnipresent rain and dingy interiors, a world I don't want to stick around in.But within that hopeless environment is a deeply unnerving thriller and even a good cop drama. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are well-defined characters; theirs is an abrasive relationship but a good one to focus on as the world festers around them. The horrors in this movie run the gamut from shock to viewer's imagination; and as ghastly as those crime scenes are, they're handled with serious skill. And then there's the ending, a magic act that could've failed so easily, yet holds up amazingly well.It's surprising that such an ugly, wet and claustrophobic movie was filmed in Southern California. And that wretched setting gets under my skin. Who knows when I'll sit down to watch this again, but it surprised me as an adult.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
David Fincher's first MASTERPIECE.,"Sin: 1-transgression of divine law;2-any act Regarded to such a transgression, especially the willful or deliberate violation of some religious or moral principle;3-to commit a sinful act. The Sins began the film and led to the end,but it was no sin making this film.""Se7en"", as you can see, it is about the seven deadly sins: Gluttony; Greed; Sloth; Lust; Pride or Vanity; Envy; Wrath. It all starts when the veteran Detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and the rookie detective David Mills (Brad Pitt) are both faced with a line of murders, and every death there is a message written with one of the deadly sins. They begin to notice that the killer, who later discover is called John Doe (Kevin Spacey) uses all sins for a different kind of murder. Soon both detectives begin a long study and research behind the insane psychopath who will later lead them to an unexpected end.With ""Se7en"" David Fincher showed the fantastic director that he can be. He went from hated (thanks to ""Alien 3"") to a true filmmaker giving a spectacular direction. Each scene is shot accurately making the film more tense and the investigation more thrilling. But it also gives credits to Andrew Kevin Walker (screenplay) with a superb writing delivering dialogs very well written and developed, and an insane study in each of the sins, but even with the gloomy environment, the movie manages to have humor that pretty much serves to calm the frantic pace.The cast is just wonderful. Morgan Freeman superb as always; Brad Pitt once again great; but who stands out is Kevin Spacey, after his appearance everything in the film seems to have a relapse, the suspense increases, the atmosphere darkens, all thanks to its whimsical and cultured expression of ""serial killer"".An electrifying thriller, well directed and written, loaded with stunning performances, leading to an unexpected ending. ""Se7en"" is the film that brought David Fincher to filmmaking life and to the world his fantastic films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
The standard of excellence for the psychological thriller.   A masterpiece and a classic.,"You really can't say enough about Se7en. It may have lacked critical acclaim (how this wasn't at least nominated for Best Director and Best Original Screenplay is beyond me), but this film is easily in the top 10 films of the 1990's, and one could argue that it is the best. Andrew Walker pens a marvelous script that is brilliantly realized by David Fincher, along with the help of 3 of the greatest actors of their generations.David Mills (Brad Pitt) is a young up and coming detective who's just been transferred. His partner is William Somerset (Morgan Freeman), who's on the verge of retirement. Different though they may be, they must track a serial killer who is choosing his victims according to the seven deadly sins (gluttony, sloth, greed, lust, pride, envy, and wrath).What makes Se7en so excellent in my mind is how incredibly real it is. There's the gritty feel to the film, and Fincher uses great shots and locations to effectively pass on his intentions to us. The film is one of the most suspenseful I've ever seen, and that is also attributed to Fincher, not to mention a wonderful musical score. Andrew Walker's script is fantastic. Easily one of the best of all time. It's such a simple concept, but the creation of the characters and the depth and development of each one is one truly remarkable quality of the script. The best quality of course, is the unpredictable, unorthodox, and scary ending that will make your stomach sink like a weight. The cinematography and editing are brilliant as the film is fluid and seamless. Technically, this film is perfect.The acting...well, anyone who's ever said Brad Pitt is for show obviously hasn't seen this or Fight Club. He's wonderful as the motivated, yet rash and sarcastic David Mills. It's a great character arc, and Pitt plays the complex character with heart and ease. Morgan Freeman...what can you say? He's Morgan Freeman, so he's excellent. Once again, a well written character that the actor takes and makes his own. Freeman is magnificent again.Of course, our 2 detectives are great, but the true stand out of the film is the actor who plays the killer, whose inclusion in the film was kept secret until the day of release. Don't worry, I haven't spoiled anything. He gives a magnificent, yet haunting and disturbing performance that will stick with you for day after day. It is one of the best villainous performances of all time. The final confrontation is spectacular because of him.All in all, Se7en is a must see if you are a movie fan. It's one of the best films I've ever seen, and you'd be a fool to miss this classic. As terrifying as it is suspenseful, Se7en is a thriller that will stick with you, an experience you'll never forget. I cannot recommend this movie more.10/10 --spy",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A disturbing masterpiece,"This movie effected me emotionally more than any other movie I can think of. (Except maybe for One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, for different reasons.) Basically, it's about a young cop and an old cop who's about to retire, who investigate a serial killer whose murders are based off of the seven deadly sins.What makes it so horrifying is that you see the aftermath. You hear the investigations, as they detail what happened. Match that with the images of the dead bodies, and you've got yourself a profoundly effective mental image. Good luck sleeping tonight! Aside from the disturbing elements, the movie is still a good movie. Pitt and Freeman give great performances as usual, and it helps that their characters are likable. Pitt's character is an arrogant ass. Or is he? As you find out by the way he acts outside the police station, he seems likes a fun guy to be around. And as the movie goes along, you see how his job and the disgusting murders that he has to get knee deep into affect him as a person. Freeman's character is pretty much the straight-up good guy, and you could argue that he's the typical ""retiring black cop"" that was made more common by Glover's character in the Lethal Weapon series.The story is very engaging, as the investigations become more intense, and the more the protagonists get wrapped up in the case. So much so, that the climax (which begins with possibly the most heart-pounding chase scene I've ever seen) becomes one of the most jaw-dropping and engrossing pieces of film I've ever witnessed.The dialogue is good, but with only a couple memorable lines (which I won't say, because they either possibly spoil the movie, or aren't that great unless you've actually seen the scene.) However, with that said, the dialogue is used as a tool for sending a graphic mental image to your head during the murder scenes. And that, is probably the best words can do in a movie.Overall, if you can get over the shudder-inducing murder scenes that I've only brought up about a thousand times up to this point, definitely give this movie a go.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

"""Well THAT was money well spent""","It really was. I saw this movie in a Five Below store. There were about 10 copies of the normal version, and abut 2 of the special edition ones that look like notebooks. I went on a limb and bought the special edition for $5. I had no idea what this movie was like nor what it was about. But I am so glad I took the chance and bought it. This movie turned out to be a personal favorite. Morgan Freeman was excellent, not just because he's a great actor, but because in this movie he was different than the ""optimistic, nature-loving"" characters he usually plays. In this movie he plays the close-to-retirement Detective William Somerset, who dislikes the world and what it has become. Brad Pitt gave a great performance as the loud-mouthed, over-jumpy Detective David Mills. Usually I don't like Brad Pitt and I think hes obnoxious and a lousy actor, but in this movie I'll make an exception. He was obnoxious in some ways in this movie, but it fit his character perfectly. Gwyneth Paltrow gave a decent performance as the stressed Tracy Mills. R. Lee Ermey was great as the Police Captain, I always enjoy his performances no matter what the circumstances. Even the bad guy (Will not give the actor's name to prevent spoilers) was Grade A in his part. The weather was rainy for most of the movie, and scenes were always lighted in small doses, meaning it was dark and gloomy for most of the film. THis really set the tone.

The Best of its Kind,"Seven is by far one of the best serial killer movies ever made. This movie has a great premise, fantastic actors, great direction by David Fincher, and a fantastic gritty atmosphere.The story centers around 2 dectectives, both going down seperate paths. Det.omerset(Morgan Freeman) is heading toward retairment while Detective Mills(Brad Pitt)is just starting out his career. He's full of energy and opinions. Soon the both are on the msot disturbing case they have ever come across. A serial killer is killing his victims based on the seven deadly sins(Gluttony, Sloth, Wrath, Lust, Greed, Envy. The killer is very smart and the two detectives soon realize that he is using them as a pawn to complete his masterpiece.The acting in this film is amazing. Morgan Freeman turns in a great performance. very subtle, yet commanding. He's like a wise-man spreading his knowledge to others. Brad Pitt is also very good in a more energetic performance. His character is pretty unlikable but he does have a certain charm. Gwyneth Paltrow is a bit underused but she is still very good. She's one of the only bright spots in this othe wise dark film. The killer, who's identity i won't give away here is avery effective in his small amount of screen time. He gives a very creepy performance that will leave a lasting impression.Another thing this film has going for it is style. David Fincher has put together a film with a fascinating atmosphere. It's very dark and it sets th tone for the film.I suggest you go out and rent this film if you haven't seen it. Also for fans of the film the 2 disc dvd is a must have.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Better than Fight Club...!,"Now don't get me wrong, I love Fight Club and will write a very positive review of that movie sometime soon. However, to me, Se7en will forever be the superior film.The plot, if you haven't seen or heard it before, concerns two detectives. One is old and about to retire while the other is new and fresh to the city. Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is as grizzled a veteran as can be imagined, his lined, elderly face folding into itself with the worries of life and the job in the city of Los Angeles (I think), a place he regards as Hell on Earth and which he is very happy to be retiring away from. Of course, like every cop on his way out (in Hollywood at least) Somerset has one last case to face, although it isn't his to take. Instead it's the property of a young buck, Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt) who initially treats it as 'just another nasty corpse,' in this case a man literally eating himself to death. Of course, where director David Fincher is involved, a tag like that is bound to be less than the whole story and, before long, a second body is discovered.Further plot explanations will only spoil the rest of the film, but stay put through the quiet, if edgy opening and you'll be hugely rewarded. This movie crackles with menace and, even before we meet the man responsible for all the carnage (Kevin Spacey's 'John Doe') you'll have experienced some truly horrifying, terror inducing moments. The fact that few if any of these are the product of screeching music or artificial suspense is a fine testament to Fincher's skill and the generally understated production of the film. Pitt isn't pretty, Somerset is hardly a benevolent mentor and Gwyneth Paltrow (as Mills' wife Tracy) is the epitome of be-trodden womanhood, someone whose former carefree existence in some quiet little town outside of LA has become a living nightmare inside of it.The cast really shine in this film, as does the director and just about everyone involved. At no point during proceedings are you entirely sure that another horror isn't right around the corner, this despite the fact that the majority of the seven atrocities are seldom even shown on screen. Fincher whets our appetite with almost graphic descriptions by junior policemen at the scene and lets the camera play over the locations of the murders just skirting the defiled corpses... but seldomly are we given the full visual. This technique actually makes the whole thing much more disturbing as your imagination is left to fill in the gaps. A corpse on film is seldom unpleasant after you've seen it once or twice. One tantalisingly close yet just out of sight can haunt you far more! And when Fincher cheekily allows himself one moment of surprise it bursts from the screen with all the greater force because of his earlier restraint.In this movie the acting, the atmosphere, the direction, the music, the plot and the pacing are all top notch and make this film a must have on DVD. Any criticisms I have are limited to a sense that there is a prevalence of style over substance in Se7en, something I think Fight Club also suffers from. The minimalist outlook and constant rain all make for a compelling atmosphere, but you only very occasionally get a feel for how big the case is. Instead it more often seems like an irrelevancy in the fast moving metropolis whereas, in fact, the murders are meant to ignite a media frenzy that ultimately leads to the films' incredible conclusion. But that is a minor quibble and one that you must probably accept with all Fincher's work.All in all this is a fantastic movie and the perfect antidote to the usual, asinine output from Hollywood (and since I'm writing this the day before Valentine's day I feel particularly vindicated in saying that!). Every cast member does their job perfectly, even the more extreme outbursts of emotion being delivered in such a way as to appear genuine, rather than the 'oh it's just an actor looking for an Oscar' pitches that I often feel when I see a modern, 'worthy' film. On top of that you seldom feel like your watching a movie. The director keeps many of his usual tricks to himself this time, instead giving us more of an insight into, rather than presentation of, three extraordinary days in the lives of two ordinary cops (Somerset and Mills). This understatement and holding back makes for a much better film and, while Fight Club may be cooler, Se7en is superior.Therefore my recommendation is: if you haven't seen Se7en then do so at the earliest opportunity, though be warned... you'll need a friend close by soon after!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Really impressive.,"77/100Se7en might just be the least David Fincher film out of all of the films I've seen from him up until this point. Nevertheless, that intent at keeping the audience at the edge of their seats in the very final act is still there. Besides from his hability to expand the screenplay's own storytelling with his impeccable usage of spaces and locations we've all seen to have improved over the years.Even when I can't fully settle for the writing structure this movie aims at, which usually tends to mess around with conveniences, any lack of quality can't be prevailed. Anyone who calls this film ""badly written"" is just stupid.Pitt does a great performance all the way to the very end, but who I want to call out is Freeman. He definetly became my favorite performance out of the whole film on account of the elaborateness he seeks in order to take over the scene he's acting in, even guiding some of the actors he's collaborating with as they go on.Even when Se7en doesn't have the charm I've grown to love from David Fincher, this still very much is a film of his, and he managed to let us know the potential he eventually took advantage of was still there, even if it was just his second film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
seven,"absolutely appreciated the movie upon first viewing and subsequent viewings....however, now after brad pitt's divorce and unseemly behavior with another woman resulting in birth of a child, my appreciation for the actor and movie have been altered. surprising, even to me, the movie does not hold the same significance....i thought i could rise above my personal feelings at brad pitt's apparent lack of integrity without it affecting my feelings for his movie/movies, but i cannot. he, like others, have nosedived in image for me. it makes me very sad, because i enjoyed enjoying success for him, especially after hearing about his climb to stardom, i.e., standing on the street in a chicken suit, etc.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
the universe in which the movie takes place is more interesting than the plot itself,"The filter, the rain and the depressing elements from the city in general set the dark, mysterious vibe of the movie, grabbing your attention from the start.The actors are, as expect, amazing are delivering their lines and had a lot of chemistry with each other. The dinner scene was especially super natural and spontaneous.I also really enjoyed how the film isn't scared to show heavy gore in the victim's scenes.But, to be honest, the plot was not as intriguing as I was hoping for. Sometimes, the investigation seemed kinda forced, like they were really lucky to find answers. Maybe my expectations were way too high.

Still my favorite movie even after 13 years.,"This movie is such a 'blockbuster' that it is only movie I have ever purchased on DVD. I do not purchase movies because they are a waste of money to me, because I don't like to watch most movies more than once, and because it is so easy to download movies to ones PC from different websites for little money. But I purchased Se7en because this is the one movie I can watch over again. Me purchasing a movie is the highest assessment I can give. So watch Se7en for yourself; it is suspenseful, a thriller, has a great cast of actors who all perform outstandingly, and most important of all an ending no one could have guessed.

Absolute masterpiece that everybody needs to watch at least once in their life, wouldn't be surprised if everyone has already seen this once in their life, it is that GREAT.

The story is so well written, the movie has your interest the entire time, I can watch this for the rest of my life and never be bored of it. Everybody involved in this movie needs an oscar each, it is just a history record breaker of being the greatest movie ever made of all time.

1 of My Fav's...,"So very good! I especially loved the ending when David (Pitt) is saying 'what's in the box'... don't close your eyes because you will actually see Tracy's (Paltrow) face, as the last image David saw of her. It's a brilliant and compelling cinematic move. It makes for really fun viewing because it's just a nano/split second, but once You see it - you can never unsee it. It stays with you forever. The whole film is wonderfully gritty and stands the test of time so well. We just viewed it again and realized how really classic it is. Take it in again... and I promise - you won't be disappointed.

Seven is one great movie I recommend strongly!,"Se7en is excellent thrilling mystery that has a great cast! Brad Pitt was very good and at the when he found out, his acting was superb! Morgan Freeman was also excellent! Kevin Spacey played John Doe flawlessly! Gwyneth Paltrow was good. R. Lee Ermey was good as always! It was surprising to see Richard Roundtree in the movie. John C. McGinley had a small part which he did good for the limited time he got to perform and Richard Portnow was good. The music by Howard Shore was very good. David Fincher's directing was unique! The last part of the movie when John Doe turns himself, when he is in the car with Pitt and Freeman, and when they were on the desert and the helicopter scenes were through the binoculars, and when Pitt and Freeman were going back and forth, that entire scene is one of the greatest in cinematic history! This film is really horrifying and not for the squeamish but if you love gruesome murder mystery movies this is a great one to watch!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Watching in 2024 and it's mind-blowing cinema,"I love long movies where there is plot and deep cinematography. Se7en maxes all that and more it is an absolute thriller. It contains strong graphic content so it is not recommended if you are watching with children. The storyline is amazing far from predictable and the actors have played their characters quiet well. Amazing shots were captured in rain. A well-executed thriller crime suspense movie captivates the audience by combining intricate plotting with psychological tension, resulting in a compelling narrative that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. This genre demands not only a masterful control of pacing but also an ability to craft a multifaceted storyline with layered characters whose motivations gradually reveal themselves. In a standout thriller, the screenplay balances red herrings and plot twists with precision, ensuring that every revelation feels both earned and surprising.The strongest elements of this genre often lie in the interplay of suspense and surprise. A great thriller doesn't merely rely on shock value; it builds tension through atmosphere and character development, often manipulating time and perspective to heighten anticipation. The strategic placement of dramatic irony-where the audience knows more than the characters-creates an unease that lingers even after the film concludes.Cinematically, these films leverage mise-en-sc√®ne and visual storytelling to reinforce the emotional undercurrent of the narrative. A moody, often claustrophobic setting can become as integral to the plot as the characters themselves, amplifying the sense of isolation or danger. The sound design and score work in tandem, subtly guiding the viewer's emotional response while intensifying key moments of suspense.Moreover, a well-crafted thriller embraces a dynamic moral ambiguity, often leaving the audience questioning the very nature of justice, right, and wrong. The protagonists, often flawed and morally complex, can blur the lines between heroism and criminality, compelling viewers to confront uncomfortable truths about human nature.In conclusion, a truly remarkable thriller crime suspense movie is one that not only entertains but also challenges perceptions, providing a visceral experience that lingers long after the credits roll. It remains an art form that requires both technical skill and narrative ingenuity, marking the genre as one of the most enduring and impactful in contemporary cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Haunting and visually poetic,"I'm a little late to the party with Se7en, as I first watched it just this year. One of those things where it's been in the queue forever and I'm slowly working my way through. Anyhow as a result of my procrastination, my ""experience"" of the film was slightly desecrated, but my appreciation was not. I realized just before I reached the massive twist of the film that I saw what was coming. I don't even remember who spoiled it for me...but oh well.The only reason I address this is the final scene of the film is by far the most talked-about aspect of the film...by FAR. And I didn't think it was greatest final act shake-up I've seen, but the movie itself is incredible.My favorite part of Se7en is it's stylishness. David Fincher delivers a beautifully noir aesthetic to the piece that colors the entire story. And my other favorite thing about Seven is the surreality of the nameless, ever-raining, Gotham-like, hellhole city where our mystery unfolds. I cannot overstate how much I love that story-telling choice. It gives the film an immeasurable sense of dread and intrigue. Aesthetically, simply a masterpiece.Se7en's other major strength it its leads. The script doesn't over-talk anything; it's economical and concise, but provides just enough chemistry for it's protagonists to make this ""buddy cop"" film stand out. Pitt and Freeman turn in some of their most thoughtful work and play excellently off one another. It's a character piece that succeeds without dwelling too long on exposition or any forced ""bonding"". Their relationship develops naturally, and in the face of abject psychological chaos, calm moments are brief and rare.I suppose it would be unfair to not mention Seven's creatively macabre components as well. I realize I didn't include a synopsis, but if you haven't already heard it 100 times from cinephiles and review sites, I'm sure it's somewhere on this page. The killer in Seven patterns takes inspiration for his murderous work of art from the seven deadly sins, and dispatches his victims in accordance with said sins. But the bizarre and disturbing, (albeit not explicit) murders are still a means to an end. The film's really about the tone, characters, and noir feel. 8.1/10",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Another Example of American VIolence Porn,"This movie is almost unwatchable because of the pornographic use of violence. There are filmmakers who use violence sparingly when necessary and then there are the ones who wallow in it like porn. This is an example of the gratuitous use of violence. The studios know that Americans and lots of foreign markets like southeast Asia LOVE violence for its own sake and so they dish it up because it sells. It sells better than sex. Religious zealots will let their kids watch violence while insisting that they avoid sex. So these kinds of movies get elevated to Academy stature. It's symptomatic of the American psyche. We would rather let our kids kill someone than have too much sex. Okay, that's overstated but you get the point. Quentin Tarantino is one of the most famous violence porn producers. David Finscher is talented but I can just imagine him and Quentin masturbating to graphic violence. They need it to get off.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"An unsettling, dark and hard hitting thriller that will stay with you long after its gut-wrenching end.","Deeply unsettling and intensely dark, this hard hitting thriller relies on great performances and a fully developed script to create a relentlessly oppressive tone that builds a growing sense of unease throughout. 'Se7en (1995)' is an interesting and subversive detective drama that layers its gritty, grimy and gruesome aesthetic atop a competent and compelling mystery to toe-curling effect. Plus, that bleak ending and gut-wrenching twist really punctuate the piece - providing an apt, if horrific, release for all the tension built up before it. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Seven ate nine,"After the abysmal failure of Alien 3, David Fincher held his breath for three years and made a new start with Se7en. His signature style of direction is all over it. Se7en is filthier than a dead stray dog at the bottom of a New Jersey toxic waste dump. It looks so miserable that people nailed to crosses seem happier.The plot explores the extreme pitch-black side of the human psyche and was entirely the creation of one writer. Andrew Kevin Walker, a former Tower Records employee, conceived, in hell, a heinous story of a serial killer who offs his victims in the style of the Seven Deadly Sins. What was he smoking when he came up with that idea? Brad Pitt plays David Mills, an arrogant, over-confident, semi-experienced detective who is way ahead of himself. He uproots from a decent precinct, dragging his suffering wife (Gwyneth Paltrow) with him, to transfer to the worst in town - an unnamed, rainier-than-Glasgow Los Angeles - for no other reason than ""to make a difference"". Good luck.Morgan Freeman is William Somerset, the most jaded and world-weary cop on the force. He only has a few days with Mills before retiring to a simple life in the country. Mills could learn a lot from him, and if he had any sense, he would. Sadly, this does not happen.In Fight Club, Fincher exposed the rotten underbelly of a free society, the seedy flipside of American culture that most people pretend doesn't exist. Somerset says the only way to deal with a world this bad is to be apathetic, the polar opposite to Mill's belief that he can make the world a better place.Few scripts make for good reading, but Andrew Kevin Walker's writing is one of the film's many strengths. He explored dark, character-driven horror/drama in shockers such as Brainscan and 8mm, but this is the meanest. The irony of each victims' death is made entirely justified by the killer's logic behind the madness. Of course, he does not believe he is insane. Just the world he lives in. Haven't you ever felt like that? It is important for such movies to have an atmosphere and Se7en is so rank that you can smell it. Pitt and Freeman deliver great performances, although Pitt should learn to breathe through his nose and not have constantly pursed lips. It becomes quite annoying.Se7en is definitely the film that kick-started Fincher's career. Had he made The Game right after Alien 3, there would have been no Fight Club, Panic Room, or Social Network.For that tiny minority who knows nothing of the film it's high time you checked it out. Even if you don't enjoy, you cannot deny its power and effect.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Se7en,"Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light ... (John Milton, Paradise Lost, Book II. Line 432)""Seven deadly sins, seven ways to die"" is the tag-line for this intense psychological thriller directed by David Fincher:~ Detective Sergeant Mills (Brad Pitt) is set to replace Detective Lieutenant Somerset (Morgan Freeman), a world-weary cop retiring after years on the force. Somerset can see no end to the harrowing crimes he has witnessed, the sickness that is the City. Dealing with murder, rape, abuse, and poverty has become the Lieutenant's life and he now hopes for some small shred of peace. Mills, on the other hand, is new to the city; he is arrogant and brash, having little time for Somerset's thoughtful and analytical techniques.As retirement beckons, so a new spate of killings begin. Like it or not, Somerset is given the investigation by the Captain (R Lee Ermey) while Mills is put on a different case. The murders are soon linked to the same killer - a twisted genius who chooses his victims based on the seven deadly sins in Dante Alighieri's 'The Divine Comedy' - and Mills and Somerset are paired together once more.Despite their clash of personalities Mills and Somerset strike up a good partnership, Somerset's introspectiveness and Mills's self-confidence turning out to be a useful combination. Each one learns a lot from the other; indeed, Mills's wife (Gwyneth Paltrow) thinks Somerset is a good influence on the husband she is rapidly growing concerned about.It soon becomes apparent that the 'sins' killer is playing a deadly cat-and-mouse game with the detectives, enjoying watching them either stumble or succeed at every turn in the case ... while he continues to kill according to the seven deadly sins: gluttony, greed, sloth, envy, wrath, pride, lust. They must stop him before he can finish his murder spree and most probably disappear forever ~ Se7en is not only the most accomplished film by David Fincher (Zodiac) but almost certainly - from a writing and directing viewpoint - the best psychological thriller in the history of film and television. There are none of the stereotypical clich√©s found in countless thrillers of violence, no room for the predictable, for the viewer is kept constantly in the dark until the very end. And the climax is both ferocious and awe-striking ... for once Hollywood kept the outcome a secret until the day of release, not an easy thing to do.Whatever vision Andrew Kevin Walker had before he took his script to screenwriter David Koepp (Secret Window) was ultimately realised once in the hands of David Fincher. Fincher's dark and rain-driven sewer, his city of sins, has yet to be matched on film. His choice of cast was spot-on. Se7en is a true classic, crossing genres like crime, horror, thriller and police procedural ... dark and moody, harrowing and painful, Se7en will appeal to the darker side within us all.Co-stars John C McGinley as California (captain of SWAT team)Matthew J Lee-Williams, Review.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Dark Human Nature,"What is the most simple way to present the Human's dark side? The answer is by sins: Sins that from the Fifth Century announce Man's most awful deviations from God.This movie isn't catholic yet, nor does it have an approach: it's impressively dark and violently grim. From the first start, the characters are presented surrounded by a whispering, sad rain. The mood is also set with dampened colors and grayish tones. Nobody ever smiles in the film, they laugh for few seconds when united in a dinner. But throughout the story, Detective Mills (Pitt) and Detective Somerset (Freeman) will set up on a case that is horrendous and enigmatic: a serial killer roams the city with the Capital Sins as basis to create his assassinations. He preaches, according to Somerset. Mills isn't accustomed to the following Odyssey, he is yet not aware of the fatal obscurity of the Human Mind. Somerset is about to retire, and he knows what he deals with his job, Morgan Freeman with his tired eyes show you everything the character has seen among his trail.As the play is opened; the killer behind the murders shows to be analytical and intelligent and he isn't afraid of people chasing him: he just introduces him to his ultimate ""work"". He plays with them. He presents a puzzle for them to solve as he is in total control. Kevin Spacey will surprise everyone with his psychotic demeanor and his empty gestures, showing spiritual deprivation.""Se7en"" is likely not for everyone. It is intended to expose the Dark, Twisted side of mankind, engulfed by a series of morbidly well thought murders. Actings are stupendous, all variating from a negative panoply: depicting Sadness, Anger, Worry superbly. Nothing is cheerful, nothing is lightning and warming.

"Often Imitated, Never Duplicated","Almost thirty years after it was released Se7en has been referenced, re-imanged and just plain ripped off to the point of parody. That's because it redefined a genre and set a template for the bleak, brutal serial killer thriller that persists to this day. But although there have been many imitators, the original remains far and away the best. Performances are excellent. David Fincher's direction stays just on the right side of the line between artsy plausibility and nihilistic hyperbole. The killer's plan, and the intensity of the final act, have yet to be equalled. I defy anyone watching this movie for the first time (without knowing spoilers) not to be on the edge of their seat and sick with anxiety over the final 20 minutes or so.

Kevin Spacey is okay but so what? He was much better in Usual Suspects and the Negotiator. Gwyneth Paltrow as always seems vaguely emaciated, and the main co-star, the smothering rain-was as much in the way as anything else.Don't go see this unless you have always wanted to know what the cause of a Scripted Barfing marathon looks like.

A stupid film for stupid people,"The film is for children, needing to be spoon feed every ten seconds the next step, victim. Like most crime films the writer/director feeds the view just enough information to avoid giving away the story even when such restrictions are illogical and unrealistic.The film is utterly disconnected from the realities of a major criminal investigation. We're expected to believe that NYPD would assign only two homicide detectives to what is clearly a serial killer.In the real world dozens of detectives would be assigned. The FBI bought in. Crime scenes would have their lights turned on (instead of the melodramatic and never ending use of torches), and instead of following like hansel and gretal the crumbs the killers has left them they would be following real leads.Canvesing, obtaining the CCTV's surrounding each victims house for several blocks. Establishing a when the killer was there and working out where he came and went to. Like another review mentioned we are asked to believe that this killer makes absolutely not a single mistake and that no one has ever seen him.However the films great crime is the belief, even after his home base and money is found, that killer continued to kill and work with nay a concern for being caught.Its utterly ridiculous and anyone who can watch this film without realising its utter crap is utterly deluded.Even most of the I hate it Reviews on IMDb complaints are banal and vexatious. Subjective things like tone, narrative and photography are well personal choice you either like em or you don't but they in themselves don't make the film good or bad.A good intelligent film treats the viewer with respect.Lastly the constant ripping on Silence of the Lambs (there are several comments in the film that refer to SOTL) when this film is far more of a marketing puff piece is an utter joke.I've deleted this film, and refused to even watch the much vaunted ""twist"".

The Good & Bad Of 'Se7en',"I am shocked that I watch, much less own, this movie, and as often as I do. It's so dark, so uncomfortable to watch in many spots and so profane (although I use a TV Guardian) that it's not a very likable story and film.....but I find it fascinating. Let's continue on with the bad, and the good, of this film - at least from my vantage point.THE BAD - As a Christian, I get tired of seeing the villains, the sickest of serial killers, portrayed as Christians. It's unbelievable Hollywood bias that would never be tolerated if minorities were the constant victim of this kind of prejudice. In case, you don't get the message they even pass by a brightly-lit neon cross in the guy's room! That, and another cheap shot about a Southern Baptist being the killer, and comments about the sicko ""preaching a sermon"" plus Kevin Spacey's talks about people's sins....all are designed to portray a sick killer as a religious nutcase. Also, for further Liberal slants, good-guy Morgan Freeman is talking to Gywneth Paltrow at a neighborhood diner and he relates having talked an old girlfriend into having an abortion which Freeman says, ""to this day, I am positive it was the right move."" Yet, he also says it was a mistake and he regrets it. Huh?? Other negatives include too many f-words and usages of the Lord's name in vain, mos of them said by Brad Pitt. There are also several really, really downright gross scenes in here. If you don't expect them, you can easily be shocked with these disturbing images: some very sick pictures of tortured and mutilated bodies.THE GOOD - Despite all of the above, the story - as shocking and sordid as it is - is a fascinating one. It gets you so involved that it's almost impossible to put down, even with the unpleasant scenes. The finale is memorable, too. I also appreciated the wonderful cinematography in here. There are some strange colors in here but it all looks fantastic on the special-edition DVD. Spacey was relative unknown in his acting career at this time was riveting in that final 30 minutes when he had his speaking lines. All the actors in here are excellent. This is a film that is impossible to forget.OVERALL - As a friend once told me, ""This movie is very disturbing."" It's also extremely interesting, but beware it's not easy to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Whats in The Box?,"When Se7en was first released, it was viewed as nothing more than a ""gorey shocker"". Today, it's considered a classic. This was the film that put David Fincher on the map. Alien 3 was technically his first film, but it was awful and he barely had any control over it. He stated that he would rather have brain cancer than make another film at the time. But thank God he continued. He was a born master with his signature perfectionist filmmaking. The performances from Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are exceptional. They played off each other so well. Especially during the scene where they talk about apathy. The dialogue in said scene was incredible. This film also contains one of the best finales in cinematic history.

Great thriller if a little cold and  dehumanising.,"Two cops - one young, one old - chase a serial killer that is leaving a paper trail.This is actually one of the best films that I have seen that I have only wanted to watch one. The reason being that while it has an interesting plot, plenty of action and a great twist it also has a horrible aftertaste. Like spending too long trying to clear a blocked drain.Hollywood has, for far too long, glamorised crime and the chasing criminal so it is surprising to see a film maker going the other way. This is a dark, decrepit and cold world where everything is falling apart and unkept. This seems a deliberate policy move that features in many of David Fincher's films. Interesting - in that is different - but strangely alienating and depressing - and these are emotions I don't want to wish upon myself.The serial killer and the criminal that leaves clues are nothing new, but the way the plot develops is. If you know the twist the movie will be cut in half and thank god I saw it without knowing the pay-off- although I knew there was going to be one. This is a movie after all.Brad Pitt never convinces as a professional of any type. Here he seems to have become a cop overnight and without much training. Morgan Freeman does his usual quiet-but-logical act that has bought him fame so late in life. He is nearing retirement (in the film), but I thought all cops were about to retire in movies - I took that as read!This is very involving stuff and we are drawn to grandstand finish that we will remember forever - but what is Se7en in longterm reflection? A horrible world in which horrible people carry out horrible acts for reasons of self-gratification?Serial killers have existed since the dawn of time, but America is home to half of the world's population of them.

This is a great film.,"Se7en has a lot of things going for it: A talented director and two among the best American actors of the past 20 years (Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt, the second at the start of his career). Furthermore, the plot is interesting enough: two detectives (Somerset and Mills) the first just before retirement with his much younger colleague try to resolve a number of murders perpetrated by a serial killer somewhere in a north American city (looks like Philadelphia but could be Chicago, it does not matter).I think the strength of the movie lies with the interaction of these two characters who are so different from each other and see their job from very different perspective. Both are very good professionals but Mills is more ambitious and sees the murders as a puzzle to be solved and does not spend much time trying to understand the killer's motivations and mindset. Whereas Somerset is more resigned and perhaps pessimistic about the efficiency of the police force to fight and contain the evil of the serial killer and the crime in a big metropolitan city like the one the action takes place.Finally, I thought that the movie tried to impose a visual style, e.g. The way of showing detailed images of crimes and torture that made me feel uncomfortable at times. If the director's message is that crime is bad because it looks 'bad' visually then I have some reservations.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Sick, Depressing and Boring","I can't understand what the critics saw in this film.  It's basically a standard serial killer film full of cliches (old cop on verge of retiring and young eager cop full of new ideas -yawn) but with two main differences - the ending, and the sheer grossness of the murders.I've watched many horror and crime movies and I'm not squeamish but I found the murders so unpleasant that I became detached from the movie and started wondering.  .  The disgusting crimes combined with the general darkness and mumbled dialogue made the whole film depressing and hard to care about.As for the ending, it only served to remove any suspense that had been building up.  I didn't find the last few scenes shocking or surprising - I realised what was coming and just wanted it to be over.Well made - maybe.  Well acted - perhaps (if you could make out all the dialogue).  Innovative - yes, but not in a good way.  Imaginative - yes, but not the kind of imagination you want to dwell on.

Se7en,"David Fincher's 'Seven' holds it's place as one of the pinnacle films of the neo-noir, psychological thriller and serial killer genres 25 years on through it's dark production design and solid direction from Fincher, a former music video director who had unsuccessfully cut his teeth in the film industry with 'Alien 3' three years prior, but shows his talents to full display here.Written by a former record store employee Andrew Kevin Walker and starring Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman, 'Seven' tells the story of a retiring detective William Somerset (Freeman) who is teamed up with the young, rebellious and newly transferred detective David Mills (Pitt) when they encounter a grisly, almost art-like murder of a fat man forced to eat till he bursts. A second body of a lawyer soon shows up with the word ""Greed"" displayed in blood, bringing to light along with the first killing that this is the work of a highly-skilled, patient and methodical serial killer inspired by the seven deadly sins: Gluttony, Greed, Pride, Sloth, Lust, Wrath, and Envy.

"Unique, horrifying thriller which leaves you desperate for a happy ending.","A film that genuinely gets better with repeated viewings, Se7en is a dark, depressing and disturbing tale which simply refuses to give the audience any grain of comfort. Brad Pitt proves for perhaps the first time in his career (forget his over-rated antics in Twelve Monkeys) that he is an edgy, dangerous actor with a good eye for an atypical role. Morgan Freeman consolidates his reputation as a consummate performer, playing the methodical, patient foil to Pitt's volatile man of action.Detective David Mills (Pitt) joins a new homicide squad in a particularly unappealing and unsafe (un-named) city. He is partnered with William Somerset (Freeman), an old, wise, experienced cop who is just a few days from retirement. The mismatched pair are sent to a crime scene where a fat man has been tied to his dinner table and forced to eat and eat and eat until his stomach bursts. Scrawled on the wall is the word ""Gluttony"", and when other bodies start turning up alongside messages like ""Greed"" and ""Sloth"", they soon realise they are dealing with a serial killer who gets his ""inspiration"" from the seven deadly sins.However, Se7en isn't just a straightforward thriller about the hunt for a serial killer. On that level it works brilliantly, but it goes beyond that. The ingenuity begins to show in a scene as powerful as it is unexpected, in which the killer gives himself up with two murders to go. For a moment, it seems that the film has made a terrible mis-step, but in actual fact we are being readied for one of the most fiendishly clever and shocking climaxes imaginable. The film ends on such a cruel note you'll come away from the film wanting to shout ""no - that can't be it... it can't end there!"" Oh, but it can! What's most disturbing is that when the killer explains his motives, he actually makes a totally valid and agreeable point about why he chose his victims. Imagine how disquieting it is to find that you share a common viewpoint with a character who has done so many sickening things. I don't ever recall seeing a film which provoked such a reaction in me. But then, twisting conventions and reversing cliches is exactly what Se7en aims to do (even the final credits roll upwards rather than downwards). The best mainstream Hollywood film of the '90s.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Holds up well,"This film holds up very well and I credit a lot of that to David Fincher, who isn't afraid to let his characters talk and isn't afraid to leave the goriest parts offscreen. This relies on two things: actors and imagination. He trusts the actors to bring the dialogue to life (I never mind dialogue when written and delivered well) and get the material where it needs to be; and he trusts the audience's imaginations are stronger and more vivid than anything he could limit the scariest ideas to visually.

WHATS IN THE BOOOOOX?????,"Seven is a true cinematic milestone, and arguably one of the greatest thrillers ever made. This dark and chilling film transcends the genre, leaving an indelible mark on the audience. Directed by David Fincher, Seven is a relentless descent into the depths of human depravity and obsession. The film is propelled by the outstanding performances of Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman, who deliver a riveting portrayal of two detectives caught in a cat-and-mouse game with a sadistic serial killer. Pitt brings a raw intensity to his role, capturing the relentless determination and emotional turmoil of Detective Mills. Freeman, on the other hand, exudes a calm wisdom as Detective Somerset, providing a perfect counterbalance to Pitt's volatile energy. The chemistry between them is palpable, enhancing the film's suspense and emotional impact. The plot is a meticulously crafted tapestry of darkness and despair, delving into the darkest corners of the human psyche. The infamous seven deadly sins become the chilling framework for a series of gruesome murders that shock and disturb. The screenplay by Andrew Kevin Walker is a masterclass in storytelling, leading the audience down a twisted path towards a climax that is as shocking as it is thought-provoking. Fincher's direction is nothing short of exceptional, creating a hauntingly atmospheric world that immerses viewers in the gritty underbelly of urban decay. The film's visual style, accompanied by a haunting score, amplifies the sense of dread and unease. Seven is a deeply unsettling and visceral experience, examining the nature of evil and the moral complexities of the human condition. It leaves a lasting impression, forcing audiences to confront the darkness that lurks within society and within themselves. A true pinnacle of the thriller genre, Seven will forever be revered as a benchmark in filmmaking, with its powerful performances, masterful storytelling, and unrelenting suspense.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

One of the best Horror/Thrillers in the past 25 years,"There are very few horror movies that have come out in the past twenty-five years that manage to deliver on the ""horror"" front without resorting to taking the gore over the top, or playing all of the lowest common denominator cards. Se7en is the exception to the rule. It's most bone chilling moments are dialogue driven, and plot progression is what packs the punches, not formulaically placed ""one-up"" death sequences. The story is personable (which is one of the best ways to increase the thrill factor), it's production is exemplary, and it's message is deep-cutting. An ace on all fronts. Movies like Se7en are a rare commodity these days. There are too many variables in on the production side to allow for ""perfect 10"" results upon release. But it's possible that this is what allows movies of a higher caliber have a greater impact. There is a sense of victory that gets mixed in with the stew of other pleasing emotions that movies like this evoke. Victory over the variables. Se7en is definitely one of the survivors.

The narrative is tightly woven, creating a suffocating atmosphere of dread that pulls the viewer deeper into its dark, twisted plot.

Shockingly good...,"There are very few films which are truly shocking, brilliant and moving all at once, Se7en is one such rare case. In my brief movie invested life, Se7en is only one of two films I would consider a masterpiece. David Fincher is my favourite director, and Brad Pitt my favourite actor, and this film is the reason I had begun to take note of the two. Fincher's direction is immaculate and Andrew Kevin Walker's script is unbelievably good.Characters: William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is a retiring detective, and he embodies so perfectly - silent intelligence, as opposed to the boyish aggression of his partner, the rookie David Mills (Brad Pitt) despite his claims of experience. Both attempt to uncover a truly mesmerising case in which the killer carries out murders based on the seven deadly sins. Somerset is deeply reluctant of his surrounding, whereas Mills seems to feed off of it, and their partnership brings across the subtle and brash attempt of uncovering a mystery respectively. Walker's script expertly devotes time through dialogue and minor actions to bring across the complexities of the two different characters and their different mindsets, whether it's their differing opinion on the killer, environment, or even how 50 bucks is spent.Story & Direction: As far as murder mysteries go, there are no better than Se7en, its script so clever, horrifying and unique. It brings a sense of realism through the characters who live in such a wore down and dismal setting. Each murder is horrific, yet as they pass, the audience become further eager to discover the killer as well as becoming further unsettled. And it is without any hesitation that I can say that Se7en has the greatest ending of all time, the plot builds up sensationally, with a dark and sinister tone and the finish is so unbelievably satisfying. Upon rewatches, the film only gets better. Fincher's unique style only adds to the tension and disturbing nature of scenes.Acting: Morgan Freeman as ever, gives a nuanced performance. His portrayal of Somerset as having come to terms with the ugliness of reality is impeccable. Brad Pitt similarly does a great job of acting as the inexperienced, arrogant and angry rookie, trying to make do of his environment. The acting is top notch throughout, as murders unravel, the shock of it all is brought across expertly through the sheer quality of acting, and Fincher relies on this, as opposed to clich√©d flashbacks.Verdict: i've seen many mystery films, and none come close to Fincher's masterpiece. It's dark, gripping and undeniably shocking. It's one of two films I have given the perfect 10/10. It's a must see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Fincher also does an excellent job to convey the unpleasantness and claustrophobia of a crime scene to the point where the viewer can almost smell the acrid bodies.

A wonderful thriller,"There is no crazier movie in the 90s that can cause to feel uneasy like the way Se7en did. Seven used imagery and your ability to imagine the insanity level of the perpetuator, to thrill you. The whole idea of using a gore scene to take majority of the movie's screen time and then satisfy the weird nature of some viewers was totally eliminated and the movie just focused mostly on character development which many may see as boring but it (the movie) still carried on to be a masterpiece. When you see the way the co-stars interact you will just bow in respect to their mastery of acting. Morgan Freeman played the old father figure and a detective who has seen too much of the streets and is so eager to retire and leave it all behind, while Brad Pitt played the younger cop, who is full of energy and is ready to jump off roof tops and chase down bad guys. The movie also made use of an array of supporting actors that are very good on their own to star in a film, actors like Gwyneth Paltrow, R. Lee Ermey, and Kevin Spacey, were also onboard in this thriller.Seven features the newly transferred David Mills (Brad Pitt) and the soon to retire William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) as homicide detectives who become deeply involved in a case about a sadistic serial killer whose accurately planned murders corresponding to the seven deadly sins: gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, pride, lust, and envy.The movie's name is seven but it is mostly characterized by Se7en and it is a most see in many levels. The thrill that the movie brings and the chemistry of the co-stars is one that you will not just find lying around in any movie. Seven became the first of 3 films that director David Fincher and actor Brad Pitt did together (that is as of now 2013) the others were The Fight Club (1999) and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008).The movie was a massive hit in the 90s and it was a both a critical and a commercial success as the 30 million budget brought in over 327 million in the box office. Andrew Kevin Walker received a BAFTA Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay and the editor Richard Francis-Bruce was nominated for an Academy Award for Film Editing. Seven won the MTV movie award as the best film in its year.If you haven't seen Seven before or you are in the mood of another fun thrilling ride as we chase down Kevin Spacey, then make time to see this movie again.www.lagsreviews.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

about seven,"Seven stylized as Se7en is a 1995 American crime thriller film directed by David Fincher and written by Andrew Kevin Walker. It stars Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow, and John C. McGinley. Set in an unnamed, crime-ridden city, Seven's narrative follows disenchanted, nearly retired detective William Somerset (Freeman) and his newly transferred partner David Mills (Pitt) as they try to stop a serial killer from executing a series of murders based on the seven deadly sins.Walker, an aspiring writer, based Seven on his experiences of moving from a suburban setting to New York City during a period of rising crime and drug addiction in the late 1980s. His script was optioned by an Italian film company but, following financial difficulties, the rights were sold to New Line Cinema. Studio executives were opposed to the script's bleak conclusion, insisting on a more mainstream and optimistic outcome. Fincher, determined to re-establish himself after a career setback, was mistakenly sent Walker's original script and, convinced of its merit, committed to directing the project if the original ending remained intact. Principal photography took place in Los Angeles between December 1994 and March 1995, on a $33-$34 million budget.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

My thoughts on Se7en,"Seven is a cop drama film released in 1995 about two homicide detectives, William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and David Mills (Brad Pitt) who try to track down a serial killer who is using the seven deadly sins as his M. O. Seven won the MTV Movie & TV Award for Best Movie in 1996 which was in my opinion very well deserved. I am a big fan of this film.I always love these types of movies. This film always kept me entertained by having the guys find the occasional disturbing corpse of one of the killers victims. In the last twenty or so minutes of this film I was very eager to see what would end up happening in the end. I also found that this film was very well casted. Both Pitt and Freeman did an outstanding acting performance. I found the antagonist John Doe (Kevin Spacey) also did a great acting performance at the end of the film acting all sinister which definitely helped build the suspense.I found the cinematography to also be pretty good, I never really research a film before I watch it, as the spoiler risk is pretty high, so when I searched for this movie on letterboxd I was surprised that this was made in 1995. Obviously the actors looked much younger but I really thought that this film was made in the '2000s. I found the Camara quality to be unusually good for that time. The stunts and set was also great. That whole scene where Brad Pitt was chasing John Doe through the apartment building was great. And the house where the first body was found was a very creepy setting.If you're someone who would enjoy a disturbing action packed crime thriller, this is definitely the movie for you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Most of it is kinda cliched ¬ñ the retiring cop breaks-in a rookie (by-the-book vs. the loose cannon working on a hunch), the clever serial killer, the soulless city, the standard noir ending where the searcher realizes that he is what he's been searching for and so on. The art direction is wonderful, with a real attention to detail. The movie makes for riveting viewing the first time around.  I find myself skipping chapters though when I try to watch it again.To make the last act measure up to the first hour of the movie, I think the writing should have emphasized the idea that the wrath/envy set up was an example of John Doe improvising after the detectives found his apartment. The wrath/envy scene doesn't have nearly the convoluted menace of the Sloth or Gluttony scenes.  It's a noir thriller and Gwen is unaccounted for - the end seemed pretty obvious to me compared to the craziness of ""HELP ME"" in fingerprints.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Amazing yet Awful,"To be quite honest, i don't know what to give this movie. seldom has there been a movie i wished i could unwatch, and this is one. but never has there been a movie i wish i hadn't seen because of the degree of truth in it.The acting in this movie is phenomenal; Pitt and Freeman really make you believe in their characters, which is the reason this movie is so terrifying. This movie makes the viewer confront the evils of society through the acts of a proclaimed ""mad man."" As you watch this movie you are instantly assumed into it, up until the point where you feel the pain of the characters.This movie made me look at a world i didn't wan to see. It essentially sucked the joy out of my day, and i am forced to ponder who in their right mind could write a story with this degree of sickness. Yes it is a good movie, but i don't think it is necessary in a day and age where the pain in our world is already all too clear.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Even criminals create their own reality.,"Aside from how this movie extremely highlights how blessed Brad Pitt is aesthetically that some scenes hurt my eyes because he is so attractive; the movie is disturbing in the way the criminal interprets the world. It is a VERY sick way of looking at people's moral challenges/the way people cope with life because instead of him empathizing with other humans for being imperfect or asking himself why they end up in challenging circumstances therefore committing these sins; he instead decided to ""punish"" them as if he is God on earth and hold them guilty for their spiritual tests. It is NOT his place to point fingers at others especially when they are not hurting him in any way. People like him could use their abilities and resources in trying to be helpful to humanity in any way like being a teacher, therapist, doctor, etc and not walk around killing people for their imperfections. This movie makes me pray for humanity to heal instead of hurting others who are already hurting.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Se7en..the epic of the seven sins,"How beautiful are those films that make you want to know the end while you are still in the middle of it, those films that surprise and shock you as soon as they end and do not get out of your mind easily.

Well, I only agree with the second part; With these words, the ending scene of one of Hollywood's greatest crime and mystery films was drawn. Se7en is a drama and suspense movie that was shown in 1995, which managed to make a wonderful mixture of several components, including the dark presentation style that harmonizes with the events of the film, the intense and focused plot and its development from beginning to end and the polished acting, all of these factors were in response to the wishes of the genius director David Fincher, who is considered This movie is a bright spot for everyone working on it.One of the greatest crime movies in history.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Brilliant neo-noir with incredible cinematography and a gut-wrenching climax.,"I love ""Se7en"". It's captivating, horrifically repulsive, thought provoking, and violently thrilling. Fincher's style creates a foreboding and appealing atmosphere that makes you HAVE to look, even if mounting tension and repulsion would compel you to do otherwise. Fincher shows you some very disturbing, bloody things in this film, but he pulls back and uses implication rather than illustration at the perfect times. The climax is incredible in its ability to effect you, forcing you to be introspective about what you would do in the character at center stage's position.

One of the darkest and most disturbing film ever,"This film was initially received with lukewarm review is now considered one of the greatest film ever. This film is so dark at its core that it will make you grip on your sit.
SUMMARY: This film is about a serial killer who kills people based on the Seven Deadly Sins and Detective Somerset (played by Morgan Freeman) and Detective Mills (played by Brad Pitt) must investigate to catch the killer.
Se7en is a very gloomy film, so gloomy that I consider the ending of this film as one of the most tragic ending ever in cinematic history and also one of the greatest ending in history. But this film is not really about a serial killer on a killing spree and the protagonists trying to catch them, it's about how this ""city"" is affecting the characters in this film. This is one great example of exploiting the settings to affect the characters. There are small moments in this film that shows that they are in fact humans and not just some random film character. Speaking of characters, all actors/actresses in this film is great especially by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt. This is still one of my most favorite film ever.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Unlucky number,"""Se7en"" was the serial killer movie of the week at the time of its release. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt--apparently representing Reason and Passion, respectively--are cops on the trail of a serial killer. Kevin Spacey plays the killer as a Hannibal Lecter wannabe with a vengeful-angry-God complex: he bumps his victims off in ways that reflect the Seven Deadly Sins.  Not a new idea; Vincent Price made two similarly-constructed movies in the '70s: ""The Abominable Dr. Phibes,"" in which the inspiration is the ten curses of Pharaoh in the book of Exodus; and ""Theater of Blood,"" in which Shakespeare's plays provide the motifs.  (""Se7en"" makes a nod in the direction of its predecessors by mentioning the ""pound of flesh"" associated with one of the murders.)The difference is that the Price movies were jet-black comedies, while ""Se7en"" is a straightforward suspense thriller, and a relentlessly grim, gray, dark, rain-soaked one at that.  It's technically well-made and unusually literate, drawing themes from Dante, Milton, Shakespeare, and medieval theology.  And there's a strong echo of Dostoevsky's ""Notes from the Underground"": when the killer's lair is located, it's found to contain 2000 handwritten notebook journals of 250 pages each.  (Quibbles: if he writes that much, when does he find time to do anything else... such as plan and execute fiendishly clever crimes?  Also, we're told that none of the journals or entries are dated.  As one who has kept a daily journal for ten years, I find that unlikely, especially since the killer is ultimately revealed to be even more, shall we say, detail-oriented than I am.)The movie's ending (which I won't reveal here) is distressingly downbeat--and surprisingly so, as well.  It leaves a nasty aftertaste.  It could be argued that anything less would've been a cop-out, but it still was about as entertaining as a sucker punch.  ""The Silence of the Lambs"" left us with Lecter on the loose, but at least there was salvation (the girl was rescued), redemption (the lambs were silenced), and retribution (the killer was dispatched without the incidental destruction of anyone else).  By contrast, ""Se7en,"" which offers none of the above, is easy to admire, but hard to enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"""Se7en"" out of 10?","Not on my scale. I choose ""1"" as a mark for this one. Why? Because it's sick and perverted, neither entertaining nor clever, neither beautiful nor comfortably ugly. Just oppressive. It's got very unpleasant atmosphere and imagery. Who are these movies made for? They are disgusting. When you watch this you feel as if you were bathing in manure. Is it supposed to be the development of cinema and taste of the audience since Chaplin movies? I'd rather keep with the old Chaplin ones.One disgusting occurrence goes into another, then - another, and so on until the list of the deadly sins is over. This flick deserves to be a piece of entertainment for bored hit men, who can later discuss ""the head in the box"" with their buddies (remember ""Max Payne""?).If a movie is artistically weak and leaves an empty feeling - all because of some fiction created by somebody, what's the purpose of it all? I should also mention that many years ago I considered this movie to be wise. And of course I wouldn't bother to write a review, but, damn, it's on the top 250 list, which is depressing.Watch our ""Stalker"", ""Ostrov"", or ""Solyaris"" if you want a clever film dealing with sins.

A dark psyco-thriller at its best,"A veteran detective counting his days to retirement and a rookie officer hungry for success and glory team up to hunt down a serial killer who refers to seven deadly sins in his gruesome murders. There's not a specific setting for the city where the drama unfolds except that it's a metropol area. The movie is perfect in directing, editing, acting and cinematography. Dark indoor scenes and narrow gloomy alleys shot under overcast and rainy skies fit very well with the brooding theme of the movie. Despite some intensive chase scenes and violence, Seven is not an action packed movie. Although it's technically classified as a crime thriller the psychological aspects of the main characters are emphasized. Some reviewers describe it as a slow paced movie but it is not. The scenes involving character development are as captivating as those with gun fights and rooftop chases. The tempo is successfully balanced in subplots but the tension is never lost and the movie never gets boring. While horrid murder scenes aren't for fainthearted they can't be compared to cartoonish blood and gore extravaganza in Tarantino's movie caricatures. Like all other scenes, the director D. Fincher uses them in moderation to instill terror in the audience. Some reviewers' comparison of the serial killer John Doe to Hannibal Lecture is ridiculous. With his unrealistic superhuman physical strength, H. Lecture's silly cartoon character looks more funny than frightening in scenes where he bites off ears and noses in a straight jacket and finds his way out from a locked iron cage. John Doe, on the other hand, is an average person who can be easily taken down in a fistfight but his psychopathic ramblings give him a much more real and menacing look.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

This movie is one of the most satisfying but at the same time disturbing movies in recent times, which has been highly appreciated by most. It's a very well written screenplay, great dialogues and captivating narrative. It's well balanced movie with right references to humor, psychology, philosophy, and life in general. Must say one of David's best work, if not the best. Morgan and Brad were a great combo team, both equally charming in their roles. Kevin landed a great role, and worked on his favor for a long time. The movie had a fantastic finale, and as the movie said, will be remembered for years to come and researched. I think as we watch the movie multiple times, as I did, we learn something new, something about self and something about the society, that at first movie movie viewing might not have made sense.

more focus on minute details would have reduced the loopholes to very few.

"""What I've done is going to be puzzled over and studied and followed... forever.""","For the first two acts of this movie, my impression of it was simply that it was a very very good detective film. But then the third act happened, and oh my word that was truly incredible. Insanely incredible. You will never in a million years expect that ending, and for it to be presented so horrifyingly too. It hits you just as emotionally as it does the protagonists, and that's all credit to the legend that is David Fincher, with his excellent use of cinematography and film editing to strengthen that feeling of sheer agony.As for the feature as a whole, I loved the grittiness of it all, giving the movie a sort of neo-noir feel to it, despite it not quite being one. And the cast - most notably Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, and Kevin Spacey - were magnificent, with the latter two's performances sticking out in my mind even to this day (I'm writing this review weeks later than I was supposed to).Overall, I would say that the stellar acclaim for this picture is totally justified, and whilst it may not be my favourite of Fincher's filmography, that doesn't mean it's not still high up on the list.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Enjoyable thriller! A solid written mystery with an oscar caliber cast and the undeniable David Fincher at the helm.,"This enjoyable movie owes alot to its success to the acting. Brad Pitt as the brash, cocky, young and fearless Detective Mills who really got noticed in Hollywood after Se7en; and the amazing Morgan Freeman as seasoned veteran emotionally worn down by his years in the service Detective Somerset. Alot of the film plays off the interaction between these two completely different detectives who are forced to partner together to solve the recent killings of a serial killer who commits his murders directly relating to the seven deadly sins. Pitt as the new but not fresh young detective determined to solve the case by any means necessary and Freeman ready for retirement after this ""one last job"" just ready to focus on leaving it all behind and possibly look to settle down (he reveals he has no wife or children). They don't get along at all and their worldly views and perspectives completely clash with each other but they put differences aside to get to the bottom of one of the strangest cases they were ever assigned to.Although littered with cliches this is a fine big time thriller with awesome support work from Gwyneth Paltrow and the very talented R. Lee Ermey who I really enjoyed in Full Metal Jacket. Another big time actor was a surprise to find here and is essential and crucial to this story but everyone who seen this already knows to reveal it is definitely ruining it for others.The story at times feel slow paced but it is because its cerebral and spends time to explain details necessary to the audience to keep guessing without giving away anything. Its somber, dark, and grisly and also sad but very intelligently done. Its a very popular movie for good reason and David Fincher is your guy for fantastic thrillers that keep you entertained right until the end. Gone Girl and Zodiac recommended as well if you enjoyed this one. A 90s gem. Also does a fantastic job showcasing the library as the primary tool for public resource and knowledge before the internet came along. Classic literature and books in general in the spotlight here too. Bravo!",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
'Se7en' (1995) brings the horror down to earth,"Horror films often pertain to the supernatural, but what's even more frightening is realism. David Fincher's 1995 thriller ""Se7en"" provides a grounded tense race to catch a serial killer. Slow moving, gritty, and disturbingly plausible, it's a great break from the sequel-ridden franchises filled with villains who won't stay dead.In an unusual pairing, seasoned Detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) teams with newcomer Det. David Mills (Brad Pitt). The two are polar opposites: Somerset is near retirement, and hardened by his years on the force, whereas Mills brings an upbeat enthusiasm. The partners investigate a string of grisly murders, which they discover are based on the seven deadly sins: greed, gluttony, pride, wrath, envy, sloth, and lust.Several elements complete the terrifying portrait ""Se7en"" paints. Visually, there are graphic murders, but moreover sadistic and methodical killings. During their investigation, Mills and Somerset reveal that the killer, John Doe (Kevin Spacey), has been planning his attacks for over a year. There's also the stark realism. Unlike pure evil entities like Michael Myers, Doe actually has justification for his crimes, albeit lunatic ravings, but he nonetheless attempts to rationalize his actions. Additionally, Doe doesn't strike in dreams, has no distinguishing traits, and is relatively average, except for the whole psycho killer thing.Rounding out the haunting genius of Fincher's film is a disturbing, and completely unforeseen ending. No spoilers, but suffice it to say you'll have to pick your jaw up off the floor. ""Se7en"" scares through mimicking the profiles of actual serial killers, rather than relying on paranormal villains. There's a thought-provoking theme of manipulating religion to validate one's own actions and beliefs, a relevant and adaptable topic. A thrilling scramble, ""Se7en"" is an unconventional horror flick with the biggest blow arriving just before the screen fades to black.-- Mitchell ""Moe"" Long http://www.examiner.com/movies-in-durham/mitchell- moe-long",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Mill's passion to catch the killer (and the prove he's no rookie) combined with Somerset's cautious, calculated, stoic-like determination makes for the perfect detective duo.As the plot line progresses, the movie forces the viewer to question the morality of both the heroes and the deranged serial-killer villian who calls himself John Doe.The pacing was just on the ideal balance of putting much attention to detail while keeping me on the edge of my seat. The killings are mostly off-screen which sorta adds to the dark, twisted nature of the killer.The cinematography; the rainy weather and the signature Fincher-esque color grading was in sync with the theme of the movie, and so was the sound-mixing.Brad Pitt's acting was oscar-worthy; best acting performance from him that I've ever seen.

A must watch disturbing murder story!!,"The movie ""Seven"" is a crime/horror movie made in 1995 by the director David Fincher. The film stars Brad Pitt as David Mills and Morgen Freeman as Detective Lt. William Somerset; one a seasoned cop, the other a relatively new one, paired up to attempt to find a killer who is inspired by the seven deadly sins. The film's plot is very intriguing and thrilling, as it makes you question what will be the next action; always keeping you on the edge of your seat. The movies mood can be seen from the beginning; dark, chilling and mysterious and it is present throughout the entire movie. Additionally the music from the composer Howard Shore adds to the chilling and intense atmosphere. The slow pace of the movie makes you really connect with the characters and the story. Brad Pitt and Morgen Freeman made an unexpected police duo which even with their characters differences worked out beautifully. Kevin Spacey plays a bone chilling character of the murderer and does it brilliantly. Even though the movie is very graphic, disturbing and a fair amount of gory, the whole movie has a great message that we can all learn from and the movies end is just phenomenal. Overall, ""Seven"" is a gruesome murder thriller that I can recommend to anybody who likes dark themes of horror without the sci-fi parts.

Master Crafted Modern Thriller,"""There are seven deadly sins captain, gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, pride, lust and envy.

Freeman, while playing the intellectual-about-to-retire cop Sommerset, brings forth great presence to the movie, the calm ying to Mills raging yang (or is it the other way round?)Some of the most disturbing aspects of this movie, are not those which we see, but those which we are left to think about. The killer's reasoning behind the murders almost makes it justified, perhaps the most disturbing aspect of all.The action sequences are all realistic and believable(well, as good as it gets in Hollywood anyway). The constant rain, the dilapidated sets, unique camera angles, innovative film processing and a oppressive soundtrack make Se7en a complete indulgence of the senses.As for the ending, it has to be seen to be believed.This movie will scar, but then, isn't that what good thrillers do?",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

The Prince of Darkness,"When I first saw Se7en, I thought it was reasonable. Then, reading the endless comments on IMDb that held it up as some sort of masterpiece, I became frustrated with people thinking that just because it is a well put together serial killer film, it is a masterpiece. Yet of late, I have realised, that Se7en is not a serial killer film. Not just that, anyway.Se7en is an idea, a statement (if you're as pessimistic as that) about the world we live in. There is not a single moment in this film that does not scream ""The world is a horrible place."" Personally I don't agree that that is true, but that doesn't make the notion of the film any less masterful. So, it is since I have realised that Se7en is not about a killer, but a horrible notion, that yes, it is a masterpiece. Whether you enjoy it or not, is a different story. But if you have not yet seen it, whilst you're watching it - consider Somerset's (Morgan Freeman) point of view, and consider how the film expresses it.There are some brilliant dark films out there - but I consider Se7en to be the darkest (and one of the best) of them all - hence the title of this review, The Prince of Darkness.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

"Warm Up to the Far Superior ""Zodiac""","Director David Fincher gets points for atmosphere, even if that atmosphere is mostly unpleasant. This movie is gloomy, even for a serial killer flick.Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are detectives on the trail of a killer who uses the seven deadly sins as the theme for his murders. I might have liked this movie more if it wasn't in love with its own grunge aesthetic -- as it is, it's the kind of film to give fanboys wet dreams, but leaves others wondering what the fuss is about. David Fincher would revisit the serial killer genre again with about 1,000 times more success 13 years later with ""Zodiac.""Also starring Gwyneth Paltrow in an early role, and Kevin Spacey, intolerably snarky as usual as the killer.Grade: B-",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Dark and disturbing,"This film is very gripping and disturbing. David Fincher does an excellent job building a tense atmosphere. Unlike other horror movies, this does not feel sensationalistic. The killer feels like a true twisted man.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
One of the best endings ever!!!!,"Se7en is a A horror/thriller movie where the killer is committing horrific crimes that represent the Seven Deadly Sins. The plot is a 10/10, amazing cinematography, ending and plot twist 10/10, Outstanding acting by Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman. THIS IS JUST AN AMAZING MOVIE NOW IT IS ALSO ONE OF MY FAVOURITES!!! IT IS AS GOOD AS PRISONERS, INTERSTELLER AND AMERICAN PSYCHO!!! The Ending was just.. I have no words actually. Even The Side Characters did a great job. Gwyneth Paltrow did a nice job. There is nothing bad about this movie, it even has the perfect duration. PLEASE WATCH IT!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Gritty,"This is gritty film about a serial killer who is insane. Might go down as one of the best murder mystery films of all time. ""What's in the Box"" I can hear this line in my head as we speak. One reason why it sticks with you is because of Brad Pitts performance. He is so flipping good in this it's unbelievable. I could watch this a million times over and never get sick of this. I'm going to watch it tonight. Morgan Freeman is also absolutely phenomenal in this movie. The good cop bad cop thing going on fits perfect.

A masterclass in pacing,"The film is of course a film masterpiece overall. But what is really nice about this film is that it zips by. Unlike many other thriller films that often feel overlong, this film doesn't waste any time whatsoever. Every scene moves the plot forward. The atmosphere is also really opaque and tangible; grimy, disturbing, bleak. You're unsure even what year the film is supposed to take place in. It could be the 70s or 80s, it could be the 90s or the near future. And you're unsure while watching which city this even takes place in. This inexplicability adds a great deal to the film's dread and disturbing element overall. It is also why this film is very rewatchable.The central performances really elevate this. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt play great foils: the former is a veteran, wise, no-nonsense, and virtuous; the latter is a rookie, in over his head, silly, and mercurial. The way they play off each other is really a joy to behold. Kevin Spacey also gives a great performance here. And Gwyneth Paltrow has a smaller role, but in her few scenes she's charming.Despite coming out 30 years ago, this holds up really well and has aged like fine wine. And that's saying a lot because I only saw this this year. When the film came out initially I wasn't alive yet until several years later. Terrific, thrilling, gripping, immersion, and shocking film. And it's timeless and at this point a classic. A must-watch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"(POSSIBLE SPOILER)...Serial killer story within a ""Law and Order"" format...","Watching SEVEN, you almost expect a beer commercial to interrupt at any moment because it's like watching a harder-edged, slightly grittier, mean streets version of LAW AND ORDER with a more experienced detective (MORGAN FREEMAN) conducting a sort of balancing act with his footloose, craving for action sidekick (BRAD PITT) wanting to get away from his desk work.It's gritty stuff all the way through, with neon lights flashing amid grimy apartments, chases through crooked alleys and across grimy rooftops and down fire escapes that break the tension of a story whose central theme is the hunt for a serial killer intent on showing off his skill to a detective he professes to admire. As the killer, KEVIN SPACEY adopts a zombie-like pose, a flat monotone and recites his dialog with a straight face--but he's never quite believable enough in the role.BRAD PITT spends much of the time protesting loudly against the authority figure who tries to calm him down when things get out of hand. But his final emotional scene is a challenging one and he does manage to bring the right anger, confusion and bitter resentment as he confronts the man who has played his final trick on him. He's unrestrained in this final moment and it's the kind of emotion the audience can understand at this point.MORGAN FREEMAN, as the more restrained, experienced older partner on the brink of retirement, is excellent but his final decision to open a box (without revealing plot details here) is a questionable procedure.Summing up: Some tense, well-staged moments but the overall effect is less than impressive as a study of a serial killer on the loose.Overpraised by film noir addicts.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Defies convention,"Seven is a classic at this point, but it never started as such. There was a lot of pushback from the studio, from actors who turned down the lead roles, deeming the script 'too dark'; and from the marketers at New Line, who understandably didn't know how to sell such a horrific enterprise to the masses. The reality is that this film is no more or less violent than a zillion schlock horror movies that preceded it - it's just that it is so well done, so effective in its narrative, and so psychologically devastating that the resulting film is more horrific in scope than most anything ever made before it, or since.It seems the jury is still out on where this film takes place. New York and Chicago have been posited, but there are no discernible landmarks to tie it to either of these cities. Philly maybe. I think there's nowhere else such a dark, sordid tale could be taking place other than where they shot it: Los Angeles, and there are street signs which don't even bother to hide the true location. Sure, the film is drenched in perpetual downpour rather than the typical sunny Cali atmosphere, but this movie isn't as much about the reality of a location as it is about the evil it documents; something which could only be illustrated with a heightened, dank atmosphere, where the characters seem to all be drowning in an encroaching sorrow.David Fincher's early whack as a director produced something original and sublime. The clich√© buddy cop film is turned on its head by having seasoned detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and his green partner Mills (Brad Pitt) do away with their opposing roles early on, as they simply sink into procedural necessity. The detective characters become equals much faster than is expected, as they are thrown into a task of having to unravel the crimes of a certain John Doe (? You all know by now who this is), hopefully before the serial killers 'masterpiece' is concluded, and more victims are tallied.Of course, this doesn't happen. What remains most haunting about this film is how uncompromisingly dark it is, how gritty it was allowed to be, how hopelessness is turned into an elegiac statement on evil, loss and death. The score of the film, by Howard Shore, is less remembered than the opening sequence by Trent Reznor - which spurred a great collaboration between a director and a musician - but Shore's contribution here shouldn't be discounted, as it perfectly captures the mournfulness of this story, and and the inevitably of its conclusion.Se7en is the movie which proved David Fincher is an exceptional filmmaker. He has made some pretty hardcore films. Se7en remains his grittiest, most memorable, most uncompromising. Thankfully the studio and marketing guys didn't get their way, or it could have ended up just like a million other detective movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Se7en: A Masterpiece of Suspenseful Storytelling and Terrifying Atmosphere,"David Fincher's Se7en is a dark and twisted crime thriller that delivers a masterful and disturbing experience. The film follows two detectives, played by Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman, as they hunt down a sadistic serial killer who is using the seven deadly sins as his inspiration for murder.The film is anchored by its brilliant performances, particularly by Pitt and Freeman, who bring a raw intensity and depth to their characters. The chemistry between the two actors is palpable, and their dynamic helps to elevate the film's tension and emotion.What truly sets Se7en apart, however, is its masterful storytelling. The film's plot twists and turns in unexpected and shocking ways, leaving the audience on the edge of their seats throughout. The pacing is tight and deliberate, allowing the tension to build slowly until it reaches a climax that is both horrifying and satisfying.Fincher's direction is top-notch, and his attention to detail is evident in every frame of the film. The dark and moody atmosphere he creates is both haunting and mesmerizing, drawing the viewer into the twisted world of the killer.Overall, Se7en is a stunning achievement in filmmaking that is not easily forgotten.

Preparation for Mank: SE7EN is one of the best sophomore films in the history of cinema!,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)I've never written or even thought about my favorite movies of all-time. I don't believe in having a definite Top10 or Top20 of every film I've ever seen. However, if I had to write this special list, I have no doubts that Se7en would be there. Obviously, this is a rewatch of the classic movie that impacted filmmaking and launched David Fincher's remarkable career (I also ignore the fact that Alien 3 is connected to Fincher due to the known production issues). With his next film, Mank, coming up on Netflix in a few weeks, I decided to go through part of his filmography. Se7en will be the first out of five Fincher's movies that I will be able to revisit throughout this week.I've seen this film countless times, but to be completely honest, I haven't seen it in so long that I didn't remember exactly some important plot points and a key component about the ending. This helped me experience Se7en in a fascinating way once again. Andrew Kevin Walker's screenplay has one of the most intriguing, mysterious, captivating narratives I've ever witnessed, still to this day. From the very beginning to the last second, I'm constantly at the edge of my seat (in this case, my couch) with severe anxiety levels and feeling incredibly tense. Biting my nails, moving my leg up and down, changing positions... it's so mesmerizing that I'm only writing about it more than twenty-four hours after I watched it.One of the most impressive aspects is how Fincher is able to leave the viewer uncomfortable with showing only a single death on-screen. This is an extremely dark, gory, blood-soaked, gruesome flick, packed with horrible displays of dead bodies, but never the actual murder scene. With just a simple photo or a straight line of dialogue, Fincher lets the viewer's imagination do the work, and it's undoubtedly as or more effective than a visually horrific killing sequence. As the premise implies, the serial killer is inspired by the ""seven deadly sins"", and he goes after the respective sinners, killing them (or letting them kill themselves) in an innovative fashion, turning the sin against the sinner.The gluttony and sloth cases are visually brutal, but the lust murder is the one that keeps haunting my memory. The latter is also the less explicit, left to open-minded people to imagine the despicable act. In 1995, a movie with such a dismal environment and dark story couldn't be well-received, and Se7en got its fair share of negative reviews stating that it was too obscure, sinister, overly violent and that the ending was absolutely unacceptable. Over time, it found its success, it gained fans all around the world, and it's now considered by many as one of the greatest films ever made, myself included. From the outstanding cast to the astonishingly enthralling detective work, the third act stands out as one of the most shocking endings of all-time.I'm keeping this review spoiler-free because I don't want readers who have not seen this movie to have such a magnificent piece of cinema ruined for them. That's why I'm also hiding a certain actor from the starring section, just like the marketing team did at the original date of release (I'll get there). Fincher's third act is simply flawless. Everything displayed on-screen in the last twenty minutes is filmmaking perfection. From the impressively suspenseful build-up to that jaw-dropping climactic moment, passing through a mind-blowing revelation, Se7en's conclusion is and will remain as one of the most brutally shocking endings in the history of cinema.Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt share fantastic chemistry, portraying two iconic characters that couldn't be more different than one another. Somerset is a notable detective with extreme attention to detail, knowledgeable, and always curious about the case at hand. Freeman incorporates this character effortlessly, delivering a subtle yet powerful performance. Pitt portrays Mills, a childish, unfocused, immature replacement to the previous detective about to retire. Despite its apparent lack of work ethics, Mills is clever, relentless in finding the killer, and desperately wants to prove himself. Pitt, just like Freeman, embodies this persona seamlessly and also gives an outstanding interpretation.Technically, where should I begin? From the haunting score of Howard Shore to the documentary-like cinematography (Darius Khondji) that offers a tremendously realistic atmosphere, it's the phenomenal production design that stands out. Fincher really wanted the dirty, rainy, depressing city to feel authentic and as real as possible. The first dialogues of the film are meant to point out the bleakness and awfulness of the city, but even without these conversations, any viewer will be able to acknowledge the absence of color, joyfulness, and life in this unknown location. Fincher's filmmaking techniques are demonstrated in plain splendor for everyone to see, and this was just his beginning.Movies like Se7en are impossible to be made today, period. It would never be conceivable to completely hide one of the main actors from the press tour and/or trailers. We live in a time where the promotion of a film must have everything and everyone. Nowadays, trailers show way too much, and this isn't news to anyone. The ending was forced by Pitt and Fincher since the studio wanted a more mainstream conclusion. Today, filmmakers may have more freedom, but there are still countless cases of executive producers changing a movie without the director's will and/or permission. Se7en was a film released in a time where it should have never been released in the first place. Fortunately, it was.Se7en might be the best director's sophomore movie in the history of cinema, and it's undoubtedly one of my favorite films of all-time. David Fincher's classic possesses one of the most captivating screenplays I've ever witnessed, marked by an extremely dark, somber, violent, gruesome story that ends with one of the most emotionally shocking conclusions to a movie, ever. The lack of on-screen death scenes is both the most surprising and effectively powerful element of the whole film, leaving the unpleasant work of imagining a specific type of murder to the viewer's mind. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are extraordinary as the now iconic detectives, delivering two truly brilliant performances. Fincher's trademark filmmaking style started here, as every technical aspect contributes to the movie's incredible realism. From the simple, documentary-like camera work to the ominous score, it's the authentic production design that sets the depressing tone, the bleak atmosphere, and the rainy, colorless, lifeless city. Overall, it's a technically flawless piece of art. One of the greatest films ever made.... I can't recommend it more.Rating: A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
That's how thrillers should look like.,"(Sorry for bad English)Se7en is unique. Usually after watching good movie I want to see it again, but not in this case. This movie shocked me with violence, it gave me so many emotions that i don't want to watch it one more time, I never thought that just a movie can scare so much. Most of horrors novadays doesn't scare so much as Se7en. Storyline is awesome and actors play very good, especially Bradd Pitt in final scene - unforgettable. Morgan Freeman always play well and so he did. After watching Se7en you will start to compare all thrillers with it. By the way I watched Se7en about a year ago but I still remember it very well and I still don't want to re watch it. This film definitely is not for everyone.

Brad looked extremely cool & dashing and Gwyneth looked simply lovely. Sloth still had the ability to make me jump even though I knew what was coming.

If you don't mind some gore check it out.,"Se7en is your run of the mill detective thriller with a razor sharp and bloody edge, though it is not only the gore that sets this movie apart. With an incredible cast (Morgan Freeman, Brad Pit, Kevin Spacey, Gweneth Paltrow, and R. Lee Emery), a sometimes overly slick but competent director (David Fincher of Fight Club fame), and a smart script by Andrew Kevin Walker (8mm) this movie was a much needed shot in the arm for the genre.We open on Dectective Somerset (Morgan Freeman) at the scene of a violent crime, this pretty much sets the tone.  Dectective Mills (Brad Pitt) enters and we learn that Somerset is retiring and Mills is his replacement.  This is there ""transition"" period and Mills last week on the job.These first few short scences are followed by one of the best opening credit sequeces ever made.At the scene of another horribly gruesome crime we come across a man who has aparently eaten to death.  When another, equally heinous, crime is linked to the first we realize that there maybe a serial killer on the prowl.  The Race is on.  Can John Doe (Kevin Spacey), our friendly nieghborhood psychopath, be stopped before he kills one person for every deadly sin (of which there are 'Se7en'), will Somerset get is man before he is out to pasture, and is there something more to these killings than at first glance.I strongly recomend this movie, but only to the not so sqeamish.  With a dark gritty atmosphere and filthy city as the backdrop to the unconscionable actions of mad man, you should not be let down.  This is a highly entertianing film with more than one layer.  If you have not seen it you are missing out.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Decades later, still one of the best neo-noir psychological crime thrillers! [+82%]","A rewatch many years later, Se7en still proves to be a very intense and benchmark psychological crime thriller. The buddy-cop chemistry that Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt share is built over several scenes in between the procedurals. Fincher, working off Andrew Kevin Walker's script, adds neo-noir visual flourishes (the use of climate, be it sun or rain, is superbly effective) and crafts elaborate scenes that allow emotions to sink in. Gwyneth Paltrow isn't as prominent a presence as the other two, but she adds the much needed sensitive heft. The crimes (or the crime scenes) themselves are gruesomely portrayed, not toning down their visceral nature one bit. Se7en isn't throwing these barbaric ideas at you just for the sake of cheap shocks - it gives the antagonist (played by Kevin Spacey) an arc of his own, and also lets viewers in on his ideologies in that intriguing pre-climactic car scene.Freeman and Pitt are excellent, fitting their respective roles to the T. Somerset never showcases weakness, and this is attributed to all the years he spent in the city's most dangerous precinct, mostly by himself. He's well-read too, a trait that actually helps the duo get closer to the offender. Mills, on the other hand, is hot-headed and racy. He doesn't care about the depths of the crime - he simply wants to nab the bad guy and put him away. They play each other off perfectly. And Spacey, as much as he's despised now, embodies evil in a way that very few actors could. That he won the Academy Award (for his performance in The Usual Suspects, released earlier that year) makes all the sense in the world now.What prompted me to revisit Se7en is the latest instalment in the Saw franchise - Spiral. The films share more similarities than I possibly imagined. In fact, I'd even go on to say that Spiral borrows more from Se7en than the Saw series itself. Put John Doe and John Kramer in a room and they'd make great conversationalists. The Little Things, the 2021 Denzel-Malek-Leto starter, is another film that immediately comes to mind. Both Spiral and The Little Things are inferior pieces, but I'm glad filmmakers are still interested in exploring the genre further.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

I thought his Alien 3 film was much more powerful than other people I know and here Fincher shows he has talent. The mood is set from the very beginning, especially the credit sequence. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt become their characters and the film pulls you into its universe. It makes you feel scared, it makes you think.

review on Se7en,"The movie Se7en tells the story of two homicide detectives, David Mills (Brad Pitt) and William Sommerset (Morgan Freeman), who try to solve seven mysterious murders. All the seven murders are committed very sadistically as the victims are badly mutilated. The mutilations have the purpose of symbolizing the seven deadly sins described in the Bible. David Mills is the new homicide detective and he is aided by the soon to retire William Sommerset. The difference between old 'veteran' Sommerset and 'rookie' Mills brings quite some conflicts in the beginning, but eventually the both of them agree that if they want to catch the killer, they will have to work together and make use of each other's strengths. The movie takes some major twists and turns at the end, and this does contribute to giving the movie a satisfying ending.We think Se7en is a good movie. The story behind the murders with the seven sins connected to it makes you think, whether or not the murders were really that bad, or did the victims (sort of) deserve it? Asking yourself this question is the result of the strong movie, as you would normally not even consider if a murder was right or not. As mentioned before, the movie builds up to the end, which does live up to the expectations created by the rest of the film, as the ending is just as dramatic and well done as the other parts of the film, which leaves you with a satisfied feeling.Editing plays a very big and important role in the production of movies, and this movie is no exception. Basically, everything that is even slightly altered from the recorded parts is included in the category editing. Editing therefore is making changes in filmed fragments, and putting these changed fragments together to form a fluent and pleasant to watch movie. An editor therefore has to make a lot of decisions. What parts should he choose to put together to create the right feeling and to satisfy the producer? why should he choose these? Etc. Editing, however, is not just used to make the movie look good or catchy, it's also used to give the audience a certain feeling, imprinted in their minds by the director. In this way, the director can set the experience of the movie to his hand.Using things such as different lighting, camera height, music and shot length, the movie directors can give the audience certain opinions about the characters without even having the character say a single word. Characters with power are often filmed from a low perspective, as this symbolizes them being greater than you. Meanwhile, meaner or evil characters often have a darker glow around them and different background music, because this creates tension. Difference in Shot length shows a difference in the amount of energy used. The shorter the shots, the more energy is in the actions. For example, in a shooter, shots constantly change from one to the other, whereas in a love-story, the shot length is way longer, to make it more romantic and lovable.This movie includes a lot of dramatic and painful scenes, wherein the director made use of a range of different shot transitions, to highlight the different amounts of tension in the scenes. In order to make sure that the message is communicated to the audience, they use longer shots and they pause between the monologues. In this way, the audience is forced to think about what's being said and what the message of the movie is. When energetic and active scenes are concerned, the director chose for short shot length, and fast shot transitions, in order to give the scenes more speed.The film was shot in a way that is uncommon in popular films. It was shot in a special way using special lighting, making lots of shadows and silhouettes. The film was then edited with a process called C.C.E, which enhances the quality of the lights, making the dark parts darker and the light parts whiter. This alteration from the original is permanent.Most of the colors used are shades of black and grey, so that parts of the images with primary colors (red, yellow and blue) stand out in contrast. In this way, red is often used, because this reminds the people of blood. The colors of this movie have a fakish look. This way, the viewer gets the impression that they watch a coloured-in black and white movie. This sequence is called neo-Gothic, and in my opinion fits well with the story and the rest of the movie, wherein mainly darker colors are used which corresponds with the dark murder theme.Although this is a pretty rad movie, sometimes scenes can get a bit too slow for our taste. This made us lose track of the story a bit, halfway through, and as a result we had to rewind some parts, to understand them. I have given this movie some thought and can conclude that the directors and producers made an excellent decision regarding the choosing of the actors starring this movie. Morgan Freeman is perfectly able to capture dramatic moments, making the viewers feel sympathy for the actor, and thus making them follow the story better. Likewise we think Brad Pitt is well chosen too, because he is highly experienced with action and shooting scenes. Furthermore, the storyline isn't as linear as one would expect from a crime thriller. On the one hand it's a straightforward murder mystery, but on the other hand there are loads of plot twists to make the movie more interesting and challenging to understand.We think it's a highly interesting movie. We would definitely recommend this movie, because it is an highly enjoyable and interesting story, and the way they made use of the different kinds of filming editing gives this story even more tension when needed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A Dark and Gripping Thriller That Will Leave You Breathless!,"""Se7en"" is an absolute masterpiece! This dark and gripping thriller will have you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The performances by Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are outstanding, bringing depth and intensity to their characters.

The plot is brilliantly crafted, with each of the seven deadly sins playing a crucial role in the killer's twisted game.

"My favorite ""horror/suspense/thriller"" film",I was taken by the way this film used the viewer's imagination to conjure up the most horrifying images of this story without graphically displaying them on screen.  I was gripped by the suspense surrounding horrifying questions of what? and more fightening still why? Mostly I was shocked and surprised and appalled as I learned the answers and found myself agreeing with the twisted logic of the grotesque madman behind the acts.

Great crime thriller,"The seven deadly sins are used as a motive for a serial killer being tracked down by detectives Somerset(Morgan Freeman) and Mills(Brad Pitt).The first victim killed is an obese man who represents gluttony.

A beautiful model whose face has been slashed dies, pride is her great sin and all of the Catholic big seven are covered by the end of this very well written and thoughtful analysis of a sick mind.Freeman and Pitt make a great pair, and Kevin Spacey is creepy as John Doe, the suspect.

Favorite Movie,"David Fincher's Se7en, This movie is unmatched in my personal opinion. It grabs you from beginning to end. I appreciate movies that can have you doing research almost in a scholarly manner. Morgan Freeman is an underrated actor and should be on everyone's top list. There is never a dull moment in Se7en. Impeccable, breathtakingly good, chilling and very well acted. The film has one of the most interesting and gripping crime stories ever told, but the director's take on the different types of crime and criminals is eye-opening. The real reason why John Doe is a very good villain is because we are not shown any trauma in his life that shaped his character. He's a genuine psychopath who looked at the world around him and didn't see himself in it- he noticed the apathy that surrounds us and decided to go on a morbid crusade to convey a divine message.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Left me disturbed,"I watched Se7en 29 years after its release. I really like crime-thriller movies and many people recommended this movie, so I had expectations, but I can honestly say that it met all my expectations. It was a completely new crime-thriller experience for me. The film breaks the unwritten rules of storytelling in many places, and that's exactly what makes it so good. The environment and atmosphere that can be seen and felt in the film completely creates a sense of horror in the viewer. After the movie ended, I sat in my room for several minutes, staring at the TV screen, and I couldn't believe how the story ended.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

7 is not the lucky number for some people,"You have probably never seen a particularly ugly murder until you see ""Se7en"". Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman play Det. David Mills and Det.

Deadly Sins,"David Fincher directed this dark mystery that stars Brad Pitt as detective Mills, who joins more experienced detective Somerset(played by Morgan Freeman) in their murder investigation that seems quite bizarre, as the victims were killed via the judgment of the seven deadly sins(gluttony, sloth, etc.) The killer is quite clever and patient, though the detectives do eventually track him down, and after his arrest, learn that he has one more victim in mind to complete his master-plan, and that it involves Mills' wife(played by Gwyneth Paltrow)...

Se7en Review,Now I have seen this movie over 100 times and I have never gotten tired of it. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman play the role of their lives in this movie. David Fincher's ability to make a gritty police film such as this is amazing. Brad Pitt plays a rookie detective called David Mills. He is assigned a job with William Somerset(Morgan Freeman). Here they go through a series of killings by a person known only as John Doe who uses the 7 deadly sins as his MO. After watching this film over 100 times shows that great films like this are dying. Se7en shows that a great film can leave a footprint on cinema history. This is why i am giving Se7en 9 out of 10,9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

"Woah, that hit me hard, OUTSTANDING","I just watched Se7en, which stars Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt and Kevin Spacey and I was gob smacked at how well crafted the storyline and ending are. Somerset (Freeman) and Mills (Pitt) are searching for a man only known as 'John Doe,' he is killing and preaching at the same time by killing people based on the Seven Deadly sins, Sloth, Gluttony, Envy, Greed, Lust, Wrath and Pride as his motive. Somerset takes this case as his last one before he calls it the quits and Mills is a new detective, who doesn't usually listen to the much more experienced Somerset. The story unfolds with the detectives trying to track this killer after he is toying with the police leaving no fingerprints and hardly any clues of any kind. I won't tell anymore but there's not many dull moments and the ending is like no other I've ever seen. From the director of Fight Club another great storyline and twist at the end, even though Fight Club is exceedingly more violent than Se7en, they are both made the same way and both have such great acting and story lines, that this movie cannot be passed over. Very Highly recommended and I would give it 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Lavishly disturbing,"Watched in film studies; loved the plot, liked the characters apart from the barely there wife. I mean, come on, they gave everyone else a personality... Morgan freeman was absolutely wonderful, and this film makes his current typecasting painful; with the depth and range of his performance. Brad Pitt did a good, but not remarkable job as well. The villain, John Doe, of course stole the show; and every single death was an exhibitionist delight to watch, gripping the part of you that likes to be disturbed by the throat, refusing to let go. The visuals were lavishly disturbing and the soundtrack worked wonderfully - however, the last death(s) was bloody obvious, and this was hell to watch for someone who thinks of herself as squeamish. I managed to man up and watch every death scene apart from the last one; in which the film turned into a radio programme instead and I was intensely fascinated with the minutiae of the floor.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

An Epic on Crime & Detection,"Se7ven is a classical movie on crime and detection. The film moves around two detectives; one seasoned and one novice. They are on a mutual assignment to investigate and arrest a heinous serial killer involved in torturing and murdering people. The story is excellently written by Andrew Kevin Walker; depicts great home work on plot, might involve review after review by him before finalization, in depth psyche of all characters and order of happening of events in an ascending order of gravity. The psyche of the killer was greatly conceived. There are a number of films on torturing and serial killing but it was a unique idea that what paradoxical impact one can perceive from great writings of Dante! It's a genuine thinking of writer and super cinematography by the director. Acting of Morgan Freeman is splendid. He has the god given talent of absorbing into characters created for him. His dressing however resembles to ""Columbo"" somehow. Brad Pitt was great except in last scene when he was double minded; his hesitance was understandable but acing was not that great as it was in whole film. Viewers' interest, suspense and mystery of the film lasts until the last scene as nobody was suspecting what actually happened; again full marks to writer and director. This movie is up to the level of Psycho by Alfred Hitchcock and we have David Fincher; an Alfred Hitchcock in pipeline. This is the movie of the Director David Fincher. He is the captain of the ship and knows how to set sail, where to speed up, where to show emotions..... all is excellent. The choices of sets and locations are great. The direction is simply magnificent. Special effects and Sound is impressive. The music by Howard Shore is inspiring, striking and exciting.

But it is also a Hollywood thriller, with big stars, and on that level it's just as affecting and successful. It's almost like a crossover film by having this mystery-investigation side of the story, led by Putt and Freeman, while the investigation itself making it pretty clear its no-holds-barred moments. Fincher's work as a director here is absolute in making style serve the story.It does this and more by making grissly images of cruelness and dark vibes that would make Nosferatu cringe (slightly).

So many pieces, in such an intricate puzzle, that all come together to form a multi-faceted, and beautiful film.The acting is well-done. While not amazing, I'd have to say each one of the characters were perfectly formed, and played off of each other in exact harmony.The storyline itself is somewhat classic in its cop-thriller genre.

"Successful for genre, but then again...","My approach to Seven was one of low expectations.  Based on the stylistic opening credits, I was expecting to be assaulted with low-angle extreme closeup murky cinematography designed to capitalize on human reflex. American film has been thwarted with bad technique in the suspense/mystery genre.  Instead of style and creativity, many directors have opted for the ole standby of loud unexpected noises/music followed by the alerting appearance of the villain.  Snore...However, such is not the case with David Fincher's Seven.  The style of Seven is fairly straightforward for the first seventy minutes of the film:  What you see is what you get. Unapologetically grotesque images from the crime scenes of a serial murder and a flood of rain in a dingy, dirty-textured metropolitan city.  The plot is nothing we haven't seen before, but it was plenty enough to keep you interested in learning about the murderer.  However, the main characters could not have been more contrived.  Morgan Freeman's character, Detective Summerset, was catatonic to the point of being convincingly dull.  The writer went for the starkest contrast with the character Detective Mills (Brad Pitt) by giving him the playground mentality of hockey player turned homicide detective.  The results were destructive to the film's effect. In the end, Mills and Summerset do their best to ruin the audience's interest in their involvement.  Gwynneth Paltrow would receive mention if her character weren't a mere fixture within a plot.  The characters just didn't help this film at all.  It was one of those all too often cases where the actors look the part but the part is badly written =(  However, much to the credit of the production designer and cinematographer, the mood of this film was still very effective.  There was however one other regrettable inconsistency:  For the first seventy minutes or so of the film, the audience forcably endures the foul, wet and lonely darkness of the city environment only to have the rug pulled out in the closing moments when the setting changes to a sun-bleached desert scape.

Mediocre slash-movie with pretensions,"Se7en confirms my first rule of movies: If the movie is bad, chose stupid typography in the title or the opening credits to confuse the audience.This movie is replete with plot holes and the preaching about a break down of moralities is heavy handed and distracting.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
The film that nearly made me give up writing in awe at its brilliance!!!!,"This film is pure genius, it nearly made me give up writing altogether.

A Different Story,"It is seldom that a movie with such an eerie mood can continue with a continuously building story line and characters who are so dynamic. Modernism and beliefs lie at the heart of the movie, and Se7en does an exceptional job in executing a great plot with even better acting.Most actors would not be capable of filling the roles of two detectives in such a morbid case. The stars Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt act wonderfully in their respective roles, and manage to remain in character and evolve throughout the film. Being initially introduced to the two men, both at different stages of life, viewers begin this exhausting journey which neither characters are prepared for.With superb performances, underlying themes and a carefully manipulated script, Se7en truly does succeed in encompassing the qualities every great movie should. The numerous connections to religious and social affiliations offer a different view of the world, and share the side of things most do not see. Although the acts displayed are corrupt, which is a purely subjective topic, insights into the mind of a killer offer this movie a trait most lack - perspective.The brilliantly written script, including fabrications many people would never even contemplate, puts Se7en on a new pedestal. This thought-provoking thriller is one for the ages, and is one that I highly recommend.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Excellent cast and was hooked from the minute i started watching it. The story gets me every time, which allows me to re watch again and again, thats rare with a film.

Best cinematic murder mystery of all time,"Se7en tells the harrowing story of 2 detectives trying to find a brutal serial killer who bases his horrific killings on the seven deadly sins. Se7en is, in my mind, the best detective movie ever made and here's why. This is one twisted, messed-up and depressing movie, but it's not unwatchable. It's actually hugely entertaining, it's got two amazing set-pieces and it's a compelling, unpredictable story. Many other movies which feature such a terrifying antagonist are often really hard to watch, but here the film works as a blockbuster still. David Fincher's direction is flawless, the cinematography is amazing and the city in which the film takes place is a truly disturbing environment. Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey are outstanding (Even Gwyneth Paltrow is quite good here) and their characters feel like humans, not just like actors. This is first and foremost a study of evil, but it doesn't shove its themes down our throats. This explores its nihilistic concepts with art and subtlety, so that the relentlessly harrowing subject matter doesn't get in the way of characters and action. Best of all, this has one of the greatest movie endings in the history of cinema, and for that alone it's worth watching. A truly great movie, which holds up very well on a re-watch, and is one of my favourite films of the 90s.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

One of the best thrillers of all time with a shocking ending that will smack you in the face.,"Se7en (also known as Seven) is one of the best thrillers that everyone still talks about. It's certainly not a clich√©d movie nor does it use a recycled plot. It is well written with an original plot and the cast is brilliant. The entire movie is suspenseful and dark with its shock value added to keep audiences engaged. Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow, R. Lee Ermey, John C. McGinley and Kevin Spacey are excellent.Set in an unnamed city which rains for most of the movie, Se7en is about a serial killer who's M.O. is based around the seven deadly sins. The seven deadly sins are Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Envy, Wrath, Pride and Lust. Morgan Freeman is Detective Lieutenant William Somerset, a worn out homicide detective on the verge on retirement. Somerset is partnered with newly transferred Detective David Mills played by Brad Pitt, an idealistic yet brash and hot headed police detective. Somerset and Mills are tasked with the investigation as the gruesome murders pile up one at a time. The serial killer who calls himself John Doe, played by Kevin Spacey, leaves inconspicuous clues on the next victim as well as his identity. Meanwhile David Mills' wife Tracy is unhappy with the move to the city and confides to Somerset that she is miserable here. Somerset and Mills must race against time to find John Doe as well as any further victims.Brad Pitt shows that he is a versatile actor and not just a pretty face as the brash Detective David Mills. Morgan Freeman is tailor made as the world weary Detective Lieutenant William Somerset who wants to solve this case before his retirement. Gwyneth Paltrow makes her mark as David's wife Tracy, who reluctantly agrees to transfer to the city with her husband. Kevin Spacey is chilling as the calculating John Doe. Kevin Spacey's John Doe earns a spot as one of the best villains of all time. R. Lee Ermey, famous for his role as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman in Full Metal Jacket, does a good job as the unnamed Police Captain. John C. McGinley also does a good job as the hard charging SWAT Team Leader California.Se7en is notable for putting director David Fincher on the map, making critics and audiences stand up and take notice that he is a force to be reckoned with. After his disastrous debut with Alien 3 (1992), David Fincher does a brilliant job with Se7en. David Fincher would later go on and direct further movies that would cement his reputation as a brilliant director with movies such as The Game (1997), Fight Club (1999), Panic Room (2002), Zodiac (2007), The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008), The Social Network (2010), The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011), and Gone Girl (2014). David Fincher, along with writer Andrew Kevin Walker and cinematographer Darius Khondji should be commended on a job well done for bringing to the screen a dark, gratuitous and grim thriller. The entire movie does not let up for one moment, and the shocking ending just smacks you in the face. The best part is that the ending is unexpected and NOBODY could tell you that they saw it coming. If anyone says that they could see it coming, they are full of it. The shocking ending in Se7en is one that will stay with you for days, and it certainly did when I first saw it many years ago.Although Se7en is a grisly and gory movie that is certainly not for the faint hearted, it rightfully earns its spot as one of the best thrillers of all time, and definitely one of the most popular movies of the 1990's.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
You can watch this movie 100 times and still appreciate every detail that Fincher presents you.,"Se7en(1995) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on Hulu. The storyline follows two detectives in New York, a young man who recently transferred to the city and an aging detective about to retire. They are partnered and sent to investigate a strange murder and quickly discover a quote that turns into a theme when the murder resembles a passage from the seven deadly sins. As the murders continue they become more heinous and the detectives get closer and closer to the killer.This movie is directed by David Fincher (Gone Girl) and stars Morgan Freeman (Million Dollar Baby), Brad Pitt (Fight Club), Kevin Spacey (Usual Suspects), Gwyneth Paltrow (Iron Man), R. Lee Ermey (Full Metal Jacket) and Richard Roundtree (Shaft).This storyline is magnificently intricate. Every aspect of this movie is well written - the characters and their backstories, details of the crime scenes, the thought process of the killer, the pace they unveil details about the killer and the nuances of being a New York Detective. Everything is outstanding. The music in the background throughout the film keeps a level of intensity from beginning to end. Even when things get lighthearted you know it's destined to be short lived. There are two scenes in this that belong in the American cinematic hall of fame - the dinner scene between Paltrow and Freeman and the final ""What's in the box"" moment.

Milestone in serial killers films,"Maybe more for me than SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. And I am not at all a fan of serial killers topics. I loved ZODIAC and recently loved THE EXECUTION from Russia.

"One of the scariest, nastiest thrillers ever filmed - makes The Silence of the Lambs look like a children's movie!","1991: Jonathan Demme's The Silence of the Lambs shocks the world, gets almost unanimous praise from critics and audiences alike, and wins five Oscars, proving serial killer flicks can be more than just a sub-category of the thriller/horror genre. 1995: David Fincher, still scarred by the mixed reactions to his first film, the underrated Alien 3, unleashes Se7en. The latter wins no Academy Awards, but people are so impressed/disgusted/terrified by the ferocity and bleakness of Fincher's vision it actually manages to make Demme's work seem rather tame. So uncompromising it is occasionally hard to watch, Se7en paints a disturbing portrait of madness no other film has been able to match.Ironically, none of the gruesome murders in the film occur on screen: what we are shown is merely the aftermath, which is more than enough to upset the weak of stomach. It sure as hell upsets William Somerset (Morgan Freeman), a police officer who is about to retire but has to solve this last, horrific case. Helping him with the investigation is the edgy David Mills (Brad Pitt), a young hothead who wants to put the killer behind bars and make sure he suffers as much as the victims (the killings are based on the seven capital sins). Unfortunately for them, this guy is not someone you catch that easily: John Doe (a name usually given to unidentified corpses) is a cold-blooded, calculating psychopath, and once he unveils his big project, nothing but pain can derive from it.What distances Se7en from most Hollywood thrillers is the consistently dark, nerve-cracking mood: while the average shocker has some kind of redeeming trait in the end, Fincher decides to go all the way with his unflinching study of the human psyche, leaving no room for hope or salvation. As repulsive as they may look, Doe's murders are actually little more than the premise: the really bad stuff happens after-wards, and even the most skeptical viewers will probably gasp in horror as the film reaches its almost unbearably bleak conclusion (the kind of ending late-night pub discussions were created for).The unsettling atmosphere is also due to the performances, Freeman's understated sadness being the ideal counterbalance to Pitt's brooding rage (a side the actor took to sublime levels in his other collaboration with Fincher, the splendid Fight Club). But it is Kevin Spacey (there's no use in not mentioning him, since by now everyone knows he is in the movie before they have even seen it) who truly leaves a mark, in the role that, alongside his Oscar-winning turn in The Usual Suspects, set the bar for every other villain to have been created since. He may not be on screen for much time, but then again, neither was Anthony Hopkins when he played Hannibal Lecter for the first time. The difference is, John Doe is so merciless and sadistic even Lecter would probably be afraid of running into him.In the end, some people might not be able to watch this film; some might even refuse after reading a summary. But those able to stomach it will see not only a very cruel thriller, but also a compelling example of everything that's generally missing in Hollywood nowadays: film-making has seldom been so bold and fearless.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Nothing new,"Seven has become a huge public success all over the world. That I can understand. What I find more surprising is that it also got well received by the critics. Most praised it as well made, exciting and original thriller. Some even thought it was a masterpiece. But in my opinion, Seven doesn't provide the genre of police thriller noting new than dim lighting and copious amount of rain.Because Seven has much more in common with other films in this genre than most people realized. A couple of clich√©s are that there's a team of two cops who investigates the case consists of an old black man who is tired of his job and look forward to his retirement. The other one is his opposite; a young white man who wants up.The murders that Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and Mills (Brad Pitt) are investigating has been done with the seven deadly sins as source of inspiration. The killer also leaves short literature quotes. Mainly Dante, something that makes  Somerset (of course the intellectual of the two cops) take Mills (who only seems to read Guns and Ammo) to the library.Director David Fincher - whose only feature film before this was Alien 3, but loads of music videos behind - reasoned ""I don't feel at home in libraries either... What music should I pick? It has to be something cultural. At least we take something that everybody recognizes - Air by Bach.Seven doesn't have any other intentions than being the two hour thriller with some disgusting corpses, an odd police couple and a crazy killer it actually is. Then it should be regarded as such and nothing more.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Strongly intense and unnerving,"There aren't many films that can play with your nerves and mind, but when one comes around, it is an absolute twisted delight!Se7en is one of the most tense, disturbing crime/drama psychological thrillers I've had the pleasure of watching in quite some time. Only two other films have been able to garner these types of reactions from me, those two being Martin Scorsese's The Departed and David Fincher's Zodiac. Both films evoked different reactions for different reasons, but they both instilled the same emotion. Interestingly enough, David Fincher also directed this masterpiece.Fincher is in top form here. The writing is fantastic. The story is well written and meticulously thought out. The storytelling is just as intelligently put together. The cast is amazing. Both Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman both give phenomenal performances, and Gwyneth Paltrow gives an equally fantastic performance in her small supporting role. But no movie is complete without a well written antagonist and Kevin Space as John Doe was amazing! He was disturbing, intelligent, and precise in his crimes. John Doe is without a doubt the stuff of nightmares.I genuinely do not know how I didn't give this film a ten the first time I saw it, but I'm there now. I am very pleased to have revisited this film.Amazing characters, fantastic writing, superb storytelling, and a musical score (thanks to the amazing Howard Shore) that amplifies everything happening on screen but also ramps up the gut wrenching feelings makes Se7en a cinematic masterpiece.IMDb: 10/10

Almost a masterpiece,"I just rewatched Seven for the first time in probably about ten years. Everything's been said by now, but I had to lower the score from a 9 to an 8 for two reasons. One, although I usually like Pitt in his roles, the younger version of him here- he's not really a good actor yet, except for the final ten minutes. He was bumbling, unrealistically cocky at times, and it was hard to decipher some of his words. Juxtaposed to the outstanding acting of Freeman, it quite a bit feels like he drags some scenes down, at least until the end. Second, while I really enjoy how the script and movie overall deals with literature, sins, and philosophy, it doesn't quite dig deep enough to make a lasting mark on th viewer's insight; much like their library research, it feels more like a 101 class or cliffnotes. Now, at least they do scratch the surface, and there are two to three great conversations that go under the surface a little more, but despite these scenes the overall ending of the film makes it just equate to pessimism, which is not entirely true to life. While you empathize with Somerset's perspective, the fact is the vast majority of people are mostly good.In Conclusion, Seven deserves lots of credit for its originality (at the time), uniqueness, cinematography, more profound material for the typical entry into the genre in terms of philosophical debate and historical literature, as well as an awesome performance by Freeman, but ultimately it just misses becoming a true masterpiece for the same reason it became so popular: metaphorically hitting the audience with an emotional sledgehammer (as Spacey's character philosophizes) with an abrupt, pessimistic ending (good final scene quoting Hemingway, by the way) without quite delving deep enough into the surface-scratching literature leaves the viewer without much takeaway despite it, other than the fact it was a good, entertaining thriller movie. This disqualifies it from being a masterpiece and its current #19 ranking on here is surprising. It feels more like a #50-80 area range film, not a top 20 all-time, but still a classic.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

"After 10 years, the story still seems fresh. Best thriller ever.","Se7en is an amazing thriller that still seems fresh even after ten years. The story revolves around two cops played by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt, one of whom is ready to retire and the other is just starting. Freeman and Pitt work great together and I was pleased to see Brad in a movie where he isn't some charming bad boy like in most of his movies. It's a nice change and I'd like to see him do more characters like that. Freeman of course does a spectacular job as well, but that goes without saying. Although the new cop/old cop pairing has been done jillions of times before, somehow Freeman and Pitt manage to make their characters different and captivating. The two, after a rough start, become friends and a good subplot involving Gwyneth Paltrow as Pitt's wife, emerges that is a nice respite from the grittier main story, which of course later ties in with the main plot later, as in every respectable movie.Of course, the real focus of the movie is not about our protagonists. A serial killer (Kevin Spacey) has started a killing spree and chooses his victims based on the Seven Deadly Sins, which are Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Lust, Pride, Envy, and Wrath. He chooses very creative fates in which he fights fire with fire so to speak as he turns their Sins against them. This is where the movie gets very graphic. The ""Sinner's"" fates are both cruel and unusual. If you're sqeamish, stay away, but it really isn't too bad compared to other movies. You never actually see the murders take place, just the corpses and aftermath. (Which is bad enough) This provides a nice balance that helps you focus on the detectives and their search for the elusive culprit behind all this as opposed to the story just being an excuse to show you grisly murders like the Saw series. Most of the movie revolves around the cops finding the various victims and trying to make sense of the antagonist's tantalizing hints and clues. The villain is very mysterious, and is definitely an interesting head case. He remains an enigma right up to the end, but luckily you do get to see how his mind works near the end. Spacey does a spectacular job portraying this mysterious figure when he's on screen, but sadly he's only really in it during the final part of the movie. But this isn't really a complaint. It's an interesting step out of the norm to not fill the screen time with the villain calling the heroes every five minutes to let him know that he hates them and they'll never prevail against his evil plan. The entire movie has a very dark and gloomy feel to it. Just about every inside scene is dark and outside it's usually always raining or cloudy.Se7en is a great thriller that should appeal to everyone except for those who think that all movies should be fairy tales and should end perfectly. The plot runs along at a good pace and has one of the greatest (not happiest) surprise endings I've ever seen. I never saw it coming even as it was happening. Perhaps what I like the most about Se7en is that it is not just a gore fest. It has a feel of intelligence and even makes statements about the evils in our society and our tolerance of them. Pretty daring for a thriller. With it's dark mood, creative characters, and spectacular plot, Se7en comes highly recommended. A 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

When one watches a bad movie, one seldom goes ""Now that could have been good, if only..."" Se7en, like its ridiculous title, is not a bad movie. It is a very bad movie. It could so easily have been a good movie that its total failure is that much more appalling. What began as an exploration of human vice and the criminal justice system soon dissolves into a god-awful mess of unbelievable ""motivations"" and idiotic scripting.

A beautiful way to be deadly,"If you want to get obsessed about the seven deadly sins this is the movie you've been waiting for.

As you can imagine, seven deadly sins brings seven deaths and that's just about the amount of victims in this movie. Brought to the eyes of the viewers perfectly till the end.The movie starts with gluttony, and then greed, sloth. lust, pride, envy, wrath comes to follow quickly as the films pace increases to the end.

Disturbing Ending,"I'm very fond of David Fincher's movies (favorite: Fight Club),and finally had a chance to see ""Se7en"". It had all the Fincher elements I like , the tone of color, the density.... The plot is generally fine, but the ending was just too much for me. It left me really sick. I know the ending is where the climax is supposed to be, and it did strike me hard, but I just can't have a nice feeling for this movie.Usually I'm not very much disturbed by shocking endings(survived Hannibal!), so I don't really know why this particular movie made me feel bad. Anyway, you are warned.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Overrated, but still well-made","An impressive achievement about itself. I have sympathy for Seven naysayers in that the movie nihilism feels very arrested development and Walker script is a serviceble one blowup for too lofty ambitions (by him and Fincher), but there's no deny conviction and Fincher really put a lot of effort into his urban hell (Taxi Driver made by people who saw it at the right impressionable age) and Freeman sells the grim determinism for all its worth. It is an overlabored movie that very much needs all the heavy hand to make its effect convincing. It also has a lot of good old fashioned craft to sustain itself. It is predicted in the opposition between the cops investigative grunt work (which intentionally goes nowhere) and Spacey's grand design (which as smarter people than me have point out Fincher keeps equating with his own). The Hollywood machinery parts work very well starting with Freeman/Pitt stock pairing, a great collection of faces filling the background and Fincher and his main collaborators (Khondji, Francis-Bruce, Shore, the Max/Wissner/Griffith trio) do put together some impressive big scenes around the investigative work. I remember seeing Seven with my dad during the original release and the ending was the greatest thing ever, but now I think the movie mostly loses me after Spacey big theatrical entrance, part is his very mannered performance meeting Walker script going into overdrive, part is feeling the strings too much, anyone who reads me knows I don't care about plausible logic, but the extense that the movie effect depends on equating Spacey to God/Fincher means the flimsiness of the whole thing does feels wrong, far too reverse engineered to make the payoff really work. Still, there's some one hour of great stuff delivered by some very skilled people doing top tier work and it was very important for me once upon a time, but I can't deny it works better now as occasional 20 minutes chunks on cable.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

His bloated, decaying corpse has been there for awhile, with roaches and other vermin crawling all over the place. If this grosses you out, don't expect things to get much better, for this flick is nothing if not a first class gross-out. While there are a few elements of some interest, such as the sequence where annoying and mouthy Detective Mills (Pitt) attempts to run down the serial killer, or veteran actor Morgan Freeman's downbeat interpretation of the jaded detective, the movie is otherwise sadly lacking in redeeming value.

"A huge thriller, although visually disturbing to the faint hearted.","In this film, two detectives have to work together in order to catch a psychopathic killer obsessed with the Seven Sins. Directed by David Fincher, with a script by Andrew Kevin Walker, this film has Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt as protagonists.This film approaches, several times, the grotesque. Its far from appealing to everyone but it will, almost certainly, please any fan of thrillers or police movies. The killer is a madman who seems obsessed with a naturally awkward topic: the Seven Deadly Sins, well known to anyone who has attended Sunday School. The film never speaks openly of religion, but we deduce that this crazy killer is probably Christian, which may displease the practitioners of that faith and even Catholics. In fact, religious fanaticism is quite implicit in the history, and the scenery. Like it or not, its an excellent idea for a movie and gave rise to a great plot, capable of holding the public until the end, despite several disgusting scenes, able to make any popcorn-eater throw in the bag. Yes, this is an alert for the teenagers and the faint hearted: this film is, indeed, visually shocking.The way the main characters were developed is very reasonable. They are two detectives, very different personally and professionally, almost the antithesis of each other until they need to form a true partnership. Brad Pitt gives life to a young cop, active, impulsive, passionate, naturally clashing against the thoughtful and prudent manners of the character played by Morgan Freeman, who only want to do the job well done and go home at the end of the day... until he understands (and he does it quickly) that this killer will not stop easily and is different from anything they thought before. The work of the actors is good, especially Freeman, who incorporate his character easily. Pitt also shone, but his character it's hard to like up to half of the film.The film is exceptionally heavy. The picture is dark, most of the scenes takes place in low light or at night (the most notable exception is the police station, plenty of bright and light colors). The crime scenes are usually dark and have black elements (in one of them is the furniture, for example). There are religious elements evident throughout the film also. The soundtrack is interesting, contributing decisively to densify the tension with the constant repetition of high and long chords.In short, this movie is deep, psychologically challenging, shocking and promises to leave no one indifferent. A great story of suspense, from start to finish.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Disappointing ending, but still good","I saw it just now because some people were accusing The Batman (that I loved) of copying it.

The end was a bit sloth since it was hardly the detective work that took them to the end of the mystery. Not withstanding, there is a certain doubt at the end of the movie about what truly happened and what will be the future.Despite this, until the last 40 minutes, the movie has great dialogue, action, mystery, character development and ambience. It makes you wonder every turn what will happen next.Another bad side is that there are very few characters, thus very few suspects.

This movie is horrible!,"What can I say.  The movie was soooo dark,  so depressing that I just wanted to turn it off and throw it in the trash.  Thank goodness I only rented this.  I continuously wanted for something good,  something exciting and It was just words and a picture of a dead man with police wandering around.  The movie was sooo bad that it made my other rental film Urban Legend look like an exciting horror classic---and that was only an OK film. Seven is a horrible experience,   little gore,   little action,  mild absurdities,   basically a very gloomy unentertaining tone.  Even Gweneth Paltrow was stupid and frankly had--no interesting lines and they didn't even show the way she looked at the end--so upsetting.  Just like the Baby with Rosemary's baby,   the director denied a crucial element,  it is just that unlike Rosemary's Baby,  I didn't care an inch about the way Seven looked at that point. Thrillers like Fatal Attraction,  The Hand That Rocks the Cradle,  and The Tie That Binds are movies that at least have an entertaining and lighter deranged glow.  Seven is just dark,  boring,  and so uninvolving.  The actors good but the story stunk.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Two homicide detectives must track down a serial killer who uses the ""Seven Deadly Sins"" as his guideline for his killings","Detective William Somerset's years as a homicide detective have come down to their last seven days. He has closed many a case, and we meet him as he encounters his last Young Detective David Mills has just transferred to the local police force as Somerset's replacement, and he shooting from his hip as soon as he walks into the first crime scene. Local police have found an extremely obese man dead in his house, and after a few minutes of investigating, the initially believed cause of death, brain hemorrhage, is soon replaced with murder. The two detectives conclude that the victim was forced to eat by his killer, and then kicked in the stomach. This is but our first taste (insensitive pun unintended) of the sick world that this story takes place in. Within 24 hours of this, a top-notch attorney is found dead in his office, and the word ""greed"" written into the carpet. On an inquiry of the first victim's apartment, Somerset finds the word ""gluttony"" carved into the wall behind the fridge. It does not take Somerset and Mills to realize that this unknown killer is systematically murdering his victims using the themes of the Seven Deadly Sins, which are: gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, wrath, and envy. With the identity of the killer, and 5 more victims helplessly unaware of what is to come, detectives Mills and Somerset must find their man, and navigate the dark world that surrounds them.If the first murder wasn't an obvious clue, this is a dark movie. The ""gluttony"" victim, and all of the other victims for that matter, is brutally executed, and most of the grisly remains are what we see. Though we do not see the murders themselves, there is little left to the imagination. In this aspect, this luridly-themed film took me to my limit, and perhaps past it. I would like to think that I can handle just about anything that a camera can show, but this film proved me terrifyingly wrong. Putting the murders aside, this film was very well put together. Freeman does a great job of playing the ""old vet"" archetype, and Brad Pitt as the young rookie is a well-cast role. Kevin Spacey as our ""John Doe"" makes the antagonist utterly sickening, which is exactly what director David Fincher wanted. From a cinematography standpoint, the film was well-shot, and the editing (Oscar-nominated) was very well done. I will leave you with a few key points that I feel I must emphasize. As a devout Christian, I found the killer's system very appalling, and I dearly hope that the public does not associate this with any Christian value. In case you did not pick this up in my previous notes, this film is DARK. I myself had to watch through my fingers at times, and I have no doubt that any future viewer will as well. The language in itself is R-rated, and it just adds to the dreariness. In his review of this film, the late film critic Roger Ebert began by saying "" 'Seven,' a dark, grisly, horrifying and intelligent thriller, may be too disturbing for many people, I imagine, although if you can bear to watch, it you will see film-making of a high order.""The thrills did thrill, and the horrors did horrify, but I found it too far exposed.

Dark thriller,"Seven is by now more or less a modern classic. The movie is so dark that I almost felt depressed when I left the cinema.

Good acting, good story, great camerawork. Bottom line; If you are looking for suspense you will get it here. You might even get a depression, but that's for free.One of David Fincher's (director) best films. Fincher is very talented but probably also very depressed considering the movies he has made.

Se7en,"Se7en (David Fincher, 1995)Here's a movie I last saw about 15 years ago, yet my memories of it are vivid and intense. Watching it again this weekend brought all that back. Morgan Freeman is great as the retiring detective who contrasts Brad Pitt's character excellently. Se7en starts off as this sort of typical police procedural that would not be out of place in a Law and Order episode, but it sure as hell doesn't stay that way. Gwyneth Paltrow's character is given little depth, which may be a flaw but I haven't decided yet. The various fates of the victims are psychologically terrifying.

Cinematic mastery: Finchers knows HOW to tell stories visually. This is made by a master.,"I was, like many, initially hooked. This is for sure a movie one HAS to see fullscreen in cinema or at least a PRETTY good beamer. Why? Because in this one, the cinematography is SO intense and subtle, follows the actors just RIGHT and pre-dicts certain actions - one has to appreciate this power on a large canvas.
And this is also what I personally loved about this film the most. The overall powerful camera movements and the pace that these create. Slow, fast, bodyless or shaky. Virtuously used. Also, the always high contrast between light and shadow create this intense atmosphere.Usually I am everything but NOT into criminal stories because they seem so predictable, but the way the story was TOLD really got to me. (not the story itself necessarily). The episode in the library, illustrated with classical music - or the invasion of the murderer's home base with its super-dark and sadistic vibe (the LED cross on the wall...wow wow wow!) or the worn-down flat of the more dead than alive Victor with tons of paper-trees (used for cars and better smell)... these are images that will always stay with me. They really got to my heart.So, again. Fincher is a MASTER in telling stories. Not necessarily great stories themselves, but also the way he TELLS THEM... make them really sublime. After the really intense and complex FIGHTCLUB, this is my second favorite movie made by Fincher. Love, love, love.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Very good,"David Fincher, Se7en is a compelling and brilliant postmodern film noir. It is grim and disturbing but it is also very intelligent and daring. What I did love about Se7en especially is that it is incredibly stylish, beautiful dark cinematography and dazzling landscapes really do add to the atmosphere. Very little of the murders are shown but we are appalled and shocked by what we hear of them, the action is tense and the climax is shattering. There is also an intelligent screenplay, a clever plot telling of a vicious serial killer who murders his victims in a gruesome way to atone for the sins(gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy and wrath)he deems them to have committed and excellent direction. The acting is also superb, Morgan Freeman gives another brilliant performance as the disillusioned detective and Brad Pitt is great as Mills in a more meatier role than he has ever done.

Seven by David Fincher: a journey into the darkness of the human soul,"""Seven"" by David Fincher, released in 1995, is a psychological thriller that stands out for its dark and oppressive atmosphere, tense storytelling, and masterful direction. The film follows the cases of detectives Somerset, played by Morgan Freeman, and Mills, played by Brad Pitt, as they investigate a series of brutal murders inspired by the seven deadly sins. Fincher, known for his distinctive visual style, creates a world where incessant rain and deep shadows reflect the moral decay and despair that permeate the nameless city where the story takes place. Andrew Kevin Walker's screenplay is skillfully constructed, keeping the viewer in a state of constant tension and anticipation, with sharp dialogue that explores complex themes such as corruption, justice, and the nature of evil. One of the greatest strengths of ""Seven"" is its ability to immerse the viewer in a visceral and disturbing experience without resorting to gratuitous gimmicks. The violence, though present, is often more suggested than shown, leaving the audience's imagination to fill in the most horrific details. This approach not only amplifies the horror but also invites deeper reflection on the killer's motivations and the moral implications of his actions. Somerset's character, with his world-weary wisdom and desire to find meaning in an apparently meaningless world, provides an effective counterpoint to Mills' impulsive and idealistic youth. Their interactions not only develop their characters but also serve to explore different perspectives on justice and morality. Darius Khondji's cinematography deserves special mention for how it contributes to the film's atmosphere. The use of dark tones, soft lighting, and claustrophobic framing creates a constant sense of threat and claustrophobia. Every scene is visually rich and meticulously composed, contributing to a sense of sinister beauty that pervades the film. Howard Shore's score is also perfectly calibrated to intensify the tension and sense of unease, with musical themes that underscore moments of greatest emotional impact. However, ""Seven"" is not without its flaws. Some critics might find its unrelentingly dark tone and pessimistic worldview overly oppressive. Additionally, the film requires a certain suspension of disbelief, as some situations and character decisions may seem forced or not entirely credible. Despite these criticisms, it is difficult to deny the effectiveness with which Fincher manipulates pacing and suspense to keep the viewer constantly engaged and fascinated. Kevin Spacey's performance, whose character is not revealed until the final stages of the film, is stunningly effective. His portrayal of the killer John Doe is both unsettling and magnetic, offering a vision of evil that is all the more frightening for its calm rationality. Spacey manages to convey a psychological complexity that makes his character unforgettable, contributing to one of the most shocking and discussed endings in cinema history.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Reflection on evil,"David Fincher's film is not only one of the best crime stories ever broadcast, but also a story that delves deeply into the nature of good and evil.Before getting into the story, I must say that for those who have a sensitivity towards aesthetics, this film will be a landmark. Personally, I was immediately immersed in Somerset's smoke-filled environment, the gothic aesthetic, and all the objects revolving around the film: the notebooks, the pens, the style, the pamphlets, and so on.Regarding the story, Seven, in my view, is a reflection on evil and how it is intertwined with society. Initially, it seems that evil is something entirely detached from good and justice, but in the end, the latter unfolds as a form of rage. Many people devote their lives to prosecuting evil, only to end up using it to destroy it. Fighting against evil requires a complete rejection of anything that bears even a resemblance to it.Seven is not only a gripping crime story, but also a profound reflection on evil in all its forms, wrapped in an engrossing aesthetic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Holy Hell.,"Se7en is a morbid, unrelenting thriller. It doesn't merely stare into the abyss, it jumps in. Two detectives, one rookie and one veteran, come across the worst murders they've ever seen, but such that are intricately designed, they know the killer is trying to prove a point. Freeman's character connects the dots to the Seven Deadly Sins as inspiration for the killings. Once they catch him, they come to find that he's as crazy as you'd expect, but more self-righteous than they would ever believe, and all along, the religious backdrop of these murders were intentional.David Fincher is a master of the macabre and has become a household name for bleak films 23 years later. You can credit him for how deeply appalling the bloody crime scenes unfold for us. The little stories behind them, the production design.. Then we come to Kevin Spacey as the killer. Looking back now, it's a bit rich to see him play a man righteously outraged by a decaying American society and delivering his sick sense of street justice on sinners.

"""An exercise in storytelling, visual style and suspense""","David Fincher's dark, gruesome and intelligent thriller Se7en remains one of my favorite films of the 1990s. It's dark visual tone and use of pathetic fallacy coupled with the harrowing story of a killer attempting to teach humanity a lesson is both disturbing and brilliant. Fincher shows audiences his true capabilities as a director, and Se7en is an exercise in storytelling, visual style, and suspense, making it one of the definitive crime thrillers of the 20th century.The film begins in a miserable and unidentified cityscape, perhaps Los Angeles, or New York. Perhaps it is simply a metaphorical version of all the crime in American urban areas. This city seems ‚Äì for at least the one week the movie takes place in ‚Äì perpetually covered in fog and light rain. We are introduced to Detective Mills (Brad Pitt), a young and impulsive cop who was transferred to the city. He is paired with Detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman), an older, calmer, meticulous veteran to the force with one week left before retirement. The contrasting pair make a nice centrepiece for the havoc which is to be wrecked upon them by an unknown murder.Their first case together is the supposed murder of an obese man, found bound to a chair, he was forced at gunpoint to eat himself to death. His crime was gluttony. There are six more deadly sins, all of which the meticulous, patient, and above all disturbed, serial killer plans to use as his MO. They are: greed, sloth, lust, pride, wrath, and envy. Somerset, who has a keen insight into the mind of the killer, asks to be taken off the case but remains in contact with Mills as he reads through Dante's ""Divine Comedy"", Chaucer's ""Canterbury Tales"", and other prose relating to the seven deadly sins. Together the pair of detectives get closer to the murderer, eventually ending in a climax which is brilliantly scripted by Andrew Kevin Walker.The key to Se7en's success as a crime-thriller is the feel of the movie. Fincher is terrifically talented at bringing to life the most stylish interpretation of the material possible. The sinister atmosphere of the city is only furthered by the grisly murders and the seeming hopelessness of finding the murderer. Even when they find what they think is his apartment they don't discover a single fingerprint. Also vital to the film is the script by Andrew Kevin Walker. He gives Morgan Freeman just enough poetic lines to run with, and the killer presented here is unique. He is intelligent, he writes his thoughts down journal after journal, he is patient, calm, sensible, and he seems to enjoy killing his victims. Interestingly, the murderer is presented with about 30 minutes left of the film, given a speaking role and made an important character, opposed to simply being the unnamed monster behind the killings who is caught at the end. I won't ruin who plays the killer for anyone who hasn't seen the film, just know that it was a smart choice both to cast this actor/actress, but also not to advertise it.Brad Pitt gives a strong performance as Mills, the younger cop who loses his temper more frequently, but still believes he can make a difference. I wouldn't have liked anyone else to play the role, but I could see a handful of other actors also embodying Mills. Somerset, on the other hand, could not logically be played by anyone but Morgan Freeman. Freeman's calm deep voice, and his presence on-screen is unavoidable. His character more questioning of the supposed good nature of humanity, yet still devoted to catching the killer. He is intellectual, he reads Milton and Dante and Chaucer for clues to the murders, and he thinks before he acts, unlike Detective Mills. This difference in character serves as an essential plot point later in the film.David Fincher has become internationally successful as a maker of both highly stylish thrillers (e.g. Fight Club, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) and more sweeping dramatic films like The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and The Social Network. Se7en was Fincher's first real venture into the crime-thriller genre, and it stands as one of his best works. The director is certainly unafraid of being uncompromising and violent, and he shows a strong understanding of visual style and artistic expression. Many shots in this film are incredibly memorable, being just a part of what makes Se7en such an unavoidable film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Great,"Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire. He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M. O. Meanwhile Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed.Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.If you have trouble with blood, gore and disturbing subject matter stay far away from this movie. But if you can handle that, watch this one. It's depressing and unpleasant but riveting.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

This thematic depth adds a layer of intellectual stimulation to the otherwise visceral horror of the crimes depicted.From a technical standpoint, 'Se7en' is a masterclass in filmmaking. The cinematography, characterized by its use of darkness and subdued colors, creates an oppressive atmosphere that complements the film's tone. The editing is tight, maintaining a rhythm that keeps the audience engaged and on edge.

Did the makers of the film think we were too stupid to get it? Why make such a huge effort in delivering tons of subtle well-written conversations only to directly explain it all later on, it feels very unrewarding to be an insightful viewer watching this.

There are too many sequences that seem just stretched and which do nothing for plot or character development.All in all: could've been a decent 90-minute movie, and I've seen many worse but it's definitely not worth more than 5 points.

A dark and gripping thriller that lingers long after the credits roll.,"David Fincher's ""Seven"" is a masterpiece that delves deep into the darkest state of the human psyche, leaving an indelible impression on the viewer even after the credits roll. Released in 1995, it is a landmark in the psychological thriller genre, seamlessly blending elements of crime drama, horror and existential inquiry to create an unforgettable cinematic experience. At its core, ""Seven"" is a haunting meditation on the nature of evil and the pursuit of justice in a world plagued by moral ambiguity. Set in a bleak and rain-soaked urban landscape, the film follows two detectives, seasoned veteran William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and impulsive hotshot David Mills (Brad Pitt), as they investigate a series of gruesome murders inspired by the Seven Deadly Sins. The plot unfolds with precision and increasing tension, as each murder scene becomes a gruesome glimpse into the sins of pride, greed, lust, envy, gluttony, anger, and finally the elusive seventh sin.

Turn up that NIN soundtrack!,"Se7en, directed brilliantly by David Fincher, and written skillfully by Andrew Kevin Walker. is a well executed movie that ranks among the best 90s movies.
To begin with, the cast has done their job masterfully as they make you descend along with the characters into the wild and dark atmosphere of the movie. Needless to mention the Brad Pitt's performance, which offers the viewers a superb performance that pushes the envelop of his own career.
Moreover, the plot is phenomenal! At the face value, it might seem like a typical cat and mouse tale, but as you go along with its phenomenal storyline, things begin to sound odd and that's a sign of realization which tells you things are a bit a different here.

"The Lord works in mysterious ways, and so does Fincher","""He thought he was a prophet, had a message to deliver, so he wrote a book, a book worthy to compete with great names such as Milton, but in today's society no one read books, so he compromised, he went and made the news!""Do you know that Kevin Spacey actually had the producers remove his name from the opening credits?

A disturbing and brilliant film,"Few films genuinely shock me nowadays, but this did. It is horrible yet fascinating, it fulfills the morbid curiosity which is in us all whether we want to admit it or not. There have been other films about serial killers but none as desperate or dark as this masterpiece.It is the unrelenting mental will of Spacey's character that chilled me the most. His utter insanity was matched only by his ingenuity and discipline. His character is one of the most truly evil in film history, forget hannibal lecter !The whole film is brilliantly made, the performances are great, even from Brad Pitt, and the atmosphere is wonderfully set, but there are two particular things which, for me, set this movie apart.The first is the way in which the city setting they are in is every bit as all consuming and intimdating as Spacey's character. People are swallowed up and spat out in this world, no one counts. It reminded me very much of an Alan Moore graphic novel called 'Watchmen' in which a character called Rorschach becomes a vigilante to clean the streets of the 'scum'. Spacey's character is somewhat like this striving to show people the evil that surrounds them. The irony is that his methods are wholely more evil than anything he wishes to illustrate.The second is the ending. Never has there been an ending like it to my knowledge. It is hard to describe how it makes you feel. There is no way he can lose, you feel cheated whilst still appreciating the cleverness of the manufactured situation. It leaves you with nothing exactly reflecting how Brad Pitt's charcter must feel at this moment. The film leaves you bewildered and mentally fatigued.However the perfectly handled ,and completely unique,  ending completes an awesome film.It is very downbeat and critical of humanity, Morgan freeman's character re inforces this in his final line, but there was a place for a film such as this and Se7en filled it.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Compelling performances,"""Seven,"" directed by David Fincher, is a gripping and dark psychological thriller that masterfully weaves a tale of sin, redemption, and the nature of evil. The film stars Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman as two detectives, a rookie and a veteran, respectively, who are tasked with solving a series of grisly murders inspired by the seven deadly sins.The cinematography of ""Seven"" is a standout, employing a gloomy and rain-soaked palette that perfectly encapsulates the film's bleak and foreboding atmosphere. The city, never named, becomes a character in itself, a faceless urban sprawl that mirrors the darkness of the human soul explored in the narrative.Brad Pitt delivers a raw and emotional performance as the impulsive and idealistic Detective Mills. In contrast, Morgan Freeman's portrayal of the seasoned Detective Somerset is imbued with a sense of weary wisdom and resignation. Their chemistry and the evolving dynamic between them form the emotional core of the movie.The screenplay, written by Andrew Kevin Walker, is tight and well-structured, leading the audience through a labyrinth of suspense and moral conundrums. The pacing is deliberate, allowing the tension to build slowly and inexorably towards the film's shocking and unforgettable climax.What sets ""Seven"" apart is its exploration of the darker aspects of human nature. It doesn't shy away from confronting the audience with uncomfortable truths about sin, guilt, and the capacity for evil that resides in everyone. The antagonist, brilliantly played by Kevin Spacey, is not just a mere villain but a chilling embodiment of these themes.In conclusion, ""Seven"" is a cinematic masterpiece that combines intelligent storytelling, compelling performances, and masterful direction.

The film's conclusion, marked by a single line of dialogue, serves as a painful contemplation that remains unaltered upon revisits. The setting sun over a darkened landscape encapsulates the movie's essence, but its impact extends beyond this grim depiction.Viewed as the chilling punchline to a narrative conveying hopelessness, Se7en weaves brief moments of light and levity to heighten the impact of torrential rainstorms and deepen the prevailing conservatism. It portrays a city engulfed in perpetual filth and apathy without delving into the societal conditions that led to such a state. It suggests that its characters are either striving to change the city's outlook or break free from it.The villain deflects blame onto an uncontrollable force, refusing to acknowledge their own apathy. When Tracy expresses concern over the city's public school conditions, Somerset dismisses the possibility of change, suggesting private schools. David Fincher astutely reveals that the characters are complicit in the city's problems, much like John Doe. Amid lurid thrills and unsettling imagery, Fincher skillfully creates an unforgettable shadow, well-timed jump scares, and an atmosphere laden with oppressive chill.

Although the climax was ""gut-wrenching"", as called by few, it was not at all so much worth watching. I came through this movie, after having watched a lot of movies of the genre of crime-mystery-thriller. I think such movies can be made far better, by adding some kind of twists at the ending. The one given in this movie was not essentially a twist; it was just something to add 2 more to the 5 sins to make it Seven. I'm not at all telling that its a bad movie.One can rate it 8/10 but obviously not 8.7. And you know there's quite a lot difference between 8 and 8.7, here at IMDb.

Everything comes at the right time, in a script, brilliantly crafted by Andrew Kevin Walker, who wrote an earlier draft in 1992, with a different ending, unlike the final one that jarred me, and left me open mouthed, haunting me for many nights later, if almost turning me off the movies. Cocky rookie cop, Brad Pitt and a more wise veteran detective (Freeman) work an out of the ordinary case, involving a killer, punishing people right down to the T, based on the seven deadly sins, some quite gruesome and graphic murders shown, led by excessive examples, sloth and gluttony, wrath and envy, the key to the finale of this nuts scenario. The brilliant performance from the very well respected actor playing our John Doe, I didn't recognizing until ten minutes later. You go into Seven, thinking it's just another serial killer movie, you come out, somewhat disturbed, jarred by it's none more shock ending, you'll never see coming, and it's great twenty minute lead up, which for some people who are easily disturbed, should steer away from. Freeman is solid here, where in many familiar start scenarios, here, he's just retiring from the department, when who should walk in, but cocky, arrogant, anger charged Pitt, in one of his best ever performances, where these two great actors were praised, warranted some acting stature. We have light hearted moments, ""meet the family"" scenes that worked well, amidst the mostly heavy and intense material, the John Doe chaser scene is awesome. Seven is flawless, I must say, it's opening theme to the song closer, that plays over haunting credits amongst disturbing and engrossing images, rocks, as does the closing soon, as a duly reminder as the consequences of those victim's sins. Put this is on your final bucket list of movies. Awesome cover poster.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Se7en review,"Se7en almost starts as clich√© whodunit film rookie and veteran cop work together, to find a killer, but Se7en is far from any clich√©. From the first scene it is clear this not going to be clich√© film it is visceral, and dark. But the violence in the movie is never shown and that makes it even more grim because you have to think about it yourself , you can make something up in your own imagination what the actual act of violence is.The two detectives are portrayed by Morgan Freeman playing detective William Somerset and Brad Pitt playing detective David Mills. The two are portraying their characters well and the chemistry between them helps the movie a lot, there are no constant arguments which is really nice.The killer is inspired by the seven deadly sins how to kill and to choose his victim. The killer is excellently portrayed by Kevin Spacey, his performance is almost eery because he plays the killer not as over the top psychopath but as a smart well thought out killer.The cinematography (the way it was shot with camera) fits well with the darkness of the movie itself.All in all, I think Se7en is one of those few perfect movies out there, the acting is great, the story and twist and turns are original, the pace of the movie is very nice, and it is well written. I think is just perfect.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
It's no House of Cards buts Spacey is incredible,"Morgan Freeman & Brad Pitt are obviously just another classic white / black duo of two butting personalities. Once the sexual tension is relieved midway through the film they both realize they are in for a treat emotionally when they encounter a villain that rivals Joe Pesci in Home Alone 2. With no Macauley Caulkin to booby trap a cunning bastard these two are left to play clue until the tragic end of themselves & their faith in Christianity. Yet hold the phone there is still hope, as we have seen in the comeback of Ben Affleck after making the film Gigli, Morgan remains astute even in the faltering of the human soul in villains & heroes because we see him later in life as the head of Wayne enterprises. All in all this movie reiterates that life goes on, unless you have committed suicide or are in fact in purgatory.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
I don't get the hype,"It's a good film I agree but thoroughly disturbing and I have to say, I was disappointed at the end. I had heard there was a twist but this was so predictable and unsatisfying.

What's the fuss?,"So, here we have another one of those ""suspense"" movies...Where is the suspense? Where is the thrill? A film of this genre should have an atmosphere, make you excited, cause you to try to guess what the next move is going to be, and most of all - provide a surprising end. None of those exist in this creation of Hollywood movie industry. If the only way to keep the viewer focused and somewhat interested is by presenting more and more gruesome ways of murder - something is very wrong here. Any R-rated movie from the shelves marked ""Horrow"" in your local video-store can provide such an entertaiment. Yet there are much more expectations from the cast involved in this project. Conclusion: bigger is not always better. This movie is supposed to be ""Silence of the lambs"" times 7, but it is not even close to the brilliant original.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

"Please try to avoid pride, greed, lust, envy, gluttony, wrath, and sloth","Set chiefly in downtown Los Angeles, Se7en infused the city with a gloomy, rainy vibe by eliminating any identifiable landmarks, iin order to retain the city's anonymity. It's an intriguing, appalling, savvy, nasty, unsettling, dark, grisly, horrifying and intelligent thriller with a tantalizing, morbid atmosphere of unease. It's not the identity of the killer that gives it its kick -- it's the way director David Fincher raises mystery to the level of moral provocation. Watching Se7en is like cracking open a safe to find it crawling with eels . The overall style is chic, studied and murky. BTW According to Roman Catholic theology, the seven deadly sins are the seven behaviours or feelings that inspire further sin. They are typically ordered as: pride, greed, lust, envy, gluttony, wrath, and sloth.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Before Saw there was Se7en,"I can't believe it's been 23 years since this movie came out. An absolute classic. Before the Saw franchise there was Se7en. A crime thriller about a self-righteous messianic wannabe that decided to kill (or set up to be killed) seven people who'd committed one of the seven deadly sins.23 years later this movie still holds its own proving that it wasn't just a movie for that era. Set in Metro it could have been any city. The setting was perpetually rainy, dreary, filthy and crime-ridden. It could've been Gotham, Metropolis, Sin City, etc. It was the perfect setting for the crimes that unfolded.The performances were great but no one could outdo the psycho. Considering that there may be some out there that have been under a rock for the last 23 years I don't want to say who the psycho was. But his ability to convey pure smug moralism after having been responsible for multiple deaths was just eerie and even rage-inducing.Se7en is a must see for psychological crime thriller enthusiasts.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Another Fincher's Incredible Classic, One Of The Best Crime Cases In Movie I've Ever Seen","David Fincher's Se7en will forever be one of the great example of building up chemistry between two main characters and this very intense well crafted and really really great mysterious case, kept you locked in and engaged in these characters, a visually disturbing movie, dark color, and great cinematography, intense music, and really the character development between Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman was the best thing in Se7en and i can't think of anything else because the movie was incredible, every aspect, one of the best crime cases in movie i've ever seen, a horror movie in a way with how much terrifying things that happen in this movie, and that ending i must say that i guessed it specifically in my head about 15 minutes before the reveal and it is still crazy and super heart pounding and it was great, i still put Se7en below Fight Club but that means nothing, both movie are 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

A Modern Crime Classic,"I think just about everyone who has seen ALIEN 3 can agree, it's pretty crappy. We should all be thankful that Hollywood had the foresight to realize that it's director David Fincher managed to show considerable talent and saved it from the ultimate train wreck it's long, problematic development meant it should have been. After throwing himself under the bus to complete ALIEN 3, Fincher was given the chance to prove what he was really capable of with SE7EN. The film is a modern classic and most people will agree. I love a good serial killer story, and SE7EN is right up there at the top of the list with the best of them. Thanks to it's gripping story, talented performances, and an ending that will go down as one of the most memorable, SE7EN is an excellent movie well-deserving of the long-term attention it's gotten and the status it helped to build for Fincher. In the film, Detective William Somerset is one week from his retirement and begins training his replacement, the younger and more na√Øve Detective David Mills. Mills is a hotshot with an impatient attitude, recently transferred from a small town to the big city where he hopes to make a difference. Mills' first case, and Somerset's supposed final, turns into something larger than your average homicide. A new serial killer has come to light and he is using torture and murder to preach against the seven deadly sins to his victims (e.g. an obese man is forced to eat himself to death at gunpoint).This is a dark, twisted movie. From the very beginning we open with a warped credits sequence and a glimpse into the methods of the yet-unknown serial killer to the remixed sound of Nine Inch Nails' ""Closer"". And it only gets more twisted from there. We never actually see the murderer (with the inconspicuous name John Doe) in action as the audience. Instead, we see the aftermath as Somerset and Mills arrive on the scene and each crime scene is more brutal than the last. John Doe is a psychopath and uses his victims to preach his message in the worst way possible. SE7EN is the most gripping serial killer/thriller since THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and even now, almost twenty years since it's release, is just as powerful as always. While there may not be any brutal violence occurring on screen, I would still recommend discretion for audience members who don't care for the darker subject matter. Despite the fact the movie was released in 1995, I'll try to remain spoiler-free when discussing the movie just in case, but the end of this movie has been parodied and paid homage countless times since. It's a strong ending and I'm glad it didn't cop out and go the usual route where the killer is stopped before his crimes can escalate and the story ends on a high note. Not here; it's a bittersweet ending where you could even go so far as to say the villain triumphs over the heroes.Every element of this movie contributes to its strength. The cinematography from Darius Khondji is amazing. The visual style of this movie is just as prominent as any performance. The high contrast, abundance of low lighting, overcast weather and sharp instances of source lighting (I really loved the red neon cross in Doe's apartment) gives this movie an overwhelming feeling of gloom that coincides with Detective Somerset's view on life in the city. I would love to get my hands on the screenplay from Andrew Kevin Walker for this one, as it's incredibly well written and was perfectly suited for the talents of someone as visually strong as director Fincher. The cast in this movie, again inspired. The only real important characters in the film are Somerset (Morgan Freeman), Mills (Brad Pitt), and the killer John Doe (who I won't spoil here on the off chance that someone reading this has not seen the movie and somehow avoided any and all revelations about Doe). Morgan Freeman is the kind of actor where you expect a powerful performance, and he delivers just that. Somerset is a jaded detective who's spent years on the force and seen it all (until Doe came along); he's tired and he's ready to find a simpler life. I've also got to give Pitt some great credit here because SE7EN was the movie that helped me realize Pitt was more talented than I'd believed and more than just a Hollywood pretty boy (further solidified in FIGHT CLUB, another awesome Fincher film). And finally, the actor portraying John Doe is excellent. Doe is a cold, calculating killer who truly believes in what he is doing and the actor gives one of the best eerie performances. All together, this all combines to create one of the best films of the 90s and almost guaranteed to become a favorite.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

A relentless tour through hell,"The origins of my love for cinema began when I started to discover many films similar to Se7en, ones that really provoke mass discussion long after seeing them. That overwhelming necessity to really explore the deeper meaning of the movie. They don't just aim to entertain, but to challenge opinions and push people to comprehend short-comings in society.When the young, cocksure Detective Mills (Brad Pitt) moves to the city hoping for a more thrilling line of police work, a string of murders are set in motion. He is consequently partnered with the diligent veteran, Detective Lieutenant Somerset (Morgan Freeman) to resolve the case, forcing them to put aside their differences to end the sequence of events, only to become pawns on a much larger board.Throughout the feature you get the feeling that these are two very different walks of life, the generational divide in their work methods are shown clearly. Whilst Somerset is cultured, world-weary and methodical, Mills is very impulsive and head strong, aiming to make an impression within the force yet not having the same determination when investigating. A montage shows Pitt's character is struggling to concentrate at home, meanwhile, his elder is shown pouring over books in a library, making reasonable headway with the case.This is no buddy-cop movie, it's unrelenting and brutal throughout. Although all the murders happen off-screen, the events are retold via the crime scene investigations and photographic evidence which enhance the aura of mystery around the killer, building up to the final chilling performance by Kevin Spacey as their very own John Doe. Blank of regret and emotion, he fits the performance perfectly as you can see the criminal exuding delight as the detectives are forced to pursue him through the grisly cat and mouse game.One of the ways that Fincher expresses how twisted the city-living can become is by the similarities between the characteristics of the 'insane' Doe and the disciplined Somerset. They act as two parallel examples of how someone can deal with a poor hand. Where the detective originally set out to better the world via law enforcement, using his intellect to prevent misconduct, John Doe executes a series of pre- meditated murders using his knowledge as a message to the masses. Their cynical outlook on how humanity has become so apathetic is resolved in two completely polar ways, their likeness fascinates me.I believe that part of David Fincher's plan when filming this was to hold a mirror to modern society. For us to scrutinise why, when murders are committed, we show no empathy? Horrors and tragedies are a staple fixture of the world today and much like Fincher's 'Fight Club' adaptation, it questions the very core of how compassion seems to have become less predominant, replaced by a love for money, consumerism and our own well-being. How accustomed we have become to awful events described by various media outlets on a a daily basis. All roles perfectly delivered by all actors involved. The ending flawlessly ties all loose ends within the plot whilst delivering its distressing climax, undoubtedly still provoking debates over a decade after its initial release.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Unpredictable Brilliance: A Deep Dive into a Genre-Defining Thriller,"In an era brimming with predictable plots and recycled tropes, few films manage to stand out as truly exceptional. Despite its share of clich√©s and a notably bleak finale, this particular thriller not only sets a high bar for its genre but also solidifies its place among the best films of its time. It captivates audiences with its masterful storytelling, intense performances, and an unrelenting atmosphere of suspense.Intriguing Character Dynamics:
At the heart of the film lies the compelling, albeit unconventional, relationship between its two lead characters, both detectives. Unlike the buddy-cop dynamic popularized by films such as the ""Lethal Weapon"" series, this duo never quite becomes friends. Instead, the young, brash detective, played by Brad Pitt, and the seasoned, world-weary veteran, portrayed by Morgan Freeman, maintain a tension-filled partnership. This dynamic is refreshingly realistic and adds depth to their interactions, as the younger cop's arrogance clashes with the elder's hard-earned wisdom, creating a palpable on-screen friction.Stellar Performances:
Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt deliver what can arguably be considered some of their finest work. Freeman's portrayal of the experienced detective is marked by a quiet intensity and gravitas, perfectly complementing Pitt's energetic and often impulsive performance. Pitt, in particular, shines in this role, showcasing a range and depth that elevates the character beyond the typical archetype of the reckless rookie.The Predictable Unpredictability:
One of the film's peculiar strengths is its ability to subvert expectations, albeit in a predictable way. Midway through the movie, viewers might find themselves attuned to the pattern of ""expecting the unexpected."" This paradoxically makes the plot somewhat predictable, as one learns to anticipate the film's next twist by considering what would be unexpected. The finale, for instance, while shocking, can be foreseen if one applies this logic. Yet, this awareness doesn't detract from the film's impact; instead, it transforms the viewing experience into a suspenseful wait for the inevitable horror to unfold.Suspense and Craftsmanship:
The film's craftsmanship is undeniable. Every element, from the tight pacing to the meticulous direction, contributes to a gripping narrative that keeps audiences on the edge of their seats. The tension builds methodically, drawing viewers into a dark and unsettling world where pure evil lurks just beneath the surface. The film excels in maintaining a sense of dread and anticipation, making the audience feel as though they are part of the investigation, inching closer to an unavoidable, horrifying truth.A Reluctant Admiration:
Despite a personal bias against Brad Pitt, I must concede that this film demands respect and admiration. Its professional execution and ability to deliver sustained suspense are commendable. The film does not merely rely on cheap thrills or gratuitous shocks; instead, it crafts a narrative that is as intellectually engaging as it is emotionally intense.Conclusion:
This thriller stands as a testament to what can be achieved in the genre when storytelling, character development, and performance come together seamlessly. It defies the conventions of the buddy-cop trope, delivers a narrative that keeps viewers guessing, and showcases some of the best acting talents of its time. Even with its predictable unpredictability and a finale that leaves one in a state of despair, the film remains a master class in suspenseful filmmaking. For anyone seeking a gripping, thought-provoking cinematic experience, this film is not to be missed.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

A cult classic that didn't get the acclaim it deserved,"Voluntarily transferring in to a crime hotspot in an unnamed city of America, Det. David Mills (Brad Pitt) is a rookie detective on the rise. He's teamed up with Det. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) who's not far away from retirement. They end up on a case investigating murders that follow a pattern and are inspired by the Seven Deadly Sins from Dante's ""The Devine Comedy"". Somerset is an expert in hunting down criminals and does things the old-fashioned way through years of working hard, due to looming retirement and a desire to stay alive he doesn't want to get involved too heavily - his years and the weariness they have brought him suggest that there is more going on than just another killer on the loose. Mills on the other hand wants to make a name for himself and pushes the case and his involvement. They fall out a little, it takes a meeting with Tracy Mill (Gwyneth Paltrow - Pitt's film wife) to convince Somerset that he has to be involved, if nothing else than to guide and protect Mills. Thus they pursue the murder, John Doe (Kevin Spacey) who has planned a shock for the detectives.Directed by David Fincher and wonderfully written by Andrew Kevin Walker, this is a fantastic intelligent and gripping film, a real cult classic and one of the iconic films of the 90's. It's dark and dirty with a fantastic atmosphere. The unnamed American city is a real hive of filth and degradation, it's always raining, and even when you are away from the rain the colour palette is muted, dark and dirty. The acting is top class all the way across the board. While having a new rogue cop and one close to retirement isn't a new set-up it works particularly well in this and Pitt and Freeman end up bouncing off each other beautifully. The score to the movie is great and really helps to build up the atmosphere and bring in a level of tension that chills. Editing techniques used are both new and existing, some a direct homage to absolute greats of horror movies, in particularly the hidden cell insertion (a-la ""The Exorcist"" for example) - a frame or picture hidden in the visual reel and only displayed for a fraction of a moment. The look and feel of the film harp back to noir classics or even graphic novel comic books the way it's all dark and gloomy, and while it's set as an action/suspense/thriller there are nods to horror too, both psychologically and physically, with the manner of killings which take place adding a grizzly and raw element. Well-paced and almost metronomal, this film will keep you entertained throughout - in fact the most peaceful time the film allows is when the detectives themselves are having a break from action. This is a feature of the film, it stays on track and focussed throughout and unlike conventional Hollywood films it never strays from it plot and purpose. The audience plays a part in the film as the third detective, in that they are kept in the dark throughout and only really learn things as the detectives learn, which allows for an intense ride and lifts the finale onto a pedestal. Not your typical cops and robbers' film this will take you out of your comfort zone and take you into a brutal world, and who knows, you might end up questioning your morality and empathising or sympathising with the killer's motives.This film didn't win half as many awards as it should have done - but thankfully its cult status and fan recognition have kept it alive in film history consciousness. 9 out of 10 from me.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Amazing thriller,"This isn't a movie for the faint of heart. There are unsettling imagery but it isn't shown for the pervert enjoyment of the viewer, but to deliver a message.The story is really well done. The 2 hours of runtime is well spent. There are no red herrings, every scene has its importance. Pacing is on spot, the viewer is constantly engaged. We get drama, surprise and a great shock at the end. Everything is built up and leads to a grand finale. It isn't the biggest, most unexpected storyline, you can guess most of the things if you saw enough movies, but it is undoubtedly well executed. Script is nice, characters are great, especially the outstanding performance of Mr. Morgan Freeman. The high class and elegance in the way he is delivering his role is a constant joy to experience. Because of this, we almost forget about Brad Pitt who also does a great job as the sidekick.Picture is beautiful. Every scene has its mood, especially with the nice touch of film noir elements. The sets are well crafted and immersive. The soundtrack fits the picture and the editing well.The movie does a decent job in raising questions about the ethics and morale of the individual especially in the context of a sinful city environment which was demonstrated throughout the takes. The challenges of living in such a place is well captured. We also get some good representation of the appreciation of literacy and the values it intend to carry. From the stories standpoint the paramount was achieved with the final ""shot"". However, the philosophical catharsis should have happened in the final travelling scene. This was the biggest problem with the movie. The script wasn't that strong here. The philosophical and moral questions that start to raise in the movie should have been worked out or elevated in this part, but we didn't get much. I can understand this from a story pacing standpoint but because of this, the movie missed a huge opportunity to leave a deep moral impact through possibly iconic lines that could have been told here. It still gives material to think about but doesn't raises to greatness. John's character had a great mystery around him in the middle of the movie, but as we get to the end it gets shallower especially with the way he finished his ""work"". I understand the narrative decision from the story's standpoint. It had to be done this way for the ending, but they sacrificed John's character and an interesting moral dilemma and the possible message in it for this ending, so John's ultimate goal was technically reached but not philosophically. IMHO this way Mills would be the one who will be right about the impact of John's ""work"".All in all it is a highly recommend if you are ready to bear the visuals.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Poignant social comment via the medium of film,"Overall, Seven is an excellent film. It is highly enjoyable in the sublime sense, in that despite being a film of great darkness combined with graphic depictions of murder, there is in fact a very poignant social comment at the end that arises from it all. The central underlying theme of the film is how society seems to turn a blind eye to the seven deadly sins it commits on a daily basis, and how a highly intelligent serial killer commits a series of brutal murders to expose this and voice his discontent with this matter.Initially, it starts with a seemingly standard murder mystery type plot, though the brutal ways in which the victims are murdered is quite unprecedented in a film of this genre, and the production design also gives the film a certain historic/period atmosphere which aids in setting itself apart from the norm.As the film progresses, each murder appears to get more gruesome and horrible than the one before. At times during the first one and half hours of the film then the pace gets a little slow, although this in fact can be seen as a build up towards what becomes one of the greatest endings in film history.The most poignant part of the film occurs when Jon Doe is explaining the rationale behind his murder 'masterpiece' to the two detectives whilst in the car near the end. He explains that he was chosen to commit this crime (even though Somerset replies that this would fly in the face of martyrdom). He says that he cannot tolerate the fact that deadly sins are committed 'on every street corner' and people just tolerate it and go on living their normal lives. He therefore uses murder as a means of exposing the fact that we live in a society which in fact is sinister, sinful, and 'shitty' as Doe puts it. Here, the dialogue is exquisite, and every word that Doe utters seems to have been carefully thought out by him (the character). He is, as he says, 'knocking society in the face with a sledge hammer' to try and make people aware just how much they are in fact going against the lord and the bible. Doe can therefore be seen as man who wishes to initiate new values in society. He illustrates each of the sins by murdering sinners of each sin e.g.the lawyer who lied to keep rapists and murderers on the street to make lots of money (that's not hugely sympathetic to the law profession, i.e.all lawyers are sinful!!)is an illustration of greed.The film is therefore a very clever social comment on quite a controversial and difficult matter. As society has become increasingly secularized, to commit a deadly sin is not such a meaningful or 'sinful' thing as it used to be, although in the extreme sense that Doe illustrates it as(e.g. lust's disease spreading whore) such sins (but not necessarily in the biblical sense) are still massively relevant to contemporary society.Overall, therefore, it has an extremely cleverly thought out plot, superb acting from all the cast, and makes for a very thought-provoking piece of cinema.Overall Rating: 9/10",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Only 5 for 7,"It had a very promising start. Opening credits were interesting and the photography was wonderful. All was going well until we were introduced to the main characters (Freeman and Pitt).Basically these characters are overly simplistic and rather cliched.Freeman the extremely well learned and rational cop and Pitt the gung-ho non-intellectual (anti) are about as believable as munchkins.Unfortunately this movie seems to have been made to gratuitous ly use hollywoods most popular actors (at the time) rather than a good movie.Sorry, watch Silence of the Lambs if you want a good movie of this genre.mho",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Doesn't Get Much Better Than This One,"A magnificent thriller masterfully done by David Fincher. Fincher's understanding of serial killers and police work surrounding them is almost frightening. This one is engaging and revolting from Moment one. The acting by Freeman, Pitt, Paltrow is top notch. Great chemistry between them. Kevin Spacey, for all his flaws, is as good here as you will ever see. The last 30 minutes of this one are unmatched anywhere. This one hold up. Great movie.

How Deliciously Evil,"The film ""Se7en"", directed by David Fincher (Fight Club), is a stylish thriller that pulls out all the stops to catch the audiences attention. The wily veteran detective, William Somerset, is played excellently by Morgan Freeman. He brings up the younger detective, David Mills, surprisingly well played by Brad Pitt, who is not known for his role in dramatic films. Later on, Pitt will work with Fincher in Fight Club,but that is a different story. The two detectives are chasing a serial killer who is committing murders according to the seven deadly sins(Gluttony, Wrath, Envy, Pride, Lust, Greed, and Sloth). The deaths and murders in this film are not too extreme, but they get the point across. The plot and storyline is well planned and thought out. Gwyneth Paltrow plays Pitt's wife. This is Paltrow in a smaller role and she plays it well. But lets not forget how the title of my summary comes about. The killer,named appropriately John Doe, is played maniacally by Kevin Spacey, a sick and twisted Kevin Spacey who's in fine form after The Usual Suspects and before American Beauty, both of which he won Academy Awards for. Fincher shoots this movie flawlessly; the camera-work is excellent, cinematography is good. And the ending is one that is a predecessor for films such as Saw and The Bone Collector. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A murder mystery that offers more for the mind than mere thrills,"Murder mysteries don't often indulge their audience's intellectual capacity. They generally believe they can get by on suspense, intrigue and our inherent and insatiable need to find out 'whodunit.' But ""Se7en"" is a philosophical thriller that addresses a much bigger part of our nature - the age old question of whether or not humans are inherently evil.As gripping as it is the way it turns gears in your head in search of any way to get mentally one step ahead of the plot, ""Se7en"" is a first-rate crime thriller because of the ideas fueling the story and a director in David Fincher who perfectly understands them.More than a story of two detectives on the trail of a serial killer committing murders based on the seven deadly sins, ""Se7en"" wants to be something bigger. It wants you to take a breather from figuring it out and chew on something a little more sophisticated, like say, human nature. The contemplative script by Andrew Kevin Walker gives us plenty of time for this as retiring Lt. Somerset (Freeman) and Det. Mills (Pitt) bicker over the killer's motives together or even have dinner at Mills' apartment. It's not just about the mystery and what psychology or ideals drive the killer -- those ideas echo throughout the film and even in these basic conversational scenes.None of that would be communicated well, however, without Fincher (""Alien 3""). ""Se7en"" takes place in an unnamed rundown city, presumably in modern day, and that locational flexibility allows Fincher and whoever scouted locations the ability to film the movie in places that would better tell this story about human nature. The murder scenes take place in seedy, decrepit apartments -- all usually dark -- in attempt to tell a story of humanity in its darkest place, at it's very worst. Constant use of on-screen lights (e.g characters holding flashlights, red lamps, etc) give the film its signature while also extending the metaphor. It's the work of a director who understands the script through and through and has command of his vision.The characters are also extremely sophisticated and believable as are the performances of the actors playing them. Freeman comes fresh off his Oscar-winning performance in ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and absolutely dominates the pacing of the film. We take our cues on when to relax, when to get more curious and when to get passionate from his performance. On the verge of retirement, we see perfectly how this one life-changing case challenges his hardened world view.Even Pitt's Mills, in his impatience, naivety and quick-tempered rebellious perspective, goes quickly from characteristics that feel a little forced to monumentally epiphanic near the climax. Pitt's taken on numerous roles in his career where we think we're getting the shells of a character role but we end up getting something meaningful after all.That's sort of the way ""Se7en"" works on the whole. Before you can even realize it, you suddenly realize you've been watching a thoughtful two-hour sermon about mankind's true nature and its inclination toward evil with a large order of murder mystery on the side. Few thrillers give us the pleasure of meditating on such important ideas, in this case a question at the center of philosophy for hundreds if not thousands of years. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
What a terrific way to end a film!,"""Ernest Hemingway once wrote, 'The world is a fine place and worth fighting for.' I agree with the second part"".What a terrific way to end a film, that was pretty shocking! And if truth be told, this particular element of 'Shock' is what made the entirety of the film work. And only through these startling moments, the film seems to shine the brightest!The rest of it can be considered as the build-up; not much happens in this time frame but this is where the plot, one step at a time, makes its tinier advancements.Other than Fincher's technical proficiency; what I admired the most was this dynamic established between Brad Pitt & Morgan Freeman as well as the characters they play respectively. Not only was I able to connect to them at a personal level but I was also drawn to their investigative manoeuvres. Although, the same cannot be told about the supporting cast; as they hardly got any opportunities to develop as characters.For example, towards the end, there's this character that meets a horrible fate (I won't give you the name); in that particular juncture, I was supposed to feel sympathetic toward this individual but I couldn't. Simply because that character (Still not giving out the name) merely had not more than ten minutes of screentime. I don't want to sound pretentious, so I'm gonna be very candid here; I didn't feel anything for that person, nor did I care.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Excellent craft work but not art,"Watching how the two detectives (a beginner and an experienced one) are pursuing a very intelligent serial killer is extremely well played and directed. Alone their interactions during the investigation is worth seeing the movie. The whole film is very much a male-type story except the character of the wife of the young detective. The appearance of the feminine character gives a human flavor to the work of the detectives transforming their male-like competition into elderly-young cooperation. Why I rate only 3 out of 10? Because the authors do not seem to understand the fundamental concept of the film, the 7 cardinal sins. The 7 cardinal sins are not actually sins themselves but are the source of other sins. Example: a married man seeing a pretty woman can feel desire to have her, but this is because men are biologically designed like this. If he acts to have the woman despite being married then he commits sins, but this sin is called adultery. So, in fact, there is one voluntary sinner in the film: the serial killer. The others - as the senior detective explains - just fail to work towards a balanced life, towards being able to love. The conclusion, that ""life is ugly but let's work to make it better"" is therefore flawed and makes the film a technically excellent work without the spirit that distinguishes craft work from true art.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

One of my favorite movies,"This movie is really good. First, it has two of my favorite actors: Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey so you know it's going to be good. This movie is based on a man's (played by Kevin Spacey) obsession with punishing people who he believes are partaking in one of the seven deadly sins. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt play the detectives after him. Gwyneth Paltrow plays the wife to Brad Pitt's character, and while it may seem that she doesn't play a crucial role in the movie, her character turns out to be pivotal in how the end of this movie plays out. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes movies about serial killers and those who distort the Bible to their own beliefs. If you have a weak stomach, though, then this movies might not be for you. There are a lot of disturbing images and swearing throughout so I would not recommend it for children. Also, parents really do need to use their judgment when it comes to letting their teens watch it. It's rated R for good reason.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"Very successful dark and grisly, noirish murder mystery","If you simply read about what Seven is about you would be forgiven for thinking it sounded an incredibly hackneyed affair. A world weary detective a week from retirement is paired with a young hotshot colleague to work on a new case of grisly murders. They don't get on at first but once they get to know each other they begin to form a bond and prove to be a good team. This synopsis makes Seven sound like a generic buddy cop movie. And, to be fair, it is that to a certain extent. But fortunately the truth is in the detail.Director David Fincher is a visual stylist and it's the look and feel of the movie that helps transcend it to another level. The setting is a nameless, hellish city where it seems to constantly be raining. There is a consistent feeling of impending dread. The visual elements of the film emphasises this. It goes for a dark neo-noir look, what with the rain and the shadowy interiors. The buildings all look like they are from a bygone era, while the men seem to dress like they are from a 40's film-noir - hats and trench coats are the order of the day, despite this clothing being completely out of fashion in the 90's. It's this attention to detail that gives Seven such an interesting look and feel.Then we have the serial killings themselves. They have been staged to represent the seven deadly sins from the Bible. Each horrible death is targeted against someone who breaches one of the sins and their punishment is an elaborate and violent lesson against their transgression. It's a great set of crimes to base a detective film around. The mystery narrative progresses at first in a fairly traditional way but towards the end the rug is pulled out from under us and we enter unexpected territory. It's this unpredictability also that makes this a fine unconventional thriller. The principal actors are all very good, with a particular standout turn from Kevin Spacey towards the end. Spacey is very adept a doing 'cold' and here he is pitch perfect.The story arc winds its way intelligently to an unforgettably nihilistic climax and Seven ultimately has to be considered one of the best serial killer films out there.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Disturbing,"Seven is a masterful and haunting crime thriller that has stood the test of time since its release in 1995. Directed by David Fincher and starring Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, and Kevin Spacey, the film follows the investigation of a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as inspiration for his gruesome murders.What makes Seven so powerful is its relentless and unsettling atmosphere, as well as its uncompromising depiction of human depravity. The film's director and cast have crafted a world that feels both real and terrifying, and the story unfolds with a meticulous attention to detail that keeps viewers hooked from beginning to end.In addition to its impressive storytelling, Seven also boasts stunning cinematography and a hauntingly beautiful score that perfectly captures the mood and tone of the film. Whether you're a fan of crime thrillers or simply appreciate high-quality cinema, Seven is a must-watch film that will leave a lasting impression on you.Overall, I highly recommend Seven to anyone looking for a thought-provoking and masterfully crafted film that will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout.

"Disturbing, dark and brilliant","I remember watching ""Alien 3"" and not being too fond of it.  I was impressed with the overall look of the movie and the darkness of it but it just didn't seem to fit in with the previous two movies.  I remembered the director's name and found myself looking out for more of his work.  I was extremely excited in 1995 when I found out he had directed ""Seven"" since I thought his career had been destroyed by ""Alien 3"".  I was clearly wrong.  I saw ""Seven"" and walked out of the theater not knowing how I felt about the movie.  It stayed with me for a week so I went to see it again.  Brilliant!  Morgan Freeman is so amazing it's painful.  He takes a cop movie cliche (the soon to be retired, embittered cop) and takes it to amazing heights. He allows you to understand his character completely.  A beautiful performance.The movie is incredibly dark not only in tone but physically.  Somehow cinematographer Darius Khondji manages to take a desert setting in the middle of the day and make it dark, shadowy and bleak.  The dark look of the movie adds to the overall feel of despair.""Seven"" pretty much gets your attention from the very beginning (introducing Freeman's character and Brad Pitt. . .who is really good) and then throws you a pretty disturbed title sequence which makes you kind of twitchy and puts you in the proper frame of mind.The movie starts off very graphically with the 'gluttony' killing.  If you manage to make it through the scene where the body is discovered (I swear, you can almost smell that apartment!) and the autopsy scene you've already sat through the goriest parts.  This doesn't mean that you can relax, though.A good job by all involved. We can only hope that David Fincher keeps making movies this disturbing and interesting.

Se7en out of Ten,"Two cops are after a killer who is choosing his victims based on each of the seven deadly sins. This pretty much sums up the plot. I highly doubt that director David Fincher is an amoral misanthropic person, but he does want his audience to be disturbed.Se7en, is a good example of the right way to construct a thriller. It is potent and eerie, superbly crafted, nicely paced, even scary at times. The climax feels a little overly contrived as so many do, but I didn't feel cheated too badly. The movie ends on a bit of a funny note and when you stop to think about it, it leaves some things unexplained.As far a cop buddies go, I can't say that Brad Pitt and Morgan Freemon make a great pair. A film like Se7en requires two lead actors of equal talent, and Pitt is no match for Freemon, although that is just my opinion.Se7en is a movie that sinks its teeth in deep, and it provides enough fascination to keep a good viewer in his seat for the duration of two hours, but it is not a film for the religious, the squeamish or the weak of mind.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
This ain't a seven: it's got to be at least an eight or a nine.,"I consider David Fincher's Seven to be a precursor/forerunner of the 'torture porn' phenomenon‚Äîmore specifically, the Saw movies: it utilises the grunge aesthetic that has become synonymous with such films, features a self-righteous villain who delights in playing gruesome games, revels in the extreme nature of its victims' suffering, and delivers an uncompromising and rather preposterous finale that is designed to hit like a kick to the gut.However, despite being the impetus for what has become one the most over-saturated and tiresome of sub-genres (as well as that irritating trend of replacing letters in a title with numbers), I don't resent Fincher's film one bit: it's just too good to hold a grudge against‚Äîa masterpiece of the macabre that admittedly requires a little suspension of disbelief to be truly effective, but which is so well crafted and so horrific that to do so is both easy and worthwhile.Fincher is able to successfully brush off the debacle that was Alien 3 and prove himself to be the accomplished movie-maker that many suspected him to be. Without studio interference, he successfully delivers his vision‚Äîa visually stunning chiller that delivers thrills, chills, grisly horror aplenty, without resorting to cheap scares or overtly explicit gore. Despite its gruesome subject matter, Se7en doesn't rely on relentless splatter to shock: the mere suggestion of what has occurred possesses the power to repel, with brief glimpses of the murder victims' corpses offering just enough grisly detail to satisfy the viewer's morbid curiosity.An ingenious script from Andrew Kevin Walker, impeccable performances from its amazing cast (including a particularly outstanding performance from Kevin Spacey), and what what has to be one of most harrowing and unsettling endings in cinema, all adds up to one hell of a fine movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A perfect crime thriller,"Seven is a perfect crime thriller. It's impactful, thematic, suspenseful, and character-driven. It fully embraces its jaded worldview through gruesome content and a culminating conclusion. Morgan Freeman excels as a demoralized homicide detective. He displays flashes of buried optimism, but is deeply nihilistic. Meanwhile, Brad Pitt is an ideal counterpart. Young and energized, Pitt genuinely believes he can make a positive difference. While these two crack the grisly case, their relationship develops into a true friendship. The investigation is captivating, but their bond is Seven's core. Therefore, their vulnerability and authenticity are crucial to the film's success.Furthermore, Seven is brilliantly enhanced by Fincher's filmmaking. First, the cold imagery often suggests rather than displays violence. This urges viewers to imagine the brutalities for themselves, which is far more haunting. The editing is slow and deliberate, masterfully mounting tension. The production design is gross and decrepit, underscoring the theme of moral decay. The effects are vividly shocking yet measured, always respecting the horror. Lastly, Fincher's direction flawlessly captures a grim tone, festering atmosphere, and methodical tempo. Thus, Seven is a transformation of its parts, a genuine piece of art, and utterly unforgettable.Writing: 10/10

Great Movie with a predictable ending,"Let's get the good out of the way. This was a very artistic movie with some excellent ambience (I loved the rain). The murders were gruesome and the storyline was engaging. Morgan Freeman was excellent as always and Brad Pitt had some great moments. However, Kevin Spacey really stole the show for me. It's a great movie and I think it's definitely worth the watch.Now on to the bad. As Se7en is a bit of a genre-defining film, it's hard to watch for the first time today without feeling like the plot is dull. It definitely has its moments, especially when the sloth victim, but one of the most pivotal moments fell completely flat to me. I was able to predict the ending as soon as I knew the killer was going through the seven deadly sins, so as the tension rose and the film built up to its climax, I was waiting for something to throw me off guard. However, everything happened just as I expected it. Apparently, this is not a common experience with this movie, but it was my experience, so it really docked the movie from a solid 9 inching towards a 10 to an 8 sinking towards a 7.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

GREAT concept and beginning thennnn...not so much,"I liked this movie from the moment it started. To me, mixing religion with anything makes 'anything' infinitely more creepy - and this film started out just that way.I loved the premise of the movie and how each new crime is set up for the viewer. Also that the movie is set up in a world where each day seems grayer than the previous - and each crime more gruesome - it really does a great job of grabbing your attention from the first scene.Morgan Freeman does an excellent job of a weathered, yet wise, detective - and then there is the Brad Pitt element. Ms. Paltrow does fine work in this movie. And then there is Brad Pitt...I want to like Brad Pitt. Maybe it's just that I haven't seen the movie yet where he does a great job and doesn't seem like he's trying to act 'too hard'. I have a hard time believing his character in this movie (or any movie he's in for that matter). But, the other actors and the script for this movie do a great job of carrying him along.Then there is the 'end' of the movie. I'm still annoyed by how this movie ended. The last scene seems to be in direct contrast with the imagination, set up, reveal, shock and get-you-by-the-short-hairs script used in the previous 80 minutes of this movie.So...my 7 out of 10 basically means, for this movie - if it comes on - I will most likely get sucked into watching it again. And then when all the great scenes are over with and I've become weary of one person's acting - I will find that the last 10 minutes are a good point to realize, ""I've been sitting down watching enough TV today - time to go get something done.

Great,"Seven (1995)**** (out of 4)Intense and rather disturbing thriller has Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman playing detectives trying to track down a serial killer who is using the seven deadly sins as his motive. I remember seeing this the opening day in theaters and I really left the theater disappointed. While I found it a good entertainment, it never really struck me as anything great until many years later on repeat viewings. Today I think the story, acting and directing makes it one of the best films of the decade. Fincher's dark style really creates a thick and rather eerie atmosphere, which runs from the opening to closing credits. The screenplay offers up a lot of tense action but I think the key to the film is the quieter moments where we get to know the two detectives as well as Pitt's wife played by Gwyneth Paltrow. When the killer's identity is finally revealed, and I won't ruin it here, the film even lets us get to know him in perhaps the most chilling scene in the movie. I think having the violence centered around the seven deadly sins was an interesting choice and the motives and conclusion could be endlessly debated. I guess it's to be expected that Freeman and Pitt would be opposite type of characters and the screenplay doesn't take the easy way out on this but instead it uses this to bring up the energy and we're able to see the killer from two different view points, which is a rare thing in thrillers like this. Both men give excellent performances with Freeman being the older, wiser man while Pitt is still wet behind the year but trying to make his mark in the profession. I know this film was a hit when originally released but it seems like it's become a classic over the past few years and I personally wouldn't argue with anyone calling this film that. I think it gets better with each viewing in the same sense that many Hitchcock thrillers get better.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
Morgan Freeman at his best,"This is probably my favorite crime movie of all time. It is expertly written, acted and directed. Mr. Freeman is a credit to the industry and does a superior job in bringing this character to life.

The suspense is top-notch having a first time viewer on the edge of their seat from the start. When the film does end, the viewer is left with a shocking twist, stirring up a few emotions that aren't often felt when watching a movie.

Disturbing and brilliant!,"'Seven' is one of the most disturbing murder mystery films I've seen - not from a horror perspective, but on a psychological level.

A mysterious killer commits murders according to these sins, killing a person guilty of every one of these sins, in the most horrific ways.Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman star as Detectives Mills and Somerset. Initially clashing, they are forced to work together with time running out. The film effectively creates suspense every step of the way. Be warned, some of the scenes are not for the faint of heart.

Fincher takes more a restrictive approach by respecting the audience and only showing us what we need to see/hear while still getting his point across. The atmosphere and screenwriting are what cause this film to be set apart from other films in this genre.Plot: 10/10

My wife wants to see the head!!!,"Without saying WHO the head is of, we were watching this the other night when a head in a box is delivered, and someone opens the box but we can't see inside it. My wife is yelling (honestly) ""SHOW US THE HEAD!!!"". She was so disappointed that we didn't see the head that 3 days later she's still talking about it, so I downgraded my better rating to account for me having to put up with a movie that didn't SHOW US THE HEAD!!!I suppose today it would be CGI'd in but they could have put something in the box to see and I wouldn't have to listen to my wife talking about it days later!!!",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
8.6 IMDB RATING! come on now,"So i rewatched this movie as i was rated it very highly previously and i can finally rest assured that this movie is overrated. To be honest, i felt bored and sleepy during most of my time watching it, its story is not as complex as others have claimed to be, and a few things i do praise in the movie which are Acting and Direction even though Brad Pitt was a bit more childish for a person with this kind of job. Towards the end of the movie it helped me a little to get me excited. I don't think it's that bad ending, and I admit that I wasn't expecting itoverall if you looking for a classical 90' Police-Criminal Chase movie this one is for you, as for me I don't think its that impressive.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
admirable   work,"not only the script. but the acting, the photography, the inspired use of genre's clich√©s, the old well known end who becomes more than a surprise are the pieces who defines the film more than a good one. its virtue - to be more than a crime movie. to transform a story in fine analysis of emotions, desires and lost hopes of the characters. a film about justice. in a very nuanced manner. because the details are more than clues. because the tension is in brilliant manner directed. because Brad Pitt could be, for many, a real surprise. because it seems be the film of Kevin Spacey. but it is result of an admirable artistic team who saw explore each detail. a film like an experience.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
The Se7ven deadly sins...,"SE7VEN is a modern thriller masterpiece, in tradition of other modern classics like Silence of the Lambs. The acting is magnificent, and Kevin Spacey played the sick, twisted villian perfectly. I don't think anyone got academy awards for this but they should have. Brad Pitt's emotional scene at the end is shockingly good, and Morgan Freeman once again does a great job in his thriller genre.So have yourself a good time watching Se7ven. It will thrill you, scare you, haunt you, and even make you a little sick at the thought of what happened in the film.

The movie contains a couple of disgusting scenes and is not for sensitive people. ;) Brad Pitt, Gwyneth Paltrow and Morgan Freeman show real acting skills and after watching this movie they to continue to be favorite actors of mine.

Do you understand how legendary this movie is? And how it will keep on living for decades?,"I wouldn't give it a perfect 10 but gosh darn if it wasn't a close 10. This movie is so timeless as it will keep living on for generations to come. Even when you know the suspense or the ending, you will still come back to this marvelous piece of cinema. Man, I love David Fincher, there's no movie of David Fincher that I don't like, except Aliens 3(well we can't call it a 'Fincher').I wouldn't talk in length about the movie, the story and all, what some other reviewers like to do. I would just keep it simple. The way they hid the identity of the serial killer and how they handled the promotions was brilliant. You had to be alive in 1995 to understand that. How much of a surprise it was to find out who actually was the killer. Anyway, let's not give it away for some users as many of my friends still haven't seen this movie so I can only assume how many are out there like him.Morgan Freeman is power man. He doesn't have to do a lot to control a scene. He doesn't have to go out of his zone to command a scene. He just does it. 30-something Brad Pitt is fire as well as the 50-something Brad Pitt. This man has kept his acting consistency throughout the year.Can we appreciate my second favourite director, David Fincher? What a master. What an absolute genius. So less people talk about him man. So less recognition given. The Social Network is still called the best movie of the decade and it wouldn't have been possible without Fincher. Screenwriters are a big part of his direction alongwith the lighting. A rather unnecessary part for a director to control but he controls it.You wanna know my favorite Finchers?Fight Club

One of the iconic films of the 90's,"IMDb Top 250: 27Seven, David Fincher's first great film, is about two detectives in an unnamed city who hunt down a serial killer who uses the Seven Deadly Sins as his modus operandi. It's an original and clever take on the murder mystery. When those opening credits start to roll, with an awesome remix of Nine Inch Nail's 'Closer', the viewer begins to both dread what will come next, but also be unable to wait to see how it unfurls.A very important part of Seven is its setting and atmosphere. The city, unnamed intentionally, is a savage, crime-riddled town that no one wants to live in. It sets the perfect landscape for such a bizarre killer. The direction is wonderful: constant rain, dark; this is a sad, dreary place, and no good can possibly come of it. It's one of Seven's greatest strengths.Another great strength is the three major players. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman play the rookie and the veteran, and both are very convincing. Pitt, a five year veteran elsewhere, comes to the city intentionally with his girlfriend. We feel his unpreparedness, especially early on. He doesn't know what to expect from this dreary place; his reaction to the vomit and him waiting for Somerset outside the Gluttony murder, in the rain soaking with two coffees proves that. While some criticize Pitt's acting at the end, I think he aces it.Freeman doesn't have as hard a job, he is the perfect smart and wise character. The last player is the killer, who I will keep a secret. From the killer's entrance to finish, you will be on edge as long as the character is on the screen. The lack of emotion is unsettling.Visually, the film stands out: colours are seeped out of the picture, leaving darkness and rain: a great example is in the alley, with cameras facing up the guns barrel into the rain.The last key to Seven's success is the plot. Full of action, suspense, and a few jumps, you will be engrossed by this story till its intense, shocking finale. Each of the killings are well-thought and shown in a gory, visceral matter, but not explicitly so. Sloth and Lust are absolutely atrocious in a good way, but I think Pride could have been fleshed out a little more. That could be the only suggestion I have about the film.The less you know going into Seven, the better. One of the 90's best. 9.6/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
A dark and complex work of art.,"Se7en is one of those films that masters it's tone. From the get-go, with its use of imagery and atmosphere, you are thrown into this grimy realistic world. The film never lets go of this razor-sharp tone and doubles-down on its dark themes. The use of rain and dirty city life perpetuates its message to the audience about the world. All of these points are a testament to the immersion of this film.Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt have very good chemistry together as a police duo and set the stage for intense moments in the second half of the film. The other supporting actors also work extremely well and the end of the film has one of the best character reveals in the history of film, but I will not go into detail on that to avoid spoilers. The acting from top to bottom is superb.David Fincher is one of my favorite filmmakers and Se7en is near the top of the list of his works. The directing is tight, the writing is fierce, and the execution of its themes is as efficient as it comes in film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

"Brilliant screenplay, amazing role performances, all in all a definite thriller masterpiece","I wasn't so sure what to expect, either a very brutal and a disturbing movie or an intelligent and an exciting thriller. Well, it was brutal at parts, disturbing at times, but it still managed to be an intelligent and an exciting thriller all the way through, a true diamond for the thriller -genre. The movie tells about two homicide detectives, an experienced veteran detective Somerset who's about to retire from his job and another detective Mills, a rookie who's supposed replace Somerset after he's retired. They soon team up together when they find out that there's a serial killer who commits his murders by choosing victims who each represent one of the Seven Deadly Sins. A perfect plot for a thriller indeed.I just mentioned about the plot being perfect for a thriller, but does the screenplay manage that perfection? Oh yes, it does. The screenplay (written by Andrew Kevin Walker) is absolutely amazing, along with the whole storytelling. The whole movie is exciting and thrilling throughout all the way from the beginning till the end by not making one single stop or telling any irrelevant subplots. It focuses on the main theme, the whole progress of solving a crime in a very detailed way, making it undeniably one of the best thrillers ever made. Another thing mentioned above is that it was brutal and disturbing at times, but it still doesn't take it over the top. I could describe those parts as being important for the film itself. By showing these brutal things it makes you alert and sort of scared, and really makes you despise the unnatural murderer who's behind the horrible crimes. You really start to live the movie itself, you want to catch the criminal and make him pay what he has done. That is because the absolutely brilliant storytelling the movie has, also giving it a very good flow which causes the 2 hours go in a blink of an eye. That is what a real flow should all be about, making a 3 hour long massive epic movie seem like only a 30 minute short film. That is what ""Se7en"" manages, a flow that's just so good it's a real pleasure for eyes to see.The directing is close to excellence and it is lead by David Fincher whose work I will most certainly be observing in the future, as I was so pleased on the result he managed with ""Se7en"". Fincher sort of follows the whole story as it should, translating the screenplay on the screen in a very successful and an entertaining way. The movie also got nominated for an Academy Award back in 1996 in the category of Best Film Editing. To be honest, I immediately noticed how detailed it actually was, how it made that flow even better scene after a scene. It makes the whole movie more immense and stirring, backed up by the great cinematography which gives the movie that dark edge it needs. The music's just gorgeous, building up the tension and making your heart beat very fast when there's these highly intensive scenes, giving the whole movie that final touch. It is composed by one of my favourite composers Howard Shore and to be honest the music is very much like Shore. I can't describe it more precisely, but if you're familiar with his work you know what I'm talking about.Starring Morgan Freeman as detective William Somerset and Brad Pitt as detective David Mills a thriller couldn't ask more from the lead actors. Both role performances are outstanding and both actors are very convenient in their roles. Morgan Freeman happens to be one of my favourite actors of all time and he's indeed one of those actors you just have to admire because to me the man hasn't done one single bad role performance in his career. Freeman is very convincing as detective Somerset, giving the character that Freeman -edge it needs, being wise and witty, a perfect mentor. I must admit that Brad Pitt also happens to be one of my favourite actors and as detective Mills he does a superb job, making the character what it's all about, the one with the looks, being fierce and serious. Both of the characters have this very realistic depth in them. To me Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt were one of the best pair teams I've ever seen on the screen, they just compliment each other's performances so well it just almost makes me shed a tear.""Se7en"" is all in all an amazing movie. Surely one of the best thrillers I've ever seen. It's intensive, immense, exciting, detailed and thrilling, just what all thrillers should be like. Everything seems to click in this film; Brilliant screenplay, directing close to excellence, great characters and even better role performances, intensive cinematography and music that just captures the whole essence of the thriller -genre. Despite the fact of it being somewhat brutal at parts it really doesn't matter in the end, it still isn't that tasteless over the top violence the horror -genre seems to have, so you shouldn't even worry about what I said about it. I'm not saying it's a movie suitable for children, I'm saying it's a movie where even the brutal and disturbing scenes are made with a good taste and a classy style. I'd give it a 9.5/10, but as that is impossible it has to satisfy with the more than deserved 9. All this gives you an absolutely guaranteed motion picture experience, it does it smoothly and it does it with style. A thriller among the best.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

"A serious meditation on the nature of evil. ""It is one of the best and most intelligent serial killer films ever made.""","It's powerfully directed by David Fincher, and Morgan Freeman gives another of his superbly understated performances. The filmmakers stick to their vision with such dedication and persistence that something indelible comes across something ethically and artistically superior to The Silence of the Lambs that refuses to exploit suffering for fun or entertainment. The reason to see Seven, which is decidedly not for the faint of stomach, is not for the punishment of sin, but the many virtues of Freeman's contribution. Seven is a work of extraordinary style, upsetting power and narrative daring. The investigation and the clues that lead to the murderer are well thought out and continually provocative. The film is quite involving. David Fincher is at the top of his form with Seven, one of the darkest, creepiest, and most brilliant serial killer pictures in film history, far more interesting than Silence of the Lambs. Both Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman give great performances in this film.The pace is fast and the shocks build beautifully. The actors within it all reel with convincing horror.It's not the identity of the killer that gives Seven its kick -- it's the way Fincher raises mystery to the level of moral provocation. Despite some truly fantastic work throughout the '90s and 2000s, Se7en still remains director David Fincher's best film, albeit by a very narrow margin.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"

Brilliant,"Two police detectives - one, Somerset, about to retire and the other, Mills, just transferred into the precinct - investigate the murder of an obese man. On his wall was written the word ""Gluttony"". Then they are alerted to the murder of a lawyer. On his floor was written the word ""Greed"". Somerset suspects that the murders were the work of the same man, a man murdering people who have committed the seven deadly sins.Brilliant. Starts off as an intriguing, clever detective drama, showing how police go about investigating crimes, developing the characters and meticulously developing the plot. Highly engaging and enthralling. From a point it becomes more than a crime drama, developing some deeper undertones and ending as a dark psychological drama.Superb ending with a very unpredictable twist. Ties the whole story together perfectly.Solid performances from Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt in the lead roles. The standout performance, however, goes to Kevin Spacey who is chillingly good in his role. Reminded me a lot of his performance in The Usual Suspects.Great work by David Fincher, directing only his second feature film (the first was Aliens 3).

I plan on buying this on a CD so I can listen to the book and see if it follows the movie. When I first saw this movie, I was prepared to just see another crime/mystery, but as you get into the movie, you see it is more than that. Morgan does his best to not like his new young partner. He also wanted this new, young partner to know he could not count on him being around for long as he was getting ready to retire and just wanted his days to be nice and quiet. The new partner did teach Morgan that young, upcoming detectives can and does become a very good cover your butt type of detective.

The best serial killer movie I have seen,"Se7en really raises the bar on the cop and serial killer movies. And it is not like any other movies from it's genre. Director David Fincher captures the essence of the dark, sinful world created in the mind of screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker with every move of the camera. The atmospheric look of this movie is outstanding. Hallways always have this dark unsettling blackish tone and non-stop pouring rain occupies the outside world.I think Brad Pitt gives his best performance up to date in this movie. His not caring acting style really fits the character of the rookie Detective Mills. But it is Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey who display the best acting in this movie. Their characters have depth like very few movie characters have. Morgan Freeman with his dynamic, brooding acting style brilliantly portrays the intelligent, cynical Detective Somerset. And the range of Kevin Spacey 's acting gives his character, the serial killer John Doe, an extra dimension of depth.Detective Somerset knows the rules of his profession. And he tries to warn the rookie Detective Mills from the dangers involved in it. But Mills is too busy proving himself on his new position as a detective, he doesn't really care for the advice. And as the numbers of the murder victims grow Detective Somerset, who wanted to retire, changes his mind and stays with the case to warn and help Mills. Somerset tries his best to educate Mills on the subject of serial killers, he gives him books to read on the case and tries to give him moral advice too. But in the end John Doe, the serial killer, is the one who educates them both on the subject of morality ¬Ö screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker gives this movie one of the most tragic endings I have ever seen on movie.Must see movie",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
"A Brilliant, dark, creepy film","This film is one of the best serial killer films I've seen. It is a very dark film and it is nearly always raining.. I loved Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt in this, two different characters who seem to get along more and more as the film goes on. Its also nice to see Gwnyeth Paltrow playing the role of Brad Pitts caring loving wife in it. This film is not for the faint hearted as there are gruesome scenes and shocks. The film is about two detectives going after a serial killer who kills his victims based on the seven deadly sins : gluttony, lust, sloth,wrath,greed, pride and envy. It seems pretty simple, but as the film goes on you become more interested in the plot and want to see what treat the killer has left this time. When the killer is revealed is my favourite scene in the movie, you don't see it coming and it's brilliant. After the film had ended, I had so many emotions going through me.

It's always raining in the city,"It is always raining in the city, but people don't seem to mind. At this point, they don't even notice it anymore. It's not ignorance, they are numb. Yet they still deal with it in one way or another. Detective William Somerset puts on his hat and takes his coat while Detective David Mills just faces it with his hair up. He gets in the car, brushes it off and off to work. There is a killer on the loose, his crimes terrible and the clues barely existent.Interestingly enough, there is no mention of what city it is. It could be any big city. Bleak, inescapable, apathetic, sad, miserable, industrial and hopeless. Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is close to retirement and Mills (Brad Pitt) is only just beginning his career. He moved in recently with his wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow). The two are expecting but David doesn't know. And maybe is for the better. In the city, excitement and agony can often become one another. Besides, the murder victims keep piling up. Mills and Somerset arrive at the first scene: an obese man, fed to death found face-down in a bowl of spaghetti. The word ""GLUTTONY"" is written on the wall. Next scene, a defense attorney, killed after forced to cut a pound of flesh from his body. The word ""GREED"" written in blood. Despite the fact that this should be obvious to anyone remotely interested in learning, it is Somerset who first notices these are two of the seven deadly sins. Next up, ""SLOTH"", ""LUST"", ""PRIDE"", ""ENVY"" and ""WRATH"".In aiding his less experienced colleague, Somerset does what most people wouldn't do when faced with such a man--he goes to the library and begins studying anything related with the seven deadly sins. At its center, Dante Alighieri's ""Divine Comedy"". He points out how the killer is preaching, his acts of murder being symbolic punishments for the victims' sins. But they are also pretty ironic. One think that David Fincher never focuses on in his movies is the comedy in various situations. He is a bleak, atmospheric, at times claustrophobic director. But this is for the better. Mills points out how the killer is ""urinating in their (the police) faces"". And I couldn't help but think there is also a sense of superiority, jargon and irony in the killer's work--how on-point and also behind the police is to him. It is, indeed, a ""divine comedy"".But as shocking as the crime scenes are, it is the interactions between Somerset and the Mills family who has the bigger insight--at least until the final scenes. Somerset is a loner, and while he is clearly intelligent and has gone through more than he shows, there are still two times when he opens up. Once, in a bar, when he has a discussion with Mills. Fincher and writer Andrew Kevin Walker had made them with such well-defined and opposing personalities that any contradictions and insightful discussions come naturally. Somerset and Mills discuss about apathy, but they also hint at hypocrisy. Mills, who loves the city life, points out Somerset's superior nature, but Somerset doesn't think any better of himself either. But even more powerful was when Tracy asked Somerset to meet her in secret and told him she is pregnant. Somerset is shocked. Tracy is depressed, she hates the city, she hates the apartment which is often rumbled by the noise of the subway passing and she needs someone to talk to. Somerset sees in her nothing more than what most people feel. The hate for the city, except she simply hadn't numbed herself yet. Like him, but not like David--David loves the city.And while the deep, personal interactions between Somerset and Tracy are setting up the shocking climax, it is when the killer finally reveals himself that the movie really solidifies its place as a masterpiece. ""Se7en"" had such a high build-up that unless the villain is not perfect, the movie collapses. But the villain--John Doe--was perfect and the movie did not collapse. From the point he shows himself he is in complete control. His physical movements--minimal. his voice--methodical, intelligent, evil! His presence--demonic. Yet his message is blunt enough--sinners, let this be a lesson to you! As he goes on about his motives, you cannot help but look at Somerset listening, silent. He makes the sneaky case of not completely disagreeing with Doe. This would be scary if Somerset hadn't been written and built through the entire movie as a paragon--which he is! Are we really all better than criminals, or do we simply--out of either morality, fear of God, or just fear of the law--suppress our darkest thoughts where no one can reach them?I care not for the answer. This movie is great simply because it raises the question. The debate is what will make it linger. And let's remember: Somerset doesn't care about the city, he only stretches his job until he will retire somewhere far away. Like Doe, he knows it's hopeless and that there is ""a deadly sin on every corner"" but it is so common now that there is nothing that can be done about it. It will always rain in the city.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama, Mystery"
