"Creepy, unsettling and very well done.","I'll say right off the bat, I didn't really know who Jordan Peele was coming into this movie. I knew he had a show with Keegan-Michael Key and was a comedian of sorts. What I didn't know was that hiding underneath all that was a genuine fan of classic horror just waiting to get out.Get Out surprised me for a number of reasons. The first is it kept me wondering what exactly was going on. There was just enough there to build atmosphere and tension without giving away the surprise. And it was delivered with such skill and care that It truly unfolded masterfully. You know something is wrong. You know something is up. But you can't quite figure out what it is.And secondly this was the work of a first time director. It's rare that you get a movie written and directed by the same person on their first attempt and they manage to hit it out of the park.And lastly, it gave us something new. This is possibly the best aspect because I am sick to death of cookie cutter horror movies. People nowadays have forgotten that horror doesn't just mean blood and guts. Before directors had to create tension and atmosphere by building the plot and unraveling the story slowly. It's refreshing to see this done with such care.Is it a perfect movie? No it isn't, but it's damn good especially if you're in the mood for a good psychological thriller with horror overtones.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Lives up to the hype,"I decided to see this film at the theater after hearing some of the hype (which was basically that it is an excellent horror film that is told from the perspective of a black man).Well, I can see this would be truly the worst nightmare of a black man (and really the worst nightmare for us all). This is NOT a film that tries to make the viewer feel ""sorry"" for black people, nor is it at all preachy, but it is just a good old fashioned horror film with a fresh new setting. I'm an old white guy by the way.The acting is wonderful, and directing is amazing. The film, while mostly horror, is actually completely hilarious in some parts, making it the funniest AND scariest movie I have seen in ages (no easy feat). It is a shame that the film will likely not be regarded in the company of Academy Award potential nominees, because the directing and acting is honestly Oscar worthy. Again, no small feat for a horror movie that is also funny.In summary, this is a MUST SEE at the theater and one of the best films of the year. It is a fun ride that is very well done!",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A more than welcome yet uneasy visit,"'Get Out' was very highly recommended by a friend, also a fellow film enthusiast, and the subject matter of the film really interested me. Add to that a very promising trailer, the award nominations and wins and mostly positive word of mouth (even with the very vocal detractors), and interest was higher.High expectations were not only met but also exceeded. Apologies for the cliché, but to me that is the best way to sum up my personal experience watching 'Get Out'. Can totally see why it was as well received as it was, though can also see why it has divided audiences on here. While it will never be one of my favourite films, 'Get Out' is among the better films of 2017 and does live up to the hype.It's an incredibly well-made film visually, with stylish and unsettling cinematography and editing and some disturbingly surreal imagery that adds to, and enhances, the unease and sense of dread.That the direction was done by a first-time director is a shock in itself, one of the most outstanding debut directing jobs seen in a long time by me. It's nostalgic in its embracing of contemporary and classic horror and also brave in the accomplished handling of the film's combative themes.Being somebody who considers music important when talking about it, the music looms suitably ominously and fits well. 'Get Out' benefits from an extremely smart and clever script (though 'The Shape of Water' and especially 'Lady Bird' were worthier wins for the Best Original Screenplay Oscar in my view), that takes on a lot of elements and balances them adeptly and the individual elements handled very effectively.Despite how it sounds, 'Get Out' struck me as more of a thriller with horror and comedic elements. It is highly successful on this front, with the thriller elements being taut, suspenseful and unsettling, the comedic ones being darkly funny and clever and the horror ones being imaginatively shocking and subtly uneasy. There is even some social commentary and interracial themes explored, and done thoughtfully and just about avoids preachiness while hitting hard still.While all the performances are very fine, it is Daniel Kaluuya's superb lead performance that burns in the memory the most.My only complaint of 'Get Out' is the too pat and somewhat silly ending that felt tacked on and like it came out of a different film, to me it too ended on a tonally jarring and that's it note.Until then, the film was this close to being a masterpiece. So it was frustrating that it just missed out on that distinction. Nonetheless it's a great film that is among the year's better ones, brought down by an underwhelming ending. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Best debut from a first time director in years,"Let's clear the air about this film. It's not a horror film. It's not a comedy. What it is, is a suspenseful thriller of the highest level, worthy to be compared to Hitchcock caliber. The humor is there, along with a few horror scenes, but not enough to overshadow the main theme of the story. The film hits all cylinders with almost no misfires. As far as complaints that the film is racist, it is not. It would work just as well with an all-black or all-white cast. Those complaints are from people who are uncomfortable with black people or interracial relationships and are letting it distract them from the narrative of the film. I most certainly hope that it reaches the wider audience that it so richly deserves.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Simply put this film is outstanding,"I think it was watching The Last Blair Witch film that I first saw the trailer for this, and while I enjoyed that film, leaving the Cinema it was my memories of Get Out that I left with, I'm so often disappointed by films, having seen wonderful looking trailers, finally a movie that kills of that thinking.Get out ranks as the Cinematic triumph of the year for me, the film was creepy, poignant, amusing, and I think highlighted the racial problems that still exist, in certain places.Daniel Kaluuya is an actor, that sadly I've not paid a huge amount of attention too, I kept asking where do I know him from, a friend pointed out that as a fan of Psychoville I should have known. Kaluuya was outstanding, and I'll certainly be taking an active interest in his career from now on, hopefully awards will follow. Catherine Keener never disappoints, she provided the scene of the film for me, the therapy session, providing a moment of sheer terror.Somehow too dark to be classed as a black comedy, but the satire was definitely apparent. I can't wait to pick up the blu-ray and enjoy it again. I know the ending was changed, I'm assuming with the possibility of a second, I hope they don't, this film deserved to be left alone as a true success.Brilliant, 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A deliciously wry slice of cinematic paranoia served with a side of cathartic humor,"I was totally blown away by ""Get Out"". This is one of the best turns by an actor behind the camera I have ever seen (Jordan Peele). Probably the timely social commentary is going to loom heavily when discussing the film; however this shouldn't conceal the fact that this is a masterclass cinematic work that has been thought out to the very last detail; it knows what it wants to say and how to say it, balancing wildly contrasting tones and defeating potential clichés with stylistic bravura. Of course everything stems from a rock solid script, where the plot points are cunningly engineered, and then fleshed out in a disciplined and take no prisoners kind of way. There is much to admire and enjoy here, including some surreal imagery that is as stunning as it is disturbing, always serving a purpose within the narrative; there are also brilliant soundtrack choices and you get subtle nods at the masters that came before (Kubrick and Wes Craven, specially). The plot involves one of those frequently visited ""fish out of the water"" type of settings where it's up to the director to make the most out of it. Which fortunately is the case here, since you get plenty of real character development and a tight, innuendo ridden dialogue that really gets under your skin. All this, together with the inspired camera work, contributes to the success of this tricky enterprise as a whole. Kudos to all the actors for going all the way with the provocative premise, considering that it could have totally backfired in less confident hands. Everything amounts to a deliciously wry slice of cinematic paranoia served with a side of cathartic humor that appropriately reflects the political times we are living in. And make no mistake, this is a true horror film that refuses to pull any punches; if you thought that Peele was just going for the laughs and the cheap scares you will get more than you bargained for. ""Get out"" will shock you silly and will make you think. Then you will want to watch it again and try to figure out how he pulled the trick.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I think all the positive reviews made my expectations skyrocket,"Get Out Directed by Jordan Peele is a horror film which begins with quite a unique story, surrounding an African American man meeting his girlfriend's Caucasian family. The first two acts of the film contain scenes which build so much tension. The start of this movie had me so invested due to how much was unknown. I really built strong curiosity surrounding why things seemed very off. All the performances were great, particularly the main character who was incredibly convincing with all his emotion. Also the cinematography was very nice, containing scenes which are one long take with no cuts. As for negatives there are quite a few. The tone of this film is very messy. I wished the horror really got under my skin. Although it was as if there were constant intermissions with cliche comedic relief. To me this broke all the tension, and really made me question the type of film I was watching. There are also quite a few plot holes, and scenes which really don't have any purpose besides trying to freak out the audience. Once the film reaches the third act, I was really let down by the direction they took. I was expecting a smart and unique revelation. But all I got was a standard messed up horror movie ""twist"". I think all the positive reviews made my expectations skyrocket. I really thought this movie would be insanely smart, but honestly it's really not that special. It didn't impact me the way other great horror and thriller films have. It's a solid and enjoyable film. But it's far from groundbreaking, so therefore I give Get Out a 6. I feel like many will disagree with my rating. If you think you can convince me as to why it is great go ahead. One thing I still don't see is why African Americans were targeted in the film. When it was asked the question was just brushed off...",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
director Peele takes you on a different kind of journey,"A unique and effective blend of horror film and social commentary if there ever was one! Young, modest black photographer Chris Washington is understandably nervous about going to spend the weekend with the parents of his sweet white girlfriend Rose Armitage, who for reasons totally unbeknownst to him has yet to tell her parents that he's black. They set out on their trip and...well the rest is really left for the viewer to discover. Writer-director Jordan Peele shows his master craftsmanship by taking this simple premise and expanding it in many different directions, also incorporating elements of racism, comedy, shock and awe, and wisely never taking things too seriously. The climax is a bit formulaic and over-the-top, but the journey is effectively unnerving and features much stronger acting than you would expect for a film of this genre. Not for everyone, but refreshingly unconventional and worth the viewing experience. ***",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Smart genre mingling effort.,"As you may guess from the submission date, I'm reviewing ""Get Out"" several months after its cinematic release. Unfortunately, the months of glowing notices have generated an anticipation in me, which no film could possibly have lived up to.This is not to say that it's not good. Jordan Peele directs well, but it's his writing that is one of the core strengths of the picture. There is such depth to it the screenplay, not only with its allegories and metaphors, but also with subtle foreshadowing and lines with multiple meanings. There are many layers to be ""unpeeled"" (pun intended) on repeat viewings.The other strength is Daniel Kaluuya. A regular face on UK TV for a while now and with a few smaller roles in Hollywood productions, Kaluuya is brilliant and this should be a career-making performance.So, what doesn't work as well? Essentially, it's the films third act. I try to write my reviews without spoilers and I will here, but the film takes a leap into science fiction towards the end that stretches your willingness to go along with it. It's an idea that make sense figuratively but not literally. Also, Chris transitions a little too far into action hero territory, given that there's been nothing to justify that, save some talk about Judo lessons.Provided you're not anticipating horror in the traditional sense, ""Get Out"" is a smart genre mingling effort. Not perfect, but certainly not bad for a debut film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Black & White but Far From Monochrome...,"Satire doesn't get much darker than this, a perspective derived from the opposite of bliss, the frictions and prejudice society draws, to control and manipulate, exploit and ignore.What would you do, if someone took control of you, could control you're every move, set the tempo to your groove, had the first and final say, how you went about your day, chose the things that you would do, when and where, with what, with who.

Didn't live up to hype.,Went to watch this film after hearing good things about it and seeing the overwhelmingly good reviews on IMDb and rotten tomatoes. But unfortunately I am severally unimpressed. Whilst the film was ok it did not live up to the hype. The plot was predictable and transparent. And for labeling itself as a horror it wasn't scary at all. Though I understand that it's trying to make a point and I feel it does this very well since it's influenced so many people. But overall I would say this film is average and I would much rather reccomend my friends something else.,5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A breath of fresh air,"Jordan Peele's strong directorial debut got well deserved Oscar attention, as it's unique, intelligent, and often times subtle storytelling made for a well layered, suspenseful film experience.It is hard to say one actor out of the supporting roles stuck out as they all performed so well, but Daniel Kaluuya in the lead role as Chris was superb. His usage of facial expression and body language played so well to his character, and in a movie with plenty of good qualities about it he shines.Jordan Peele also uses a lot of subtle imagery that contributes well to the themes and tone of his story, which is notably impressive especially for a first time director and make for rewarding second, third and maybe even more repeat viewings.This movie is not without faults however, as there is a handful of times where characters inexplicably act strange seemingly just for the audience, and like most horror movies coming out recently it has it's pointless, shrill music stabs to emphasize a silly jump scare.Despite it's faults, I would still highly recommend this one to anyone looking for an intriguing story.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Thriller seen from fresh eyes,"Fantastic! I would not call it ""horror"" but certainly ""thriller"" with some comedy thrown into it. This Jordan Peele fellow has managed to bring something new to this genre and I certainly hope he'll do more thrillers.The cast is great and I especially enjoyed Betty Gabriels performance. Lots of faces I have never seen before and they all did a stellar job. And those faces I have seen before did a stellar job, too. =)I do not know if the overall idea is new but the way it was presented and the way it was done feels very fresh.Warmly recommended!",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A rare triple-threat genre film,"Horror tension, mystery tension and racial tension blend together into a gripping and formidable nail-biter in ""Get Out,"" the astonishing directorial debut of Jordan Peele. The former half of the comedy duo ""Key & Peele"" has found a way to both honor and subvert the thriller and horror genres in a way that's unmistakably modern.In the tradition of ""The Stepford Wives"" with the twist of ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?,"" the story follows a young black man named Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) who goes to meet his girlfriend, Rose's (Allison Williams) parents at their fancy estate where things go from slightly uncomfortable in terms of Chris being black to deeply messed up in one slow but inevitable fell swoop.With a creepy opening scene showing a different black man getting abducted in a peaceful-seeming suburb, the tone is set immediately that there's cause for concern. Luckily for Chris, Rose is really sensitive to issues of race and prejudice, and even when her parents (Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener) or brother (Caleb Landry Jones) seem to make Chris' blackness into a thing, the two handle it as best as any interracial couple could. The warning signs come in the form of the Armitage family's black help, maid Georgina (Betty Gabriel) and groundskeeper Walter (Marcus Henderson), whose behavior is anything but normal.Peele sets a tone of creepiness largely with the help of composer Michael Abels, also making his feature film debut. The unpredictable nature of Georgina and Walter as characters, the ever-increasing suspicion of all the white characters and the way Peele keeps you nervous about who or what is just outside the frame fuel the fear and paranoia as well as if not better than any horror movie featuring more overtly malevolent forces does.Kaluuya, in a role that will deservedly put him on the map, gives a performance that will connect with viewers who identify with Chris as a man trying to feel comfortable while out of his element experiencing strange things, and those who truly understand Chris' experience as a man of color undergoing the very same events. It would be fascinating to know the different ways a black viewer would experience the film compared to a white one, but the most important thing is that everyone will identify with and feel for Chris.When a little horror film debut like this one gets talents such as Whitford, Keener and Williams, you know the script is good. Peele keeps up the air of mystery a long time even without packing in very many unexpected twists. The awareness of something being wrong but not quite understanding what it going on or why despite getting new information is a real strength of Peele's writing. Then of course there's the brilliant ways that race and the black experience make it into the film. If that weren't enough, Chris' best friend (LilRel Howry) provides comic relief in a way that's stereotypical, yet Peele uses him in unexpected ways. So we get to benefit from Peele's nose for comedy as well.Not everything adds up by the end of ""Get Out,"" but the film plays out in extremely satisfying fashion. Fans of horror and fans of thrillers who don't mind horror when it's done well should both enjoy the technique and experience. It provides thrills of the pulse-pounding, thrill-seeking and thought-provoking variety and few genre films can say the same.~Steven CThanks for reading!

"Delivering both on the expectations of the genre and the comedic expectations of a Jordan Peele creation, GET OUT is simply amazing.","Jordan Peele's directorial debut is an exhilarating horror thriller that also manages to spark laughter and comment on social issues. The cinematography, tropes, and soundtrack echo horror, but the film finds abundant moments of comic relief like when a father reassures the main character he isn't racist by claiming, ""I would have voted for Obama for a third term."" Before the plot delves into a traditional horror frenzy, it mines the horrors of racism. The social commentary plays on audience expectations and results in both humor and suspense.

Missed opportunity,"I'm confused by this film, and after the hype I truly expected a lot more.Two lovers; a white woman and a black man go to visit the womans family, at their mansion where everything is a little unusual and slightly tense. The family have black servants, reminiscent of plantations of yesteryear, and they all act possessed.I didn't like any of the characters except Chris, who was brilliant, underplayed his role and was a genuinely likable character. Only he and his friend Rod, who was pretty damned funny, were the only good characters here.It had some quite creepy moments, but they were too few and far between, and some of the dialog was so cringe worthy I actually gave up on the film initially.What it could have had, if the plot been more plausible, is potentially a Jacobs Ladder/The Shining horror type quality. Mixing comedy with horror is no easy task. It isn't as funny or as frightening as say 'An American Werewolf in London', in fact, it's pretty mediocre on all levels.I very generously give this film a 6.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Cleverly written with an eerie twist,"This movie is appropriately in a genre Mr. Jordan Peele has christened, ""Social Thriller"". The movie creates a very unsettling feeling from the beginning that slowly builds to a crescendo, that forces the viewer to see prejudices head on. When all is said and done, you now have kind of a bird's eye view of what is wrong with society. But besides that, it hints a Hitchcock-type of thrill that is sure to deliver Goosebumps.

Nothing is as it seems,"I've just finished watching ""Get out"" at the crack of noon in 2025 and I've got much to say. I'll start by saying that it is a thriller/horror movie that lasts 1h 44min released in 2017. It is the story of a black man in a relationship with a white girl whose family seems apparently strange towards him. Antipathy? Racism? The usual and banal plot we all know already the ending?Given that I hadn't watched any of Jordan Peele's movies, I didn't know anything about either the presumable themes or his cinematic style. The first impression I felt was the undefined genre of film I was going to see. I mean, it could be both a romantic and adventurous story and a crime and horror one. The director played with my mind making me think of various endings throughout all the film. Moreover it's ambiguous the main theme too: you get to know the message of the film only quite at the end of it. Another particular thing is that it made me lose the perception of time, since the film is supported by an alternate rhythm of tension and ease.However, despite the movie started in a good way, expectations collapsed in the end. In fact, there is an interesting plot and an enjoyable net of the characters. The issue arises as the plot become unmanageable, deviating in massacre with exaggerated blood, useless scenes and unexplainable facts and coincidences.It's a shame that the film concluded as not as its refined and alienating introduction and development, though its convincing and original acting of each of the characters.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Starts well, becomes ridiculous two-thirds in","I liked the idea and how Peele creates suspense in some scenes. However, the movie progressively descends into ridiculousness and becomes downright predictable.I had the same feeling when I watched ""Us"" by the same director. In that case, the ridiculousness started even earlier and was probably even more disappointing, given that the beginning was stellar.As a non-American who is well-versed in American politics and social issues, it is difficult to shed the feeling that Peele's movies are lauded by many only because they are evaluated through the prism of ""anti-racism"", ""finally a Black author in Hollywood"", etc, not to mention the reverse racism that is not even subtle in many scenes.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

To all who regard the movie as racist - I don't think so. Any modern day theme be it racism, sexism, disability issues anything can be used in this movie to highhight the issues being faced by individuals. It is for most part a unique genre in its own right.

A horror comedy without jokes,the newest film made by jordan peele lives out to the hype that it made.horror comedy is one of the hardest genres(or sub genres) to make a movie about.some good examples would be evil dead 2 and scream.the film actually takes a subject like racism and makes it into a parody of itself.the comedy of the movie is actually really subtle and your'e not gonna walk into the movie and start laughing as a joke comes along.its a realization that can be made while watching the film or after you watched it.it can't be really called a satire of horror movies because it uses the horror movie clichés more than once but the good part is that i doesn't annoy you like a lot of horror movies do.one of the strengths of the movie is that you don't need to be an American to understand the story.a basic knowledge about racism will be enough.but for the clues and metaphors that are in the movie you need to pay more attention and know a little bit more.there are no jokes in the movie and even the comedy relief character lil rel howery doesn't make jokes but sells its comedy by his performance which makes him actually funny and not just an annoying side character like we see mostly in the movies right now.the performances are great and the character choices are rational and logical unlike most horror movies we see today.allison williams does a pretty good job and actually nails the character far more better than i expected.the cinematography is pretty good but it got distracting in two or three places of the movie but it wasn't boring and actually kept the movie pretty good looking.the twists of the movie will actually kinda predictable but that wasn't what the movie was about and i didn't expected to be shocked since the movie doesn't take itself to seriously but serious enough to keep the plot going.the CGI blood were kinda distracting and the movie got slow in a few places but it had the pay-off and you were rewarded after the scenes.the movie is well made and deserves a second viewing in some time and i would recommend it to horror fans or if your'e a fan of subtle humor and comedy.,8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"An Unexpectedly Well Written ""Modern"" Horror Story","First and foremost, kudos to Jordan Peele. Never in all my years would I have expected horror/drama so well written from a comedian. While the story does have its comedic aspects, it is well balanced with thrills, spooks, and mature storytelling with a very interesting and twisted plot.As you may be well aware, when it comes to the horror genre, minorities are grossly misrepresented. Get Out, I believe, has been the first horror movie to achieve this level of critical acclamation with a black starring role. Now, I'm not basing the quality of the movie on the fact that the protagonist is a minority, but am only calling to attention the rarity of this type of direction. I feel like this movie opens a door of a genre in which minorities are atypical.The concept/plot of the movie is different -- the good kind of different. You are lead to believe one thing and the movie elegantly slaps you in the face with a twist. This family is spooky as hell, and they are in a league of their own. While the movie does have a racial focal point, it's no disadvantage to the movie's storytelling, rather adds a level of spookiness to the reality that, no matter what your race, you can find yourself confronting the same horrors as anyone else. This movie does seem to portray a certain allusion to slave trades and whatnot, will admit, but that's not inherently a bad thing, unless you're one of those people that think blacks being victimized by whites can only be political correctness. I actually recall many lambasting this movie as one that makes whites seem like egregious, conniving devils, but when watching the movie it seemed to me, a white guy, a representation of particular crazy individuals, and not at all representative or demeaning of the entire white race like some have commentated.Aside from the concept, the characters in the movie are so naturally acted and convey their roles with excellent direction.This movie is no Keanu. Prepare yourself for an actual horror film, not a Scary Movie 3. This movie implements horror and comedy so well that one facet does not impend on the other and everything flows like a well though put story should.This movie was a great watch. It delivers a level of creepiness, complemented with a unique and creative concept and elements of ""black"" humor.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Sick Movie,"Sick movie, Sick sound track. The music contradicts the circumstances in the early scenes perfectly. Everything seems cool, but you as the audience know there is something fishy going on. You can't put your finger on it just yet and neither can the protagonist, you feel his frustration building as he fails to explain the incongruencies to his girlfriend. He wants to ""get out"", but he has to go through this if he wants the relationship to progress. The internal struggle is real, and when sh*t gets too real (when more knowledge comes to light) it's too late for our friendly protagonist.The way he gets sunk in (sunken) to all the non sense is pretty original, the scene that visualised what was going on in the characters mind was excellent, as he falls deeper and deeper and his vision of reality slips away. On the edge of your seat the whole way. The acting is excellent from all members of the cast. The movie fulfils its thriller genre, but also delivers some 10 out of 10 comedy moments.

We objected to its constant referral as a horror film - it's an effective thriller with mild horror elements - but it is not a gore/slasher movie - this is more about getting under the skin, and inside the mind, of the viewer.The plot is simple: girlfriend takes boyfriend home.

So much better than your average horror movie.,"The big surprise break-out hit of 2017, ""Get Out"" has received a lot of critical acclaim and still should be considered to be an underrated movie; that's how good it is. The movie does not necessarily use the most original concept (we have seen similar things with ""Rosemary's Baby"" or ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" before), but the movie mainly benefits from its clever storytelling - because sometimes it's not about which story you are trying to tell, sometimes it's about how you are trying to tell it.The brilliant actors (Allison Williams was surprisingly good, Catherine Keener and Bradley Whitford were as good as was to be expected, and boy, was Daniel Kaluuya amazing) added to the film's success, as well as its better-than-brilliant directing. Jordan Peele easily deserves an Academy Award nomination for his work as an director; and it's easy to see how much effort and lifeblood flew into the making of this movie. ""Get Out"" is a horror movie, but not necessarily a horror movie in the original sense of the word; you won't find much blood, just as you won't find many jump scares - in this movie, it's all about the tension, meaningful dialogues, more tension, tension, tension. And it's incredibly well done. Not a single scene has been wasted, every little aspect of the movie has a purpose, and ultimately, that's what movies should be about: telling a story with so much love for its details that a viewer can simply sink into the movie and forget what's happening around him. Jordan Peele has already mastered this art in his directing debut.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
An ingenious genre film hiding a wicked sense of humor and a trenchant commentary,"GET OUT was the most satisfying movie going experience I've had in a long time. It delivers brilliantly and viscerally in just the way that you want a paranoid horror thriller to but it also raises some topical questions within its horror conventions without undermining the fun and thrills. Jordan Peele definitely has a career ahead of him as a writer/director with a clever approach and a singular voice and vision when it comes to genre material.The actors are uniformly excellent. Daniel Kaluuya is crucial to establishing the reality of the situation; he never overplays his character and you never catch him acting. Allison Williams is a pleasant surprise. I'd only known her from GIRLS and she shows a whole new potential here. LaKeith Stansfield is a star in the making; it's just that simple. Everything I see him in, he is impressive. The rest of the cast consists of some of the most reliable character actors working today, including a personal favorite: Stephen Root in a VERY surprising role.GET OUT will be a future classic. You won't regret seeing it. It has several levels and it works smartly on all of them.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Topical Horror Done Right,"Peele's debut Get Out is a far cry from his stand up and Key and Peele days, channeling the goriness, witty plot hints, and over the top evil from classic horror flicks of the 80s.

The characters felt one-dimensional, and I found myself checking my phone halfway through 'cause it was lowkey boring. The pacing was so slow, and by the time it ended, I was like... that's it?

Peele proves his versatility in 'Get Out',"In 2017, Jordan Peele proved he's not a one-trick pony when it comes to his career. When not playing all kinds of various characters on his Comedy Central series 'Key & Peele,' he lately has starred in mostly lower-tiered comedy movies. Then came 'Get Out' - Universal and Blumhouse's terrifying psychological thriller that was written and directed by Peele. The film follows the story of a young couple who happen to be mixed race (Daniel Kaluuya as ""Chris"" and Allison Williams as ""Rose"") who take a weekend trip to visit her parents' estate in the country.What's expected about 'Get Out' is the major emphasis on race, as Rose's family (and extended family) is virtually entirely white, and their two hired support staff, Georgina and Walter (Betty Gabriel and Marcus Henderson), are black. As Chris begins to learn more about his girlfriend's family as he spends more time with them, he realizes things are not exactly what meets the eye. While some films mishandle the issue of race relations, 'Get Out' is written in a way that seems fair and doesn't spend too much time on stereotypes. But make no mistake - there is a lot more at play than race in this film.The themes of guilt and regret have a central role in 'Get Out,' including references to characters' pasts (especially with regard to Chris and his upbringing). What helps these feel authentic is the excellent character development and acting performances, not only by newcomers Kaluuya and Williams, but veteran actors Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener are standouts as Rose's parents. They are complicated individuals and things become clearer as the film progresses, but they never lose their edge as we drift into ""the sunken place."" And then there's LilRel Howery, who portrays Chris' TSA agent friend Rod Williams. Rod's character is definitely the film's attempt at comic relief - and for the most part, he delivers without making things seem too cheesy or out of place.The only issue with 'Get Out' is the final third of the film, which seems to follow a typical formula. Despite the adrenaline rush that results, there are flashes of a ""seen it before"" feeling in some of the final moments. Even so, this does not really take away from the overall effort.Based on the runaway success of 'Get Out,' it's likely Jordan Peele has a future in directing and writing rather than just offering up laughs.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The first half does a good job of setting the stage and gets you thinking ""ok what the hell is going on here"" which is exactly what the main actor is going through - well played.As for the racial bias against whites - as a white male i'm not feeling it on this. If you watch the movie to completion this goes way beyond mere racism, and more into sick sci-fi. That said the build up to this point is full of comedic racial tension that all but the most grumpy white and black folks can laugh at.

Perfect Horror Movie,"Ignore the 1-2 star reviews. The 5-6's are valid - some people don't like horror, and that's cool.

The ironic thing is that this is more an indictment of the ""enlightened"" liberal.BUT that really isn't what makes this movie good. It is the quintessential ""good horror movie,"" as opposed to the ""good movie"" that happens to be horror (for instance, Silence of the Lambs, Psycho, or even movies like Babadook or Black Swan.) Instead of attempting the drama-as-horror or serious sociopolitical allegory, this is classic horror, done as well as it's ever been done. It embraces the hallmarks of the genre without being submerged by them, adhering to the classic formula close enough to avoid the ""mystery"" label.

A Very Pleasant Surprise Indeed!,"Finally, after hearing all the talk and reading tons of reviews, my wife and I set out to see Get Out. Neither one of us despite being very big movie fans consider ourselves to be lovers of horror films but I must say that we were both pleasantly surprised by Jordan Peele's first movie out of the gate. The story itself was solid and suspenseful the acting was second to none and despite being just a tad long in laying the initial groundwork when the characters initially arrive at the parent's home the story pulled together in a very timely fashion. The supporting cast was great and the interjection of comic relief was timely and funny. The horror moments were just that horrific.The story line kept me guessing just long enough to figure what nefarious deeds were happening behind the scenes. The social message and the intertwining within the story itself were illuminative and gave way to a deeper meaning. Hands down Get Out did not disappoint and delivered in a way I have not seen when it comes to horror films and that's saying a lot from someone who doesn't consider himself a horror fan.

Spoiler Free Review: Get Out,"This is, hands down the first masterpiece of 2017. It is definitely not a masterpiece of horror because it isn't a horror movie. It is a thriller with bits of brilliant comedy infused in. This film has a very important message on race and it really speaks on race as it is still a very serious problem in America. But beyond the very relevant themes, how is it as a movie? It is flawless. If you are looking for a great thriller this is the film for you. The performances are all around incredible but the most impressive aspect hands down is Jordan Peele's writing and direction. His vision is very well realized and it's obvious that the studio really didn't give him much interference which is a very good thing because his vision was the best. Seeing how serious he took this project really makes me excited to see what he can do in the future. I won't spoil anything, but the ending, and the twist, is pure perfection.

"Jordan Peele's Directorial Debut ""Get Out"" Is an Unprecedented Shock","Many a cinephile might have lost all interest and hope in contemporary American films in recent years, but it turns out they might have just been looking at the wrong places. As the award-winning films of the country have become duller and duller, packed in a stale, tight corset, the most interesting auteurs have found their way in popular genre films which do not resonate that well with the businessmen who give out awards but which strike a deep chord with the general public. Long- time comedian, Jordan Peele's directorial debut ""Get Out"" (2017) is a perfect example, and it has already garnered well-deserved critical praise in France. Alongside the Safdies' ""Good Time"" (2017), another genre film which might go over the heads of the critics and award-givers who are used to the stale flow, ""Get Out"" is definitely among the best American films of the year. It should be seen by everyone not only for its social significance but also for its cinematic freshness.An African-American photographer, Chris (played by Daniel Kaluuya) travels to his white girlfriend Rose's (played by Allison Williams) parents to visit them for the first time at their secluded estate somewhere in up-north countryside. The friendly atmosphere of this mundane meeting starts to crack and reveal something more sinister beneath the surface.The basic set-up of the plot echoes the classic civil rights era film, Stanley Kramer's ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" (1967) where a white woman introduces her African-American boyfriend to her liberal parents whose tolerance begins to show its limitations. Peele cleverly uses this inter-text as a backdrop, giving an undertone for the main theme, but essentially develops his film into something utterly original. Many spectators will leave the film with the thought that they have never seen anything like this. Never have the monsters of horror films felt so abstract and so concrete at the same time.Peele is able to derive from his comedy-background the ability to build up tension in a fashion which often borders the line of humor without directing the spectator to laughs but rather to flinches in terror. Although ""Get Out"" does not come across as a self-aware meta-film dealing with the genre of horror like ""It Follows"" (2014), Peele's film does have a self-awareness to it which, however, never interrupts a scene or the development of suspense. Peele might use genre conventions with an ironic twinkle in his eye, but they are never subjected to any comprehensively genre-critical discourse. On the contrary, the self-aware genre conventions enhance the deeply felt structure of the film whose narrative power pushes the spectators tightly into their seats.""Get Out"" begins with a serene shot of a wealthy American suburb where an African-American man is ambling, looking for the right street. This image in itself, mundane as its setting may be, already invokes feelings of horror because we have heard of so many stories where black men end up dead in innocent places such as these. It sets up an impressive and frightening sensation of not being welcomed which characterizes the film throughout. Peele's structured and disciplined mise-en-scène of precise compositions beautifully articulates and exemplifies the impression of a seemingly ""post-racial"" society where everything seems to be in order, but which conceals secrets underneath.Overall, Peele's ""Get Out"" is a real cinematic treat and most likely will acquire a following. Whether the film skyrockets Peele to cinematic success or not will remain to be seen, for it is always the second film which shows if the director's first hit was just a stroke of luck. Yours truly is very confident -- as well as interested and hopeful for the future of contemporary American cinema.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Good for a horror movie post 2000's,"Get Out is a decent horror movie, better than average, but not without its set backs.
It absolutely didn't deserve an oscar, let alone for screenplay, but it's not the worst choice in the world at the end of the day.
For a debut film this is pretty admirable and could mean a lot for horror movies, black people and the general film industry, but aside from the politics of the film, it really is just an ok horror.The VVitch and It Follows are much, much better horror films; deserving of much more praise, but because THIS horror film has a discussion about race it gets millions of dollars and awards and praise. Is this a bad thing?Not really. It's better than giving an award to something like another shat out Blumhouse/James Wan sequel with no talent or effort put into it.Basically, the best thing about the film is the actors and their performances, especially Daniel Kaluuya, who is as excellent as always.The worst thing about the film would probably have to be the ""horror"" elements since it's incredibly one- note and unoriginal in this department. Not saying it's bad, but it doesn't do anything the horror genre hasn't seen a bunch of times already.It's good, not great.

It also has a number of good laughs in it, so it's bending a few genre conventions here, methinks. It's an entertaining genre film, but it also has some social commentary in it too, so it works on more than one level.All the performances are strong, but Daniel Kaluuya is particularly effective playing a boyfriend caught up in a scenario that isn't entirely what it appears to be on the surface. Catherine Keener is also very memorable in this one, playing a mom who might be more than just a typical nurturing mother. But there's more than one memorable performance in this movie; the entire cast is very good.Anyway, thumbs up from me.

Suspenseful & witty horror flick about racial stereotypes,"GET OUT is the story of how a black guy—Chris, played by the marvellous Daniel Kaluuya—and his white girl-friend visit her parent's mansion at the countryside. At first sight, his girl-friend's parents seem just fine with Chris being black. But he soon discovers that something is off. The black ""servants"" at the mansion are behaving oddly, as if brainwashed. And as he digs deeper, more secrets about hist girl-friend's family are being revealed.GET OUT is witty as hell. It deals with racial stereotypes in a funny way, turning them outward and explicit by making racial divides within the US the premise of a horror movie. The script is spot-on, with just enough jokes to keep you laughing, just enough racial subtext to make it cringe-worthy, and just enough seriousness so as to not destroy the suspense. And it is there where GET OUT excels: In many movies, suspense and comedy are mutually exclusive. Not here! GET OUT manages to keep both up and going till the very end.Mix into this great performances (both on the protagonist and the villain's side), good cinematography, some fun play with US accents, self-awareness of and commentary on horror movie tropes ... perfected with a dash of violence and gore ... and you'll end up with something that's truly unique, managing to deliver many complex emotions simultaneously while still just being outright fun.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Provocative Yet Funny Take on Traditional Horror,"Jordan Peele's directorial debut is a smash hit. A great take on the horror genre with enough comic satiric material to keep you on the edge of you seat both in terror and abdominal pain. The movie tackles the always complex and divisive theme of race, but it passes the test with flying colors not coming off offensive by any standards. All politics aside the movie is a pure joy to watch. From the simplicity of its shot design to the fool proof way it is directed. The movie is truly remarkable considering that this is Jordan Peele's first movie. Having said this I do think the movie has been garnering exaggerated praise. The movie is a really fun watch but that's about it. For a movie with a 99% (as of today) on RT i found it rather dull and lacking in substance. What it lacks in substance it more than makes up for in style. The movie creates situations that should be frightening but my reaction is laughter. And that's directly the focal point of the man behind the camera and his humor. Regardless the movie builds up to an impressive third act where the funny just leaves and here is where the horror in this movie truly shines. Regardless if I had to compare this movie with A Cure for Wellness (both original horror movies) I would tell you the following. If you love film, composition, and direction see A Cure for Wellness. But If you wanna see a horror film with your friends and just have a good time, well Get Out is your flick.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Massively over hyped,"This movie received incredible reviews at the time of release and so I watched it with great anticipation. However I was hugely disappointed. It is nothing more than a run of the mill horror with a nasty, thinly veiled message beneath it that all white people are racists. Whilst the premise is interesting, it is played like it's either a pastiche or an Am Dram production with a hint of Hammer Horror. The plot has no surprises and by half way through it is very boring. Peel infuses his movies with thinly veiled racism and an distasteful aroma of 'I'm cleverer than you'. Get out is an average film at best. However it is a monumental piece of art compared to his next outing 'Us' which is without doubt the worst film ever made. And I've seen Sharknado.",3.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Masterfully done Independent film,"""A mind is a terrible thing to waste."" Of course we have all heard this one and brushed it off as just another whimsical, inconsequential, cliche tossed around in the maze of social interaction, but there is whole new depth brought to this phrase by Jordan Peele's independent Horror film ""Get out""
 We are met in the film by Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) discussing with his girlfriend Rose (Allison Williams); the plans for the weekend stay at his girlfriend's family estate. Immediately the issue of race is involved when Chris asks ""Do they know I'm black?"", which is met with the reassurance of Rose that this won't be an issue. When at the estate, there is nothing intrinsically wrong, but at the same time everything has an odd sense to it. Our nerves are settled with the line ""I would have voted for Obama a third time if I could"", delivered by Rose's father, but our intention is immediately recaptured by the oddity of the groundskeeper trimming the grass with a old school rotary lawn mower. This is completely intentional, and complete genius by Peele, as no other emphasis is put on that mower, but it all gets explained after the big reveal. However, in the time it is just playing into the motif of the horror film.
 This Horror film offers much more than your typical jump scare, and tantalising suspense (though it does those well too). This movie contains layers upon layers of social and racial intentions and stereotypes; but again it portrays these in a rather unusual and original manner. This film takes every right wing social stereotype and completely flips them on its head. Not a single scene nor character in this movie is wasted, they all have a purpose and play an integral part in the storyline, with some playing even double and triple subliminal rolls, unbenounced to the viewer.
 The movie is quick to portray the typical white cop racially profiling a black man, stereotype, but Rose, quick to interject as the hero, intervening and standing up for her boyfriend in the face of the oppressive white cop. At least this is what is shown, and is expected to be interpreted from the scene. Ultimilty it is the viewer that is the one being played a fool, by some tricky double acting, with everything building up to the main reveal. 
 Many family stories and tid bits are shared with Chris, aimed to be portrayed as the awkward stage of meeting someone new and inviting them into your home, but as the pieces fall into place, these interesting tales turn into rather disturbing hints. 
 It isn't until the first night of Chris's stay that the viewer finally gets the first inklings to the threat surrounding Chris. Peele sets this reveal up so brilliantly that even though he is shouting the answers to the viewer, letting everyone know the truth to what is going on; the viewer is not fully convinced, and is still unaware of the intimate danger (or at least I still was). It is all explained and covered up by the answers provided to us by the scene, about Chris's mother and the nightmares he battles from the night she died.
 The subliminal hints dropped through the entirety of the film are perfectly disguised within the context of the film, as to not give too much away before the big reveal. Going into and throughout the course of movie, I was expecting an overtly racist, and simplistic storyline with an intriguing aspect of horror. What I got was entirely different, and masterfully intertwined with the social complexities that exist with minority groups. Rather than taking the typical approach and portraying the racism as a right wing, blatantly racist film, Peele went the other way entirely and portrayed the racism rather as an oversensitive ignorance, amongst left wing elitists. You know, the kind that say they would vote for Obama for a third term, but in reality don't have any sustainable, tangible relations with any black people.
 Peele, through angles, lighting, and mise en scene, is able produce discomfort in scenes, that is not reliant to the racial innuendos. Rather, the racial insinuations add more depth to the awkwardness and tie in to the full reveal. The characters still manage to come across offensive and itmindating, without overtly ruining the mystique of the movie by coming across overly aggressive. 
 This film keeps you on the edge of your seat for the entire 104 minutes, with endarounds, double acting, and overlooked social layers. For an introductory independent film Peele displayed mastery of crucial aspects in the film industry allowing an entire audience to relate with Chris's discomfort even if the racial and political aspects fly over your head. Peele uses a complex shot combining both birds eye view, and worms eye view into one scene, really to drive home the point, while still managing to hide the big reveal. Suspense build throughout the movie with Chris's growing paranoia. The framing is excellent. There are aspects of omniscient perspective, where the viewer knows what's about to happen but the character doesn't. It all meshes perfectly and fluently. Showing the viewer just enough in any one scene, and then completely changing the topic to make them forget what they just saw. (I.E. the lawn mower is just one example of this.)

An entertaining but predictable horror spoof mixed with clever racial satire.,"You know we are in a post-Oscars movie slump when a satire horror like Get Out (2017) can generate global praise for bravely cutting new ground in film. The truth is: it does not. What it does is satirise the political correctness of a white majority that expresses racial tolerance but harbours malice for those who are different. Set aside that message and you are left with a well-paced, well- acted but predictable horror film that preys on white guilt and coloured fear.The storyline is clear-cut and entirely consistent with the standard tropes of zombie-like horrors. Cool black photographer Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) and his gorgeous wide-smiling girlfriend Rose Armitage (Allison Williams) have been dating seriously for a few months when Rose arranges a weekend to meet the parents. She insists that it is not worth mentioning that Chris is a black dude as her neurosurgeon father Dean and psychiatric hypnotherapist mother Missy are so liberally non-racist that ""they would have voted for a third Obama term"". Driving onto the sprawling grounds of her parent's home Chris notices a black gardener with a weird smile who stares vacantly. The camera cuts to Chris's face and we know immediately what he is thinking. After an effusively over-friendly greeting by the parents at the front doorstep, Chris sees a black housemaid with the same weirdly vacant stare. After an awkwardly polite dinner where Chris is subjected to the usual new-boyfriend interrogation, Missy tricks him into being placed in a hypnotic state that renders him controllable by the tinkling of a spoon in a teacup. From here on, the story shows Chris increasingly entrapped by the family until he realises his life is in danger and that he must 'get out'.From the minute that Chris sees the look on the gardener's face most of the script is laid bare. If that does not sufficiently telegraph the narrative arc that lies ahead, the dinner with the parents make the trap and its dangers obvious. The story pivots on the plausibility of a tinkling teacup making Chris comatose and the duplicity of his girlfriend as the collector of fine black human specimens for neuro-transplant purposes. But of course, in the horror genre there are no boundaries for plausibility and no limits to the gory ways of ending someone's life. While the plot's weirdness requires suspension of disbelief, the casting and acting is excellent and delivers entertainment value for horror audience's money. Although words like original do not suit this film, it is tightly directed and holds enough twisted surprises to keep viewers engaged as it cruises to its entertainingly blood-filled climax.Some of the over-hyped publicity surrounding this film dwells more on its racial message than its merits as a horror film. Indeed, some are even calling it a landmark in socially progressive film. For this to pass any plausibility test, we must be prepared to imagine that the most vocal middle-class supporters of racial equality in contemporary society are most likely the ones that, subliminally at least, harbour the most evil intentions towards coloured minorities. This would be a regressive exploitation of a complex social issue that, in this writer's view, is not what this film is about. It's just an entertaining horror spoof mixed with clever racial satire that is filling cinemas while we wait for the next round of Oscar nominated movies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Not Bad: Good and Creative Story, Suspense Somewhat Ruined by Trailer.","With the large advertising budget, there's a good chance you've seen the trailer, and there's also a good chance you just saw the IMDb trailer, but I need to preface that the best viewing experience will be found if you know nothing about the story beforehand. (I will not talk about any specific events or characters in the movie.)Story: 'Get Out' is a great 'journey-type' horror movie that is most strong and reliant on its tone and build-up. The movie is very good in these aspects, and makes the whole narrative well-done overall because of it, even withstanding a weaker ending in my opinion. But that will happen with a lot of the aforementioned 'journey-type' horror movies. Essentially things build-up and build-up to a certain point, and the ending releases everything. Regardless of what the ending is like, that journey is what holds the primary value. (Ex. The Shining (1980), The Witch (2016).) In that sense, I will leave off saying in watching this movie for its story, it's good but not great.Cinematography: Scenery and sets are really well-shot in this movie. Some events in the latter-half of the film have settings that really stand-out, especially on a second watch. Most of 'Get Out' is shot on one property with a large house and yard surrounded by forest. Scenes inside the 'office' and the basement are prevalent scenes when it comes to cinematography, among others. I will say that the camera-work is good overall but it doesn't utilize any elements to establish any more suspense or creepiness outside of the script and some really good acting. (More or less these statements apply to the former-half of the movie, because there are some creepy shots in the latter.)Film Score: Even as a lover of music in movies, I didn't feel much from this track. The score is somewhat generic but well-used, so it didn't impact the merit of the film, but it could have earned a higher rating from me if it did stand-out.Overall: I recommend this movie to anyone that can enjoy a good suspense-filled movie. Even though it is weird and a bit twisted on a superficial level, it's not very bad whatsoever and other than some language. (And yes, there's some practical blood effects but that just makes the film better in my taste.) I would even recommend this to younger (13+) and more general audiences alike, it's not a very hard 'R' to me. It definitely doesn't beat out 2016's 'The Witch', which it's most comparable to in tone, but it is a very solid movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Underwhelming,"Seeing the rating and reviews I had high expectations for this movie, hoping i would enjoy it but was ultimately surprised with how underwhelming it was. The first half had an unsettling feeling and was building interest and suspension but it went down hill from there for me. It didn't take me long to predict what was to come and who would be involved but besides that i did not find myself liking the execution either which i was hoping would make it better, the whole concept just became cringe after the revealings, i personally did not find it scary at all (which is not important to me but can be for others), a lot of details where too silly to overlook and it just generally failed to make sense of things, ultimately becoming hard to take seriously. At the end of the day, I've seen much worse horrors and okay it was watchable but the praise this movie has completely baffles me, i have seen movies far far better in this genre with lower ratings but what do i know i guess. I made this review for anyone with suspicion about this not living up to the hype, a heads up to not be disappointed, to those who enjoyed, don't take it personally, you just confuse me:D.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

An interesting thriller with elements of horror.,"The movie does a great job of subtly portraying some of the everyday stereotypes faced by the African-American community - from being asked to produce an ID in the middle of the road, to so-called liberal Whites going out of their way to mention that they loved Tiger Woods and had voted for Obama.What worked for me was that there was no banal supernatural element to bring in the 'horror' component, but something more realistic from our day-to-day lives.*** Potential spoilers ahead ***The ending was pathetic though - it seemed that the script-writers ran out of ideas. A happy ending is okay if executed properly, but random coincidences, no. It would have been a fitting end to a horror/thriller if the police officer from before had arrived on the scene to arrest our hero, who's fingerprints were on the hand-gun with the double-faced girlfriend aptly playing the role of the victim.*** End of potential spoilers ***Anyway, makes up for a great one-time watch thanks to the powerful acting, a masterful build-up, and a (90%) strong script.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A great first film from Jordan Peele,"Get Out is a new horror comedy from one of the minds behind the hit series ""Key and Peele"", although this movie is less of a comedy and more of a straight up suspense film. I thought this film was fantastic. It was always apparent from the direction of ""Key and Peele"" that Both Jordan and Keegan-Michael understood directing very well and could easily satirize bad directing, but I never knew how that would translate over onto a serious attempt at making a film. That is until this movie. From the moment Childish Gambino's ""redbone"" began playing I knew I was in for something special. This is the best first film from a director I have seen since last years ""The Witch"". It knows how to create suspense through things like mood and score rather than overused constant jump scares and other weak techniques. This film utilizes a foreboding string score to ratchet up the tension and it never really lets up. The acting is also amazing. Each actor does a perfect job of either portraying fear or lynchian esque creepiness. Just watch the ""conversation"" that takes place between the movies main character and the house maid. Listen to the score. Notice the low , up-close camera angle. ""Get Out"" knows what it is doing and how to put its audience on edge. In fact, both people I watched this film with were grabbing onto me and refusing to let go pretty much the entire time. It does have issues that hold it back. There is a scene of horrible CGI fire that made me and my girlfriend both say out loud something along the lines of ""wow that looks like dogsh@t"". There is another scene that makes no sense, and without spoiling I'll just say it has to do with an open door leading to a bunch of photographs that have no reason of ever being so blatantly left around. Finally, the ending happens too fast and while it is oh so satisfying, it blows its load too soon and quickly. Don't let any of that deter you from seeing this movie though, whether you are a horror fan or not. Whether you are black or white. Liberal or Conservative. This film is for anybody who can appreciate film or at least loves being scared. I give it an 8.5/10 and it currently stands as the best film of 2017",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Surprisingly racist premise turned into an anti-racism story,"For the vast majority of this movie you will feel like - what the hell is this extremely racist crap? Literally every conversation throughout the movie has a classic racist cliché vibe, this movie is extremely derogatory towards black people, i would assume there were many easily triggered people who walked out of the theater on premiere.Apart from the insane display of racism the suspense was pretty decent, not too much violence, just tense atmosphere. Overall, the movie is just fine and has a very original story, have not seen anything quite like this, just the execution could have been much better. The ending is definitely extremely surprising, seeing how racist the whole premise of this movie was.An interesting movie worth watching just because it is different and has an interesting outcome, which was completely anti-cliché.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Now this is how you make a great horror/thriller movie,"Lets start by saying, this is pretty much the best movie I have seen this year. The story is great, easy to get into it and unsettling.Starting with the basic. The acting was top notch. The girl kind of fall flat at the end but other than that, great all around. Main and support and even the one liner are very good.The setting and the camera work was great yet again. Only one thing that to me made no sense but it is minor. The rest was perfect in my opinion.The story was fun for everyone. If you are a black person, you will see an ""exaggerated"" version of things that might happen. If you are not, the movie does a great job in putting you in his shoes. Back to the story, t starts slow but not boring and ramps up fast. It keeps you guessing. To be honest, I was expecting something very different as a plot twist but the way they went works. I found one hole in the story I can't explain but I am guessing it is explain in the extended or deleted scenes. There is no jump scare, no cheap gimmick, only a good story that keeps you in suspense.I don't know how to explain it with no spoiler but YOU NEED TO WATCH THIS!

Meet the Parents,"Nervous about meeting his Caucasian girlfriend's parents, a young African American struggles to work out if everyone is acting strangely around him or if it is just his imagination in this unusual mystery thriller. The film is very deliberately paced with lots of malice foreshadowed but exposition only revealed in tiny chunks along the way. In fact, utterly unsettling as the pre-credits sequence is, it is hard not to wonder whether the film would have been better without it since it is the only scene for quite a while that spells out the horror slant of 'Get Out' beneath its quirky façade. That said, there are enough elements that remain elusive here that the film stays enticing until the end. The final quarter also comes off as a very clever homage to the horror movies of the 1970s, complete with appropriate furniture for the period. What really elevates the film though is its social satire. The racism agenda is a little on-the-nose, but the protagonist's anxiety at being a 'token' African American really clicks, forced to enter into awkward conversations with several houseguests at one point who have no idea how to talk to him without sounding racist. It is actually quite a universal predicament and aside from being a captivating mystery movie, 'Get Out' also pinpoints how strange it can be to interact in an environment when one is a minority, whether it be by race, religion, gender, age or other factors.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Believe the hype...,"Jordan Peele is a man best known as one half of the comedy duo Key & Peele, so when I first heard the news that he'd written and directed a horror film, I would be lying if I said I wasn't a little surprised. Then came reports that Get Out was getting ridiculously good feedback from test screenings and, after horror having a solid year in 2016, I was hoping it'd live up to expectations. Believe the hype guys because Get Out is as good as you've heard.Black photographer Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) and his white girlfriend Rose Armitage (Allison Williams) visit Rose's parents for the weekend, where they will meet Chris for the very first time. Staggered by their behaviour from the very off, Chris begins to think all is not right in the home of Dean (Bradley Whitford) and Missy Armitage (Catherine Keener).I absolutely loved Get Out as both a psychological and satirical horror, Jordan Peele's imagination bringing us something quite unique within the genre and showing that he has such a big future ahead as a filmmaker. Right from the opening sequence, which is one of the best openings to a horror I've seen, I knew this film was going to be special. It felt almost as if I was watching a film from a seasoned director and not a man making his directorial debut, Peele exuding confidence more and more as the film rises through the levels of paranoia.The writing is spot on as well, Peele's background as a comedian coming into great use to blend the satire so perfectly with the horror. Peele has clearly made Get Out as a form of social commentary but he does so by keeping the audience on their toes, wondering where the film will turn next, which is one of the most important aspects of a horror film. As well as being genuinely creepy, Get Out also has some hilarious moments up its sleeve, leaving the audience in the palm of Peele's hand.Peele's confidence as a filmmaker is seen further through Toby Oliver's swift cinematography, akin to work seen in The Shining, and both Michael Abels haunting score and songs picked by Peele to accompany his twisted film.Coming to the performances, Get Out excels above many horror films with a talented and strong cast. Daniel Kaluuya leads the film with a quite exceptional performance as Chris Washington, impressing with each passing minute as the paranoia within his character grows. Expect to see much more of Kaluuya in the future.Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener are both devilishly charming and unnerving with their performances as Rose's parents, who take an immediate interest in Chris' life, both past and present. Get Out gets its truly unsettling performances from Betty Gabriel and Marcus Henderson as Georgina and Walter, hired by Dean's father. They both have a stand-out scene where it becomes clear that all is not well with either them or the house they tend to. Lil Rel Howery deserves a mention too for being genuinely funny in the role of Chris' best friend, Rod, who doesn't just feel like the comedy relief shoehorned in for the sake of it.Get Out brilliantly continues the resurgence of the horror genre and, as a directorial debut, has to go down as of the best I've seen from Jordan Peele. He's already stated that this is the first of a number of horrors he has planned which will act as social commentaries and, if they continue to be as good as his debut, I cannot wait.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A 5-star production - if it's a Virtual Reality horror movie,"Get Out is an intense, unnerving movie that keeps you on the edge of the seat --- only if you are satisfied with an adrenal rush and not looking for any depth in the characters or the story. It's a great production done with superb acting, music and visual arrangement, but as a movie about racism it just doesn't go beyond.It starts with the romance between Rosie and Chris, the sweet white girlfriend and the talented African-American photographer, where Rosie asks Chris to spend a weekend at her posh parents' country house. It's just a weekend, but as things get awry, it escalates to be a matter of life or death. The backdrop can be easily taken as a trope for racial relations/tension in America, but contrary to what Peele the director aspired to do, this movie just couldn't provoke any discussion or shed light on the touchy issues. To have the guests ""locked up"" in a grandiose house with two distinct camps of the white and the black is also a scene that occurs in Tarantino's Django Unchained. While Django Unchained uses a fictional story to unveil the cruelty and injustice of black slavery, Get Out feels more like a sorcerer's tale that manages to carry the label of racism because the victim happens to be a black. The characters are diabolical and psychotic, but they are also flat and uninspiring. They might carry a secret agenda, but it just makes them look like an underground cult group who somehow has a bit of a supernatural power – it must be because some of the things they do are scientifically impossible, e.g. the surgery scene. Their persona and the things that they can physically do – hypnosis by the mother and surgeries by the father – are just not representative at all. They do not carry any association to racists or the xenophobic. In fact, they are also kind of dumb to have that kind of video conferencing set-up in the room where the victim gets to talk to the perpetrator. It works well if the movie wants to create suspense or terror by paying tribute to the horror classic Saw, but again, it doesn't add any depth to an intellectual reflection on racism.Some people comment that the film commits dogmatic stereotypes. I think the only stereotype used here is that the black and the white are by default at war with each other. Yet, it's used more as a convenient trick to shove the audience into this them-versus-us mentality so we get as suspicious as Chris. The horror is real, the acting is fantastic and does send the chill off your spine, but it doesn't stimulate your thinking or perpetuate any racial prejudices. If this movie is played in a virtual reality movie house, it's top notch; but if it attempts to be meaningful, it is not.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Finely tuned racial themed psychological thriller,"This film manages to encapsulate quite a few themes. We have here a psychological thriller/horror which has themes on race and standing.The film begins with our lead (a young black man) who is to visit the white family of his well to do girlfriend. As you are to find out, not all is at it seems.I don't wish to say too much more on the story as it will easily give too much away. The film can be quite derivative, and as you watch it, there are various films you can clearly see which influenced it.However, that doesn't take away from the gist of what is here. There are racial themes that will make you ponder on it all way after you've watched it, which is what this is all about. It make it interesting, but it doesn't shove any political agendas down your throat.The acting is great, with some recognisable cult film actors present. Special mention must go to LilRel Howery who provides some comedy and tension relief in an otherwise very dark but often darkly humorous movie.I enjoyed it despite the uncomfortable nature of it.

Fun and well-made thriller,"'Get Out' is billed as a horror film, but - no spoilers in this review! - it's really more of a mystery/tense thriller. It's shot really well and looks great (nice effort from first-time director Peele), with some smart use of the Alabama location and a good score. The premise is purposefully cryptic: ""African-American man visits his Caucasian girlfriend's mysterious family estate"". Chris (Kaluuya) is meeting Rose (Williams) parents - Missy (Keener) & Dean (Whitford) - for the first time, and they welcome him with open arms, even if the servants seem off.It's not all about race, but it is a key aspect of the film and handled quite well. The two leads easily carry the film, both having some great scenes. However, the best bits are probably whenever Chris' friend Rod (Howery) is on screen, being hilarious and boisterous, even though often by phone. The humour and some slow bits do well to make the surprises seem even more shocking.The twist isn't as big as 'Cabin in the Woods' or 'The Sixth Sense', but the final 20min is certainly one of the better endings to a thriller/horror film you'll see for a while! Bit of a slow build up in parts, but a very exciting finish and it's all over in 100min.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A unique thriller,"In an unnamed U.S. city, Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) is an African-American photographer. His white girlfriend Rose (Allison Williams), whom he has been seeing for about four months, asks him to join her to meet her family for the first time. At the country's family estate, Chris notices some odd events which lead him to think he could be in danger.Director/writer Jordan Peele has created a superb thriller that easily reminds one of the brilliant ""Stepford Wives"" (1975). The tension slowly builds with the viewer identifying with Chris. The strange events seem harmless at first but there are too many coincidences to dismiss. Once the pieces come together, it's easy to see why the film was given its title.""Get Out"" is not without its comical moments especially stupid comments from well-meaning ""good, white liberals"" which peak at a massive garden-party-from-hell. As a modern psychological horror-thriller with an unique perspective on racism, it's easy to see why ""Get Out"" has earned so much recognition during the current awards season. It does borrow heavily from ""The Stepford Wives"" but clearly adds its own special, creative spin on the ""people here sure are weird"" atmosphere. - dbamateurcritic",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"""Get Out: A Missed Opportunity?""","While ""Get Out"" garnered critical acclaim and widespread popularity, I found it to be a somewhat disappointing experience.Here's why:Predictable Plot: The premise of a young black man visiting his white girlfriend's family and encountering unsettling racial tension is intriguing, but the execution felt predictable. The twists and turns were easily anticipated, leaving little room for suspense.Over-the-top Performances: While the performances were generally strong, some characters, like the white family members, seemed to lean into caricatured stereotypes, detracting from the film's overall impact.Uneven Pacing: The film's pacing felt uneven, with moments of tension interspersed with long stretches of dialogue that felt unnecessary and dragged on the momentum.Unresolved Questions: Despite the film's success in highlighting the complexities of race and identity, some aspects of the story felt unresolved. The motivations behind the white family's actions, for instance, remained ambiguous, leaving a sense of incompleteness.In conclusion: ""Get Out"" is a film that tackles important social issues, but its execution falls short of its potential. While the film has its merits, its predictable plot, over-the-top performances, and uneven pacing ultimately detract from its impact.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

One of the Best Films I've seen in years,"This is not a film for White People.

This is truly a unique cinematic experience, I've spent a great deal of time watching films from different parts of the world and its rare for me to say that I've never seen a film like this before. This is one of those films that makes white people look bad, but to be fair it does a great job in capturing the experience of a black man surrounded by ""too many white people"". For instance, I've almost always been the only black person at my job, and I've had my boss ask me about certain rappers simply for the fact that I'm black. During the summer olympics, my boss literally asked me what it was like to see black people win gold medals for America.

Attack of the killer WASPs,"""Get Out"" follows a young black man who heads to his white girlfriend's parents' home in an upscale bedroom community. Things are a bit off from the beginning, but they become progressively weirder—and worse—as his visit unwinds.Decried by the political right as ""racist"" and touted as a racial-political masterpiece by the left, it seems to me that most people are forgetting that, at the end of the day, ""Get Out"" is a horror film, and it earns its thrills amicably. Of course there are racial politics being commented on here—at times far too heavy-handedly so—but one has to remember that Peele's script is an exaggerated distortion as commentary on the current social climate around race as a topic; it's hyperbole at its finest.As a horror film, ""Get Out"" is successful because it manages to generate tension and push buttons in all the right places. It plays to audience expectations just about as much as it doesn't, so there is both intrigue and the expected catharsis these films are known for delivered equal measure. Peele wears his influences on his sleeve here, with ""The Stepford Wives"" (novel and film) being a chief template, even down to the film's primly manicured lawns in what is ostensibly anywhere, Connecticut, USA.The off-kilter atmosphere is strengthened by astute performances from all involved: Daniel Kaluuya is a sympathetic lead, and Allison Williams, though I found her profoundly annoying in the first two acts, plays the finale much better. Catherine Keener and Bradley Whitford play the white liberal country clubbers who voted for Obama to a t, but sublimate a perceptible weirdness that adds to the tension (especially Keener). The performances from Marcus Henderson and Betty Gabriel are also noteworthy in their utter weirdness, marked by odd expressions, movements, and gestures that throw the audience off over and over again. I did find the final act and reveal, as fun as it is, a bit routine; it's remarkably playful and has some clever shifts, but at the same time, it's nothing we haven't seen before—that said, it is nonetheless nicely played.In the end, ""Get Out"" is a legitimately fun, atmospheric, and suspenseful offering. A large part of what allows the film to surprise its audience is its core commentary and observations on race, and what Peele has in essence done is inject that into a tried-and-true genre setup. It's wryly political as much as it is committed to maintaining its horror prerequisites. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Now you're in the sunken place!,"Not all the directional debut sees this kind of welcome from the audience. Yeah, Jordan Peele had written and directed it. It is similar to the 90s style mystery-thrillers. Definitely must see for the 90s, 80s guys. It kind of looked like a black comedy, but I guess that's not they had preferred. Especially that teacup scenes and some of the close up shots, that freaks, yet very funny.Well, this is the story of an interracial romance. When Chris decides to meet his girlfriend's white family, living outskirt of her hometown, all goes as planned. But he was not sure how her parents take it, that he's a black. Now everything has settled, but his visit started to take a strange turn after a series of weird events. What it is and how he overcomes it is the remaining tale.The casting was amazing. The story was suspenseful. You would feel you can predict the scenes, but not that easy and when twist happens, you will realise it was simple as that. This is a hit film now, but if it was 20 years ago, surely would have gotten a cult classic status. And yes it is, thinking the future.When this got out and its pre release, I thought it would disappear without any trace. It is rare a recognition a film like this to get to having a second string cast, debutante director and being a low cost film. I got entertained thoroughly as it delivered as promised. But I think some people are overjoyed and praising it like crazy. That's true if you are not a film fanatic, otherwise it is one of those decent films. Surely not to be missed.

Too on the nose,"There's a lot of not so subtle social messages in this film, and I can't get away from how on the nose and apparent they are. It feels less like a horror film and more like a social-justice art show at times.Many of the stereotypical horror elements of this film are fine, and there is an unsettling feeling of creepiness to the setting of the family home. Yet, these are still stereotypes and cliches that are very unoriginal and played out.Overall, it felt like a very typical cheesy horror movie with a racial element and social justice role.

Edge of your seat horror,"I watched this film during my Horror Film course this semester. Prior to the last session, I had no idea what the film was about or even that it was so new.Jordan Peele takes viewers on an emotional journey in this film. Just as the viewer gets comfortable with the direction of the plot, he throws several twist and turns into the mix to keep things fun and exciting. I would have thought that Jordan Peele writing a horror film would be lead in a more comedic direction with a few small elements of scary. He does the exact opposite!! This film left me guessing and on the edge of my seat.Get Out gives the viewer more of a mental scare, as Peele stays away from the typical cheap jump scares you might be expecting. I could watch this film again and again while still finding a different element to ponder and evaluate.The actors in the film are just amazing; how they can hold their cool in such obscure situations is baffling. The film deserves awards that it did not have the chance to win. Being able to combine horror and comedy in a well-balanced film deserves much more recognition. I would truly like to see another horror film from Jordan Peele, as I feel he has found a way to create a new, more modern horror film.To anyone who is looking for the psychological thrill, this film will make you feels many uncomfortable things, but it will offer you the opportunity to see the world in a different way and maybe evaluate your past and future.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

a trenchant social critique in spite of its genre setting,"An unheralded cash cow in its domestic revenue and also a succès d'estime, USA black comedian Jordan Peele's directorial debut GET OUT rides on the coattail of the racial powder keg in the current USA soil, conjures up a well-conceived conspiracy theory married with an aroused scenario taking the leaf from the time-tested suburbia genre book, a close cousin is Ira Levin's THE STEPFORD WIFES, and enlivens its central story with robust horror tropes pulsating in a bracing beat.Our virile hero is Chris Washington (Kaluuya), a black photographer who is going to meet his white girlfriend Rose Armitage's (Williams) family for the first time. What Chris encounters is not the hostile racism usually presides within uncouth hillbillies or religious-poisoned happy clappies, instead, in this close-knit WASP community, what lurks around is something much more sinister and beyond one's wildest imagination. The overt clue is the aberrant behaviors of the black servants living with the Armitages: the housekeeper Georgina (Gabriel) and groundskeeper Walter (Henderson). At first glance, Peele seems to dangle viewers with a more conventional reference of slavery, but correlating with the film's unsettling prologue of abducting a black man Andrew Hayworth (Stanfield) in the same neighborhood, a sober mind suggests that we cannot take the situation for granted, certainly, something is wrong with the black people on the lot, they are not themselves, but the voodoo in the mix hits more on the mark of deep-rooted illusion of immortality than the ostensible white supremacy, there is a nuanced overtone even eulogizing black race's vitality as the perfect human specimen, meanwhile the main trope vouchsafes what lies beneath is the turpitude of extreme selfishness which deprives others of their identity (brain) for one's own sake, a metaphor of power-abusing from those privileged few, which is part and parcel of the film's runaway success, viewers cannot help but paralleling it with the current political affairs in the Trump era - life can be a sick joke.Artistically speaking, Peele rounds up a coherent (albeit improbable) story arc within its suburbia milieu, an estate is quietly ensconced with quaint Americana, a retro luster contradicts the young couple's modernist urbanity. From that symbolic deer-in-the-headlight accident to the para-psychic hypnosis, to a superbly and literally devised sunken place (evoking the murky other-worldliness in Jonathan Glazer's UNDER THE SKIN 2013), until the mandatory but still engrossing bailing-out killing spree, GET OUT treads circumspectly through the familiar ground without overdosing in the wantonness of its cock and bull story.Credits should fairly given to a capable cast, Daniel Kaluuya makes for a straight-up hero with gaping intensity, and Allison Williams capitalizes in Rose's about-face veracity to a bone-chilling effect. LilRel Howery as Chris' best friend, a TSA officer, stands out as the comic foil and a mouthpiece of inappropriate one-liners, and an openly hearty Bradley Whitford, a beguilingly frosty Catherine Keener and a delirious Caleb Landry Jones, rounds out an unsettling dysfunctional family, last but not the least, Betty Gabriel, arguably leaves the most bizarre impression perfectly in line with the thematic out-of-body creepiness.For all its hype and buzz, GET OUT benefits greatly from its timing and present-day context, plus a genuinely appealing wheeze of identity-swapping. A miracle-maker borne out of an above-average commodity that no one should begrudge for its success, because it excels as a trenchant social critique in spite of its genre setting, which is dishearteningly wanting in most wide-opening theatrical staples, especially at a dejected time like this.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Flat, predictable thriller with glaringly obvious plot twists","'Get Out' is a disappointing and highly overrated movie that fails to meet even the most basic expectations of a horror/thriller. It lacks any real scares, is generally ineffective in its attempts to be creepy, and many of the would-be thrills fall flat due to the fact that the plot is, for the most part, completely predictable with many of the plot 'twists' glaringly obvious.To most viewers, it will be fairly obvious what is going to happen in this movie from very early on, and so the big 'twists' really don't have any impact at all. I was sat there waiting for something that I hadn't seen coming - a smart and well-disguised twist that all decent thrillers have, but it never arrived.Even to the very last scene, 'Get Out' is so predictable and never even attempts to think out of the box, resulting in a rather dull, boring and forgettable thriller.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"'Get Out' is a brilliant psychological horror that fittingly exemplifies the revulsions of a supposed ""post-racial"" society","Set in a ""post racial"" America, 'Get Out' challenges the complacency of a liberal society, setting the audience with deep unease throughout the film, not just by its chilling horror aspects, but rather the disconcerting social attitudes audaciously identified in the white middle class family. Before the main story, which follows Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) and his weekend away with his girlfriend Rose's (Allison Williams) family, the film opens with an unsettling pre-credits scene of a young black man being jumped to Flanagan and Allen's Run, Rabbit, Run. This establishes the sincerely disturbing tone of the narrative, constantly manipulating the emotions of the viewers in favour of the victims, whilst still expertly retaining elements of subtlety that slowly uncover throughout the film.'Get Out' incorporates a remarkable array of horror aspects in its 1hr 44min run time – from guts and violence to, most prominently, psych and emotional terror. Each feature is integrated stylistically, culminating to form a smart and consistently tense narrative, although at points flowing just like any other horror movie in terms of set-up, revelation and the sporadic comic relief. Similarly, a significant suspension of disbelief is required to grasp the tenacious premise of the eventual plot drive, which is unveiled in the latter third of the film. Thus, its overarching spread is sometimes too thin and consequently struggles to candidly assemble at the end.That said however, there is a great deal more to praise about the way in which director Jordan Peele unravels the story towards this climax. The brilliant intricacy of the family's 'acceptance' of Chris' culture, by being overly pleasant that is, superbly exacerbates the tension in the relationship, not just on screen, but between the audience and the characters. The gradual, relentless extrication of the plot is entrancing during the entire course of the film, leaving many aspects rightfully open to the individual interpretation of the viewer, intuitively hinting at Peele's intentions, to isolate the despicable root nature of racism in our society. And my god, does he do an exceptional job.The casting of Daniel Kaluuya as the lead character, despite the controversy regarding his nationality (ironically), was an excellent decision by Peele; Kaluuya's steady intensity makes it easy to see why the director eventually chose him for the role, having never intended to cast a black British actor initially. The 'Skins' and 'Sicario' co-star is a captivating lead, with the high forecasts for 'Get Out' hopefully projecting this young talent to step into larger roles that he unequivocally deserves. Lil Rel Howery (as the charming Rod Williams) is without doubt the standout supporting member; the comedic timing of his character and the relatable quality of his personality is exceptionally charismatic, adding a meaningful layer of hilarity to the already fascinating spectacle and appealing to wider audiences who would not instinctively connect with the archetypal horror genre.A movie that exhibits several fresh prospects in the film industry, 'Get Out' is a terrifically innovative film and potentially a generation defining horror.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Unsubtle but deft balance of laughs and bloody thrills,"'Get Out' is a well-balanced blend of horror and comedy. While it is consistently eerie, intriguing and suspenseful, the comedy manages to compliment the tone, which is hard to achieve. For example, the comic relief character TSA Agent Rod is actually funny and a stand- out, which is uncommon, but it should be noted that every actor in this film is stellar, particularly Daniel Kaluuya. Director Jordan Peele ('Key & Peele' and 'Keanu') displays a strong influence from classic horror/slasher films, but shows enough originality (black brainwashing, the ""sunken place"") to stand out from other horror directors. He achieves this by subverting the horror genre, having a black male as the lead in peril, instead of a virginal babysitter.The theme of racism is strong and ballsy; Peele's tactic of having white middle-class liberals (you) as the villain, the movie reflects back on the audience to chilling results (like 'Black Mirror', only much better). The film remains accessible throughout despite the heavy, ""in your face"" race theme – I felt the metaphor lacked subtlety, which was a small issue. The ending was good if a little too small in scale ('Hot Fuzz' was better at this) and the twist was surprising and had a strong build-up (""get the keys!""). The film was let down by not having a big scare-factor – this was more creepy than scary and long-time horror fans might be disappointed with the slightly unnecessary jump scare cues. I would describe 'Get Out' as creative and engaging, and awesome to watch with a cinema audience (I can't remember an ordinary packed screening room clapping before).",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Its a good movie, don't overthink it, just watch it","Watched this movie with my friend and we had no clue what the movie was about when we entered. We just sat in the theater, and watched. After watching the move, we've been talking about it the last 3 days.All these sensitive people are pretending that the movie was trying to prove something or is insulting to white people. The movie isn't trying to prove or show anything. It's just a movie. No one listen to those people who thought it was misinterpreting of white people. Those people just want to complain about something.The movie doesn't use Cgi monsters or demons to make it scary. What makes the whole movie scary is that they make every character so awkward and sketchy that it starts creeping you out. What I find makes the movie stick with you after, is when you realize that everything progressed in a realistic way. For most of the movie, you don't know who's the real bad guy. Also, the main character knows something is up right away. Most horror movies are just a repeat of the main character ignoring all the crucial clues to get out. You realize the main character did everything he could in this movie, which makes the movie seem so real.In conclusion, If you just watch the movie and forget about all that stupid slavery and white family talk, you'll enjoy it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Fun Thriller; Not Racist and Not Political,"People are way overthinking this movie. It's not a social/political satire. It's not racist. Yes, it does make fun of white racist stereotypes of black people, but nobody in their right mind would think the writer/director actually thinks most white people think like the mad scientists in this film do. This is a basic thriller, a piece of old-fashioned movie-making. It is inspired by the classic ""The Stepford Wives"" which did something similar with sexism as this film does with racism.The plot involves a young black man who is taken by his girlfriend to visit her parents for the weekend. The family has black servants who act weird. Although the plot unfolds in a somewhat predictable way, the movie is elevated by intriguing parallels that involve the main character's childhood trauma. The mom is a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis, and being a hypnotherapist myself I can say that although these scenes exaggerate the power of hypnosis, they don't exaggerate it by much.There are a few surprises, but what I liked best about this movie is the strange recurring motif that involves the main character's trauma. We see his weakness but also his strength. That made this film a cut above standard horror/thriller movies.By the way this movie is not very violent; it's about average for a suspense movie. If you want a slasher movie with a lot of blood and gore this isn't it. It's a thinking person's movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Told You So,"Get Out in short: An African-American man meets his white girlfriend's parents, and their friends, and notices that there's something a little strange going on.Racial undertones surround this really good horror-mystery film directed by a guy who has a (mostly) comedy background, Jordan Peele. Peele wades into deep waters filled with many horror greats swimming about. The question is, does he manage to stay afloat in this pool of great talent? Get Out is not without a little satire, but it's not the cheese comedy and clichés you sometimes see in bad horror films, it works here, it's smart. But it is a horror film, after all, and a damn good one too. So yes, Peele's floaties are working just fine.As a viewer, you instantly pick up the vibe going on right from the start. Director Jordan Peele, whose mother is white and father is black, sets the mood early and keeps reminding you of it. Chris, a black man, is dating a white woman, Rose. Nothing unusual about that, but for reasons that soon become clear, a big deal is made from it. Rose brings Chris home (Guess Who's Coming to Dinner-esq) to an affluent neighborhood filled with old money and old white people who ""act as if they've never met a real black man before."" Suddenly, the geriatric's are referring to black stereo types, like, ""I'm a big fan of Tiger Woods,"" or, ""Is it true what they say about black men in bed."" People are getting creepy, if not rude, looking him over - sizing him up almost like cattle at an auction. Chris' best friend, Rod the TSA worker (and proud of it) ominously warns, ""You don't go to a white girl's parent's house!"" Even I began to feel sketched out!Two things you'll LIKE about Get Out: 1) The story is brilliant. Peele also wrote the script (2018 Oscar nominee for both Original Screenplay and Director). It's unique and unexpected. 2) It's the best horror film since The Shining (1980).Two things you'll DISLIKE: 1) You may be a little uncomfortable with the racial undertones at first, perhaps even embarrassed for your entire race (if you're white). Give the move a chance to make the point of it all. 2) It may be a few more years until you see a horror-mystery like this one again. Soak it up while you can.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
GET OUT had a very dark and unique plot line that was great to watch.,"PROS: The acting in GET OUT was phenomenal, the best acting I've seen in this decade so far. The genuine fear the main character had was chilling, and the insanity that every other character played was impeccable. The acting, in my opinion, is what carried the film. Most of the other parts of what makes a film worth watching were very OK. The tension in the movie was good. This portion could've been much worse, but it had a very unique style to it. When you watch as many horror movies as I have you anticipate a certain style of rising action, but this film came at it from a different perspective. It wasn't my style, but I could understand and appreciate it from a very technical level.CONS: With any horror movie there will be some cons. The ending in GET OUT felt very unfinished. To me it felt like the director couldn't come up with an ending as good as the rest of the film, so instead he settled for this very mediocre finale. But when you put that all aside there was one flaw that bothered me more than the rest. GET OUT was marketed as a ""big horror film"" or the ""most intense horror of 2017"" and these statements frustrated me because after watching the film it was quite obviously not a horror film, more or less a psychological thriller. I went in to this movie expecting one thing and preparing myself for that thing but in turn it delivered a completely different message. Was the movie good? 100% yes, but these negatives just stuck out like a sore thumb.www.chorror.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Daniel Kaluuya is perfect in this role. All of the family is eery and fits like a glove into the movie. Allison Williams is particularly convincing. The one problem I have is the building of suspense is a tad slow and the first two acts only increase in quality as it progresses. The third act is stunning and held my breath. It left smart references to the days of slavery and terms used my slave owners in the south. The humor is sharp and dark at most times(the Dahmer rant anyone?).

Jordan Peele used it in a way that was reminiscent of British humour, which is something i really enjoyed. On top of that, we have some first rate suspense and a strong sense of anticipation.

Brilliant modern horror movie with a clever theme of racism underneath the surface! - Film Review By Niall Maggs (http://ateenstakeonfilm.com),"This first-time director manages to create an unbelievable and surprising horror flick that was hysterically funny at parts. The film is filled with good performances and fun characters with a realistic storyline and quite relatable to many people, not the supernatural bit though! ... the 'meeting the parents' bit! The scenes when the couple arrives at the parent's estate are fun and enjoyable to watch, much like the scenes when the supernatural stuff begins! The film as a whole is quite creepy and features a disturbing performance played brilliantly by Caleb Landry Jones. The film could be classed as a horror comedy though, mainly due to LilRel Howery's hysterical performance with his random outbursts that resulted in the entire cinema completely losing it! This benefited the film as it created a fun cinema experience that you can enjoy with a group of friends! Some may argue that the comedy element may take away from the horror aspect of the film but I'd have to disagree, there is a perfect mix between both that results in a fantastic modern horror flick and the best I've seen in a very long time! Also, this is definitely a contender for my favourite film of 2017 so far!

Great horror-comedy,"A superbly created horror that flips the genre on its head. The pacing is immaculate, taking viewers from sheer terror to safe unease like the smoothest roller-coaster in the world. The cinematography is beautifully threatening and the performances by Kaluuya and others are intimidatingly good.Better yet is a script that features realistic characters who react as the average person would.

"Creepy and, though not horror, good thriller","It started out a bit slow, but the creepy-ness of the people held my interest. Then the suspenseful part came and it goes uphill from then on.

It was aight,It contained many elements that progressed the plot along. There were many things throughout the movie that foreshadowed the direction of the plot and things throughout the movie symbolized things in real life.

This is how thrillers should be,"Get Out is a thriller-lovers amusement park. It has a plot, a strong story-line, a good acting, and most of all structure. Movies these days lack in structure and are just like pop-music. Copied crap with repetitive sh*t. But not Get Out.First of all, this movie is not racist as some reviews may suggest. It is good, high-quality thriller that uses known subject, but gives it an extra twist.Throughout entire movie, you'll probably be interested and think about ""what is next"". Leaves you expecting, which means you'll keep focuse. Don't look for deeper political meaning, because the director did not aim at that subject IMHO. It is just a well made movie, using race issues in past to make good story-line. Simple as that.The beginning is simple, the middle is quite a ride and ending gives some satisfaction but leaves you kinda wondering.P.S: The side-role dude is JUST AWESOME.

Everything about this movie is refreshing.All you really need to know is that, during the climax, the audience of the packed theater applauded, and a minute later they all laughed. But then, 5 minutes later they applauded AGAIN, and a minute later laughed AGAIN. Such is the impact this gem of a film had in that showing.Thrillers often employ humor, but it's usually not funny and it's used in inappropriate places. Here the humor is timed perfectly with the thrills so they don't interfere with each other, and it isn't used too often, but when this film is funny it's really funny.The cast has no major stars, and hardly any recognizable faces, yet the director got Oscar worthy performances out of several of them.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Unexpectedly Enjoyable! 7/10,"Review: This is one messed up film! Now that I have finally watched it, I can understand why some people found it quite disturbing but the ending brought some justice to the whole messed up situation. Daniel Kaluuya plays a black photographer, Chris Washington, who is in a happy relationship with his white girlfriend Rose Armitage (Allison Williams). They decide to go to Roses parents house, and he soon realises that they have a weird outlook towards black people. With a black woman and man as there servants, and various statements about his colour, he bites his tongue and he attends there annual party, which also leads to more racial comments. When Chris finally decides to leave, he is faced with an unbelievable situation which leads him to fight for his life. I was definitely shocked with the outcome of this movie, and I wasn't expecting the various twists and turns throughout. It's not everyday that you see a film were the black underdog, triumphs with all the odds stacked up against him, so I have to give the director the thumbs up. The ending seemed a bit abrupt, and it does take some time to get going but once it does, you can't fault it for originality. Personality, I would have got out of the house after the first day, especially after seeing how weird the servants were but I can understand that he was in love with his girlfriend, which is why he was willing to put up with ignorant behaviour from the messed up family and friends. Anyway, I enjoyed the movie and it's definitely worth a watch. Enjoyable!Round-Up: This is the first movie directed by Jordan Peele, 38, who is known for his comedic series Key & Peele, alongside Keegan-Michael Key. The shock success of this movie, brought him to the main stream, and with Keanu also doing well at the box office, the only way is up for the dynamic duo. Although Daniel Kaluuya isn't a household name, he has starred in Cass, Welcome to the Punch, Kick Ass 2, Sicario and the series Skins, so he has had some experience in front of the camera. He definitely brought some intensity to the project, and it was good to see him use his brain towards the end.Budget: $4.5million Worldwide Gross: $252.5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their horror/mysteries, starring Daniel Kaluuya, Allison Williams, Catherine Keener, Bradley Whitford, Caleb Landry Jones, Marcus Henderson and Lakeith Stanfield. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One of The Worst Films Ever Made,"This is the second time I have given this film a chance. I could not get by the first half on the premier viewing. It is, without doubt, one of the most pretentious, over-wrought, inane, and plodding pieces of crap I have had the horror to waste time over.The whole thing could be told as a 23 minute episode of The Twilight Zone. The concept of the plot is asinine and presented at the very end of the film, almost as a way to make sense of everything that passed before, but only in a very ridiculous and unbelievable manner.It does not know if it is a surreal film or a real film or a fantasy film, or a sci-fi fillm, or a drama film, or what. One thing it is, though, is garbage. The leaden directing of this film sees us witnessing overly long scenes that serve no purpose. This clown of a director makes the master of plod, Denis Villeneuve. Look like Michael Mann.Alas, you have probably seen this painful abomination, but if you have not, just skip to the one hour and nine minute mark, to marvel at the ""suspense"" and ""thrills"" of this disaster of a film.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Brave theme, skilled pacing, great direction, awesome plot","It's very refreshing to enjoy a masterpiece, obviously. This is an art piece. Just because horror and comedy don't get labelled as art very often doesn't mean it isn't possible. Why? The movie doesn't care what you have to say about it, it just wants to be itself, get its message through, which it does in brilliant fashion. So many layers in this movie will inspire you to reflect on people and society from a fresh perspective. The leads' performance and character development is the kingpin holding it all together. Here you get a brilliantly subtle portrayal of a well fleshed out main character. I'm not a fan of Key & Peele so I resisted watching the flick out of expectation that the humour would turn me off. So glad I gave in and watched it as this film in fact presents a well balanced, thoughtful and expertly wielded theme; one which most are too fearful to touch with a ten foot pole. It must be tough to create a clear, focused vision with topics that are so controversial, but clearly there is much more to Peele than the lighthearted comedian, for here he has have crafted and directed a bold, mature and most of all, important piece of cinema. All the while the horror is still good horror and the humour is still good humour. Smart. Very very smart.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Something Refreshing But Yet A Bit Overhyped,"This movie is a mixture of comedy and somewhat horror although I did not find it scary whatsoever.

This movie would of been better if the white actors were maybe more scarier. However, it does keep you entertained depending on what you're into. If you're open minded and like thrillers and a bit of comedy then this movie is for you. In conclusion, this movie is a bit too overhyped but still very enjoyable.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"""We're Huggers!""...","In GET OUT, Director Jordan Peele has created a gripping horror film that is also a biting social satire.When a man named Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) accompanies his girlfriend (Allison Williams) on a weekend trip to meet her parents, an awkward situation slowly turns into an unspeakable nightmare. Kaluuya plays Chris as a man tormented by a past event, which he must overcome if he is to survive.Instilled with a general sense of uneasiness, and some genuinely disturbing / disorienting moments, the movie builds toward its terrifying conclusion. A wicked sense of humor is also evident throughout the story.Original and effective...",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Wonderfully absurd and effectively creepy.,"Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) is a young African American photographer whose white girlfriend Rose Armitage (Allison Williams) wants to take him to meet her parents, psychotherapist mother Missy (Catherine Keener) and neurosurgeon father Dean (Bradley Whitford). Chris is worried that Rose hasn't told them that he is black, but she assures him that they won't be the slightest bit bothered about his race. As it happens, his colour turns out to be the least of his worries as his growing suspicions that there is something very sinister afoot at the Armitage house turn out to be well founded.Not long after Chris arrives at Rose's parent's house, matters begin to get weird, Mr and Mrs Armitage's affable behaviour a little too perfect, while their home help, maid Georgina (Betty Gabriel) and groundsman Walter (Marcus Henderson), act in a manner that can best be described as freakin' bizarre. A party for friends and family introduces more strange characters into the mix, most of whom are politely racist. Something clearly isn't right about this picture, but the viewer is wisely kept as much in the dark as Chris, while director Jordan Peele exhausts all of the possible paranoia/conspiracy angles. All the strings are pulled together in the final act, in which Peele reveals the outlandish truth, going for tension and scares, with just a little gore for good measure.As a Caucasian, I guess I could take offence at the film's portrayal of white folk, who, with no exception, are evil bastards who covet the physically superior body of the African American. Instead, I just found the whole crazy notion too absurd to take seriously.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Innovative mix of genres - exhilarating and disquieting at the same time,"Get Out is an innovative and entertaining movie: a mix of Comedy, Thriller, Horror, Dramatic, Grotesque, Noir, Sentimental and Social Satire that succeeds as a horror movie even without the use of monstrosity, jump scare or blood, but thanks to really disquieting shots and facial expressions that keep the viewer alert. It is also a criticism of certain ""white people"" who voted for Obama: this movie unveils a less cliche', more politically correct and treacherous face of racism.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Good But Don't Believe All The Hype,I have until very recently had a problem sleeping. You see when I was in bed I'd be lying there and I'd suddenly have enraged thoughts as to the Oscars being too white. Words can not convey just grief stricken and tortured I was knowing that once again the Academy Awards were going to gift accolades to white film makers once again damaged me mentally . emotionally and physically. Thankfully all this was cured when MOONLIGHT won the Best Picture this year. All the world's wrongs had now been righted in what must be the most important event ever since the big bang 13.8 billion years ago. Now the only thing bothering me is that every time I watch a horror thriller is that the token black character gets bumped off early. Along comes GET OUT which has received universal praise and features a black director/screenwriter in Jordan Peele and stars black actor Daniel Kaluuya so there's no way a clichéd thriller where the first scene features a token black character getting killed!!!! SUGGESTIVE SPOILERS !!!!So the first scene features a black man walking along a dark lonely street .. Then he's attacked. I suppose this is an example of post modernism? Thankfully this is more than tokenism because we're introduced to the main character Chris Washington who is African American and has a white girlfriend Rose who drives him to her middle class WASP parents home. There's two things that can happen at this scenario. One is the middle WASP class parents slam the door in their face and disown their daughter. The other scenario is boyfriend is greeted as a respected new addition to the household and he soon wishes the parents had slammed the door in his faceTo be fair to Jordan Peele he has made a fairly effective and enjoyable tongue in cheek horror thriller. The only thing he can be criticised for is that the polite middle class White Anglo Saxon Protestant characters constantly reminded me a little too much of THE STEPFORD WIVES. Apart from that it's an entertaining film. The downside is that it's really nothing more than that and I'm slightly surprised as well as puzzled by the hype and acclaim surrounding GET OUT. It goes without saying that the hype works against. Watch the film but don't expect a masterwork of cinema otherwise you'll be left with a feeling of disappointment,7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A rare kind of horror movie with fluent watching experience,"The plot is very well written and away from Clichés, though it has some inspirations and the house in the movie is very familiar. Characters are not extremely stupid like in most of the horror movies, and this makes the movie enjoyable as you find a little bit reasoning. The third part I liked was that the movie scares without gruesome or bloody images, and there are not any jump scares. The movie actually scares the audience with thought and getting inside of the mind. Throughout the movie, a mysterious ambiance follows, and this makes the movie fluent. Lastly, cinematography is really good. With this good cinematography, acting and fiction are well reflected toward audience. Otherwise, the movie would be wasted. Overall, I liked the movie very much as a rare type of horror movies.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Behold. The Coagula.,"The amiable Daniel Kaluuya gives an enjoyable breakthrough performance as Chris Washington, a young black artist dating white girl Rose Armitage (Allison Williams). Five months into the relationship, and it's time to meet her parents. They live in a back of the beyond universe populated almost exclusively by whites, along with a few black people who behave quite strangely. Chris will discover some nefarious doings by Roses' mom and pop (Catherine Keener, Bradley Whitford) and these other members of the white elite. Will he be able to ""get out"" of this situation before it's too late?Overall, the filmmaking debut for sketch comedian Jordan Peele is a respectable, if not great, effort to blend some commentary on racial relations with a tried and true, formulaic Hollywood thriller. This viewer could point out the film that seems to have inspired Peele the most, but that would be along the lines of a spoiler. While the film is technically well made and well paced, and builds towards an appropriately visceral finale, it is troubling in some ways. Its ""mystery"" is easy to figure out (Hell, Chris' seemingly paranoid friend Rod (LilRel Howery) may actually be on to something), and the characters are pretty ""black and white"", if you'll pardon the expression. Undoubtedly, the film is perfect at being manipulative, with villains whose violent comeuppance is the ultimate catharsis.The cast provides most of the value. Williams is good as the girlfriend who, at first, tries to have you wondering ""is she or isn't she"". Old pros like Keener, Whitford, Stephen Root, and Richard Herd do as much as they can with cliched roles. The lively and profane Howery is quite amusing. Caleb Landry Jones dials up the seediness to 11 in his role as Roses' loutish brother Jeremy.As this viewer said, the scenario is likely to get the blood of some audience members boiling, but it could have used a bit more restraint. It's certainly entertaining to a degree, and clearly it did hit a nerve with the movie-going public, even garnering some Oscar nominations.Six out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Best ORIGINAL Screenplay????,"In this era of disposable entertainment where we have no cultural memory (and, I fear, no cultural future), and people are living only for the next best thing, is there no one who recognizes that this movie is almost a head-on remake of Ira Levin's The Stepford Wives (1975)? Substitute racism for sexism and mix liberally, no credit given to the original author. The fact that not even the Academy could recognize the wholly derivative plot shows how far we have fallen as a moviegoing public. In all likelihood, even Jordan Peale probably believes he wrote an original script. He didn't. And that's what's terrifying about Get Out.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The only thing I disagree with is that the whole ''black paranoia'' (thinking all the white people are out to get them) thing turned out to be ''helpful'' which is certainly not a thing in reality.Well,we all knew the setting of the movie and it does fit *this movie specifically*.I just hope that people don't take it the wrong way and accept it as a global fact.Conclusion: a great watch with interesting twists.

A must-see for any Mystery/Horror fans,"I was pleasantly surprised by this film having not really heard of it before watching. Kudos to Jordan Peele as the writer and director of this horror-mystery piece, as I was indeed kept guessing throughout. On several occasions my hubris got the best of me, I thought I had the plot sussed - I was close, but no cigar. And I fully appreciated being taken down a different road than the one I had expected.A strong performance from the cast en masse, but Daniel Kaluuya did stand out; since we are essentially watching events unfold as and when he experiences them. We cringe as he cringes, we're shocked as he's shocked.... and we, the audience, remain bonded to Daniel's character, Chris Washington, until the movie's conclusion - and in this way we feel like we are almost in the film ourselves. Immersed in a strange scenario, off to 'Meet the Parents', but with a twist of the unusual.If you enjoy the mystery/horror genre, this film is unmissable. With horror films in particular being bogged down with the same type of characters and very similar plots, 'Get Out' comes as a refreshing change.On the whole, I would recommend it to most viewers, horror fans and non-horror fans alike - the gore is not overwhelming.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The movie is just interesting enough to keep me engaged in the film. Although nothing stood out at as particularly great. For such a highly acclaimed film though, some of the films special effects look hilariously amateurish, like something a college film student would put together.

The Perfect Blend Of Horror and Comedy with Social Commentary Mixed In.,"Get Out is fantastic.When I first saw the trailer for Get Out, I laughed hard. I thought it looked awful because the trailer was so weird and strangely cut. I was wrong.Here's what the movie did well.Get Out is the best movie I've seen so far in 2017. The story follows an African-American man visiting his white girlfriend's house, but there is so much more than just that. The story is incredibly entertaining. The dialogue kept the audience entertained, it was funny, witty, smart, and kept a constant pace. The movie blended horror and comedy perfectly, neither taking center stage. The film has a lot of dark humor which I'm a huge fan of, it worked very well with the setting and tone of the film. The story has twists and turns that are very original and catches the audience off guard. The story has fantastic social commentary, commenting on subtle racism throughout which is very effective. The story keeps the audience on the edge of their seat throughout. When the comedy hits, it hits hard, each joke hit and were well timed. The horror hits hard as well, making the film disturbing and creepy when it needs to be.The technical things in this movie were amazing. The lighting was consistent and gave the film a dark, stylized, and disturbing vibe. The cinematography was fantastic, each shot giving off a certain feeling which helped move along the story. The music that played in this movie helped with the vibe, fitting whatever scene it was in.Most everyone who acted in this movie gave a fantastic performance. Daniel Kaluuya, Bradley Whitford, and LilRel Howery particularly giving great performances. Everyone embodied their characters perfectly and put a lot of effort into making sure their characters were believable.This film was Jordan Peele's directorial debate, if this type of quality holds up in his future films I can see him having a long and successful career in directing. The film is well paced and makes sure to keep the audience on their seat. Peele made sure to get fantastic performances out of his actors and did a great job creating the tone for this movie.Onto the bad, which there aren't a lot.There was, out of the whole movie, one shot I didn't like. There was a shot with fire in frame. The fire didn't look real which took me out of the story for a split second.Caleb Landry Jones's performance was a little over acted. If he acted less like a cartoon character it would have been better but it doesn't effect the movie in a major way.Overall, Jordan Pelle's Get Out is fantastic,keeping the audience on the edge of their seat when they need to be and made them laugh when the jokes hit. The film is beautiful looking and the story is unique and will surprise many audience members. I highly recommend Get Out if your looking for a quality horror/comedy movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The ""racism"" theme you find here isnt anything related to the real world like 12 Years a Slave or Django Unchained. I have no idea what granted Peele an Oscar for this film. Ive seen B movies much better than this and seeing someone go from comedy to Director you'd be 100 times better off watching A Quiet Place directed by John Krasinski. This movie left me feeling annoyed in the fact that ive wasted money and time on it; even The Emoji Movie is more entertaining than Get Out.

The messages and the parallels with real life are just chilling. This movie should be taught in schools to be honest.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Interesting,One of Jordan Peele's first bigger movies.He absolutely crushed this one.

Best goddamn horror/psychological thriller I've ever seen,"It took me a while to get to this one, and it's because I knew the general plotline and I thought maybe it would be a little too hamfisted for me to enjoy, and I also knew that any movie with that kind of premise would be adored by the critics, whether it was actually good or not.Turns out this movie managed to be nuanced, deeply unsettling, heart-pumping thrilling and downright hilarious all at once. It really hits every mark you could ever want from a movie like this. Daniel Kaluuya did a spectacular job, and although there are a lot of excellent survivor-trope characters played by excellent actors in a lot of great horror/slasher/thrillers, I honestly think Kaluuya takes the cake for being the absolute best. Which is not something I say lightly, since I am a huge fan of thriller/slasher/horrors with the survivor turning the tables during the climax, particularly when they have a unique twist (a la ""You're Next"", ""The House of the Devil"", ""Babysitter""). Basically what I'm trying to say is that while this movie is in a lot of ways a very particular trope that is popular right now (and that I happen to love), it also manages to be incredibly fresh and unpredictable.I found myself wanting to re-watch the movie immediately after finishing it. And if you're like me, and you find the ""white people are all veiled racists"" messaging in a movie incredibly off-putting (which is the reason I stupidly avoided this classic for so long), just forget all that and watch the movie anyways. When it comes to the racial element, I think there's a number of different ways you could read into it, and IMO that was entirely intentional.The important and enjoyable part of this movie (I think) is just how well it puts the viewer in Chris' shoes, such that you can't help but feel the confusion, suspicion, terror and then dread at all the exact same moments he does. Even if you know precisely what's coming. That may not sound like a lot, but particularly for a seasoned horror movie fan, it's exceedingly rare that a movie hits the notes at just the right times in just the right ways to put the audience right into the protagonists shoes every single time. It's terrifying, unsettling, funny and satisfying in a way most horror movies try desperately to be, but very rarely succeed in actually being. Get Out succeeds over and over and over and over. Just watch it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
How Can this Be Reviewed at Less than a 9,"I loved this film. Nine reasons this film deserves a ""9"" review1) The plethora of corny, not-so-veiled, race references. 2) Action ending with plenty of well-deserved dying and gore. 3) Actress Betty Gabriel playing the role of Georgina. 4) Creepy silent Bingo scene. 5) Rosemary's Baby meets Deliverance vibe. 6) Fantastic hypnosis special effects. 7) No-holds-barred Black, humor and profanity lines. 8) Impressive directorial debut by Jordan Peele. 9) Finally,what a blast of ironic magnificence to have the Black man pick cotton (from the chair arms) to save his life.p.s.

A curious and suspenseful film but with a less than stellar ending,"No doubt the lead actor Daniel Kaluuya who plays the African American boyfriend named Chris Washington was a stand out and well deserving of his Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. Chris who is going to meet his white girlfriend named Rose Armitage's (Allison Williams) parents at their home for the first time doesn't know what to expect on his first overnight stay and neither does the audience.This film bares little resemblance to the classic 1967 Comedy/Drama Guess Who's Coming to Dinner starring Spencer Tracy, Sidney Poitier, and Katharine Hepburn, which also has the African American boyfriend surprising his white girlfriend's parents over dinner at their home. The comparison ends there.Actor Daniel Kaluuya's facial expressions are priceless and I give him kudos for carrying this films quality performance more than the seasoned actors Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener who play Rose Armitage's parents. I also thought actor Lil Rel Howery who plays Rod Williams as Chris Washington's long distance best friend and advisor was the perfect opposite of the frantic Chris Washington. The screenplay reminded me a bit of the original 1975 The Stepford Wives in the vein of being brainwashed and under someone else's control.My only disappointment was the ending was a letdown compared to the other 90 percent of a very good screenplay. Overall I give the film a respectable 7 out of 10 rating and it is worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Above Average Horror Film,"The black photographer Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) travels with his Caucasian girlfriend Rose Armitage (Allison Williams) to meet her family in their house in the countryside. Chris is worried since Rose 's parents do not know that he is black but he is welcomed by her father, the neurosurgeon Dean Armitage (Bradley Whitford); her mother, the psychiatrist Missy (Catherine Keener) that uses hypnotism in her treatments; and her brother Jeremy (Caleb Landry Jones). He has also a weird and cold reception from the black servants Walter (Marcus Henderson) and Georgina (Betty Gabriel). During the night, Chris feels uncomfortable and leaves the bed to breath outside the house. When he returns, Missy is in her office and invites him to talk to her about his mother. However she hypnotizes Chris that freezes while his mind travels to a pitch black place called the sunken place by Missy. On the next morning, Chris wakes up in his bed and he believes he had a nightmare. Then he learns that there will be a family party with white guests only. Chris calls his best friend, the airport security guard Rod Williams (Lil Rel Howery), and he reports the weird events that happened to him. When the guests arrive, Chris feels awkward and convinces Rose to leave the house at night. While packing his clothes to travel back home, Chris finds photographs and the dark secret of the Armitage family.""Get Out"" is an above average horror film by Jordan Peele with a flawed story about veiled racism and without any message and excessive hype. The first half is great and Walter, Georgina and Andre Hayworth look like characters from the 1975 ""The Stepford Wives"". The second half becomes a joke and the happy ending does not fit well to the story with so many holes and evidences against Chris. Allison Williams is amazing, changing her behavior from a lovely girlfriend to a cruel woman. Catherine Keener is also excellent in the role of a cold hypnotherapist. Daniel Kaluuya performs a non-charismatic character and the impact would be greater with an actor with more personal charm to perform Chris. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Corra!""

Nothing is what it appears,"This film is so much more than your standard horror movie. If anything, it's much more a suspense movie with a devious twist. The plot is simple enough at first, girlfriend brings boyfriend to her place for uncomfortable meeting with her family. Sure, basic enough. But Jordan Peele has constructed a film that is anything but basic.The interracial couple in and of itself can make people uncomfortable, and the ingratiating of a white family to the daughter's black boyfriend can also be its own thing easily. What Peele does is merge those two, and makes every seemingly accepting scene cringe-worthy no matter what race you may be. If you're white, the white people are embarrassing you. If you're black, you're feeling the discomfort of being in a place like this, and wondering if there isn't something underneath the apparent good words.In that way, Peele encapsulates our society. White people invoking Barack Obama's name as though it gives them credibility among black people, for instance. Through each scene, you begin to wait for the other shoe to drop, and wonder what exactly it means when it happens.When it does, the film brings the slow boil to a raging inferno, and the connections make themselves in a way that creates great suspense and terror until it all reaches its inevitable crescendo. Peele has, as such, built a perfectly frightening movie, and with its deep societal roots, it is intelligent, and its timeliness ensures its excellence and a historical place.The acting is stupendous, and the twists are crazy good. The comic relief that Rod provides as a goofy TSA agent is a great counterbalance that not only taps into the comic genius that Peele is, but provides the viewer a momentary respite from the immediacy of Chris's plight.10/10. See this movie and see it often.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
What feels like more Hollywood leftist agenda,"Basic run-down of the movie.Black people: GOOD.White people: BAD.I'm not racist at all, but this tends to be some kind of theme that's going on in Hollywood nowadays.

This horror movie getting 99% on rotten tomatoes. I feel like everyone is afraid to bash things that are 'safe space' issues now, but I'm not afraid to say this was an alright movie, certainly not awful, but nowhere near Oscar material or warranting a 99% critical review.I can almost feel the agenda being shoved down my throat on so many movies now.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Watch with an open mind,"I've seen mixed reviews about this movie. Some people loved it while others consider it to display an extreme standpoint of systematic racism. To me, its a well-made horror movie with subtle comedic moments. The perspective, although exaggerated and unrealistic, is fresh and unique. Its a break from typical horror movies and there are great symbolic references through the visuals, dialogue and soundtrack. There is great depth to the scenes and I realized this after reading the IMDb trivia section (avoid it if you haven't watched the movie yet). 
The plot was quite predictable but I was impressed by the way it was executed. The dialogue contains great meaning and provides us an insight into the stereotypes that human beings have to live with everyday. And lastly, it was refreshing to see the black guy actually surviving till the end of a horror movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Enjoyably creepy and tense,"I heard good things about this film, but beyond that I really didn't know much about it - comedy or horror or a mix, that was about it. What I got reminded me of Black Mirror in terms of its tone and dark but yet slightly comic material. The plot starts with an oddly racial situation, where the family are well meaning and accepting, but at the same time not in a way where the black/white divide is not clearly present in some way. From here it starts to add gentle shifts of tension and a creeping sense of unease and dread across the plot. It is this element that works best because it provides engagement, leading to a reasonably short period of reveal and resolution - this final section working best because of the investment in the mystery side.The film is well paced to do this, and the plot is satisfying in the way that it uses race, but at the same time stands on its own feet without it being a theme if you don't see it or want it. First and foremost it is a horror, and it is an effective one. The cast work really well from top to bottom. Kaluuya leads the film well, and is convincing in all his moments. Williams is good, and holds her own alongside Whitford, Root, and Keener. Howery gets his performance just right - he could easily have been too much comedy, but he hits his marks importantly.Get Out is a smartly created horror/chiller where race is used as a strong foundation, but not in a way that the film forgets what it is trying to do.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
7.5/10 Runaway hit - classic mystery horror material,"I made a BIG mistake , I read reviews before seeing this and unfortunately they contained spoilers grrrr - I always try to avoid spoilers and simply let you know whether it's worth seeing or not . Well this is definitely worth seeing . It lives up to the hype and the trailers .Let's talk about the positives - Acting - superb lead role by Daniel Kaluuya he's come a long way since being a parking warden on Harry and Paul . Can see this $100m plus box office hit from a $5m budget catapulting him into the Hollywood big time . Great supporting roles from the rest of the cast in particular Caleb Jones who's sinister presence was felt in every scene he appeared in . Music - the music was superb right from the ' run rabbit run' opening scene - eerie and atmospheric throughout .For a horror there probably weren't enough jump out of your seat moments but it certainly was a cerebral horror and had elements of classics such as Wicker Man , The Village and Hostel in there .Overall this was a good film , it's worth seeing , it's not the best film I've seen but it's certainly not worst . It's above average and will definitely appeal to horror fans .",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Does not live up to the hype.,"This is basically a stupid movie. It's trying to be something different by mixing horror-lite with humour, both of which fall flat as the whole thing is predictable and obvious from early on, and it just isn't funny. Whatever social or cultural attitudes around racism it tries to buck are spoilt by the essential childishness of the whole thing.I get it isn't supposed to be real or even credible but that doesn't excuse some major plot inconsistencies. You expect a movie like this to stretch reality, but too much borders on sheer stupidity.A good idea in principle, totally ruined in execution.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Excellent,"I have never seen a better movie that depicts the insidious, rather than overt, nature of racism. This movie is for all the white folks who think ""they aren't racist."" There are so many layers to this movie: majority culture coercing the minds of the minority, the annoyance of having to explain your identity to every white person around you, the societal eye-rolls when a black person goes missing, the ""violent nature"" of a black man (gaslighting at its finest).. Sometimes, the everyday occurrences that a person experiences is more painful than one traumatic event. This movie perfectly depicts just that.And to all those that complain that this movie ""played the race card:"" this is like complaining that the Pirates of the Caribbean movie played the ""pirate card."" Why isn't racism a legitimate theme in cinema? Oscars, I'm looking at you. I understand why some white folks don't like having a mirror held in front of them, but that doesn't make those suffering from ""well-intentioned"" white people disappear. Looking away is culpability and watching this movie is one small step in the opposite direction. And isn't that the whole point of art? To open your eyes, to make you feel? Doesn't the best kind of art make you feel uncomfortable, and in that discomfort, change your perspective? This is a horror movie told through the eyes of a black man, but unlike slasher films, this horror comes from a very real place. This is what I learned from watching this movie as a white woman, so excuse my ignorance, as I am not black. I can never begin to understand how that feels. Ignorance is bliss, which is a dangerous luxury that is not afforded to all.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Keeps your head spinning until the final act.,"Jordan Peele's Get Out is a new take on a classic story. Get Out takes this approach to examine the state of racism in our so called ""post-racism"" society. From the very start of the film, a sense of uneasiness is present in the main character, Chris. This uneasiness is maintained and heightened as events unfold. Viewers are set into a cycle of uncertainty, fear, and momentary relief; they are pressed with visceral feelings that accumulate as the story unfolds. You really don't know what is going on until the final act of the film where the curtains fly open. The mis-en-scene of every scene is dramatically important; we are given clues of the future from the very start of the film. There are times where a seemingly meaningless joke has tremendous implications. The deep web of foreshadowing can only be appreciated after subsequent viewings.Of course a riveting story is important, but so is the cinematography and sound. Peele's use of zooms, extreme close ups, high angles, low angles, create a collage of scenes that are laid out beautifully on-screen. These techniques enhance the viewer experience and improves storytelling. Sounds are equally important. The phenomenal score bounced between moments of silence and intense, heart wrenching music. The dialogue and acting are both very fluid and the script never stops impressing. Most importantly however, is the use of dietetic sound for storytelling. The main characters experience important moments of sound that impact their state of mind in the scene.Overall the film leaves almost nothing to be desired; it is a journey that ends on a very satisfying note.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"The movie takes common, casual racism and what-ifs it to a whole other level.","I am not a fan of horror genre. I don't enjoy being scared. And I am so glad it didn't stop me from seeing Get Out. It's not the kind of horror that makes you afraid of the dark, or of showers, or whatever innocent inanimate objects. The horror is in the meaning. The movie takes common, casual racism and what-ifs it to a whole other level. Plausibility of the horrific things that happen or lack thereof (that can be an undoing of a movie like this for me) is irrelevant here. It's the symbolism that matters. And this symbolism is very subtle, never in your face. The film delivers a message, yet never appears to be trying to say something.The lead and supporting actors are all great, but I want to give special kudos to Marcus Henderson (Walter), Betty Gabriel (Georgina), and Laketh Stanfeld (Andre Logan King). They had the hardest jobs and they were fantastic. The story flows smoothly. There is never a false moment that could throw you out of the movie's hypnotic grip.

My Kind Of Horror Thriller,"After sitting through two and a third long hours of ""IT"" recently, being bored mostly by the predictable CGI and the usual jolts in today's so called horror films, I just watched ""Get Out"". I wasn't expecting much, as the DVD had 5 mediocre to awful previews. But almost immediately, I became intensely involved by the plot and quality of this film, which mixes social satire and racial issues brilliantly. This is not like most horror films today, but rather more like suspense thrillers as ""The Stepford Wives"", ""the Harvest"", or ""The Tall Man"". The scares are not like jolts, but rather stem from the nervous feeling that kept me glued to the screen, anxious to see what will happen next. I just learned this was the director's first film, though it seemed to have excellent production values and built suspense seamlessly. I love stories where something strange is going on, and the mystery is gradually revealed, like the original ""Invasion Of The Body Snatchers"" or ""Night Of The Living Dead"". For those not looking for gore or shocks, but rather suspense, this should satisfy most of you. But if special effects are your preference, maybe stay away.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A smart satire on social commentary with genuine humor,"The last horror movie I truly enjoyed was probably ""Cabin in the Woods"". Recently, I liked ""Green Room"", and ""Split"", but it continues to be a hard genre to break out with a truly original idea. Jordan Peele's ""Get Out"" felt like the universe had heard my prayers. A smart satire on social commentary with genuine humor, and yet a still bone chilling plot? How have we been so blessed? The balance of horror and comedy is weighted perfectly, with every release of laughter being used to reset the suspense, giving the audience the chance to build back up to paralyzing fear over and over again. All of the performances were pitch perfect (Alison Williams with the keys!), and I anticipate this is only the beginning of Daniel Kaluuya's rise. I often complain to my friends that the biggest disservice of the horror/thriller genre is that by pigeonholing something as ""a scary movie"", you isolate a whole demographic of people who want to just go see a blockbuster on the weekends. Having Peele's name attached and released by Universal on the perfect weekend (only up against week 3 of Lego Batman) gave this layered story a chance to breathe and be appreciated for what it is.

Past nominees from this genre includes The Exorcist, Jaws, Sixth Sense, Black Swan, The Silence of the Lambs (the only winner so far), and now we have a new addition to this prestigious list: Get Out.Get Out tells the story of Chris who's whisked away for the weekend by his girlfriend so he can meet her parents. His nerves are understandable because aside from the possible awkward and tense first meeting, factoring in their interracial relationship, he doesn't just worry if they'll like him for who he is but also for what he is, an African-American. The feeling of uneasiness never escaped him as later his nervousness is converted to fear for his life when things start to unravel as to what the true purpose of the trip was for.I browsed the reception of the movie and it's praises all around and is one of the most buzzed about nominee this year. Of it's four nominations (Picture, Actor, Director, Screenplay), I would have to agree most with the Best Actor nod for Daniel Kaluuya who I remember and loved from one of my favorite Black Mirror episodes: '15 Million Merits', and just yesterday hated (in a good way) as W'Kabi in Black Panther. While he won't probably win (there wasn't enough that can be done with the role compared to Timothee Chalamet's Elio or Gary Oldman's Churchill), those scenes were he cries on point just takes your breath away. As for the rest of the nominations, it might just be me but I don't get the extreme love for it, which includes a 99% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. I get that it's breaking barriers, the symbolism (some of which I got only after reading up on the movie) but to me it's just another horror movie. Maybe I've seen too much of Blumhouse Production movies such as all Purge installments, Insidious, Sinister and Paranormal Activity that's why I'm lumping it with the rest of them. It might win due to it's popularity but if we're talking overall production, it doesn't hold a spoon (pun intended for those who've seen it) at least against CMBYN and Darkest Hour.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Extremely Well-Written Tale of Racial Horrors,"Get Out (2017)*** (out of 4)Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) is a successful black man whose girlfriend Rose (Allison Williams) is taking him to meet her parents for the firs time. Chris is worried that they're going to be put off by him being black but Rose assures him that they're not racist. At first Chris is welcomed by mom (Catherine Keener) and dad (Bradley Whitford) but soon he begins to realize that something isn't quite right.Jordan Peele wrote and directed this film, which pretty much came out of nowhere and became a huge hit with critics and it was an even bigger hit with crowds. I don't think anyone would have guessed that this film would have made the amount of money that it eventually did but it's refreshing to see. GET OUT is certainly a rather strange picture and it's one I'd call ""liberal horror"" and I'd also lump DON'T BREATHE into that genre. I think both films are incredibly interesting and the best part about both of them is the fact that afterwards you can have a discussion about their politics, which is something not too common for a horror picture.For the most part this was a very impressive horror film but I'm not even sure I'd call it a horror movie. I'd probably lean towards calling it a mystery with a pinch of thriller thrown in. The film really plays out like a great episode of The Twilight Zone as we got a terrific setting, a racial undertone and some great performances that keep you guessing at what's going on. We really don't figure out what's happening until there's about twenty-five minutes left to go in the film and I must say that Peele did a wonderful job in the director's chair by having the film hold your attention. Obviously there's a strong screenplay that manages to hold your attention even when there's not much action going on.The film also benefits from some terrific performances. Kaluuya is certainly wonderful in the lead role as he has a lot of different emotions to play. Not only is he the fish out of water but his character is also given some personal drama that plays out throughout the film. Williams is also extremely good because she's playing someone that you don't know where the character stands. She has to walk straight down the line to keep the mystery going and she does so perfectly. Both Keener and Whitford are extremely good as well as is Marcus Henderson.As I said, the racial and political elements are right in your face and it's refreshing seeing a horror movie that doesn't shy away from this. The alternate ending is actually a lot better than what's on the theatrical cut but it's easy to see why it was changed. Heck, I'm shocked that the screenplay was even able to get funding. I think the first hour is much better than the final thirty-five minutes and especially when the mystery is finally revealed. I'm not going to spoil anything but GET OUT certainly makes you discuss what it's about afterwards.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Best original screenplay -- it is what it is and that's good!,"I didn't have any expectations about this movie. I avoided reading reviews and anything, just so I would be surprised. Unfortunately, I didn't see this one on the big screen. I liked the movie, a lot. Horror? It is in a certain way. Racism, of course. It is an American movie with Southern story background, come on, this is like American cliché right there. But it is OK. We all know how races is a big deal in the US. It is maybe the only country where you are forced to think you have a race. I mean, let's not hypocrites here but in the US, it really matters. It is like people are curious to know what mix have you been blended with? Get some white, black, Asian...put in the blender and ... there you are!! It doesn't take the originality of the movie and I don't think it is a big deal but there it is.

This is not the case here. Everything makes sense, and in more than one level. The atmosphere of underlying racism is done in a way that makes people from across the world, who did not have contact with USA slavery issues, get good insight.

a race to the race.,"Instead of spoiling anything, I just feel like telling you a story of mine considering race. I have myself been working with movies, and one experience I have is how I needed to find a better lighting guy. You see, as soon as we put a black person in front of the screen, the lighting guy just didn't know what to DO. It wasn't about race or anything, he just couldn't figure out how to make the lighting look good on any black actress. It just didn't work on screen. Now I have been waiting for this movie forever, and I am a white privileged man –however white trash-but I live in a racist underdeveloped country (Sweden, oh the irony) so I found it necessary this morning to just download a shitty cam version of it, and all I can think of is how beautifully lit it is even on a cam version, how the light reflects so well on those ebony bodies even in the dark scenes, their white teeth, their genetic frame and whoops we are back into race again. This movie is very subtle, but always constant, in its remarks on unconscious racism. The direction is ever so slightly off beat sometimes to be subtle, perhaps because it handles issues almost too absurd to handle,but it is truly on the top in the absurdist horror genre right up there with films such as It Follows, The Babadook, and Scream. What this film eventually does is asking the big questions, like where consciousness is even located, which made me respect the script even more. Big ups to Jordan Peele, I seriously didn't think he had this in him, except for the occasional brilliant Key and Peele sketches such as Lil' Homie. Give this nigga an Oscar already. Since these are big questions to handle it never gets too gory, and the slight nuances in the acting is superb. Catherine Keeners evil goddamn chuckle as we remember it from films such as Being John Malkovich is right on spot, and Dexter's sister is brilliant in voice control (the phone scene!). All this being said, there is a contraption men can wear nowadays that with small electrodes let you feel what it is like to have a vagina and go through a period. This movie is as close you can get (apart from wearing a blackface?) from understanding racial tension nowadays. An important and very entertaining movie. You got soul.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
'Get Out' Gets It,"Is it possible for a movie to be both stupid and smart? both blunt and subtle? Generally speaking, ""no"". But in the case of a film like ""Get Out"", the answer is very much ""yes"". ""Get Out"" is a movie of contradictions. As opposed to being a weakness, the contradictions are completely the point and the movie radiates with them.This is the directorial debut of Jordan Peele. Better known as the second half of the comedy duo Key & Peele, a duo that has forayed into the movies since the end of their series. Last year it was the comedy ""Keanu"" and now we have Peele by himself behind the camera. For a directorial debut, he shows a real eye for using the camera as an integral aspect of storytelling. Also, he seems to inherently understand what makes good horror work: it's not necessarily what you see that scares you, but what lurks just out of sight.Further, if this movie was just a skillfully directed horror piece that would be impressive enough, but hung within this horror framework are instances when it also manages to be an entertaining comedy. Without giving anything away, there are two moments of spectacularly jarring musical choices that should jolt the audience out of the movie. Nevertheless, due to the way that the movie is woven together, they become humorous moments without breaking any of the tension.If all you want is a horror movie that avoids the worst clichés of the genre (e.g. annoying characters doing truly stupid things) then you should enjoy yourself just fine. However, there is so much more to uncover within this movie.You might be able to guess from the ads that racism plays a pivotal role in this movie. Yet, no one in this movie gives the appearance of being a traditional racist. The movie is much to savvy to depict stereotypical racism. Instead, it delves into far more insidious forms of racism and, by doing so, many of the same story elements could be used to examine any form of prejudice.On closer inspection, this film exceeds the expectations of a comedic horror movie wherein brain transplant surgery is a real thing. Just as with prejudice, if you take this film at face value, then you've missed the subtle undertones that give life depth. Peele retells a moral told many times before, yet somehow manages to make it feel fresh and interesting.Peele's directing career is off to a very strong start. I'm exciting to see what he makes next.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Want humor and horror? You got it!,"Jordan Peele has a future as a writer -director. So expertly does he navigate genres in Get Out that I'm struggling to come up with one descriptor; rather I want to put them all in a stew and hyphenate: horror-comedy-social commentary-psychological thriller.Young black man, Chris (Daniel Kaluuya), goes for weekend with white girlfriend, Rose (Allison Williams) to her parents' home way out in the woods. The scary tropes are all there including strange servants and wacky psychologist mom (Katherine Keener), all overseen by equally off-center neurosurgeon dad.If you mash up Guess Who's Coming to dinner with Stepford Wives and add a dash of Freddy for scary laughs, then you'll understand my enthusiasm for this first effort by an entertainer now firmly right behind Damien Chazelle for young, promising filmmakers.Enjoy brains tossed in a trash bucket and wildly-inappropriate social comments (comments that at the same time as the humor allow Peele to draw on the absurdities of contemporary correctness and social engineering). No social hot button about the place of minorities is not pushed, albeit superficially, but in depth for a horror film.Now I know why I was so disappointed in the recent Split directed by M. Night Shyamalan: His horror flick was aiming for the expected twist without finesse and understatement. Get Out is assuredly aiming at the incendiary interracial flash point while it attends to issues of conformity and mind control in contemporary society.This film, however, never loses its sense of humor when it regularly lards the narrative with cell phone conversations between Chris and his shlubby buddy, Rod (LilRel Howlery). It's hilarious use of ethnic humor to advance the plot and provide comic relief from the considerably-scary goings-on. I haven't laughed as heartily as this in a long time.As amused as I was with Peele's virtuosity, I was perplexed that such a fine genre buffet as this should be released at dumping-ground movie-release time. Surprisingly as well, I have not been as vicariously scared in a long time, perhaps because, stripped of its horror and humor, Get Out is also about us all with our private prejudices fueled by our need to control others when we can't control ourselves.Enjoy this rich amalgam of light-hearted hokum and genre mixing--or enjoy excellent filmmaking.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"a great jumpy, psychological horror with suitable laughs",Get Out is a great horror film for horror movie fans. there are unexpected laughs in the film that go with the subject of racism in America and sex slaving between the main guy Chris and his best friend Rod. all the performances are really good especially for the newcomer Daniel Kaluuya who plays the main guy Chris who goes to his girlfriends family's house estate to see her parents who are greatly performed by Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener. this does deliver a couple of jump scares but it focuses on the psychological side of the film which I think it's a good thing that happens in the film.I think that this film is great for all horror movie fans all out there from all around the world.,10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Quite a different story that makes for an interesting movie...,"It was without no knowledge about what this movie was about when I sat down to watch ""Get Out"". The only thing that I did know about it was the fact that it was a horror movie, and I do enjoy horror movies quite a lot.I will say that the movie does start out quite alright, albeit it doesn't really have that horror genre feel to it. But the story soon takes a turn into a more bizarre twist. And I mean that in a good way, because the way the story was constructed and set up was actually quite intricate and interesting. Director and writer Jordan Peele managed to introduce an element of confusion to the movie, which keeps the audience in the dark and have the audience guessing at just what exactly is going on. And that was a great accomplishment and definitely something that added a dynamic layer to the movie.And while the story did seem quite odd and bizarre, it was actually a really good story, and it turned out to be quite interesting and actually well-thought through.Director Jordan Peele was able to skillfully introduce some great build ups of drama, tension and suspense throughout the course of the movie. And the climaxes of these build ups were equally well brought to realization as well. Again, this really added a lot of depth and worth to the movie.Furthermore, the movie was really helped a great long way by having some really good acting performances by the cast. I must admit that I was especially impressed with Daniel Kaluuya's performance and how at ease he seemed to be in this role. And I was also quite impressed with Betty Gabriel, although I think it was a shame that her role wasn't bigger and that she only had limited screen time.The odd dialogue by various characters thought-out the entire movie actually makes sense when the revealing of what actually was happening took place. I will be the first to admit that I was quite puzzled and was wondering about much of the dialogue throughout the movie. But when the plot was revealed, and you look back at the dialogue it all just makes perfect sense.""Get Out"" is labeled as a horror mystery, but I would say that the mystery aspect of the movie far outweighs the horror aspect. But then again, I would say it is more of a thriller than it is a horror movie. Regardless, then ""Get Out"" is quite an entertaining and interesting movie.For a directorial debut for Jordan Peele then ""Get Out"" is quite an accomplishment. I was more than genuinely entertained by this movie, and can warmly recommend that you take the time to sit down and watch ""Get Out"".",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

one of few horror movie that I liked,"""Get Out"" delves deep into the unsettling territory of societal horrors, earning its 7/10 rating as a film that's genuinely liked. Jordan Peele's directorial debut is a breath of fresh air in the horror genre, blending sharp social commentary with spine-tingling suspense. The standout acting, particularly by Daniel Kaluuya, lends authenticity to the characters and their disturbing predicament. The film's clever editing and cinematography heighten the tension, keeping you on the edge of your seat. While the film's message on race relations is thought-provoking, some viewers might find it heavy-handed at times. The score and sound design amplify the eerie atmosphere, adding to the film's overall impact.

Unexpectedly good,"When I had finished watching this, I felt the film-viewing equal of 'Wow, that was a really satisfying meal!' And I had really not been expecting it to be as good as it was. I don't mean that I thought it would be trash or b-grade. I just wasn't expecting something so powerful really, as a horror, as a dark comedy, as satire and as social commentary.I loved this film's use of metaphors. Others here have drawn attention to the themes of covert racism that is a disease of power, control and dominance of whites over blacks whilst projecting a smiling, friendly face. Yes. Absolutely. And also about cultural appropriation; admiration and envy for those attributes of a people where there is no respect for the people as fully human beings, even often as not fully sentient beings, less than animals.'Stuff' to be exploited for one's own benefit. I am very sure this is what the 'dark place' alludes to, being pushed into a place of nowhere as your world is gradually stolen from you.The humour in this that is not really satire, is found in relief scenes centred around Chris's (the victim) best friend who senses something is NQR from the beginning but cannot persuade his friend of this.I look forward to more from this writer/director.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Jordan Peele's marvelous start into directing,"Get Out is creepy horror/mystery involving hints of great humor and strong message behind the terrifying plot. Daniel Kaluuya who plays the main character Chris Washington does a brilliant job in showing what the character is boldly thinking and does this with uses of thoughts out loud. Normally i would see this type of acting unprofessional, however this fitted in brilliantly with Jordan Peele's style of comedy he wanted to added smartly into the horror. The rest of the cast do a amazing job at giving that uncomfortable feeling Chris is going through. The moment they pull into the drive way of the house it immediately feels scary and that something isn't quite right.Although some scary scenes were quite predictable and had their fair share of jump scares. The originality was most definitely their and is definitely a completely out there horror we haven't seen for a while. I particularly impressed by the opening scene especially after hearing it was filmed in one take. It put viewers straight into the plot of the film and gives you a mysterious overview of the villain in the film and how it is later shown towards the end of the film. Lots of links between scenes were used to form a great use of intensity that had me trying to hide in my jumper.LilRel Howery who played Rod a very close friend to Chris completely stole the show with every scene he was included in. He uplifted the film at the perfect moments with great use of humor and had some of the best lines in the script by far. The twist was absolutely perfect and was portrayed at a great time in the movie and was surprisingly unpredictable. It also formed a good transition to start the grand finale of the filming.The film was not riddled with action and contained a large amount of slow yet interesting scenes that gave clues towards the whole mystery behind the family and house. Jordan Peele was able to enlarge the worldwide problem of racism and had almost everybody thoroughly thinking about how African Americans are still treated in certain states of America that i admittedly wasn't aware of was still occurring.Even though the film showed a unrealistic and paranormal theme. It related effectively with lots of real life scenarios.In conclusion Get Out was heavily intense, scary and enjoyable film especially considering it was Jordan Peele's first ever film directing. You can definitely tell that the plot was well thought through and i'm excited to see more films by Mr Peele down the line of the film industry. I would most certainly watch this film again and recommend it to anyone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A movie with the depth of a Tales from the Crypt episode,"Despite my rating, I don't hate this film. I find it to be an unspecial movie that doesn't know if it's a horror or comedy one. Surprisingly Jordan Peele has some film knowledge, and it shows a couple of times in the film, for example the opening or the hypnosis scenes. Overall this movie is decent on a technical aspect, but what ruins it is the script.
Full with plot holes and clichés and nonsense, the movie is just stupid. It tries to be more than what it is introducing social and political commentary. First of all, i'm not american, i'm mexican. And second, I don't care about what happens in the USA. For me, a movie that says that racism is bad and white people are bad, will not have an impact on me. I don't hate white people like a lot of americans, i'm not a SJW, and I don't sympatize with black people (because they are the most racist towards latin americans, believe or not). So, the fact that this movie has this message, doesn't make it good. Letting this aside, we just have another generic horror movie, with stupid jumpscares and stupid characters and bad acting (except Daniel Kaluuya, he does a good job) and a stupid script (we know why this won an Oscar, because is a movie made by black people).

And if a movie calls its own genre ""thriller"" or ""horror"", then the movie should keep some level of atmosphere, to make the audience tense up to some point. Not saying that the atmosphere was even there, it was made even worse by inserting some random jokes in between the movies, which of course wasn't even humorous. And the character development was the worst thing in this movie, as some character shows passionate caring attitude and all of the sudden he/she turns into a complete psychopath. It was so abrupt that he/she would even change the way he/she speaks to a person that's not even supposed to know something happened. One of the key evidence that this movie was made without brains.Let's just be honest. The movie makers only cared about making profit. Mixing horror, comedy, and not forgetting to insert white-is-evil rich-is-evil theme inside with a black person as main, so that you can call all negative reviewers ""racist"" (and sorry, I'm not even white). Then using some way to make people spam positive reviews, most of them which I highly doubt even saw the movie.

"An absorbing psychological thriller, that's even darker than it seems","I wasn't sure when I saw the trailer. It had the potential to be one of two things, either a very clever psychological thriller, or a puff piece telling us how all white people are evil.I'm glad to report, that it's the former. This is a cracking film.The set up; a young black guy is about to meet the family of his white girlfriend for the first time. He's a little apprehensive, but she assures him that it'll be fine, her parents are anything but racist, in fact her dad would have voted for Obama for a third term if he'd been allowed too. But, when they get there, things don't seem quite right, it's hard to explain why, but something's definitely wrong.Daniel Kaluuya (nice to see an English guy in an American film not playing the bad guy) plays Chris, our poor unsuspecting boyfriend. He is the lynch pin to the story, everything revolves around him, and he's superb. Allison Williams plays Rose, the girlfriend.If you've seen the trailer you'll know that Rose's family live in the whitest of white neighbourhoods, the handful of black people that do live in the area, seem to be acting very oddly indeed.This is another film with a small budget. There have been a few recently, and I'm starting to believe that some films just spend money for the sake of it, sometimes at the expense of telling a story. Get Out cost somewhere around $5,000,000 to make. As I write this, it's apparently taken more than $130,000,000 in the USA alone. This shows just what you can do with a well written script, some good acting, and some high-quality production values, if you have all that, then you have a really good piece of work on your hands. There are also very few special effects in this film, and those that are used, are very simple, you could probably recreate them on your phone. The film relies on its astute writing, and that's a great thing.I was just asked if this is a horror? No. I don't care what IMDb says, I don't care what anyone else tells you, Get Out is a thriller, and a good one at that. There is very little in the way of blood and guts violence, it's all about atmosphere, about a palpable creepiness factor. There are points where it's actually hard to watch. There was also one moment that springs to mind, that caused popcorn fly around the theatre, but even that wasn't a horror moment, it was a great use of sound.The story is a good one. The production values are lovely. It's creepy, it's funnydid I mention the humour? The interactions between Chris and his best friend Rod (LilRel Howery) are wonderful. They might be a little over the top at times, but if you took this situation and transposed it into real life, then it would be pretty surreal, it would be over the top, so oddly, those moments fit in beautifully with the rest of the film.Get Out isn't just Chris on his own, it's also filled with a litany of wonderful performances. Everyone portrays their character perfectly. Roses parents walk a fine line between seeming awkward and menacing. Her brother is an off the wall loon. The other local white people are so odd, even for rich white people. As for the few black people that Chris meets whilst he's there, wow, they would make anyone feel uncomfortable.The score is powerful, I can't think of a better way to describe it, it adds so much to the feel, to the atmosphere. The story moves along at a good pace, there isn't time for you to switch off or get bored. In fact, the story is key here, you think you know what's going on, but things aren't quite what they seem, even in a film that is based around the concept of things not being as they seem, and the film is clever in the way that it let's go of its secrets, you find out when Chris finds out, because of that, you really feel a part of the narrative, it draws you in.I was worried that this was going to be a film that states that all white people are racist, and this is evidence of how far they'll go. But its not, it's so much more than that.I don't want to go into details, but there are moments when you're thinking ""how are you going to get out of this one Chris?"" It brings out genuine intrigue, it makes you think, it keeps you on your toes.I really liked it. I'm not going to do what a friend of mind would do, and scream ""it's the film of the year!"" from the highest point I can find, but it's defiantly up there as one of the best of the year so far. At 104 minutes, it's not a very long film, but like everything else about it, it seems just right.This is well worth watching, in fact I'd say you're an idiot if you pass up the opportunity to see it.A wonderful film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Surprisingly Pleasant movie experience.,"I came into this movie expecting something to be pounding racism as the main theme. I expected it to just be about racism and how certain groups of people want to go back to the days of slavery. It didn't hit racism in a way that was meant to make people feel uncomfortable. The remarks about racism are more common themes and not the point of the movie. I don't Want to spoil the movie, as the overall plot is interesting. Just this movie being primarily about racism would likely keep many away from it. It does have themes involving racism, but that is not the primary objective of the movie as far as I can see.The movie has a slow build, but really picks up around an hour in. The build feels justified at the end. There's a particularly comical character that is scene more and more as the movie goes and steals the show towards the end. The plot twist is particularly interesting as it's not quite what was expected and yet seems like a reasonable twist.Not a fantastic movie, but overall a fun movie going experience. Not excessively gory to prevent people who don't enjoy those parts in movies, but it is R for a reason. Just seems like a good balance that really surprised me that I didn't regret seeing it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Overall great, thought provoking movie.","Racism is Real? Get Out.If you are looking for a thrilling movie that simultaneously attacks today's controversies, Get Out is a must see movie. This newly- released horror film has been all the rage. I had heard many positive reviews before seeing this movie, so my expectations were relatively high. I was expecting a somewhat scary film; a thrilling story of a boyfriend whose girlfriend's family has a plan to destroy him. What I was not expecting was a thought-provoking film that cleverly confronts the ever-present issue of racism. Director Jordan Peele has discovered a way to throw a controversial topic into a horror and comedy and impressively wrap it all into one. I found myself laughing out loud as Lil Rel Howery, who plays a TSA agent that is best friends with the main character, comes to the rescue to save his best friend. ""Man, I told you not to go into that house,"" he says at the end. This film includes many classic horror scenes and gore. But this film causes viewers to take a look at racism in a terrifying but real way. This movie is an original; Jordan Peele does something never before done in the movie industry. Although I was slightly upset with the abrupt ending to this movie, I couldn't be more impressed with the overall film. If you believe in reverse racism and are a white lives matter advocate, get out of the showing of this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Get Out - Movie review,"""Get out"" is a movie that came out last year and is directed by first time director Jordan Peele. This film is about an interracial couple between a black man (Daniel Kaluuya) called Chris and a white woman (Allison Williams) called Rose, and now Chris with Rose go on vacation at the house were there parents live . In that house Chris meets Rose's family and he doesn't feel so comfortable in this environment, he feels awkward and weird and that is meanly because he is black. And later on in the movie we find out some deeps secrets about this family and maybe some dark stuff is going to get him.Now look, before i saw this film i was really excited, because i watch some of the review from professional critics and they were saying that this film was a masterpiece, a unique experience. In Rotten Tomatoes this film has 99%. So this film instantly went into my radar but i didn't have the chance to see it until this year. And now the Academy Awards nominated this film for four Oscars including Best picture, director, actor and screenplay. This film supposedly had all positive, and now i got the chance to watch it and...well, this is my viewpoint.I don't hate ""Get Out"", i think it is a good movie, but i don't think it is a great movie. I was kind of disappointed with this film to be honest. But let's talk about the positives things first.Daniel Kaluuya gave a terrific performance here, thought out this film we see this character progress and change, and i did care about him in some of hard-core scenes, he did a good job. Jordan Peele's direction was good, there are some things in this film that kind of reminded me of the way Stanley Kubrick directed his films. From the way the opening scenes were going along i was enjoying it. From the way the shots are made and the amazing score, it feel like i was watching a horror film from the 90's. The tension and the suspense surrounding this house and this family is very well done and when a character is in danger you feel that danger. This movie also knows how to make the comedy pop, in movie like this you expect to see the scary things pop out , and this movie does that, but also knows how to make the film funny at times. And you laugh when you are suppose to be laughing, there is not weird sentiment of: We should be laughing or should be scary? - The film doesn't do that.That is what i loved about this film, but, as always, this film has flaws. I think that the major problem that i have with this film is the tone. This film for the majority of it is a suspense movie, things pop out, weird stuff happens. But in the final scene of the movie, it feels like a completely different film. I not going to spoil it of course, but for me just didn't work and i felt that the end of the film was kind of messy. Another flaw with the film for me is LilRel Howery's character. In this film he plays a friend of Kaluuya's character and he is always talking in the phone, and for the majority of the film his character was very funny and Howery was doing a good job as this character, i felted that by the end is was useless. I mean he does things in the movie for sure, but he didn't added to much to film beside some funny jokes and thats it. I also felted that this movie was a little too long, and there are some scenes were Chris goes out of the house to take pictures of things because he is a photographer, and from that scenes, i'm out. There are boring and it doesn't help too much to the film.Guys, like i said at the beginning of my review, i don't hate this movie. But i thinks is getting a little overrated. The hype and excitement for this movie is putting this film very high and in my opinion it doesn't deserves it. My best way to describe this film is comparing it with another film i saw a couple years ago called ""American Sniper"", that film got a lot of positives reviews, got academy awards nominations, and it was put as an amazing war film. But when i saw it i was kind of disappointed with that film too. That is my exact feeling with this movie, for me ""Get Out"" is 2017's ""American Sniper"". Is a good film for sure, but is not a great one. But as always i'm just giving my honest opinion here. If you loved this movie, good for you, if you hated this movie, good for you also, all the opinions are welcome here. For me this was good horror movie and i had fun with it at times, and because of that i'm going to give this film a 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Didn't believe the hype,"Against my better judgement I watched this film. I don't buy into the hype of anything and as usual, this film was forgotten and never once brought up in conversation since its run in theatres ended.Thanks a lot Jordan Peele, but I've already seen ""The Skeleton Key"". Don't get me wrong, decent script, decent cast, Bradley Whitford may have been the best apart (Wouldn't be fair to say Stephen Root since he is amazing in everything i've ever seen him in).Anyway, there was no hype. A very mediocre story that loses its tension; voluntarily, with an incredibly predictable ending.It would seem most people rating this a 10/10 Should go watch the aforementioned film. I surmise you will rate it a 20/10 as it was played out far better than this film.Should have stuck to my guns and avoided this at all costs. Good idea for the story though. Could have used some more originality.... ironic since this won best original screenplay.But that's what you get when you overhype something, a hard dose of reality. I will say that simplicity saved what could of this story. Don't overcomplicate it. Don't overdo it. Don't overhype it either..its just bad for business.Entertainment Value 5.5/10
Overall 6/10Would not watch again. Shouldn't have watched the first time.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Relevant, Intelligent, Terrifying, Hilarious, Entertaining","Jordan Peele, of Key and Peele fame, kicks off his directorial career with a genre-swapping film that depicts a young black man's ill-fated journey to his white girlfriend's parents' house. There he finds that all is not as it should be, and that his prospective in-laws may not be as normal as they appear to be.The atmosphere of 'Get Out' is one of the very best you can create in a film. Spine-chillingly creepy at times, with foreshadowing and acting that works better than any jump scare, and at other times raucously enjoyable, witty, and entertaining, it succeeds across all fronts. Daniel Kaluuya makes for a relatable and likable protagonist that the audience can root for, whilst Lil Rel Howery as his erstwhile and foul-mouthed friend is huge fun, and one of the standout comedy characters in recent years. The parents, played note-perfectly by Catherine Keener and Bradley Whitford, represent a ramped-up version of the so-called 'West Wing liberals', the type of people who purport to be progressive and welcoming, but inadvertently make black people uncomfortable with racial stereotypes and microaggressions.The film ends up being one of the best cinematic examples of presenting race in a long time. Perfectly capturing the zeitgeisty racial divide in modern America, its depiction of the daily struggles faced by minorities is remarkable, and one of the scariest aspects of the film is how plausible and true to life it all is (up to a point). The satire is delivered flawlessly, and Peele deserves all the plaudits he is receiving for the astounding first-time effort he has made here. Combining his fresh, razor-sharp and highly witty script with the subtle yet 100% effective direction, he has made a film that is not only one of the best satires of modern times, but also an incredibly enjoyable horror-comedy.It is not quite accurate to label 'Get Out' a true horror film. It is certainly scary, mainly stemming from the experience Kaluuya's Chris has to go through, which transports the viewer into his shoes and leaves us on edge throughout the buildup. However, if you go in expecting a Halloween-ready horror film that will rival the horror classics, you will inevitably be disappointed. It is more of a horror-style thriller, with its dynamic plot taking the audience on a twisty and unpredictable journey that lets the viewer piece it together whilst going along.Overall, 'Get Out' is probably the best film of the first few months of 2017. Being fresh, innovative, thrilling, scary, and sharply scripted, Jordan Peele's debut is promising and it's an important film for the issue of race. 91/100.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
This has got to be the greatest movie I have ever seen!,"This movie blew my mind, I still can't get over the fact that Jordan Peele from Key & Peele actually wrote and directed this film. I don't want to get into much detail here, but I simply love this film. Get Out! has to be (in my opinion) the scariest films I've simply ever seen in my life. I had to watch the film a second time to fully understand what was the message Jordan Peele was sending. The message was so deep that I couldn't sleep at night. Most of the actors in the film were not very well known actors in the film, but they were able to pull it off with an awesome performance. The acting was great, the dialogue was great, the comedy was fantastic and the horror was superb. I have to grade this movie an A+, 10/10, 5 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Get Out (Quick Review),"Excellent ""slow cook"" Horror movie!!! The pacing is well timed, and the reveals happen naturally. The plot is deeper than race, but you have to watch the movie to understand why. Decent sound design (tea cup) and I love the 50+ mm CUs (when they happen, it's for a reason). Good comedic timing to release tension.. Seriously, it's an awesome Horror movie.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Creepy and fun,"The dialogue can feel a bit clumsy and is not as nuanced as advertised. The subtle racism isn't all that subtle and cheapens the desired impact. The first 40 mins are a bit slow and the most conventional. However, after this point the film really begins to take stride and Peele starts to amp up the growing sense of anxiety of Chris' situation. Satisfying resolutions. Sometimes the comedy felt out of place, but I liked it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Groundbreaking film may define a new genre,"Jordan Peele has described this movie as a ""social thriller"", and in some respects his use of small, subtle cues to build a growing sense of unease borrows heavily from the ""psychological thriller"" genre made popular by Alfred Hitchcock. Part of this film's strength lies in the frank examination of social expectations and nonverbal communication. Chris, the main character sees, and hears many things that bother him and contribute to his anxiety. But because he is in a social situation where awkwardness and stereotypical gaffes are something he expects, he writes off many of his experiences as misunderstandings or coincidences, or of examples of ways in which his own social expectations are out of place. He is unable to clearly verbalize what's bothering him. He therefore overlooks things that, to his friend Rod, are gigantic warning flags, while voluntarily putting himself in a situation where he is more and more helpless to escape when he finally realizes he's in danger.It may be necessary to draw a distinction between a ""psychological"" thriller, wherein the key factor driving the plot and the decision making of the characters is the internal thoughts and feelings of the characters, and a ""social"" thriller in which the tension comes from the interaction between different characters and the contrast in their expectations as to what behavior is or is not appropriate. Is a particular behavior creepy, abnormal, and worthy of a jump scare? Or is it simply a normal aspect of a social situation in which the main character is not comfortable? The way Chris begins to question and second-guess himself, and the way he starts to doubt his own instincts and intuition, comes almost entirely from the social aspects of the situation he's in.Unlike many horror films in which the victims do phenomenally stupid things, this film accurately depicts exactly why Chris tolerates what most people would consider inappropriate behavior, and why he stays at the Armitage home instead of leaving. Every single decision he makes is completely understandable, even when it puts him at risk. Frequently even his riskier behavior is the only possible option given his life experiences and his emotional state.Race, and racism, are omnipresent in this movie and some of it is overt. Chris is treated differently, objectified, and patronized by the Armitages and some of their friends. In the midst of a scene where ""White"" racial stereotypes of ""Black"" people are being trotted out and exaggerated to the point of hilarity, Peele injects a few lines of dialogue with a Japanese character who, ironically, can easily be interpreted as a stereotype. With layer after layer of irony, the film subtly mocks its own effort to deconstruct racial stereotyping.Lacking the stereotypical gratuitous nudity and sex many people associate with horror, this movie has several violent scenes at the end but is not gratuitously gory. The victim's helplessness, and the casual predatory nature of the villains (who really are Up To Something) is conveyed almost entirely through the acting, which is outstanding. Many horror conventions are turned on their heads, such as who the victims are and who the villain or villains might be.It is also important to pay attention to the score. The background music for this movie is spectacular, particularly ""Sikiliza Kwa Wahenga"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"While the film does boast some talent, the film itself wallows in self importance.","Let me start off by saying this: Get Out is far from a bad film. It is genuinely frightening at times and, dare I say, even genius at some moments. But the film's biggest problem is that it knows it is a step above other horror films and it reeks of self importance. When you take into consideration the political climate in America, Get Out is a film that is hitting at a right time. It is tackling white liberal racism in the upper middle class and it does a very good job at making its point. However, as the film goes on and the scares become more frequent, the film starts feeling cheesy and overwritten even if the performances are truly stunning.Director Jordan Peele makes the most out of his cast. Daniel Kaluuya gives a truly magnificent performance as Chris while Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener are utterly horrifying as the Armitages. However, Allison Williams is a weak link and is very dry in her delivery which makes her performance comes off as wooden. She is the weak link and it isn't hard to figure it out especially in her scenes with Kaluuya. The story progresses and Williams' performance is slowly twiddled down which then leaves the glaring issue of the script. While the characters in this film are really layered and relate-able, the story they are in is so overwritten and self indulgent that it is hard to consider this the horror gem many critics and audiences are calling it.The idea of a great horror film is to thrill and scare while making a social commentary. We look back on such films as Rosemary's Baby, Night of the Living Dead, Friday the 13th (maybe), Halloween...these films have weight to them and you don't know it until it's over. With Get Out, we know this is a film with political undertones, we know it wants us to think this is something more than a horror film. In some regards it is, but in most it is just a horror film that thinks it is more important than it actually is. This takes from what Peele is trying to achieve with directing a horror film. Everything comes off being very tongue-in- cheek instead of being straight horrifying and that is probably the most disappointing factor with Get Out. Instead of sinking these political undertones in the writing, Peele makes them abundantly clear and it ends up taking away from a film that is, otherwise, pretty good.Get Out is a step above your average horror film and features some pretty amazing performances. Despite this, the film suffers from a very weak script that will feel as if you're being hit over the head with political banter rather than having the sh*t scared out of you. Overall, I was pretty disappointed in Get Out but the film does feature some awesome performances and some genuine scares that will be enough to make you wish the film was better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Real Doggone Keeper!,"I just saw Jordan Peele's directorial debut ""Get Out"" last evening in my local theater and I was blown away by how clever, funny, insightful, and of course unsettling it was. It was deliciously weird, eerie, and clever from the very first scene to the last, as I sat transfixed by the events occurring on the screen. Watching the trailers and seeing the first two acts of the film made me think something quite different from what the film actually turned out to be, and I have to commend Peele for being able to pull that off so well. It's rare that my predictions for the ""twist"" or finale to a movie are so off the mark!But focusing on the plot itself, it follows a young black man named Chris (Daniel Kaluuya), who is actually British in real life but I never would have guessed had I not seen interviews with him, another testament to his incredible acting prowess, and his white girlfriend Rose (Allison Williams) who have been dating for five months and decide it's time for Chris to meet Allison's upper class, bourgeois-type parents (Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener) who live on a large family estate in an affluent suburb. This affluent suburb also happens to be the location where several black people, mostly men, have gone missing for many years, vanishing under mysterious circumstances. Chris is a bit hesitant and nervous because Rose has apparently not told her parents that she is dating a black man, but she assures him that everything will be fine and they are definitely not racist.However, immediately after they arrive, Chris quickly realizes, more and more over the course of his little ""visit"", that they may not be overtly racist they do hold certain views towards black people that are a bit odd to say the least. Coming from a satirical perspective as Peele, who also wrote the film, has stated, Chris, and indeed the audience, isn't sure how to take some of the things they say, whether or not they are just snide, off-hand remarks or hinting at something more sinister going on behind the polite, cheerful, Stepford-esque facade. In addition to the family itself, there are also two black servants, Walter and Georgina, who also seem incredibly ""off' as if something isn't quite right in their heads. They seem too polite, too well-spoken, and too ""white"", for lack of a better term, to Chris, who nevertheless tries to maintain his composure and hide his true thoughts to his girlfriend, and the family in general.Unfortunately, as Chris soon finds out, he has every reason to feel paranoid. At a garden party, another black man who seems oddly familiar to Chris, temporarily snaps out of his robotic persona and desperately screams at him to ""Get Out!"" before it's too late. He quickly realizes that something is terribly wrong and that his very life, or at least his mind, might be in jeopardy.I have rarely seen a film where just about every single member of the cast, from the main protagonist, antagonists, and side characters give outstanding performances, performing all the little nuances and quirks of their character to an absolute T. This definitely includes Chris's friend Rod (Lil Rey Howery), who provides most of the comic relief of the film, but is also able to carry on the more dramatic scenes effectively. Also, I can't forget to mention the amazing score for the film, which is a mix of blues, funk, and a truly haunting Swahili folk song which plays over the opening and end credits.An absolute treat from start to finish, and aside from a few clichéd horror movie moments here and there, a true marvel of cinema. Definitely the sort of film to watch at least twice, as once you know the twist, you can go back and see the film from an entirely different perspective, and all the confusing pieces of the surrealist puzzle fall into place. That's all folks!",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Get Into the Theaters to see Get Out,"Do young black males in America feel like they're being hunted? The movie ""Get Out"" directed by Jordan Peele was a thriller in every sense of the word. The 2017 film is one that will go down in history for a variety of reasons. The director is known for his show ""Key and Peele"" which is a riot for any comedy fan. Peele has been a strict comedy director for many years—making this film a surprise. I expected this film to be comedic in nature and probably not to thrilling. I waited a couple weeks to see it but decided it was a must after the pop culture following. Every social media account of mine was laced with friends' admiration for this film. With this in mind I went into the theater expecting allusions to our culture's view on race.To say ""Get Out"" met my expectations is an understatement. I was blown away with the rest of America with this film. There was a perfect blend in this movie: comedy, horror, and thrills throughout the whole 103 minutes. There are allusions to the way young black men must feel in our country—hunted. The throne of privilege young white women sit upon is addressed, and the comedy we all have grown to adore from Jordan Peele is prevalent. In one scene Rose, played by Allison Williams, seems to be standing up for Chris, played by Daniel Kaluuya, by not letting the officer who pulled them over take his license. Rose did this because he wasn't driving so it seems like a noble gesture; the real reason Rose doesn't want the officer to have his license is chilling.I loved this film. With an astonishing $154.5 million dollar box office grossing and an even more astonishing $4.5 million dollar budget, Peele—a first time thriller film writer and director—has out done himself.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Shocking. Disturbing. Necessary in a Trump Presidency.,"I don't got to movie theaters often. With Netflix and other online video websites, the need isn't clear for the theater. As soon as I laid eyes on the ""Get Out"" trailer, it was immediately clear why I needed to see this in theater with others. The subject matter was heavy. The acting was precise. The story line was provocative. There was some concern early on that the trailer gives away too much. It does show a lot of crucial moments but there are shocking twists that go way beyond the trailer.This movie could not be more relevant or necessary in the Trump Presidency in which we find ourselves if for nothing else than to discuss perspectives on race and perception.10 out of 10 stars.PS: Jordan Peele directorial debut was a major success.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Surprising in its unflinching social commentary,"I think the biggest surprise of this film is just how deeply it really digs into the social commentary that is at its core. That drives the film's themes and it's what makes the genre thrills and horror work. The biggest thing that stood out to me was the absolutely fantastic ensemble cast. The film needs a certain type of acting in its first two acts in order to give enough suspense and enough detail as to what it's about, and the actors have a very clear idea of what the tone needs to be. They're pitch perfect in their work. The film is also very well directed and paced, and it's a total blast to sit through it with a large group of people.

"Man, I've been waiting for this flick for a while I knew this was going to be awesome!!","Being known for his half of the comedy duo Key and Pelle, writer, director, Jordan Peele seem to be doing something out of his element at first seeing that Get Out is a horror film, but this film has all his markings of his feelings on life that he has done many times over in his comedy.Chris is a black dude going out with a white woman, who takes him to see her family. He's worried about them flipping out when they find out he's black. He's got bigger things to worry about.It does have that feel of a Key and Peele sketch as Chris tries to be the only black man in an all white world. He hits it on the mark with the awkwardness of dealing with a society who has never interacted with a black person that did not work for them, and Chris' discomfort being the only black person in the house who is not serving the white folks. Then like all good Key and Peele sketches the movie ends on an extremely crazy scenario.Jordan Peele is a genius in the way he was able to create a film that was both a great horror film and funny as hell, but not because the horror was campy.You can relate to the social issues of race being handled in the film, and it's strange because most of it is not met to be funny at all, but it connects like Jordan is telling a joke. On top of that the full story of Get Out was an great horror story.This is a no brainier, it you love Key and Peele than you'll love Get Out for the same reasons.http://cinemagardens.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Thrilling and very enjoyable with some intelligent character writing for a change,"I just hate it when every horror/thriller movie takes out intelligence from victims and this movie is very satisfying on this matter. Chris is likable, relatable, intelligent and capable, which automatically makes him stand out as a protagonist in this genre. With underlined political message to think about, the movie takes you on a joyful thriller ride filled with suspense. There's just enough of humor to chuckle through it and it's well timed to not take away from creepiness of the situation. Chris' impressions of things developing are in line with audience which keeps movie on topic every minute of it and doesn't fall behind in keeping it suspenseful.I've seen lots of people complaining how message about white people playing on privilege is too much in your face and I beg to differ. There's plentiful screenplay lines that affect Chris realistically and that are happening out there in the real world. Anyone who would find character's domination through this story insulting needs to be reminded that that table turns story to story and this story was this guy's turn. While it's good to think about that topic, thrill is guiding the movie and is written for the genre and screened incredibly well - if you'd allow that your ego is so strong to prevent you enjoying such a great cinematic piece, then problem is not the movie, or that message.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Decent, but disappointing given the hype","It would be wrong to say that this is not a good film, unfortunately one that has been over hyped. If I had watched it without knowing the hype and rave reviews, it would likely have earned an extra star rating.No need to discuss the plot but the film sits in the mystery/horror genre slot. I thought it was a comedy-horror going in, but it isn't. In fact the undertone to the film has quite a dark and socially challenging agenda.Though is the film a new fresh take on the horror genre as some reviews have suggested, well, erm, no. All though there is some astute direction in building the suspense, Get Out does end up following the standard horror narrative. The last 25 minutes is particularly typical as our central character desperately tries to 'get out' of the bad situation.Would still recommend watching this film, just don't get too excited.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
'Skeleton Key' remake and that's not a bad thing.,"Let me get this out of the way early: This is 100% a remake of the movie 'The Skeleton Key'.Now that that is out of the way, I will start by saying that I really enjoyed this film. The cast and acting was great. The music score was phenomenal and perfectly fitting with each scene. The camera work was above average. Plenty of tension breaking moments of levity that were really well executed.One of my biggest gripes about this movie though has to be the pacing of how they reveal the story. You see the ""twist"" if you can even call it that, a mile away. The movie is aware of this fact and nearly breaks the 4th wall to the audience in recognizing this fact. I'm not sure this entirely makes up for it though, as it just comes off as generally lazy writing.All in all great flick. If you enjoyed the movie skeleton key, you will enjoy this.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"A fresh, disoncerting, and often funny look at race in America","I totally disliked this at first. It starts off like an updated version of ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"", with a young, stereotypical white woman from an upper class family trying to prove her liberal, anti-racist bona fides by bringing her black boyfriend home to meet her family. But then things start getting interesting, as Chris (the African-American hero) begins running into increasingly disturbing situations. There is the faux-hearty banter with the family, with its racial overtones. And then there is the matter of the strange behavior of the family's black employees. Get Out is fresh, disconcerting, and often funny. Racial tension between white and black Americans is clearly the subject, but things never get preachy. I was not crazy about the ending, which veers into horror/cult movie territory, but this is a unique and fascinating film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Instant Thriller Classic,"I had heard several great reviews of this film and saw the high rating on Rotten Tomato - so with my 6th or so friend having gone to see it and raving about it, I finally made the go.I was definitely not disappointed. The key ingredients of a good thriller, for me, is to have compelling characters, the right amount of humor, jump scenes, and psychological tie together at the end. This movie had that and more.The director blended enough what the hell is going on thoughts, with funny comic relief to keep me engaged the entire film. I felt like there may have been more room for a few more jumpy parts, but overall this will be a go-to thriller to recommend to people wanting a great flick to watch that will tie together really well in the end.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A conservative review,"I gave this movie 8 stars, which for me is high praise indeed. On my first watch, I would have given it 2. That said, now that I have viewed this title several times I can truly appreciate what Jordan Peele is going for. It's not just a ""black and white"" film, and if you think it is - you miss the point.Peele captures much of the ridiculousness of modern American society while also playing to those that think everything boils down to race. Is this is an oscar contender (little o intended) - who cares? All the film awards do is help already narcissistic overpaid morons celebrate themselves.Does this film look at some serious stereotypes while making fun of so many of things we preoccupy ourselves with? Yes! To appreciate the humor and ""thrill"" of the film you must watch it more than once. Again, I consider myself a very conservative individual but still appreciate the humor to be found throughout this film.If you didn't like it the first time, try it again - you might find some very clever things you missed.

A decent thriller with some unnecessary politics thrown in the mix!,"I am all for racial equality. We are all men and should treat each other that way. And that said, there are better movies on the theme of racism. Theme of racism in ""Get Out"" feels forced and is even pure cringe at some times. And at one point in the movie, when I figured what was plot about, I was like: ""What? Really?! That's... What?!"" ""Get Out"" is a decent thriller and I would lie if I told I wasn't interested and that I didn't want to know what will happen next. Scenes are very well put together. Daniel Kaluuya and Lil Rel Howery give some great performances to the movie and their communication serves as a comic relief to what is essentially ""very serious and dark movie wannabee"". They make this movie so much more enjoyable that watching it without them is hard to imagine. I give ""Get Out"" 7/10, and that is only because of the said performances.

Great Movie,I haven't been to the movies since Captain America: Civil War but this movie here is worth seeing in theaters. I was skeptical at first Jordan Peele directed the movie and he's more of a comedic guy. He showed his comedic side in the movie and it was what a thriller like Get Out needed. It was very satirical and it kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the movie. Once the movie ended I told myself that I would see it again in theaters.

Somebody's Making A LOT of Money on THIS,"Three and a half stars out of five. I deducted a half-star for the fact that it's obviously an amateur production, made much better than it should be by some very talented people who have bright, bright futures ahead of them. All in all, a fine effort and a load of fun for people who really dislike typical slasher films, because this isn't one.Nowadays, a ""horror"" film can be just about anything including pornography, ersatz ""snuff"" films and documentaries about the government. We all seem to be a trifle more mature now than we used to be, and Hollywood is throwing everything at us hoping something will stick. So it's fun and cool when a low-budget film doesn't just cop- out with gross-out horror or get lost in politics. I appreciate it when the filmmaker actually gives the audience credit for having a brain and using it.The camera work is this movie is seldom bad and often very good. The acting is surprisingly good, considering that we're not talking A- list cast here. The story is strong enough to keep you guessing and the little ""touches"" that make or break a story like this are there.So what's wrong, if anything? Well, like a lot of low-budget ""thrillers,"" Get Out begins to lose a little momentum as the requisite creepy buildup begins to change over into the inevitable ""action."" I don't think it's a spoiler to say that things get more fast-paced as the film progresses. It's during this part of the film where we begin to wonder just how far ""over the top"" we're going to go--too far into ""that's dumb"" land or not far enough into ""that's boring"" land. Get Out almost pulls it off-- but in the end we feel that we watched a really good low-budget thriller, not a true work of art that will go down in history.

Its one of the best movies of the year,"I loved this movie! This year has been full of sh*t, I have seen very few movies this year that made me walk out of the theatre with a smile on my face. The only movies I have seen this year that I really loved are Split, Logan, and Get Out.This movie perfectly combines horror, comedy and social commentary. And it is the good kind of social commentary, because its not just saying some stupid sh*t about how racist we are, it actually makes you think and provides some very interesting ideas that really enrich the experience.The performances are all great. The main actor was great in this film like he was in ""Black Mirror"" and in ""Sicario"". The rest of the actors also did a very good job and the comic relief character was hilarious, I laughed every time that dude was on- screen.The horror or thriller aspect of this movie was great. There were many scenes in which I was hugging the arm rest out of anxiety. The whole purpose that this white-folks have with ""Chris"" actually terrified me. The only bad thing about the horror is that this movie actually uses the ""someone passed through the hallway and the score becomes loud for a second"" which is really cheap.The comedy was also pretty good. The director understood that this whole idea had some level of absurdity to it. So he used that to the advantage of the film and created some scenes in which the whole movie theatre was bursting with laughter. I believe that the movie handled pretty well the transitions between the horror and the comedy.The social commentary is also pretty good. It talks about a whole other level or racism. One in which the characters have passive-aggressive racism. I thought that it really enriched the movie experience.The whole tone and feeling of the movie is great. You feel awkward when the character feels awkward, and scared when he is scared.The score and cinematography are great and really made this movie have a much cooler style.Also, the movie had quite a lot of metaphors and symbols.Definitely go support this movie.

A knock out of the park from first time director Jordan Peele,"Get out is the directorial debut by comedian Jordan Peele from the comedy central show ""Key and Peele"" as well as Mad TV. Unlike his work that I previously mentioned this is a horror film so it was really interesting to see what he would do with this movie.So what's the story? Chris (played by Daniel Kaluuya) goes on a trip with his girlfriend Rose to meet her parents. Only thing is he is black and her parents are from a rural suburb and he's worried they won't care for them being in an interracial relationship. At first everything seems okay. The parents welcome Chris in open arms however ,the longer they are at this meet the parents trip, things become stranger and stranger, as the parents gradually begin acting more sinister and hostile and every person that works at this house is black, further adding to the creepiness of this whole situation.Let's talk about the dialogue in this movie, every single word that is said has some sort of meaning and commentary behind it. If you watch the trailers you'll see the Dad using stereotypical black slang and accents when speaking to Chris in an effort to relate to him. Every one is trying insanely hard to prove that they aren't racist, and many other things that make the viewer feel more uneasy the more they talk.The good thing is the subtext in this movie isn't completely reliant on dialogue the TV's look very much like the old style ones from the 1950's, the architecture of the house is colonial style like a plantation home and so much detail put in this movie that it's insane. You really get the feeling that Jordan Peele put a lot of effort and care into crafting this insane horrific world.Also the pacing is very well done. It starts off fairly relaxed. Not boring, just relaxed. Then the further the movie goes along the more intense it gets. The film lulls you in such a way that you don't even notice how drastically the tone changes over time until the movie is over and you realize you've been on the edge of your seat for over 90 minutes.Despite the film being an extremely intense experience Jordan Peele does manage to sprinkle in some of his special brand of humor when the tension needs to ease up at times. There were times when I would be scared out of my mind and then in the very next scene I'd be rolling in my seat laughing.You might take a look at this and think if you're a white person ""man I don't wanna watch this movie, I don't wanna feel like some monster simply cause I'm white."" And to that I say get over yourself just because some white people suck doesn't automatically mean you do. With that being said this movie takes a subject that can be very divisive and uses carefully crafted suspense blended with humor to bring the viewer in who may have an entirely different background from the main character as far as race relations go and generate sympathy for problems one may not have to deal with on a regular basis. Me personally, I'm a white man from a rural SOUTHERN suburb in a predominantly white town, and unfortunately I have encountered many people with racist attitudes in my lifetime. And yet I didn't feel attacked for my background or anything like that.While I did mention everything having a purpose, and extreme attention to detail there are certain parts that while scary at the time don't really have a lasting impact on the story as a whole. The thing is though this is something you don't realize until you're in the car on your way home and you think to yourself wait a second! Really that's my only knock about this movie the story is intriguing, the dialogue and scenery are rich with social commentary, it's well paced, just certain things don't really pay off as well as they could from time to time. Go see this movie. If you consider yourself a horror fan you owe it to yourself to see this movie, especially since good horror is in such short supply recently.And I'm gonna give Get Out, a 9/10.(For other reviews like the one you just read, check out my channel on Youtube.

Out Of Breath,"Made an account just to rate this movie and if you ask why I rated it 10/10, it is because of the following reasons (no spoilers):1.

It follows the viewers line of thinking, and not some ""Hey, let's explore this because we're original like that."" story like in 99% of the today's horror movies. 4.

"Original, authentic, thought provoking and meticulous","I went to see this film knowing nothing about it, not even its genre. I was given some clues during the trailers before the movie. First I was forced to enter a room with a young girl looking out the window only to turn around and suddenly reveal to my shock and horror the she was a very loud CGI monster. Then I was made to watch some kids go into a dark scary room filled with water which was suddenly and very loudly a clown-doll's swimming pool... or something.And so I discovered Get Out is a horror movie. Get Out, however, does not follow a formulaic build up of jump scares and rehashed imagery to create it's tension and tone. It does this through meshing flawless cinematography with brilliant acting, music, lighting and script. Furthermore, the movie has plenty of commentary on the modern and historical faces of racism which it explores masterfully whilst never insulting its audience by being too brash.Every shot in this movie feels carefully crafted to create tension and unease. From the single uncut shot of the opening scene to the unnerving choice of extreme close ups during dialogue. So often the choice of shot subverts what you would expect for the scene. Characters being warmly greeted by family is shown in a long shot giving a sense of detachment and that feeling of being watched. You are also as acutely aware of what is not in frame during the film as you are of what is in frame and this only adds to the ever mounting suspense. Combine all this with an eerie soundtrack (if a little cliché) and you have a film that feels organically creepy and not manufactured.Furthermore, the film has genuine moments of comedy, which is unsurprising given its director's background. But the occasional comedic shifts in the movies tone never felt clunky. Well rounded and well fleshed out characters meant that the humour felt like it came naturally to scenes.To go with the meticulous directing is a strong script. The film reveals information at an appropriate rate, the pacing is never tedious or rushed and most importantly, character motivations never feel inauthentic. Importantly, there wasn't that ""I'm going to stop escaping to go open that door where the eerie music is coming from. I hope that loud, jumpy, stabby thing that's been chasing me isn't there"" scene that pulls you from the movie.This film is as intelligent as it is gripping. It will disturb and entertain you whilst viewing it. It will provoke thought during and after. It will continue to grow on you long after watching. Jordan Peele has put together a wholly original film that feels fresh, authentic and most of all meticulously crafted. I thought hard about what rating to give it and ended up figuring if I don't give a film this unique and this well made a 10, then what's the point in having a score go up to 10. Do yourself and those interested in original and well made cinema a favour by supporting this film and seeing it on the big screen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Get Out (7/10),"There hasn't been one horror movie in the past decade to get the critically acclaimed ratings and reviews as Get Out. As this review is being written, Get Out has an impressive 8.3 rating on IMDb and an astonishing 99% on rotten tomatoes. Those types of numbers scream potential Oscar nominations for Get Out, and by receiving this type of notoriety, the potential of the horror film/genre getting to an Oscar platform again would be monumental. However, even before seeing the film and understanding the current political environment in America, it is apparent the social message is the primary reason the film is being universally praised by critics.It's also clear the best way to view Get Out is in theaters as it feeds the crowd with a variety of emotions that include laughter, intensity, and awkwardness. Jordan Peele did marvelously in his directorial debut, shooting scenes with comedic value swiftly into serious, nerve- wrecking sequences. Peele also have written the story-line came up with a very original concept of a social horror film. Racial dialogue was constant throughout, not subtle in the least, with most lines hitting well but there were a handful of duds. The cast did great with their dialogue and were well rounded in terms of performances and screen time. It seemed supporting actress Betty Gabriel as Georgina, really stood out in her role, executing it perfectly but Daniel Kaluuya and Allison Williams were spectacular in their leads too.Possible spoilers ahead... The biggest faults in the movie came in the last fifteen-twenty minutes, when it took a different direction in its plot and drew sharp comparisons to a past horror film, Skeleton Key. The very ending was however the most questionable aspect taking the easy, cherry route instead of a darker, more socially compelling ending. There was an opportunity to hit big with the ending but it missed. Get Out is an amazing original movie, great for the horror genre, and will be cheered heavily for possible Oscars. However, does it deserve the high acclaims it currently has? Answer is a definite no.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
GET OUT and see the film!,"Seriously, if you've pondered on whether seeing the film or not, please do yourself a favor and go see it. It's worth the admission.Jordan Peele, known for Key & Peele makes an excellent first impression in his directorial debut. He brings a fresh take on typical horror movies, implementing the obvious, but subtle racial tension and sharp satirical wit.A young African-American man named Chris visits his girlfriend Rose's mysterious Caucasian family estate, and from there on a series of increasingly disturbing discoveries lead him to a truth that he never could have imagined.In most horror films guys like Chris, exceptionally played by Daniel Kaluuya, end up dead really quick. It's an overused cliché, but it is reversed in this film, and to see an African-American male protagonist front and center is a nice change of pace within the horror genre.What's also great is that the film showcases his paranoia, he knows something is up, he's not blind to it. He makes the smart decisions and plays it cool, he isn't some dumb protagonist ready to be next on the chopping block. Kaluuya is great at playing a doomed man who thinks he's in control of the entire situation. On the surface he looks confident and at ease, as he has sharp eyes taking notes on everyone's behavior and it doesn't take a genius to figure out something is odd. You're never quite sure what's going on at the girlfriend's home, whether everyone's involved in some sinister plot or if its just some awkward misunderstanding. But it's clear that something is happening, and Chris is the most normal person here, and as the audience member we're not given any reason to doubt him.Kaluuya also has great chemistry with Allison Williams who portrays his girlfriend Rose. They both get to showcase their moments as a couple together very well, and I'm quite positive they'll get more recognition into furthering their careers.The characters are fleshed out immaculately, with Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener in their best performances to date. Caleb Landry Jones also has an appropriately, intensely edgy role, a tad bit over the top I might add. Whenever the film needs a short moment of humor, a lot of the film's levity comes from Lil Rel Howery as Rod, Chris' best friend.In some areas, the film does take its time to get things going, but Peele strategically knows where to add elements into the film to build up the tension. For example he knows where to showcase creepy sound effects and music cues. He successfully increases the level of anxiety, relying upon the fear of something not visible to the naked eye. It is reminiscent in the ways of a Hitchcock or Kubrick film.Get Out embraces the stereotypes and embraces them very well. Social commentary is very relevant and poignant in the film. Peele allows the viewer to see prejudice head on. When all is said and done, you now have a bird's eye view of what is really wrong with society. The film definitely shines light on the aspect of ourselves that a lot of us would rather not acknowledge or be in denial of. As much as we try to convince ourselves that we're above forming preconceptions and stereotyping, we aren't. Peele uses this as a tool to bleed out anxiety and tension which very much fuels the entire film.All the slow build up leads to one of the most satisfying climaxes I've seen in a while in a horror film. Peele is the true star of this film. He brings a distinctive visual style, carving out the film's creative path with some dark reveals, addresses the variable levels of racism with subtly, pays homage to some great horror films, and at times very humorous as well.There have been some quality horror films of this era, Sinister, Paranormal Activity(not the cash grab sequels), The Conjuring, Lights Out, but Get Out is one of those horror films that is intellectually engaging and self-aware. For me it ranks up there with Scream and Cabin in the Woods.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A very intense and very original horror comedy,"Get Out focuses on a black man named Chris while he travels with his girlfriend to meet her very nice but very suspicious parents. After Chris is introduced to the house he sees some disturbing imagery and weird acts that make him think something more darker is present, but what exactly? First off, everybody in the movie is great. This film also offers some astounding visual horror. I didn't expect this to be a comedy, but when you get the comedy it really pays off.Get Out actually touches some of the social issues that are in our world such as racism and it does it in a very smart way. The soundtrack is also pretty great and works very well with what is going on in the movie. This isn't a flaw but there are some scenes that were scary but it didn't really make any sense, but fortunately the big twist explains why that weird thing happened. I won't spoil it, but the twist is very satisfying and is very unsettling to even think about.In the end, Get Out was a very intense but also in a sort of sense serious with things that happen in our community and excellently blends horror, comedy, and social commentary in one original and creative film.

The Perfect Blend Between Horror and Comedy,"Get Out is the directorial debut from comic Jordan Peele and tells the story of Chris, an African American man meeting his white girlfriend's parents for the first time at their secluded home in the woods. With all the praise surrounding Get Out, I tried to go in with an open mind not letting the hype overwhelm for what could be an ""O.K."" film. However after seeing it, the praise its well deserved. This is a meticulous, well-crafted film, that offers both frights and moments of laughter. I was thoroughly impressed by how well made this film was, the score and cinematography is both haunting and dreamlike, giving the viewer an unsettling experience. The story in Get Out, is well realized and the trailer doesn't do enough justice, this isn't a white vs. black film, but rather a social commentary on marginalization, that uses the current events in our world as a springboard to get its ideas across. There were themes/metaphors throughout the film that I didn't realize were connected until the movie was over, this is far more than your average scary movie. Though you can treat it like a good ole' popcorn flick, the film has enough depth to keep the most sharp-eyed viewer thinking afterwards.With that aside, Get Out is an almost perfect example of a horror/comedy mix, the use of LilRel Howery as the comic relief was excellent, his moments were scattered throughout the film but they never felt out of place and he was actually genuinely funny. This film felt like an old episode of goosebumps or a live action version of the board game ""Clue"", due to the mystery the protagonist faces. As he is discovering what is going so is the audience and though I was able to piece together what was happening early on, I was still enthralled with what was going on, due to the excellent writing and performances. Most of the actors and actresses in this film were unknown to me but all of them played their roles convincingly well, particularly Caleb Landry Jones, who had a riveting scene that takes place at a dinner table which really got under my skin.Overall this is a well crafted film that had me on the edge of seat, Jordan Peele proves that he is not just a funny guy but should be taken seriously as writer and director. I thoroughly enjoyed my time with Get Out and do highly recommend it. I see myself re-watching this film quite a few times, especially around the Halloween season, as it just has a fall vibe to it. This really is one of my favourite movies I've seen so far this year, so for that reason, I'm giving Get Out an 8.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Very mediocre amd mainstream...,"I read a review for ""Speak no evil"" that mentioned this movie, since ""speak no evil"" was very good and this movie had such a high score on imdb (7.7 currently), I thought i should check it out.I thought i was going to see a real horror movie, a movie that is somewhat believable and disturbing. It was annoyingly unrealistic and packed with cliches. Right from the start the very ordinary looking main character's girlfriend is way too hot, I know she is suppose to be attractive and desirable and pleasing to the viewer but her particular look makes the whole premise of the movie (which is there relationship) extremely unrealistic and unconvincing. From then on it just continues being extremely predictable, there is a gradual at times cringy build up, full of exhausting cliches that had been done a million times.It is well made as far as i can tell, the photography looks good. It's more of an entertaining movie then a horror movie.

Racial Scaremongering at it's finest,"I gave this film three stars because you have to acknowledge the level of skill that goes into this movie. It takes real subtlety in the earlier parts of the film to make a big deal out of every little thing that happens, to justify the race-based fear-mongering this film is really going for. Ironically this film is itself very racist, but it cleverly sidesteps this by creating a fear based narrative that justifies their racism. Props to them for that, not since Goebbels have such effective scare tactics been used. Of course it's still deeply racist, so to hell with that",3.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

What an amazing exciting movie to watch,"I decided to go watch the movie after I saw the high reviews about it and when I went to the theater I was ultimately enjoyed. everything about the movie is amazing , interesting and exciting. From the very beginning you can feel the strange setting , the strange reactions from the white family, you feel that there's something wrong and this makes you more concentrated in the movie and not feeling bored at all. The movie really takes you from the very beginning and I like that kind of movies which has fast temp. Then the second part of the movie when everything is revealed you can sympathize with the hero as if you're him . you really feel sorry for him , you feel like you really want to help and that makes you more concentrated and following the afterwards scenes where you need to know more and keep thinking how he will react to his situations .what will happen next and all that sort of questions keep coming on your mind.In the end you can see all the pieces of the puzzle coming together and you began to connect the scenes with themselves.On the other hand and in spite of that this movie is a horror movie but there is a very high comedy scenes in the movie that would really make you laugh so loud and this was very very very interesting.I really enjoyed the whole movie and I'm really so thankful to the writer & director Jordan Peele because he really made my day and because this is the best movie so far in 2017. Really I do appreciate his hard work and I'm really looking forward to all his next projects.Last thing I gave it 9 out of 10 just because I wished if the movie could tell us more about the stories of the other victims . This depends on the viewers some people like it to be left like that for our imaginations and some people like me love it when more details in more scenes are shot and added to the movie .Go watch Get Out all the people",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Feels Like Standard Paranoia, Yet Driven Down A Different Turn","I can now see why this psychological horror is so mind-bending. After catching this movie, I have to say that this is a thrill ride that continuously toyed with my perspective up until the terrible truth is unveiled midway into the film.Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya), a black man with a hobby in photography has a white girlfriend named Rose that live happily together in the city. When she then decides to finally introduce him to her parents in her hometown outside the city, they seem to welcome him in open arms. However, the townsfolk begin to show signs of odd behavior whenever Chris so much as approaches any of them or if he even speaks his mind in conversations. Chris becomes increasingly paranoid as he uncovers more to the town than meets the eye.For comedian Jordan Peele's directorial debut in a horror film and his pairing with ""Paranormal Activity"" producer Jason Blum, this is something that required more thought as the story began to play out. I honestly attempted to comprehend the motives of each character, but as I started deducing their reasons, it grows unsettling each time. Instead of racism being used as a plot device, it seems this is a bizarre twist on that subject matter by making the residence not racist, yet they add insult to injury in their true nature by giving off a form of liberal ignorance. There are moments in the film that were pretty laughable to ease the tension done by the leading man's best friend TSA Officer Rod (played by comic Lil Rel Howery). And I say this doesn't ruin the ride, more like only gives depth into what his character knows what's best for himself and his friend. In the end, this isn't a movie made for cheap jumps or thrills. Instead, it kept the gears in my mind constantly turning and my curiosity growing with how the horror conventions were approached differently here. It's certainly interesting.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
An All Time Great Horror Comedy,"I always say that horror and comedy have a very thin divide between them. In both genres, you are trying to get an extreme reaction out of your audience, whether it be laughs or screams. This may be why writer/director Jordan Peele, half of the comedy duo Key & Peele, was able to make such a smart and well-executed horror/comedy.Get Out has a simple premise. A black man falls a white girl, and goes to meet her family. He is nervous about her family's reaction due to the fact that his girlfriend has never dated a black man. As he goes from his comfortable urban setting to the country bumpkin locale of her family's home, he begins to feel unsettled by her family's attitude, and the behavior of all of the African Americans in the area. There are multiple ways in which Jordan Peele deals with modern racism that incredibly intelligent.Some of the all-time great horror films have dealt with race as a subtext. Both Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of Dead have subliminal racial contexts that take some reading into. Get Out brings race issues into the forefront as the central conflict of the plot. As we of course understand, racism has quite changed since 1968 and 1978, when the first two Dead movies were made. In Get Out, the subtle racism of modern is depicted. The details of this film are what make it executed so well. Throughout the film, small little allusions to stereotypes to slavery are a constant throughout the film, if you are perceptive enough to pick up on them. Peele said that he wanted to make a movie we would all want to watch twice, and he definitely succeeded with his precise placements of minuscule, but important details. Many times, statements we make, we truly do not believe they are racist, even though we are trying to connect and relate to another human being. This film brings these to the forefront, to be examined by its audience. also, the film challenges the stereotypical role of the African American man in the horror movie and tries to change this context within the bounds of the film.What really helps Get Out is getting Oscar and Golden Globe nominees like Catherine Keener and Bradley Whitford, as well as rising stars like Allison Williams and Lakeith Stanfield in your horror movie. Many times, studios are just concerned about how they can make a movie for as small of a budget as possible so they can maximize profit. The studio is not concerned usually how good the movie is, as long as it makes money. these shoe string budgets usually do not have the room for great talent in front of, or behind the camera. Maybe Get Out can prove to studios that this talent is necessary to make the horror film great again. as a sidenote, I love that some old white studio heads had to approve a lashing criticism of the subtle racism of white people. Viscerally, it appeals to me for some reason.Get Out has put itself among the all-time horror greats while being intellectually engaging, and roaringly funny. This probably the best horror comedy since Cabin in the Woods. If a movie makes you hate the ways of the race you were born as by the time the credits role, it has succeeded in its purpose.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Don't believe the hype.,I'd heard great things about Get Out but I decided to put it on the back burner until last night. Get Out is nothing more than a rehash of Brian Yuzna's Society but without the grotesque physical transformations. It has its moments but ultimately it's all been done before.,,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Ill-Placed Humor and Racial Division,"Get out was a movie that never hit the mark the trailers portrayed. The movie had some Ill-placed humor throughout. This humor not only pulled the viewer out of the story, but also felt forced and did not add to the plot. The movie was not over-the-top scary, but did had its share of suspense. I think the majority of the acting was superb and the cinematography and accompanying scores really set the stage for what could have been a great movie.The movies weakness lies in its storyline. The movie propagated the agenda for racial discourse by portraying white on black crime. This weak plot never allowed the viewer to become fully engaged. This shallow storyline at no point left the viewer feeling satisfied.I think this movie missed its mark entirely. It could have been a big hit if the story was more fleshed out with a different focal point. I enjoyed parts of it, but would not recommend it or see it again. I think A Cure for Wellness, which was released a week before, did a much better job of engaging the viewer.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Most Original Suspense in Years,"Get Out is one of the most entertaining movies I have watched in years because of the well crafted mystery, gradual but sure build up of tension through music and direction, and appealing lead character.

I would watch this movie again, and highly recommend it for those who can overlook the racial component.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Superb Piece of Horror with Interesting and Insightful Social Commentary,"'Get Out' is a superb piece of horror with sharp, sometimes funny and always interesting social commentary that walks the line between classic horror conventions and a modern, revitalised genre form perfectly. It's an excellent debut from Jordan Peele who moulds his clever tale together with a great cast, interesting camera-work and a welcome dose of heavy tension and menace.First of all, go see this film as blindly as you can. Teaser trailers are acceptable, anything else could ruin or spoil the moment. I made the effort to go in relatively blind through part laziness and part active ignorance, avoiding critic's reviews and switching off the radio if people started talking about it. The premise alone should be enough to interest most people and Peele's name attached to the writing and directing should be able to persuade most sceptics. That said, whether you like or dislike horror, make the time for this one.The cast is all around excellent though special praise must go to Daniel Kaluuya who, despite the temptations of genre, keeps his acting naturalistic, completely believable and watchable. Catherine Keener and Bradley Whitford also deserve special mentions for their parts, as do Marcus Henderson and Betty Gabriel for their creepy turns. Peele doesn't let the cast carry the film however with some interesting, creative and above all else unnerving camera-work and great writing throughout. Lest we forget that Peele wrote, directed and produced this.Beyond everything Peele has succeeded in balancing the genre demands of his piece with the social commentary he puts forth. There is a danger with any horror film that the social issues at hand overwhelm the story or that the story and plot dampen any wider concerns to nearly nothing. There is interesting and at times genuinely uncomfortable moments created by the issues our main character faces and situations he deals with. Peele has got the balance spot on and the film is also helped by moments of well timed comic relief.Debuts are always a double edged sword which half the time leave you feeling underwhelmed and the other half overwhelmed, setting up inevitable disappointments for whatever follows up. Peele has proved himself a skilled and inventive director who can tackle complex and fascinating subject matter in a horrific fashion as much as he can in his comedy. He has said he has many more stories of 'social demons' to come over the next ten or so years. I am looking forward to them already.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A great horror/comedy blend with a well-foreshadowed end,"Get Out was a wonderful watch - I found myself alternating between laughing in shock and disbelief, laughing in genuine good-natured joy and (of course, as it is a horror) finding myself deeply afraid for the protagonist's well-being.I wouldn't say Get Out revolves around a ""twist"" - because a twist implies something unexpected, and while it isn't entirely *expected*, the script did an amazing job of laying all the pieces out for you to realize what was going on on your own time. That said, the ending is intensely satisfying. It has all the hallmarks of a great horror film for me; the protagonist is extremely likable, there's gore and anticipation and characters with disgusting (but realistic) motivations, and the bad ends for each individual who has one feel completely justified and necessary.Growing up in a very diverse metropolitan area in the US and seeing how different the suburbs can be, I found it a plausible-yet-morally-unthinkable extension of real-life unpleasant racial dynamics. For the skeptics among us, brushing up on your history of medical atrocities will give the film some much-needed context - and despite the very heavy themes throughout, the main character's attitude and simple ability to keep going in a horrible situation (as well as the comedic elements) keep Get Out from being unwatchably dark. Highly recommended!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Well-paced, suspenseful horror with a touch of humor...","Jordan Peele's cinematic debut is an astounding accomplishment for a genre that is commonly maligned as formulaic and inaccessible to broader audiences. What may first smack as a homage to the blaxploitation horror tradition, ""Get Out"" proves to be much more than any cliche attempt to elicit fear and unease purely through racial tension, gore, or cheap jump scares. Through the eyes of Chris, played by Daniel Kaluuya, we get a small taste of what it feels like to be truly uncomfortable in one's own skin. The tension is authentic, building into peaks of anxiety broken by stabs of humor, and sometimes the absurd (as can be Mr. Peele's inclination). Twists, turns, and a rousing climax complete an experience that wills surely engage from the opening scene to credits.I can only think of a handful of moments where I lost immersion due to clumsy dialogue or clunky cinematography. Overall this film is highly deserving of it's Oscar and I will enjoy watching it again in the future. Mr. Peele and the entire cast obviously have incredible talent and I look forward to seeing more of their work.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

And what a fantastic performance of the protagonist!",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Get Out? More like Get In and watch this film!,"Now I dont think this film is the kind of film you'll stay up all night cowering in fear wondering about what evil is lurking around the corner. At least it wasnt that kind of horror film to me. It's more psychological. And it does make you think about what its like to be black in this world. And for all those saying this film is ""racist"", I dont think that was Jordan's intent. He is married to a white woman, I dont think he seriously thinks all white people are evil. I see it more as ""Not everything always appears to be as it is"" cautionary tale. And also a bit of social commentary on those who think racism is long and dead just because there arent public lynchings anymore. Yes, we have made strides since the Civil Rights Moment. But its still there. And thats what I think the film was trying to say. Everything might look rosy and cheerful on the outside, until you get into the thick of it. And I think it was an interesting topic to handle. Jordan Peele did a really good job of tackling it and in an new, exciting way.Also from a horror point, ""The Sunken Place"" is really creepy. The score also is on point. Its more of a slow burn. But that doesnt mean its boring. Jordan does a good job of leaving you little clues here and there that somethings not quite right and it helps to build up to the climax.In terms of comedy, Lil Rel Howery (who plays the best friend role) is the comic relief. He is the one that gets all of the funny lines. That being said, I definitely dont really consider this a comedy. It never felt a comedy to me. So for those that are expecting laughs, you might be disappointed.Daniel Kaluuya though is phenomenal in this film and I'll be rooting him on during awards season.Overall, I really enjoyed this film and Im impressed that this was Jordan's directorial debut.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

GET OUT of your house and go watch this now!,"This is Jordan Peele's feature directorial debut, and what's interesting here is that GET OUT is uncharted territory for him as he comes from a comedic background. But, watching this movie, it felt like he's been directing horror his whole life. To put it simply, the guy knocks it out of the park.It's an artfully crafted and remarkably accomplished debut. He exploits an atmosphere impregnated with tension and skillfully choreographs an escalation of unrelenting suspense and crowd-pleasing thrills. The camera-work was absolutely ingenious; there's a scene involving hypnosis, in particular that had my jaw hitting the floor. I loved how they visually achieved that heightened state of suggestibility on a visual level.GET OUT is as much satire as it is horror though. And its most impressive feat is how masterfully it blends the two together. I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that so seamlessly shifts from sequences of jubilant laughter to instances of insidious horror in a matter of minutes.Writing satire is tough, writing good satire is even tougher, and writing good horror-satire is as rare of a commodity as you get in the film industry these days. To achieve this a film must have exquisite timing and near-prefect pacing, which is exactly what GET OUT has. The run-time is 103 minutes, yet it felt more like an hour. I guess I got so invested in this engaging story that I lost all sense of time, which is what you ultimately want in any movie, really.Daniel Kaluuya showcases his acting chops with an impressive range of emotions; it's not necessarily what he says but what he doesn't say that has the biggest impact. Other standouts include Allison Williams, Bradley Whitford, and Catherine Keener. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention comic Lil Rel Howery, who plays TSA agent Rod, aka the protagonist's best friend. He's definitely a scene-steal-er, breaking the film's uncanny tension with a number of gut-busting interludes.While GET OUT sets out to mainly entertain and shock, it's also accompanied with some poignant social commentary. It shines light on the aspect of ourselves that we'd rather not acknowledge. No matter how much we try to convince ourselves that we're above implicit stereotyping or forming preconceptions, we aren't. Peele uses this unavoidable, unflattering truth to draw out anxiety, and then he uses that anxiety as fuel for the film itself.GET OUT is one of the best movies to come out of 2017 thus far. I can't recommend it enough.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Get Out Review,"This film... well... what can I say... they call it horror and mysterious, yet it's funny as hell. There isn't too much action, the story would need a good remake, but overall I did enjoy the film.

People didn't understand this movie,"Rant BeginsIt's really interesting to me that people are getting triggered and claiming that the movie is extremely racist or something. When Rose says that her father will vote Obama for 3rd time she is not trying to deceive Chris. These people aren't thinking black people as beneath them. Every one of them envies a different point of them. One of them thinks they are fast, one thinks they are cooler in this modern age etc. The point is these people are not neo-Nazis or white supremacists. These people are liberals who would actually vote for Obama again. What this movie criticize is liberal people who, when trying to be ""liberal"" to black people, make things worse. I'm no way claiming that all liberals are like that(obviously) as I am white liberal person but yeah...Rant EndsThe premise of the movie could be better as there was no need to bring science fiction stuff. They could've just rolled with the ""Let's make them slaves by hypnotism"" because I mean brain exchange didn't really add something to story other than unrealism. Saying that, there was a huge tension until the later parts of the movie. And there was a certain sickness if I had to say? I mean psychological aspect of the movie really creeped me out.In summary it was an amazing movie who combined horror/comedy/thriller into it and did it well.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Not As Good As I Hoped,"While the premise is quality and the on-screen chemistry between Daniel Kaluuya and Allison Williams was great - the movie fell a bit flat for me.

Which could have been a terrific arc, especially with the political leanings of Rose's (Allison Williams) father.

A disturbingly insidious movie,"I feel so conflicted watching this movie. On the one hand, the writing is clever and the acting superb. The dialogue feels natural and the actors are believable. All that is well and good on the surface. But then, there is more. Writer-director Jordan Peele makes insinuations that are disturbingly insidious. I don't remember seeing any movie that is so evil to its core. And despite the smart dialogue, the plot nevertheless contains loopholes and certain parts of the script come off as sloppy.

Meet the Armitages,"""Get Out"" might not deserve the critical acclaim but is still a pretty good film. Jordan Peele's blend of black comedy and mystery is a bit too slow-paced but has its own particular mood. Daniel is aware that something is off with the Armitages, but at the same time can't help being continuously swayed by the situation and feeling like a fish out of water. This creates a surreal kind of tension that is constant throughout the film. Unfortunately, most twists are pretty easy to figure out, but it's almost impossible for the viewer to understand what is really going on until the end. The social critique here is nothing deep, but it's fun that the film mostly got praise from the same politically correct white liberals it condemns.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Heavy-Handed Approach to Race,"Get Out offers an original blend of horror and social commentary that keeps you engaged throughout.

Destined to be a Classic,"Film fans might avoid the movie ""Get Out"" because it looks like another drama about a black man, a white woman, and the way they are treated in the inter racially unfriendly deep south. However they will quickly discover that director Jordan Peele has twisted this theme of racial ethnicity into a bizarre and intense psychological thriller. The story revolves around Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) a young black photographer who is dragged by his white girlfriend, Rose Armitage (Allison Williams) to her parent's traditional gathering of wealthy white family and friends. Chris is well aware of the hostility he might encounter from the white folks in Alabama but he isn't prepared for the unnatural behaviour of the black people he encounters, especially the gardener (Marcus Henderson) and the maid (Betty Gabriel) whom Rose ironically insists are part of the Armitage family. Rose's father, Dean Armitage (Bradley Whitford) walks Chris through the family history and discloses some interesting facts Rose's grandfather while his wife Missy (Catherine Keener) corrals Chris into a discussion about hypnosis and her ability to cure people of their disgusting smoking habit all the while stirring a cup of tea with her spoon. Everything seems benign in the Armitage family until Rose's brother, Jeremy (Caleb Landry Jones) reveals his true racial prejudice although Missy quickly puts him back in line. The next day, Chis is introduced to several guests attending the gathering who share their admiration for particular traits of black race; the physical strength, the athletic ability, and the fashionable appeal. But when he notices the one black guest resembles an old acquaintance named Dre (Lakeith Stanfield) who mysteriously disappeared from the neighbourhood several years ago, Chris calls his New York friend Rod (LilRel Howery) who investigates the matter and eventually comes to rescue him from this horrible nightmare. ""Get Out"" will certainly prove to be one of the great, psychological thrillers and deserves its high IMDb rating.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Excellent filmmaking! Even better after second watch,"I just recently rewatched this movie and I'm happy I did, because there are so many details I didn't realize during my first watch, but I did realize during the second time, which made it even more fun to watch and a better film overall.GET OUT is a horror-satire that discusses the issue of racism (at least certain aspects of it), but it does it in a way that is not heavy-handed or preachy. I like the fact that it makes fun of how white people tend to relate to black people, but also how black people tend to relate to white people and even to each other. At the same time it has some genuine moments that show the difficulties black people can have in a white-majority environment. Nowadays people can be labeled a racist even for ridiculous reasons (especially in the U.S.) which is a very unhealthy tendency in society. And if that's something that bothers you as well, let me assure you, GET OUT is not a film of that spirit, its goal is not to make white people feel guilty. This movie is smart, funny, but it also has heart, and is honest about the topic.Acting, directing, writing and cinematography are great across the board. The two best performances, in my opinion, are that of Daniel Kaluuya, who plays the main character and Lakeith Stanfield who plays a smaller role, but is fantastic in that.GET OUT is thrilling, creepy, funny, sometimes over-the-top, and even though it was released back in January, for me (as of September 4, 2017) it is still the best movie of the year.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"You really shouldn't stay, but you cannot leave either","It has been said that comedians make surprisingly good horror actors and directors. Which makes sense when you think about it. Comedy and horror both owe a lot of their success to timing, involve buildup and crescendo, require you to understand human psyche and what makes us tick, and cannot be fulfilled purely in the script, through dialogue, requiring the nuance of body language and facial expressions.Which is why this directorial debut from comedian Jordan Peele isn't as much of a surprise hit as it perhaps could have been. At least, not to me. Get Out is a film about Chris (Daniel Kaluuya), a black photographer, who travels upstate to meet the family of his girlfriend. The very, very, very white family of his girlfriend. But when he gets there, a sense of unease and the feeling of something not being quite right starts to build.As you can imagine, race issues are at the heart of this film and Peele himself has dubbed it a social thriller, where the tension rises from those not-so-invisible lines between different social classes. And the film does have a lot to say about what you'd call casual racism. Not the kind where you're actively throwing around insults and insisting that Obama shouldn't become the president because of his skin colour. Rather this film focuses its social criticism against those people that insist that they're not at all racist, but nevertheless only know other white people and stop for a moment to stare when a black person happens to wander into their neighbourhood.As for the horror aspect of the film, it's a bit more, shall we say by the book. Nothing we haven't seen in a million other films, albeit done with enough panache to tide you over. Personally I was hoping for a bit more from a film that was hailed as an instant horror classic, but I guess that most of the film's positive hype came from that aforementioned social commentary.Nevertheless, it's not a bad film by any means. It's a well-acted social commentary teeming with uneasy atmosphere. And if you're looking for that feeling of ants crawling down your spine, then this film is well worth a watch.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

One of the most original horror movies lately,"Get Out is Jordan Peele's directorial debut and it's about a young black man whose white girlfriend takes him to meet her parents. There is a lot racism going on and he starts getting more and more paranoid.I really can't describe the plot of this movie very well without spoiling too much and that's because of the one problem I have with this movie:awkward pacing. It's a bit of a slow-burn until the very end and then everything is resolved very quickly. It's still well-done and intense, yes, but the pacing makes the whole thing feel a bit off. There is also a comic relief character that was given way too much to do. He wasn't annoying, he was actually pretty funny, but his constant appearing gave us some way too sudden tonal shifts. Now while I'm saying all this, it probably sounds like I didn't like the movie, but I really did. I didn't think it was perfect, but it was an interesting ride.The premise itself is pretty smart, I just felt that more could be done with more psychological parts of the movie. Even though the plot structure isn't the best, the dialogues are very well written and backed up by very strong performances. Main character is well developed and you really care about him, which makes the whole situation even more intense. Through the first two acts, not much really happens, but you can't help but feel that sense of dread. Then things go down. Actually, it has a similar structure to The Wicker Man, just with a less disturbing ending.This movie has its flaws, but that didn't stop me from enjoying it because it won me over with an intense atmosphere and nail- biting climax.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Get Out (@cmp_moviereviews),"The secret is out. The world now knows that Jordan Peele is not only known for fame in the comedic realm, but also for debuting a very effective thriller. ""Get Out"" is ultimately effective due to its intriguing premise and crowd pleasing mentality. Comic relief in horror usually falls flat for me, and confuses the tone of the film. Here, it's used very skillfully, and the laugh/thrill mixture is very successful.

Don't get out!,"Discrimination, in all its possible variables, is a matter of which it's possible to get very far both in extension and intellection, an issue that has touched various media in terms of attacking this puppet of such evil purposes. Basing on a sad-popular behavior such as racism in the United States of today, filmmaker Jordan Peele—who gained status by TV shows of a comic nature that with the accustomed dubious quality achieved American transcendence—presents a sour, fiery and impetuous social satire brimming with black humor with delicious psychological thriller hint that arrives in order to impact strong on a certain well-off sector thanks to a reflective tale of the big little lies that we tell each other in such a clever, effective and commercial way that might well gets it a list of meritorious titles as ""cult film"" or ""the best suspense movie of the year"" and maybe, a round of accolades for its splendid components, identical in quality, different in appearance.Peele's feature film converges, in not few vertices, with the laudable allegorical representation (""The Invitation"", 2015) by American filmmaker Karyn Kusama, highlighting as the main concomitant the essence of the true thriller: increasing discomfort and vulnerability sown in order to audience does not feel secure with what happens on the screen, which provokes in this incessant birth of perceptions toward the loaded questions posed by the story. A genre equivalent to a perverse roulette, in which in the slightest moment of carelessness, a rush of revolutions can shake your safety from head to toe. Such concordance adorned with an acute social criticism, substantial of the authentic films inaugurated by Mr. Hitchcock, in which are exhibited the poorest actions that we can come to commit. We're the black and white dots.While it builds outstanding psychological game with detailedness, Peele, deserving of double mention acting as scriptwriter and director, conjures up ordinary components and other unusual that can be abridged in three major fields: the first one, of course, is the narrative, although, beyond wise skill of developing the subliminal core idea, it's the successful combination and harmonization between two discordant genres as horror and comedy, an impressive achievement especially in the decadent film period in which we are in. While comedy is based on the supporting comic relief gags (contradictory and stereotypical a black man) and the irony of the situations, it's fascinating as horror doesn't require scary monsters or spooky entities to fulfill its objective (although there are), here, terror springs up from dread and the veiled significance of the words, from confrontation with the harsh reality. The second one is plausible constituents at a technical level, namely, its mise-en-scène, soundtrack, cinematography, and photography that unite the vertiginous final act with the hesitant first act using, as usual in Jason Blum's company, precise elements that facilitate and enrich the following of the story. It's prodigious in the composition of its images, having in its power a vacation home encircled by a dry forest is not a break, on the contrary, it's sensational as they create beauty, usually in confined spaces, with what they have. With certainty, the film has conceived one of the most beautiful shots in horror film history, an oneiric picture where Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) jolts awake after a cyclic hypnosis in a pale leather sofa, with the sound effect from an old TV as the only company, his face—tremendously photographic—raises an analogy through the melodramatic tears in his exorbitant eyes, a frame that will last in the memory of any modern cinephile. There are also sparkling scenes, which reach horns of the moon in its exciting third act, highlighting vigorously camera focus in the third major factor: the overwhelming and heterogeneous performances. Kaluuya's role radiates power and strength, he's sensitive and unprotected when he needed, aggressive and lethal when everything is a disaster. The alienation of the Armitage family is dosed between the competent actors, from which stand out Allison Williams (with a twisted plot worthy of Shyamalan) and her brother in the fiction, interpreted by Caleb Landry Jones. Exclusive attention requests scene stealer Betty Gabriel, who plays a couple of shocking scenes, with dimensions of complexity and interpretative depth typical of an acting matron. Be careful because this lady and Kaluuya will present great surprises.Conscious of its game, Peele's motion picture is a deliberate subversion, offered by the hand of cinema, which cries out for the eradication of injustices perpetuated by the social and political sects of the Trump era. It also breaks supposed barriers between genres and ideas and overflows creativity and power by creating situations as exciting as cartoon-like, as intelligent as reflexive; A satire that wasn't requested, perhaps out of fear, but in the end, it came with a relentless purpose. It achieves what many feature films don't: surprise and affect.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Tense thriller with an interesting but pretty much predictable twist.,"""Get Out"" was on my radar for quite a while as I saw positive consensus related to this project written, directed and produced by Jordan Peele. I liked it, it is a tense thriller with many uncomfortable scenes. Since the beginning I understood that something with the Armitage family was off, but the more you go on, the more unsettling things become. The buildup is progressive and the plot kept me glued to the screen. The main twist is interesting, but also very predictable: I cannot say that I was particularly impressed. The ending was a bit disappointing, as it felt rushed and pretty generic. This is something where screenwriters should have focused more.I liked the cinematography and there are several creative shots that I have truly enjoyed. There are tons of captivating scenes and thankfully the director never used jump scares to frighten the audience. The cast did a wonderful job to create tension and fear. Daniel Kaluuya was absolutely fantastic, he expressed a wide range of different emotions, his acting was always on point. He is very talented and I am happy that he is succeeding with his career. There are a few critics related to racism and white power, but nothing too elaborated like in a Spike Lee movie. I think that ""Get Out"" is a solid and entertaining film, with the perfect runtime.

Skillfully balancing between comedy and horror,"Debuting director Jordan Peele knows how to handle his budget. Universal Pictures, who were smart enough to pick up the movie for distribution, can be quite pleased with the turnout: with $4.5 million in production budget, the movie has already returned $204,3 million (and it's still counting) at the box office worldwide. One thing is for sure: director Peele knows how to balance between the swamp of horror clichés and a sketchy, almost over-the-top humour (reminding to some extent of Edgar Wright), but he also gives his comedy horror another dimension by playing with the conventions of whites-and-blacks relations.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Creepy, unsettling and filled with brilliant performances","Get Out is one of the best and most refreshingly original horror movies in the last decade.

Stay out from Get Out,"Get Out, no really, Get out...So, I went to see the movie Get Out with some friends yesterday. We had a choice between Leggo Batman and Get Out, and we chose Get Out. We're still arguing about who should be blamed for that choice. They list it as a horror. What they don't tell you is that the horror is that someone would even make this movie. I've never seen any of Jordan Peele's movies before this. I will spend the rest of my life trying to avoid ever seeing one of his movies again. The thing strives to be one of those Sixth Sense ""What a twist!"" movies, but the so called twists are so obvious, unrealistic and just flat out lame that you find yourself rolling your eyes in the dark and just praying that no more twists are coming. And they always are. If you were to take the racial premise in this movie and reverse it, there would be pickets and riots. But apparently it's perfectly acceptable to have a white people are evil and black people are good movie. Just for the record, I'm only part white. But I'm fully offended by the premise of this movie, not to mention in the clumsy and lazy execution that doesn't bother to try to make its plot points make any sense. To be fair, the trailer to Get Out does hint that this could either be a very good movie or one of the worse that you've ever seen. It comes far close to the latter and is too lazy to ever even approach the former possibility. This movie really does suck. It sucks despite some very good actors, including Catherine Keener, who has been superb in indie films like Your Friends and Neighbors and Bradley Whitford, an Aaron Sorkin favourite. The lead actor Daniel Kaluuya was even in the wonderful British series The Fades and Skins. And yet the net result, the only result is just flat out stupid and predictable. Maybe the title, Get Out, is meant as a warning to any potential audience. But probably not. That would require too much effort and self awareness. But the rest of us can try to help each other out in these days when going to the movies is more expensive in most places than drugs, and gives you far less pleasure.

Fascinating hybrid,"This film could be categorized as a horror film, or a satire. It has elements of both, although the Golden Globes nominating it in the ""Comedy/Musical"" category is a stretch.Much has already been said about the film by critics and in other IMDb reviews. A film like this is only as good as the performances, and they are incredible. The entire cast must've realized what an original piece this is, merging elements from home invasion movies like The Purge with social comedies like Guess Who's Coming to Dinner. If you are familiar with the careers of Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener, you will be knocked out by what they do in this film. Allison Williams, daughter of Brian (those cheekbones give that away...), is also downright surprising here.Perhaps the Golden Globes placed this film in the Comedy/Musical category since there were so many fine dramas to come out in 2017.

Definitely worth seeing GET OUT,"GET OUT directed by Jordan Peele is like no other film that I have ever seen; not a conventional comedy, nor a conventional horror movie - but rather a trenchant psychological thriller about black/white relations incorporating myth, history, and racial symbolism resulting in an intelligent, profoundly moving fable. GET OUT opens with an abduction of an innocent young black man who is lost, aimlessly searching for an address on a quiet suburban street in the dark of night - this one abbreviated cinematic moment encapsulates years of racial violence, forecasting what lies ahead for the viewer.We witness a young couple who appear to be disarmingly happy - a young African American man Chris Washington (an excellent Daniel Kaluuya) and his white girlfriend, Rose Armitage (a lovely Allison Williams) packing in preparation for a visit to her parent's home in the suburbs. Once they are in the car leaving the city they allegorically cross a ""color line"" and the mystery and tension mounts with baleful incidents that augur a grim future.When they arrive at their destination, we observe in the behavior towards Chris, a cool veneer that is draped over each character like a shroud of duplicity, particular Rose's ""liberal"" parents (the wonderful Catherine Keener as her mother Missy) along with a groups of friends who are invited to an annual lawn party. Each character is satirically delineated with a familiarity that betrays their inner bigotry. GET OUT is so biting that the ensuing marks claw deeply under our skins.Jordan Peele (formerly of Key and Peele) in his directorial debut makes memorable use of his powerful comedic skill, but this time we do not laugh with joy, but we drown in the despair of a modern-day allegory of stereotypical attitudes and conspiratorial stratagems towards Afro-Americans that are as original and devastating as a science-fiction tale.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A Welcome Addition to the Horror Community,"For a while I was becoming pretty convinced that it was impossible to make a movie that focuses solely on being a good movie. Not trying to throw in political themes or the director's private views so he could please people, no, just a damn good movie that's fun to watch!Get Out is that movie, one which I have throughly enjoyed watching. It's a damn good horror movie because it has psychological horror about being powerless and trapped in a world you can't escape. That's really powerful and it's great to see a movie focus on this often unexplored psychological aspect of fear. It felt like watching a really good Twilight Zone episode that just so happened to have a black actor in the leading role. Daniel Kaluuya kills it as Chris Washington, he is such a cool everyman. You can really relate to this guy regardless of who you are, he seems like an average chill dude who you want to hang out with. This perfectly helps you relate to a character. He's our outlet into the story and our way of becoming immersed in the horror.One thing that kinda frustrates me though is how everybody sees this movie. For those who call it politically correct nonsense about evil white society, I almost want to punch these idiots in the face! This isn't something like Mudbound where you instantly realize what the movie is about without even having to see it, Get Out pushes racism and white prejudice in the background so it can focus on the story, not the political climate it happens to be in. People who praise or hate this movie on the grounds that it tackles racism are people who didn't get the point of the movie. This movie is not about political themes but everybody thinks it is because it has white villains. For those people, leave your damn politics to CNN and just appreciate a movie because it's great!Get Out is great, and if you like horror movie and want a good modern horror movie, give this a watch. I love the classics and I will adore movies like Frankenstein and Bram's Stoker's Dracula to death (literally), but sometimes I wanna watch a modern movie where the real villains are the monsters inside the people we think we know. It's a great movie. It's really fun! Go watch it!9/10 great movie that holds up well and a welcome addition to the horror community!",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A horror movie with a satirical edge.,"Get out is the first movie, that I've seen at least, to take the racial paranoia that is present in our culture and exploit it to make a horror film. And while I was watching this film I began to realize how well Jordan Peele can blend comedy and horror when I was laughing and getting nervous at the same time throughout the film. Jordan does a fantastic job of building tension while also layering the film with his humorous point of view. So that there is an atmosphere of satire all throughout the film. I also have to respect that this is not an easy film to write, given the touchy subject matter. It could have very easily come out as racist or ignorant, however the comical undertones gave the film a tongue-and-cheek sort of vibe. And the paranoia I experienced in this film is actually one that is prevalent in our culture today. And even if the racial subject matter is very touchy, horror is not supposed to be kind towards our sensibilities, it is supposed to take something that scares us in real life and escalate it so that it can horrify an audience for around two hours. This one just happened to have a nice satirical edge to it. However, the film did feel short to me. There were some major plot holes in the film. One phenomena involving a phone that contributes to the plot in a big way is never explained. The twist in the film is very entertaining. However after the twist the story feels kind of rushed. There does not seem to be any sense of patience or building tension. It is more of just a transition from a horror movie to, all of the sudden, an action movie. I would have liked it to be longer. There is a lot of potential for more material in the film. The directing in the film is really eerie and well executed. I get kind of a Hitchcockian vibe from his directing style. There may be some influence from John Carpenter in there, which is hilarious given the satirical nature if the film. I did not expect Jordan to come off as such a seasoned filmmaker. He proves that he has a knack for bringing work to the big screen and I look forward to seeing more work from Jordan in the future. Less Keanu, more of this!",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"I'm not racist, I swear ;)","I surprisingly liked this movie a lot more than I thought I would! I knew from the clips and trailers I have seen that it was going to be well done and well acted. And it was. Especially from Daniel Kaluuya. Superb acting. Even a lot of the smaller characters had certain moments where they shined. It won the best screenplay award so I had that in mind while watching and I have to agree it was great, the story grabs you from the start, kept you on the edge of your seat wondering what the heck is going on. But don't get me wrong. It's not action packed. It's a slow burn mind game and it was pretty fun trying to figure it all out. Don't watch clips or trailers! It was nice going in not knowing much. It was rated R because the story needed it to be, not just because it wanted to be, which I always appreciate. The soundtrack was pretty cool but not that unique for this type of movie. The directing was pretty great and the story was told very well. 
You may be asking yourself ""Why is Chris surprised he liked it? Is it cause it's about black people made by black people and he's racist and doesn't think black people can make good movies?!"" Uh no. Ha! 
That's what the Social Justice Warriors want you to think. Which is exactly why I was surprised I liked it! I feel like the Oscars and lots of the media praised this movie so much and acted like it was the ""best movie of our generation"" and acted like it was SO IMPORTANT for black people. It made me think it was going to be filled with political and racist preaching. But I watched it with an open mind and it wasn't like that! I know it had metaphors and other things throughout but it wasn't in your face or preachy. It was just a good thriller that you can either take at face value and enjoy or you can think really deep about and get social issues. It lets you have that choice. That's what surprised me and I'm glad. So if you want a good thriller with twists and ""what the heck""s, or if you're racist against white people and want to see them get it, Get Out is the film for you!",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Masterful, brilliant, spectacularly crafted horror movie that will have you on the edge of your seat","Get Out is easily the best movie of 2017, managing to get the highly coveted 99% on Rotten Tomatoes. Once I finally decided to watch the movie, it was easy to see why.The basic idea behind the plot is this man, Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) has decided to go spend the weekend with his girlfriend, Rose (Allison Williams) and her parents, in an isolated home in Alabama. But, as the weekend progresses (and without revealing too much of the plot), Chris begins to discover something truly sinister.Jordan Peele, the director and writer, crafts this horror film so delicately, being sure to reveal things slowly and carefully as the film progresses. The plot is simply so original, unique and ingenious, and credit is due to Jordan Peele for all his decisions. He has us viewers believing one thing for the majority of the film, only to dash that aside for a far more sinister truth. This horror movie uses so many common horror tropes, and yet it expertly embraces and twists them into what truly is a masterpiece.The film also centres around racism, primarily the more subtle, liberal type that has arisen in society in modern times. Jordan Peele intertwines this message of racism so delicately throughout the film, and even though it's a horror movie there's plenty of poignant commentary of the state of racism today.Personally what I loved about the movie was the pacing, which allowed subtle hints to be sprinkled throughout the movie before the dramatic, sinister reveal. I also loved Kaluuya's acting; it was so raw and believable, and it really had you convinced of the true horror of what was going on throughout the film. Every second of the film we see his character responding and coming to terms with everything going on around him; it's genius.There were a few things that I didn't love about the film, but they're mostly plot related and I don't want to give spoilers. In my opinion it's not the ""perfect"" movie, but it's so close the difference is honestly negligible. It's especially remarkable given that Jordan Peele is a first time director. Everything about this film - the writing, the acting, the pacing - is so clever, and there is praise due to everyone who worked on this movie. It really does prove that the world of Hollywood still has plenty more ideas to explore yet.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A brother among democrats,"Honestly, I'm not sure what to think about this. It seems that lately, every movie has become a battleground for one political side or the other. Personally, I just want to see a good movie. Is this one one? As far as craftsmanship goes, maybe.
Full disclaimer: I watched this because of the Honest Trailer. So, I knew what was the basic premise going to be. However, I expected that the time-frame was going to be 60s or such. Right at the beginning, it becomes apparent that it's Obama or post-obama era (the people have better and newer cellphones than I do). Then it's explicitly stated later that it's post-obama era. Seriously? You want to talk about racism in post-obama era? Every person of color in this movie lives in a more expansive apartment than I do and wears brand clothes. I'm not buying it.
This movie is supposed to be a horror but it isn't scary at all, it's more like a comedy about liberals. You can't be scared if there's no survivor for you to be invested in. Imagine if the Alien was made from an omniscient perspective and the Xenomorph would be revealed to be a transsexual libertarian who just wants to make a living. You wouldn't be very scared than, would you?
The visuals are very derivative from ""The Skin I Wear"" but unlike that one, it doesn't really draw you in. But all in all, the movie doesn't really suck. It doesn't make much sense either but it doesn't suck. So by today's standards, it's like Avengers: Endgame? It was a time when Hollywood made movies had at least some redeeming qualities.

A good movie with Tension,"Personally I liked the movie ""Get Out"". The plot of the film has an exciting process that never lets the groom know what's going to happen next. In the film, the director has the shots and angles well thought over. Most scenes have a special transition, which provides the viewer with a better insight into the film. The tension of the film increases over time, which ensures that you wanna know what happen next. I think the normal end of the film is unexpected and not very realistic, which made me think about it later on the film.
The other variant of the end, I liked better, although it is a sadder end. In both scenes there was help at the last moment, all the people who survived were the same as in the other scene.

Kudos Jordan,"I am by no means a professional troll, here to say that my opinion is relevant. However, this movie was FANTASTIC, but again, that is just my 2 cents. For a debut in directing, especially when it's Jordan Peele, I was awestruck. Not for my lack in trust in his ability, but this was a horror/thriller, and I have known his work for always being something more along the lines of side splitting hilarity. I heard he directed this film, often times, doing his impressions of President Obama (how I miss thee) and his other well known impressions. I also hear that Jordan took notes from the late and great George A. Romero, in creating the story around a black man as the protagonist, which really how often do we see that? Always refreshing to see a new perspective in an old genre. If you really want to see a new look unto ""meeting the family"" of your significant other, watch this movie. Especially if you are wasting your precious times reading reviews like mine, and others. Take the 90 mins or so and sit back. The soundtrack also worth listening. I give it a 10 out of 10.

best thriller in a long time,"I won't even bother telling you the premise. I'm sure you know it. What I will say is that this has extremely tight writing. The plot twists hold up. I can't think of a single plot hole, and I'm one of those people who obsessively tears apart films looking for those (I don't usually have to even try).I have a mixed race family, and I say it's extremely relevant, politically, racially, in today's world. It's not an anti-white film, it's not calling all white people racist, or anyone racist, it's just probably using some dialog the writer/director has probably heard a million times in conversations with white people in high society.It's not a horror movie as it's listed on IMDb and by most viewers. It has some horror elements, but it's really a suspense movie, and it's a very good one because for the first half of the movie or more, you have a growing sense of dread, and you have no idea why. To top it off, it has some very funny parts, but they don't ruin the suspense because the funny man is on the other end of a phone, the protagonist's only link to the outside world, as it were, and so it is compartmentalized and doesn't diminish the very real threat he is facing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One of the better horror movies,"In an era where actual good horror movies are pretty rare, Get Out gives me a little hope that this genre isn't dead just yet. This isn't just another series of jump scares with terrible acting and a stale plot. This movie doesn't make you jump, it will genuinely make you feel uncomfortable for the most part. I'll be honest, this is one of the only horror movies that actually made me feel sick because of how creepy and uncomfortable it is to watch. The first two acts are great and very well written but the third act and the ending are both a little silly and don't seem to fit with the rest. Overall though, Get Out is certainly a must watch for horror fans or people who just want to watch something different. Oh and Daniel Kaluuya is fantastic!",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Deja-vu Science-Fiction Tale,"Since the independent filmmakers of the United States presented in 1986, for the first time, their award called Independent Spirit (or, in its short version, Spirit), when Martin Scorsese was honored for «After Hours», the Spirit became the maximum reward of the ""other cinema"", of the cinema away from the mega-industry of Los Angeles, in a kind of Oscar of the ""liberated"" of the Hollywood dictatorship. From that date, the award distinguished good filmmakers ignored by the ""Academy"", such as Robert Altman, John Sayles and Todd Haynes, and many others who later became ""officialized"", such as Tarantino, Nolan and Aronofsky.To be honest, today in 2018, there seems to be not much difference between one cinema and the other: the film that won the Spirit for Best Film of the Year is not far from the gore aesthetic present in the Oscar-winning film as the best . While «Get Out» is not as whiny as «The Shape of Water», but a more forceful and ""virile"" drama with some denunciation, both films are science fiction products that take the path of extreme and bloody violence to lead us to the conclusion. Both films also have in common an Afro-descendant, obese and comical character that plays a decisive role in the plot: in the amphibious fable it was Zelda as played by Octavia Spencer, and here, LilRed Howery as Rod, an airport investigator.In the film, a white girl invites her black boyfriend to spend a weekend at her parents' house, and the poor young man falls into a terrifying intrigue, surrounded by sinister Caucasian beings and three African-Americans who look like zombies, though as charming as the ""Stepford wives"". Little by little the intrigue is revealed, although one suspects from the beginning who the villains are - in part, due to the stereotyped performances of some interpreters in key parts of the story.They say that the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay usually indicates what was the true best movie of the year, according to the ""Academy."" This year this indirect recognition was given to the director and scriptwriter of ""Get Out,"" Jordan Peele. The film does entertain and is effective (thanks also to a careful soundtrack and very good music by Michael Abels), but if you expect a lot from it, you may be disappointed.-------------------------------------
P.S. The garden party reminded me of a similar scene in ""The Stepford Wives"". Just as Katharine Ross and friend Paula Prentiss are observing the guests, so does Daniel Kaluuya. As a matter of fact, both Ross and Kaluuya play photographers. And when the Nanette Newman robot malfunctions because it drank too much wine, that is similar to Lakeith Stanfield's ""epilepsy"" crisis.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Heart in the right place, but overrated","After hearing all the great reviews and praises, while still avoiding any spoilers, I started to watch this movie prepared to love it.I found it... silly.Flat. Unsubtle and unoriginal. Absolutely zero scary. With an unsatisfying payout, and jarring changes in tone.And not really very biting in its social commentary, too.The only thing positive I can say about it is that it have its heart in the right place, but the execution...Maybe the language of the movie failed me because I'm European and not American, I don't know, but I suspect that a good share of the praises the movie got were because it's on the few that are not loaded with jarring moral values, and I guess that especially in this historical moments that's quite important... still I truly look forward to a future with so many movies and work of art made with social awareness and wide representation of all, so that we can start praising movies that are *really* good in itself, and that being not morally repugnant is a given, not a special cause for praise.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Thanks J Peele,"I want to thank Jordan Peele for not taking the easy road and following his own vision to full execution. I know the ending may be too convenient for some - but the moment it happened it was forgiven given the genre he was in. There are indelible scenes in this movie, and that takes a special skill and certainly some luck. I can't imagine how hard it would be to go from an idea and a dream to a grueling work schedule worrying about money and everything else and end up with a massive data base of footage - and then to start working again to create an authentic manifestation of that original idea - just amazing, especially for a first time director.

"A solid ""B""","I was intrigued by the fact that Jordan Peele (1/2 of the comedy duo Key and Peele) was writing and directing a ""horror"" film that I decided to check it out.  Interestingly enough, I soon discovered that GET OUT, is NOT a horror film.  It is a suspense/action flick with horror and comedic elements.And it works, quite well.Following in the footsteps of suspense/horror/comedy films like the Edgar Wright/Simon Pegg SHAWN OF THE DEAD, GET OUT tells the story of Chris, a young African-American lad (Daniel Kaluuya) who is dating Rose, a caucasian (Allison Wiliams).  Rose invites Chris to meet his parents at her family estate.  Once there, Chris realizes that something is terribly wrong...Written and Directed by Peele, GET OUT zips along breezily for the most part, stopping for a moment for a piece of comedy or suspense.  The ""estate"" is very, very much WASPy and white bread and all the victims are African-Americans, so there is a very real racial element to the story, but Peele does a good job of showing - and not telling - the inherent racism simmering just underneath the facade of those around him.And these facades are very good - as Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener play Rose's parents and they bring much more to the table than a typical film of this type might otherwise have.  Both are congenial, threatening, friendly and covert, showing us layers hidden under layers.  Stephen Root shows up as one of their white bread friends, who might be sympathetic to Chris.  Williams does a nice job as Rose adding to the tension.  Only Caleb Landry Jones as Rose's brother is too over-the-top.  The rest of the family are nuanced - he is not.But the star of this film is Kaluuya as Chris.  He is the audience surrogate in this film and brings us along in a winning fashion, trying very hard not to believe what he is seeing, but also slowly and shockingly coming to the realization that something is horribly wrong.Adding to the fun of this film is the breakout performance of LilRel Howery as Chris' friend back home.  His Rod Williams is saying out loud what most in the audience are thinking and he is quite hilarious.  I can't help but think that Peele had this film in his head for quite some time with his partner, Keegan-Michael Key playing Chris and Peele portraying Rod, for Rod has the funniest lines in and is the most winning character.If you are looking for a horror film, go see something else.  If  you are looking for an entertaining enough Suspense/Comedy/Horror film, than GET OUT fits the bill quite well.Letter Grade:  A solid ""B""7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Claims to be a 'horror' but it's so much more than that.,"Once in a while a movie comes along that takes a genre by the scruff of the neck and vigorously shakes it into a new shape.This is so with Get Out, a horror movie (so the marketing blurb says) that lobs a few horror tropes into a lean and mean 104 minute thriller. But it is really a social observation on the insidiousness of racism. It comes out the other end as a unique movie offering.It borrows from Pacific Heights, Psycho, Michael Haneke's astonishing Party Games and sub-horror-porn like Saw without ever being any of them.Without resorting to spoilers its one gigantic twist from start to finish that realises the fears of a young black American guy on a trip to the country to meet his wealthy WASP girlfriend's family on a celebration weekend. Every sentence uttered by every character becomes a retrospective clue as to what the outcome will be.Given it's described as a 'horror' you can expect a deal of nasty stuff in a climactic ending. What director and screenwriter Jordan Peele (amazingly a debut outing) most cleverly does is apply Hitchcockian tension so that 89 minutes of tension are realised in a mere 15 minutes of terror in such a way that the nasty bits don't (as so often is the case) outstay their welcome.Superb performances all round from the five principal actors, but especially boyfriend and girlfriend Daniel Kaluuya and Allison Williams (Girls).It's should be no surprise that this has been both BAFTA and Golden Globes nominated, but it is because this genre rarely reaches this level of critical acclaim.It'll get Oscar nods too.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Do people really like this movie or do they just think they should?,"I'm white, so I realise I should be giving this movie somewhere between a 7-10 rating to appear as woke as possible, but c'mon, this was pretty garbage... So many plot holes. So many silly moments. Took itself way too seriously. The two leads were ok, did a decent job. The rest of the actors I found incredibly annoying, especially the brother of the girlfriend. Definitely not the worst movie I've seen, but NOT worthy of the hype and high ratings.",3.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Not really a horror film, more like a thriller with a very insolent sense of humor","Having heard nothing but raves about this film and how scary it is, I caught its return to the theaters. For starters, I'll say this. Get past the first 15-20 minutes, because initially it comes across as cartoonish and obvious and gives no indication of how clever and brash it's going to become. But a sharp soundtrack early on gives a hint of something to come.This mystery story of a young couple, black man and his white girlfriend meeting the latter's parents in their suburban house quickly sheds its cookie cutter aura and becomes something brazen and ominous as the family members are introduced. The film pulls no punches in landing one stereotypcial gag after another. If you're a politically correct individual who cannot stand any kind of racially-charged digs, this film isn't for you. I found the jokes to be so shameless and the satire so biting, that it made a film about race relations in this day and age seem almost carefree. And although it does have some isolated horror elements, this is a suspense film through and through.Don't get me wrong. The humor aside, this movie is not afraid to get its hands dirty. But the outrage is really on mute. This is not the kind of film that should stir up strong emotions for the simple reason that it's so escapist and cheerfully juvenile. At the same time, despite its sheer style and witty screenplay, I don't see this film winning Best Picture. Happily recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Very Well Made---but I have a question someone can answer,"Very entertaining. Jordan Peele is hilarious and he has a good touch with suspense and Horror. I am looking forward to his next work.

What is up with the opening scene? if that is the guy that went missing, Andrew hayworth (or something close to that) his attack goes completely against the way they lured the others? The Daughter lured the men and then they hynotized the men and controlled their mind and ultimately turned them into ""zombie like"" but the beginning the man is attacked and strangled and thrown into a car? Was he Dead? is he the man with the funny hat that went missing. and again if so, Why was he taken that way? the whole movie was about Hypnosis, not killing/attacking men on the street. anyone have a rational explanation? and absolutely no one is asking about this.

A measured and endearing enough beginning,"A measured and endearing enough beginning as a couple proceed to 'meet the parents'. The fact that she is white, the family wealthy and he is black shouldn't make any difference. Should it? He is aprehensive and we understand and to some extent share his concerns, especially as she seems not to have any similar concerns. This is where we are already sensing something is wrong but when things turn 'weird' at the house we rather relax into the notion that this is going to be a horror story, maybe based on the guy's paranoia. Well, this goes way beyond that into 'Society' and 'Stepford Wives' territory, but always with an element of race. This becomes more and more pronounced until the film is about little else and the audience is set up to cheer the death count (of the white folk). Allison Williams is a real discovery and will surely go o to greater things and the director too clearly has skills but that chip on his shoulder and a liking for racial humour may hold him back.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Absolutely terrible!!!,"I wonder if I can press charges against Jordan Peele, for ROBBING me of 104 minutes?There's nothing new, or refreshing about this horrible ""movie"".

It's like an SJW's version of Orwell's ANIMAL FARM...""Black people gooood...white people baaaad!"". Instead of creating a film that would help revitalize a quickly stagnating genre, Jordan Peele has created nothing more than a piece of propagating filth. Rather than trying to make a film showing the unity of the human race, he drives a wedge of contention between the races...further fueling bigotry, and hate. It's pompousness, and arrogance that strokes the flames, NOT genius. If I could rate this drivel less than 1, I would. Stay far, far away from this!!!",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Original and Thoughtful Horror,"Let me just say straight up, I'm not a fan of horror but this film directed and written by Jordan Peele is very original in the storyline and themes within the movie. It is really a fresh take on the genre weaving a social message without any heavy handedness. Without giving away the story line, the movie is about an African American man with a white girl friend going home with her to visit her white parents. He has the trepidation any African American would face in this situation. Is the family racist? If so, how racist? Will there be lots of awkward conversations about African Americans?

A modern classic,"Jordan Peele's debut has changed the game. A sharp, visceral and at some points comedic look at 'modern racism' in america is just what cinema needed.Social thrillers now have standards set far higher than any predecessor due to outstanding performances by Daniel kaluuya and Allison williams and a captivating story line with a perfect plot twist.What prevents this thriller from reaching the heights of nolans is the unfortunate unrealistic concept of brain transfers which frustratingly holds back this film from becoming a masterpiece.Despite that the symbols and motifs lift this film well beyond classic thrillers and has engraved itself in the history of cinema",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Decent movie, but over-rated","As a general rule of thumb, I trust IMDb ratings to represent how good / bad a movie is. But there have been a couple of movies recently that I've seen that have just not lived up to their IMDb rating promise, and this is one of them. Never in a million years is this a 7.7-star (at the time of writing) movie.First, the positives. ""Get Out"" was very well acted, and all the characters were believable. And I was gripped enough throughout to not be checking my phone every few minutes -- in that respect, it's a decent enough movie.I note quite a lot of the reviews here dwell on the racial theme of the film, and give it 1-star on the basis that they think that such racism isn't real, and the film is simply ""paranoid."" My hunch is these people are probably white and thus don't really know what it's like to live as a black person in a white society. So to mark it down on that basis is a nonsense.I'm marking it down because it wasn't a particularly great horror movie, it was somewhat predictable in parts, and I found it a little weird in parts too. For example, the movie was pretty serious largely -- not something you would call a comedy -- but there were segments that seemed to jump into jokey wisecrack-comedy territory, notably around the main character's TSA-employed buddy Rod Williams (played by Lil Rel Howery). Those scenes just seemed a little out of kilter with the rest of the movie.I also thought the ending was a bit rubbish.Overall, ""Get Out"" is a watchable movie, but it simply is not Oscar material, and 7.7 on the IMDb Richter scale is just wrong.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Get in,"It's been about one whole year since Jordan Peele's Get Out was unleased onto cinemas and I've only just managed to see it! I call myself a seasoned horror fan but why on Earth did it take me so long to see a four-time Oscar nominated horror film? You know it has to be special when the Academy (who famously shun all genre movies) consider giving it a gong for Best Picture. After all, Get Out is the first all-out horror film to be nominated in the category since The Exorcist in 1973. Unless you decide to count the likes of Black Swan and The Silence of the Lambs which have elements of horror but are no where near as obvious as this film.Is it all that superior then? Personally I think we've seen better recently in films such as The Witch and It Follows, but there's no denying that it's a cut above the rest. It's certainly far more intelligent than most films nowadays, which the Academy miraculously realised after awarding it an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay last night. It follows black British star Daniel Kaluuya as he goes to meet his white girlfriend's parents at their large middle-class home. Everything seems fine a first but gradually things start to take a sinister turn as some very white guests arrive and seem to almost close in on our black hero. To say anything else would be to ruin the terrific surprises in store, I went in knowing almost nothing about the plot and was certainly all the better for it.Get Out takes a simple horror movie premise and turns it into a thoughtful and scarily plausible satire about racism. What's nice is that it doesn't shove it down our throats in a ham-fisted way like say, Mother! (which I loved, I must say) but there's stuff for keener viewers to dig in to. It never patronises its audience and is always interested in building up a sense of paranoia and suspense around a likable protagonist who we can all root for. It also manages to provide an exciting third act which manages to satisfy and thrill in equal measure.It's difficult to believe that this is Jordan Peele's debut film. The technical competence is pretty outstanding, although he has had plenty of experience starring in film and TV before so he must've learned something about being behind the camera whilst being in front of it! He shows great flair and vision behind the camera, always remaining focused and expertly building tension. Where most directors would go in for the heavy-handed approach, Peele uses subtlety and restraint. Even the barmy revelation is presented with such confidence, that you don't doubt the logic for a second.Get Out might not be the ground-breaking classic you were hoping for, but it's certainly a fine horror film with enough comedy to comfortably cleanse your pallet. Despite always having its tongue in cheek, it carries an important message about liberal racism and does an excellent job at making the audience feel what it's like to be a black man in modern America. The ending perhaps could've been less predictable and convenient, but Get Out offers plenty of hidden riches in repeated viewings.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

However, this brilliance is sometimes overshadowed by scenes that seem overly staged or lack nuanced realism, preventing the movie from consistently maintaining the viewer's full engagement.

"Don't be so Quick to get in on ""Get Out""","Jordan Peele's directorial debut ""Get Out"" is a comedy-horror about race with a sinister twist. With its phenomenal reviews and acclaim it's getting one could assume that this film is simultaneously ""funny, scary, and thought-provoking"" (as rottentomatoes put it). Well just because a movie has racial themes does not all of a sudden make it a good movie. We get it! Some people are racist bigots. Just because this film depicts that (even in a satirical way) does not make it amazing. The film is a horror, right!? Well this film ain't scary in the least bit and Jordan Peele relies on cheap jump scares early on to keep the viewer on edge. ""Get Out"" isn't necessarily bad; it does have some humor, intelligently thought-out character decisions (something uncommon in horror movies), and cleverly depicts a forgotten form of racism.

Is this really necessary.,"I really enjoyed this movie a lot. It was very suspenseful throughout, even the beginning which left you wanting to understand what was going on. So why do I title this, ""Is this really necessary""? I just don't get it why movies feel compelled to use foul language throughout the whole movie, which I found distracting. Don't get me wrong, I was not offended with it, just find that someone who uses that language on just about every line of the script is not very imaginative with their character. I find it refreshing when script writers, actors and directors refrain from it for the most part to tell a story. This movie would have been better if they cut out 50%.I would have given this movie a 10+ if it wasn't for the unnecessary language.

A creative if rather bland horror movie.,"Coming off of the amazingly bad comedy 'Keanu' Jordan Peele has decided to branch out into the horror genre. From various interviews that I saw with him, he seemed to bring this film out of a very genuine place. Saying that, while it has commentary about racism, it's not intended to be aggressive or hostile. It's just things that he has personally noticed. So he combined his own personal observations about race relations and his favorite genre of film, horror. The story is mainly about a black man that goes to visit his white girlfriend's parents (it's very weird typing it like this but, trust me this is vital information). Upon arrival, things aren't quite as they seem. Like the tagline suggests, ""Just because you're invited doesn't mean you're welcome.""Shortly after arriving the mom of his girlfriend puts him in a trance of sorts. She claims that this specific type of hypnosis is to aid him in breaking his smoking habit (a ""habit"" that we never see). This hypnosis scene is probably the best scene in the entire film and I wish we got more stuff like it. The way it's intercut with things from his past and how it slowly ratchets up tension using sound is all very well done.That's the thing with this film, though. It's about 50% good 50% bad. When it's good, it's really good, but when it's bad, it's really bad. The best thing I can say about this film is that It's a strong directorial debut for Jordan Peele. He puts a noticeable amount of effort into this film and it's clear that this material is something he really cares about. Everything looks great, sounds great, and offers great performances across the board.But this film really feels like a tale of two halves. The first half of this film is mostly positive. It offers some strange and surreal sequences that do make you feel uncomfortable. But, at the same time, there's also incredibly obvious racial commentary. It feels like the idea for the film was created before the story was. So we get a variety of great ideas for scenes that don't quite connect to make a cohesive whole.For example, the opening scene. We watch as a black guy gets abducted as he walks about the streets. OK, but why was that in the film? It's not really apart of the main story and doesn't offer anything much aside from a minor set up for later on that we didn't need. Is it a cool scene? Sure it is. It's all shot in one take and does have blatant satire but it's a good idea for a scene.And that's the biggest problem with the film. It mostly feels like a collection of good ideas that were poorly thought through. The execution rarely falters but the script feels like a first draft. The main story, satire aside, is basically none existent. But that's OK because there's social commentary to fill that void. The only problem with that is the satire is so obvious and so on the nose that it rarely left me with anything to dwell on. It's always spelled out for you to the point of it feeling like it was hitting you over the head.This is the most frustrating part especially coming off 'A Cure for Wellness'. Which not only had a solid story holding your attention but subtle, strong political and social commentary for anyone paying attention. And you really had to pay attention to see it, which is something 'Get Out' simply doesn't do. The oddest part is that the commentary all but evaporates by the end of the film. The crazy, violent things you expect going in start happening and it seems to completely lose its edge.It turns into this violent quest to survive but and that was great and all but I completely lost any sense of satire. Which was the only thing carrying the first half of the film. It's bizarre that the payoff to all this obvious satire isn't anything but mindless violence featuring characters that the film barely bothers to develop. 'Get Out' isn't the film it could've been. Its heart is in the right place and it has a good message in there. But the message is bogged down by how in your face it is and the fact that there isn't much more to the film other than that.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"""It really doesn't matter if you're 'Black or White""","""Get Out"" was written and directed by Jordan Peele and was his directorial debut. And a hot item on his resume it is too.Daniel Kaluuya (""Sicario"") plays African-American Chris Washington who, nervously, takes a trip 'upstate' to meet the parents of his cute white girlfriend Rose (Allison Williams). The parents, Dean (Bradley Whitford, best known as Josh Lyman from ""The West Wing"") and Missy (Catherine Keener, "" Captain Phillips""), are extremely welcoming.But the weekend coincides with an ""annual gathering"" of family and friends, and events quickly take a left turn into ""The Twilight Zone"", with anti-smoking hypnosis and a bizarre game of Bingo where the win is so substantial that playing becomes a 'no brainer'. Can Chris 'Get Out', with his mind still intact, before it's too late?This is a really clever script by Peele. The film baits you into thinking this is some redneck-inter-racial-revenge flick, but actually the colour of the skin is almost irrelevant. (Or is it? This angle is left deliciously vague). Some of the filming is spectacularly creepy, with the hypnosis scene being reminiscent to me of the excellent ""Under The Skin"". And never has a teaspoon in a cup of tea been a more devastating weapon.I seemed to have talked at length this year in this blog on the subject of the ""physics of horror"": the story elements hanging together in a satisfying – albeit sometimes in an unbelievable – way. ""Get Out"" delivers this to perfection, keeping its powder dry until the closing moments of the film before delivering a series of satisfying ""Ah!"" relevatory moments.While the 'physics' of the film is good the 'biology' is bonkers, featuring a plot point from the terrible first episode of the 3rd season of the original ""Star Trek"" (if you can be bothered to look that up!). But I'll forgive this, parking my incredulity, to salute what I think is one of the year's most novel and impressive low-budget indie horror films.(For the graphical version please visit http://bob-the-movie-man.com or One Mann's Movies on Facebook.

Should You Get Out and See This Film?,"Another February weekend, another time for a horror movie to hit the silver screen. Tonight, my review is on Get Out, a simplistically titled tale that is from the mind of Key & Peele's Jordan Peele! How well does a film directed/written by a comedian fare, as always, it's my job to share some thoughts, insights, and opinions on the latest film. So, stay in, grab a drink and read my thoughts on this ""epic"" film.LIKES:  Good Central Character  Comedic Relief  Well-Paced  Decent StorySummary: It's always good to have a character you can grip onto if you are going to watch them face the nightmares of this film. Chris is one of those protagonists that fulfills that role containing all the elements you want in a character: backstory, level headed decisions, not annoying, etc. Daniel Kaluuya is certainly one of the better horror genre actors, and portrays his role in a manner that doesn't want to make you roll your eyes, outside some emotional flatness the team made him portray. Yet the other actor to steal the show (not based on looks) was LilRel Howery as Rod the TSA. Rod's scenes are purely comedic, serving to relieve the tension the movie builds up and keeping it decently integrated into the story. These scenes, in addition to lightening the mood, keep the pace of the movie flowing to avoid that prolonged dragging feeling that many horror films seem to have. Such a pace kept the film interesting to me by keeping the suspense at a maximum. Perhaps the biggest strength to me, is that Get Out has a decent story laced with some originality. While not the scariest tale to hit the screen, this film has some hot topics built into the story (primarily racism and its wrongdoings) that go alongside the character building moments of the story. In addition, there is a nice twist to the tale, which may please many fans of this genre.DISLIKES  High Political Points  Unnecessary Scenes  Not scary  The ending being a little too easySummary: While Peele's writing is certainly impressive, tasteful, and clever at times, it also falls victim to being overly political for me at times. Get Out has many scenes were the extras throw the multiple judgmental stares, the rude, overstep their boundaries with too personal (and insulting) questions, or out of the way monologues about skin color that were more eye-rolling than necessary. It's not that I don't believe this issue exists, I just grow tired of directors deviating from the cleverness and pace of the story to make a point in these movies. Another unnecessary deviation was some of the comedic relief moments. Don't get me wrong, Rod's comedic relief was very welcome and had some of the best dialogue presentation of the film. However, there were moments where his scenes felt out of place, randomly thrown in there where they felt more like an SNL intermission than being pertinent to the story. Guess a comedian can't fully drop his roots. His comedic background may also be the reason this movie wasn't too scary either. Again, Peele has done the genre justice in terms of making a thriller with a decent plot that has some substance to it. But this movie failed to scare me at any point of the film, outside of maybe a few creepy stares from the brother or other staff. I think Peele tried to make it creepier from the realism aspect, but outside of that the jump scares were poor, the extras presentation was more annoying than scary, and the theme of the movie takes a different twist. Finally, when the movie reaches its exciting climax, Peele's writing definitely leaves you feeling fulfilled on many levels. However, much of that ending seems to be a little too conventional that takes away from what he built. Things happen in random succession and there are a few moments where logic (and realism) are dropped like so many hot potatoes it again becomes more humorous than fun.The Verdict:Despite my doubts, Get Out is a movie that stands out (in a good way) from many of the horror movies unleashed in the last few years. I always find value in a film has a good central character that has development and a well-paced, intriguing story to support it. In addition, while the comedy does have its out of place moments, the comedy is also a welcome diversion to make you laugh, fortunately in a manner that isn't overly stupid. However, if you are looking for a movie that will haunt your dreams and make you jump, this isn't the movie for you. Whether it is the lack of scare tactics or the overly political moments, Get Out's horror aspect is highly diluted in this film, feeling more like a mystery than anything else. Worth a trip to the theater? I'm on the fence about this one, but I have to say wait on this one until it hits home in a few months.My Scores: Horror/Mystery: 7.0 (mystery element) Movie Overall: 6.0",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

One of the best movies I've ever watched.,"THIS. MOVIE. IS. SOMETHING. ELSE. This masterpiece feels so indie, yet, it is one of the greatest cinematic artworks I have watched in my entire life. The story is so unique, the build up is so in place, there is not a moment of cringe horror acting, the characters all act logicaly like anybody would act in that kind of a situation, especially the main character. I don't know who he is, but from now on, he is in my top 10 actors, altho this is the only movie I've watched him in. Throughout the whole movie, there is this feeling of creepiness and tension which leaves you at the edge of your seat, especially at the end where you get to know and understand it all. It is not a horror, it is not a thriller, it is not a mistery, it is everything combined, but none of these alone.

The Alt-Stepford,"Some people go to the movies for escapism - for a diversion; a well-deserved break from real life. Then there are those who frequent the cinema for elucidation of deeper truths, or explication unpacking sociopolitical concerns of the time. Somehow (somewhat amazingly), comedy veteran Jordan Peele has crafted a film perfectly geared to appeal to either camp - and as his directorial debut, to boot. Get Out is an unforgettable cinematic experience, tackling subtext almost eerily prescient in the wake of racially-motivated hate crimes, rallies, and dangerously escalating discrimination (both explicit and pervasively subtle. But, lest prospective viewers pass it by as a soapbox diatribe, Peele opts to frame his discourse through an ingeniously un-didactic psychological horror genre lens (think The Stepford Wives crossed with Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, thrown into a Hitchcockian Psycho blender, and churned with a table saw). It's fiendishly eloquent, but almost outlandishly absurdist. And it may be the most clever, bonkers, nail-biting, irreverently ingenious, and grimly fun time at the movies this year.If that sounds like a confusing cocktail of diametrically opposed elements it is. Yet, somehow, Peele shakes, stirs, and serves the perfect filmic entrée disguised as an aperitif, its roller-coaster ride of emotions and response somehow working seamlessly as an ingeniously homogeneous film. Social satire and the horror genre have long gone hand in hand (in fact, ""We all go a little mad sometimes"" could practically serve as the tagline for the movie that is 2017 ), but Peele finds that true horror lies in the crushing weight of racially-motivated micro-aggressions sprinkled out by the caste of (sometimes) well-intentioned nouveau-liberals doing their best to counteract privilege by being a little too earnest in telling the only African American in the room that they would've voted for Obama for a third term if they could. Peele's satire may be barbed - perhaps too much so not to hit a nerve for some audiences - but its teeth are razor sharp, capturing the intricacies of moments of discomfort almost imperceptible apart from those experiencing them in both hysterical and cringe-worthy detail. His airtight script is succinct but extraordinarily precise, with dialogue rife with clever wordplay (watch for all of the seemingly innocent inclusions of the word ""black"" in innocuous conversation) and coy foreshadowing so intricate the film practically necessitates repeat viewings to drink it all in.And just when you're engrossed in cackling and cringing under your breath at the savage Act 1 satire, Peele cordially reminds you that you're here watching a horror film - and hits you with no holds barred. Of course, he's never fully let you fully forget it, with a chillingly surreal prologue, and poetic flourishes sneakily maintaining a mood of general unease (protagonists Chris and Rose hit a deer on the way to visiting her parents in the countryside). Some of these are artsy piece of tone-setting foreshadowing. Some are playful red herrings. Some are both, with enough narrative bread crumbs scattered to elicit some painful 'I should've KNOWN!' face-palming in the third act for all but the most eagle-eyed viewers. And none are extraneous, all firmly in service of forwarding both the film's horror tropes and real-life horror intertexts in equal, grim measure. Case in point: ""the sunken place"" - a bout of hypnosis-paralysis Chris is subjected to that has the film at its most claustrophobically terrifying while also providing a crushingly perfect metaphor for feeling consistently beaten down and repressed in a closeted discriminatory culture.As things take an increasingly chilling turn for the macabre (and Peele's pitch-perfect pacing stews tension to a frantic fever pitch with the effortless nonchalance of a seasoned veteran), Get Out's ultimate, rather sordid, gag is how easy it is to miss the forest for the trees. We find ourselves tempted, alongside Chris, to write off his spine-tingling experiences as paranoia (or the film artistically extrapolating on the experience of racial discrimination), when the reality could simply be that things are, in fact, so much worse than the fears a lifetime of living in 'polite society' has taught him to dismiss as overzealous. The realization starts witty, then becomes almost overwhelmingly sobering. And there's the definitive microcosmic distillation of the film's audience experience as a whole.Daniel Kaluuya gives an outstanding performance as Chris, establishing a baseline of perfectly affable nonchalance to make the rawness with which he radiates horror at the indignities he's increasingly subjected to all the more harrowing. Still, Kaluuya's work is too sophisticated for rote 'final girl' horror reactions, and a couple of left-turn character choices skirting obvious Hollywood moral choices keep Chris enigmatic enough to remain compelling throughout. Allison Williams is equally terrific, perfecting a peppy charisma with just enough of a highly-strung edge to ensure she equally dodges cliché throughout. Catherine Keener and Bradley Whitford embody that particular strain of friendliness that is somehow icier and more imperious with every smile to almost unnerving effect, while LilRel Howery is reliably hilarious, pulling double-duty as the film's bombastic comic relief and incredulous moral centre. Finally, Caleb Landry Jones infuses his inherent slithering creepiness into a drunken jock archetype to perfectly unnerving effect, while Stephen Root's warm eloquence provides a welcome foil to the tone-deaf effete posturing threatening to suffocate Chris.If ever there were a single film to distill the madness of the sociopolitical climate of the past year and make sense of it with acid wit and world-weary humour, it's Peele's unforgettable Get Out. It's psychological horror film as inventive and groundbreaking as it is sadistically playful. It's an unnervingly timely, walloping deconstruction of the intimate intricacies of privilege and prejudice for the ""I'm not racist, but..."" crowd. In short, prospective viewers would do well to follow the advice of its title - Get Out of your house, routine, deeply entrenched mindset, and drink in what hindsight will invariably decree the most illustrative (and fiendishly enjoyable) film of the year.-10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Not sure why people love the film the way that they do,"It is a good film, but I'm not sure why people love it the way they do. Like it is a social justice thing or something. I've heard everything from conspiracy theories about body organ harvesting to warnings about interracial relationships and nothing appears to come close to a true understanding about what the film does, and that is merely to provide metaphors for deeper issues about race. What those are, is totally up to you to decide. What disturbs me, is that people want to take the film literally, and the absurdity of what we see in this film suggests, at least to me, that the film was never meant to be taken literally.I almost wonder if people are actually watching the sketches from Key and Peele and enjoying them for the social commentary or if that aspect goes completely over their head. The fact that we're looking deeper into anything they do or try to figure things out suggests that the joke is on us. If anything I love the film because it successfully trolls people looking for something to validate whatever theories or micro aggression they may have. It is not a question of whether the film is the truth about anything so much as it is a consideration about why we're looking under pillows and mattresses for confirmation about the complexities of race relations that we already know too well.Watch the film. Yes, things are not always as they seem. But that isn't the point. The point of it is that you want things to be what they are not.

Get Out (2017),"I am a huge fan of Jordan Peele. I loved Key and Peele and loved that the duo stepped into making a film with a pretty good comedy in Keanu. All that said I had some strong reservations about Jordan Peele stepping out of his comedic element and into a horror especially one that is psychological. I didn't know what to make of the trailer. I was thinking that this had to be one of those ""horrors with humor"", I just couldn't see Peele stepping that far out of his comfort zone. While I feel this film gets overrated by the masses, its quite a successful venture for Peele.The film follows a black man named Chris and his white girlfriend Rose. Rose decides to introduce her boyfriend to her family. While everything seems peachy at first it soon becomes obvious to Chris that something is way wrong. The black workers in the house act so weird and reserved and the extended family and friends of Rose are far too intrigued by Chris and the color of his skin. While I won't divulge any deeper into the plot, I'd say this was a fairly satisfying film. Its an interesting effort by Peele, that has some real world relativism.The scares are predictable and come in moments that are exactly where we expect them to be. The film still keeps you engaged and entertained and coming up with theories of your own as you go along for the right. The film is kind of predictable at least the main arc of what is actually going on with the family. That really doesn't take away from what is given. There is a fair bit of nice imagery, which goes to show some of the creativity Peele had for this. The social and racial aspect of this film can't be denied, its a bit of a social commentary.This will probably be a breakout role for Kaluuya, he's come a long way from that episode of Black Mirror. The film received higher praise than i think it deserves but it does a good job at being a thrilling and engaging film. I am very optimistic about seeing whatever Jordan Peele decides to do next because I am certain now that he is very capable of going outside the comedy box.7.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The Most Original Horror Film in Years,"Talk about a major batten switch for a celebrity. Jordan Peele who is usually known for acting in comedies, goes the complete other way. However this film isn't all scary like The Conjuring. But what this film does masterfully is building up the tension. This film made me feel very uncomfortable and very uneasy, which is what it's meant to do and does it to a T. In terms of acting Catherine Keener, and Daniel Kaluuya give the best performances. Keener is very subtle and slow with her words making her character very creepy. And Kaluuya gives a frightful and ultimately terrifying performance and plays a character you actually rout for. If you are a horror film fanatic, this is what you're looking for. The only flaws are that the villains are killed off way too easily, making the last fight for survival a weak one. But for the fact that this is Peele's first film to direct, this is as good of a debut as you can ask for. I can't wait to see what else Peele can do. Check it out, or get out! Now to grade.

A Genre defying horror movie you do not want to miss,"Captivating, spellbinding and well directed - these are not the adjectives generally associated with American horror movies. It is a genre which is now suffocating under the sheer volume of silliness produced every year. A genre, so muddled by clichés, that it is not worth watching even for casual entertainment. And that is why Get Out stays as an genre defying exception. The debut feature by Jonathan Peele uses every genre tricks available - but does so cleverly that they become part of the cinematic language and not just thrill seekers' staples.Get Out works at multiple levels. On the outset it is a horror movie. It builds up the suspense masterfully, adds a well anticipated twist and ends with just the right amount of gore. But then in the narrative it becomes a social critique. There are moments when it becomes psychological thriller and makes you really uncomfortable. At times it pays homage to genre stalwarts like The Clockwork Orange but the very next moment it takes a turn towards a socio-political satire. And it does all of these with such an agility that the audience never loses the connection with the proceedings. There is a hero to sympathize with - but the other characters are masterfully played. The movie hints towards an underlying psychology of hatred which is very relevant in today's world.Get out is an absolutely recommended watch for the movie lovers. Such a genre defying movie is very hard to come by.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Fighting stereotypes with stereotypes. OR: Horror hype: Once again, it doesn't follow.","As a horror movie connoisseur, I couldn't get around this movie that has become a surprising box office success, has got positive reviews from critics and fans and has developed a hype that might classify it as future cult movie. Behold! The same was said about It Follows not so long ago, a movie I thought was tedious and overrated. As it turns out, Get Out is another genre movie that doesn't deserve all the praise it gets. Don't get me wrong, it's better than another Paranormal Activity sequel and is overall a slightly above average film but it surely isn't the stunning masterpiece most people make of it.Just to be clear, this film barely classifies as horror movie. I would call it a psychological thriller with some misplaced supernatural scientific elements. The movie had an overall vaguely mysterious atmosphere but it didn't get scary aside of two minor jump scares involving a deer and a servant.Let's start with the positives. First of all, the movie has a continuously intriguing mysterious atmosphere. This atmosphere isn't only supported by the gloomy plot but also by calm and precise camera work that offers a more than welcome alternative to cheap shaky camera stylistics in contemporary horror cinema. The movie features a moody soundtrack that blends in without being as eccentric as the Insidious scores.A movie is carried by its main character and British newcomer Daniel Kaluuya is a gifted actor. The character's emotions are portrayed accurately. You can see how the main character starts as calm, grounded and smart person and becomes nervous, hectic and confused. Daniel Kaluuya is a name you should keep on your mind because we might see more stunning movies with him. I could even see him becoming the next incarnation of James Bond.Let's talk about the negative parts. First of all, the trailer is basically the entire movie, so don't watch it. I didn't even watch it and it still took me less than five minutes after the main character arrived at the mansion to figure out what was going on and what would happen next. The fact that the movie is so predictable has a negative impact on its otherwise intense atmosphere. The movie fails to offer any surprises to people who are familiar with horror movies.Despite a short running time, the movie feels stretched. When I'm watching a horror movie, I'm not expecting any action and I'm ready to wait until the movie quickens up the pace but some elements in the film are either irrelevant or repetitive. Instead of showing us one scene where specific characters act weirdly, the makers offer three similar scenes until the most feeble-minded viewer has realized what's wrong with these specific characters. A subtle horror movie should take its audience more seriously and offer less redundant clues.This leads us to the acting performances. Daniel Kaluuya delivers a stunning performance. Allison Williams offers a solid performance but the two main characters have no chemistry and fail to represent a realistic couple. I could still accept this because that hint might have been intentional. What I can't accept is that every single other actor acts over-the-top, no matter if it suits their roles or not. It starts with the main character's hyperactive friend, goes on with repulsively rude police officers and ends with an entire family and its friends who behave as if they came from a different planet. This acting strategy is repeated to death until the characters have become parodies of specific stereotypes. That doesn't fit to a movie that relies on its gloomy atmosphere and intends to spread a message against stereotypes.On the other side, the movie takes itself too seriously. The scene involving a car accident and an encounter with a local police officer is obviously included as an element of foreshadowing announcing the main character's struggle with his mother's death and with white people with debatable stereotypes. However, this scene feels so forced and pseudo-intellectual that it takes away from the movie's atmosphere instead of adding to it. A very similar thing happens at the end, when the writers offer awkward science-fiction elements appropriate for old-fashioned Frankenstein movies but not for a film with such a relevant message when police violence against black people has increased in what is supposed to be the flagship of democracy, equality and liberty. It seems that the movie makers couldn't decide whether they wanted to offer an entirely serious psychological thriller with relevant social critiques or a clever parody playing with stereotypes. In the end, they failed at both attempts. The movie feels directionless.My guess is that it got such praise because it portrays an admittedly sympathetic black man struggling with abusive white people. It's funny how a movie that intends to mock stupid stereotypes is itself based upon stereotypes. Would this very same movie have had the same positive reviews if it had portrayed a white main character being abused by black people? I'm quite confident that wouldn't have been the case because people would have called the makers of this movie racist and the film's message debatable. This proves that the reason why this film receives such approval is because of its message that is at the pulse of time and yet simplifies a very important topic too much. If you take away the movie's intentions, what do we have left? We have an average horror movie.If you aren't familiar with horror movies and want to get a smooth introduction with a psychological thriller, this film is a good choice. If you are rightfully infuriated by the current rise of stereotypes including racism, you will get some food for thought. If you are looking for a clever or innovating horror movie that justifies its hype, you won't get satisfaction. My final suggestion is to rent this movie instead of spending well-earned money on a cinema ticket.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

I think advertising this as a horror is really a stretch. I guess you could compare it to more of a Alfred Hitchcock horror, as opposed to true horror like Sinister, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Evil Dead, you get the picture.I'm really surprised at all the 10 star reviews that misled me here at IMDb. This was more of a drama/thriller. If anything the best part of movie was demonstrating how white people trying to not be racist, can still be really racist. The movie is just saturated with dialogue like ""I can't be racist, I voted for Obama!"" or ""I can't be racist, I have a black friend!"". While I'm not quoting the movie directly, you get the idea.

Interesting idea but shouldn't have been done,"Honestly, the plot was interesting b it it was a dumb movie. What's the purpose for this movie? As a black woman, I found this movie interesting but distasteful. Why? What was the point of this movie? To educate about a fantasy? What? To horrify? Honestly, I hope to God that this movie didn't make racial things worse for us here.Peele is in a position that not a lot of black people are in and he chose to make a movie about this while married to a white woman. Oh because she didn't say anything about it, you thought it was ok to do this movie? Whatever dude. Next time, do a movie that doesn't involve racial tensions. Just make it about the black experience and some funny, cool or educational stuff. Or maybe even something else.

"intelligent, humorous, scary-a whole lot of fun!","When I look beyond the obvious race related message the film offers us, I still see an excellent and entertaining modern day movie masterpiece. ""Get Out"" is a creative, unique, and witty movie that I am so happy has gotten Oscar recognition (it's sort of what ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" was in 2015 in terms of an unexpected Best Picture nominee) as it will likely lead to more original voices being heard within the mainstream cinema (I can also say the same about many of the other nominees this year, ""The Shape of Water"" and ""Three Billboards"" both being primary examples). The subject matter the film tackles is clearly pretty heavy handed stuff, and is worked into the movie quite well once you get used to it. Racism has almost been used as a cinematic convention at this point, every year there's the new ""racism is bad"" Oscar bait flick, but ""Get Out"" pleases with its subversion of convention, as ""Get Out"" plays provocatively around with genre. At once it works as a mystery-thriller, a horror movie, a comedy, and a drama, and never does a tonal shift feel wrong or out of place. Everything in this movie serves a genuine purpose, which I have to applaud Jordan Peele on as I know that's not easy for a writer to really do. I mean, this is a brilliantly planned out film, scene by scene it stuns and entertains and the 100 minute run time feels more like a 50 minute run time. Really impressive stuff, and a directorial debut no less!",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The biggest surprise of the last years.,"Get Out was a giant hit, a movie that many people did not know about from exploding, was acclaimed by critics, with one of the biggest notes of Rotten, and when the movie came out he had good criticism of the public, but a lot of people did not find the movie All, I went to watch the movie with contained expectations, I did not even go with much hype, but I expected something very good, and at the end of the movie it was something better than I imagined without exaggerating one of the best horror movies I've ever seen, Is a film that has many criticisms of racism and etc, and are very intelligent critics by the very promising director Jordan Peele, the film is not terror to be scared, will have some scares, but nothing is too much trouble, the film does not have Jupscare and the The film also has a good amount of humor, highlighting Lil Rel Howery who is the comic relief of the film, the cast is excellent, the young Daniel Kaluuya is excellent, Alisson Williams is very good too, it reminded me To Jennifer Connelly In some moments, Catherine Keener and etc, all excellent, the film also hits the dialogues that are excellent, and also has many references to racism too, and obviously the film is strange in several moments, there are parts that you will not understand So strange, the script is very round, the only thing I did not like so much was a part of the end, I found it cliché well in a few moments, but fortunately the movie concerts, Get Out is a great movie, one of the best movies of the year , And the biggest surprise so far, I hope the film gets an indication to Oscar.

"""Get Out"" is an inventive, insightful and very entertaining film.","Writers are told ""write what you know"". For Jordan Peele, that meant writing (and directing) 2017's ""Get Out"" (R, 1:43), but also stretching significantly as an artist. Half of the Comedy Central comic duo of Key and Peele, Peele has been a comedian since college and is a veteran of The Second City improv troupe and MADtv. The product of an interracial marriage, much of Peele's comedy springs from his observations about race and racial divisions in the U.S., while he also uses his work as a form of social commentary on those issues. His talent and insight have earned him nominations for the Emmy Award and NAACP Image Award (multiple times each – including one Emmy win, an American Comedy Award and a Peabody Award for accomplishments in public media). Peele has also appeared in films (including 2016's ""Keanu"", with comedy partner Keegan-Michael Peele), television shows and internet videos. All of those experiences serve him well in ""Get Out"", a movie which has moments of comedy and carries implications for our racially divided modern world, but is actually more horror film than anything else.Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) is a New York City photographer who is preparing to drive out to the country with his girlfriend, Rose Armitage (Allison Williams), in order to meet her parents for the first time. Chris is nervous about how Rose's parents will react to their daughter dating a black man and Chris' buddy, TSA agent Rod Williams (Lil Rel Howery), teases him over the phone about the situation. Rose reassures Chris that her parents are very liberal and open-minded. As Rose predicted, her father, Dean (Bradley Whitford) and her mother, Missy (Catherine Keener), welcome Chris with open arms.It turns out that they are not racist, but they do make a number of racially insensitive remarks without realizing it and they employ two servants, both of whom are black. Walter (Marcus Henderson), the groundskeeper, and Georgina (Betty Gabriel), the maid, both act so politely that it seems phony to Chris, not to mention that they both speak very strangely. When Rose's brother, Jeremy (Caleb Landry Jones), shows up for dinner, he is even rougher around the edges than his parents. Things get even more uncomfortable for Chris when an annual gathering at the Armitage home introduces Chris to a host of rich white people much like Rose's parents (except for a blind art dealer played by Stephen Root), while one older woman is married to a young black man (LaKeith Stanfield) who looks vaguely familiar to Chris, but who doesn't act anything like the black men that Chris knows from back in his native Brooklyn.But it's not just the way everyone acts that makes Chris uncomfortable – it's also the things that are happening around him. A police officer whom they meet after hitting a deer on a country road treats Chris like he did something wrong, even though he wasn't driving at the time. Missy, who is a psychiatrist, voices her strong opposition to Chris smoking around her daughter and insists on hypnotizing Chris in order to help him break the habit, even after Chris turns down her offer. She also keeps prodding him to talk about a painful memory from his childhood. Chris talks to Rod on the phone about the strangeness of his weekend and then Chris starts finding his phone unplugged. It also turns out that Rose hasn't been entirely forthcoming about her dating history. I'd like to say more, but I won't because, as much as I've already written, there are still plenty of surprises for the audience to discover.""Get Out"" is an inventive, insightful and very entertaining film. Although admittedly influenced by ""The Stepford Wives"", what happens in this movie and why it's happening is original and sheds fresh light on the subtler manifestations of racism in America, even from sympathetic and well-meaning people and groups. In fact, it's easy to see this movie as one mainly about racism, but generally, as a Movie Fan, I see it mainly as a well-crafted horror film. There's a certain creepiness about it that starts early, and then slowly, steadily ramps up throughout the film and its appropriately unexpected and shocking reveals. Some of the plot points strain scientific credulity, but that seems to matter little in what is basically a horror fantasy. The film is perfectly cast and terrifically acted. There's also some funny, effective and well-placed comic relief (from Howery's character). That's to be expected from someone like Jordan Peele, but who knew that he would be so good at horror? This movie feels like one of M. Night Shyamalan's better films, with a strong subtext of social commentary. For so effectively presenting these elements and perfectly balancing them, this film deserves the nearly perfect grade of ""A"".",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Racist movie over-hyped by SJWs,"First of all, in order for you to enjoy a horror movie, you need to relate with the protagonist. The main character in this movie keeps on the same dull and lifeless expression throughout most of the movie, like he is constantly lost in his own thoughts. Even when someone comes out of the woods running at him full speed, he remains there frozen, staring into the void.
The plot twist is easy to anticipate early on. This makes the second half of the movie boring and tedious. Actually, you know who the bad guys are half hour in the movie, it's really easy since there are no good guys apparently.
Finally, this movie took the concept of Skeleton Key and replaced magic with science and blacks with whites.And if you ask why this movie has high ratings, is because of modern politics. Every single white person is portrayed as evil and envious of black people, in every aspect. Skin colour, muscles, talent, even eyes. Thus, critics gave it high ratings.",3.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Yes.,"Wow. Just wow. About time Hollywood had the balls to put out something like this. Bravo! This is the kind of movie you want to watch again right after watching it because of how new and innovating it is. This isn't the same recycled horror film you've seen a million times before, and that is why this film performed as well as it did. I'm guessing you know the plot already. A white girl takes her black boyfriend to meet her parents and the boyfriend notices an above average amount of racial awareness and overall creepiness going on with her family. And I'll leave it at that. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie without knowing anything else about it. I can't wait to watch it again.

The old fashioned quilt patchwork,"In a cinema full of suspense movies, ""Corra"" does not revolutionize the genre, but does in a daring and different way, joining blockbuster to a highly artistic cinema, we do not have that session of a fright for minutes and no shallow characters with Ghostly characters, complex characters, high development, social criticism, a spectacular direction and great performances, the daring novice Jordan Pele, accustomed to acting, and making his directorial debut recalls names like Spielberg for betting that Artistic side aligned to a good script is better than an appeal to call the public, also has a Stephen King side, for transforming from something so mundane and natural into something that walks the linearity of the supernatural and occult and why not even Hitchcock and even Shyamalan , And at times he very much remembers Scorsese's ""The Island of Fear"", for Jordan, makes ""Run"" a scrap of the best Suspense has to offer, even if it makes small mistakes. ""Run"" tells the story of Chris (Daniel Kaluuya), a young black man who goes inside to meet his girlfriend's parents, Rose (Allison Williams), arriving at the house, Chris begins to realize that family has something to hide ... It seems even an afternoon session synopsis, but the film goes beyond, the script is great, it's linear, it knows how to create a tension like few, this the first second of the movie we notice that something is wrong, this is the first The movie has a comic relief that bothers it, it breaks the tension of the film, the movie goes through more than an hour building a tension, and instead of letting the viewer enter, conjecture and reflect until a Hypothesis about the construction of the film, everything we imagine about the outcome is verbalized in a joke, and this is horrible, even the final solution being very creative, the last scene does not please, but it's not all bad either. The film criticizes a post- modern slavery, and the whole movie is surrounded by a racial tension that is suffocating, even though they are stereotyped in some points, the film makes us feel disgusted with characters not by themselves verbalize rampant racism, but rather By hiding it, this is new, it is well built, and leaves a very nice criticism. Unlike most suspense movies where tension has to be created, ""Run"" has an extremely clear photograph, with a warm palette, his photograph is almost cheerful. Permeated by a sensational soundtrack, which goes from Hip-Hop to classical music, it is here that, in due proportion, Jordan jokes about being Hitchcock, using the conductor and thermostat music of the audience, the sound design does not have to be used To scare, because the goal is not this, it is to create tension, and the soundtrack is completely perfect in that aspect, another thing that is perfect is the game of camera that Jordan uses, also emulating Hitchcock, the camera does not stop filming a Frame, she has life, because even with a few movements, she creates an absolute tension, always knowing to position herself in the right angle, she films the characters in a way, that even everyone smiling and cheerful, you get stuck in the chair and clenched fist , Because he knows that something is wrong, we can not fail to mention the rhythm that is going on in an extremely visible rising wave and that he acts the acts excellently, and contributes not only to the construction of the tension, but the construction Plot and character. With a cast, that even being little known, is completely fabulous, I will not mention all the actors, because even the secondary characters haunt, even that character in the background, who does not have some annoying dialogue, all are wonderful, but I will cite our Protagonist, Chris (Daniel Kaluuya), because it is what has a more different performance, because it is what makes the pape feel uncomfortable and intuitive with the situation, even with few words and few expressions, Daniel has an incredible posture, and A verbal communication that speaks for itself, this is very interesting, which creates an actor of many facets and complete.

Mind blowing !,I decided to see this thriller movie when I saw it got 8.1 on IMDb.com. It is about a black man being chased into a strange family living in a spooky house in countryside. What makes the film interesting is that the suspense is maintained till the end. The plot is very well written and realistic. The film is regular paced without any boring scenes and it follows a logical sequence. All the conversations are related to the subject. The Daniel Kaluuya is a great actor. I did not know him before. But I can tell he is very promising and we should definitely see him again in other great movies. It goes without saying that Jordan Peele is very successful both as a writer and as a director. Overall performance of the cast is very good.

8.5/10,"When Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) has to go to visit his girlfriend's parents he worries that they don't know he is black and that this might arouse problems. Yet, upon meeting them they appear more than welcoming until strange occurrences in the house and to him start freaking him out and ultimately lead to the discovery of a terrible mystery.""Get Out"" is possibly the culmination of the last few years of great horror and finally solidifies Blumhouse Productions as one of the main protagonists of the modern horror golden age, other than introducing the movie going public to the mind of writer/director Jordan Peele and his stunning sensibilities in genre filmmaking.What is possibly the most indicative aspect of this film's incredible success is the molding of tones and, as in all in great genre clashes, it makes the comedy and the horror work together and function on the same beats. That is something that is rarely found and when it does work it works to these incredible effects: there are moments where the tension is building and building to incredible stress levels and it gets released with comedy beats that are genuinely funny and laugh out loud moments as much as they are fu*king creepy twisted moments that add to the white-knuckled thriller aspect of the film.The picture is intense, really intense. It does not let you breathe for a second and I loved every moment of it, it always had me on the tip of my toes, I did not know what was coming next, sometimes I didn't know whether to laugh or to be scared and it just got me to this place of being totally locked into it with my body, it affected me physically and that is one of the best compliments you could ever give to a motion picture. Peele knows every trick in the box of how to play the audience and he rarely ever makes a false step in guiding us through the story. The scene weave is flawless and every new bit of information is delivered at the perfectly right time and escalates to twists and twists on twists which never lost me and actually ratcheted up the tension.It is clear that there is a lot of influences moving Peele around and it is a testament to his cinematic ability that they are never bluntly thrown at your face, instead they are used in a complementary way to bring us a delicious mix of everything. Edgar Wright, Quentin Tarantino, Roman Polanski all transpire beautifully through this film, yet possibly the best one that we get is Hitchcock. On one side we see the homages and the subtle similarities that only make the film better on another it just made me remember why Hitchock was and is the best and why his lessons are universal.There isn't much to point out here on the negative side, the film flows and hits you without having any stumbles on the way. There are little moments where the quirky, off beat atmosphere gets amplified to 110% and you may start to feel a little overwhelmed, but it picks up immediately and doesn't really leave any trace of that on the film. I think that a 10 or so minutes cut down could have benefited the film in making it even more hard hitting as there are little moments that drag and a couple of plot beats that are explained to the audience shamelessly when they could have been entrusted to work it out by themselves.""Get Out"" is a hard hitting Comedy/Horror, incredibly original and fresh and made with a stunning craft in filmmaking, especially considering this is a feature debut. It scared me, it made me laugh out loud and it made me sweat, a lot, I really enjoyed it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Scary in a weird disturbing way,"Get Out is an unusual suspense horror thriller Daniel Kaluuya is very good in his role but must be the replacement for James Franco who was odds on favourite for a nomination until ""allegations ""of misconduct at the 11th hour by actresses he had worked with scared off The Academy voters.
It's quite a good movie I found the subject of Afro American slave zombies slightly uncomfortable and politically incorrect.
The movie came out May last year so I had to hire it and watch on the small screen and it perhaps would have seemed better at the cinema as all movies worth seeing are but I'm certain Get Out doesn't deserve or have a hope of winning Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Director or Best Screenplay, all the categories of which it's been nominated for.
I have only one question after seeing this movie , why was the director of Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri Martin McDonagh so egregiously snubbed for a best director nomination when Jordan Peele managed a nomination for Get Out, which is a good movie but just doesn't deserve any of its nominations in my humble opinion..",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,"A young African-American man visits his Caucasian girlfriend's mysterious family estate."" This movie is quite Unique and in its own way. The moment it starts we are thrown into the typical Girlfriend/boyfriend plot along with the Meet The Parents. However what makes this movie so special is how it takes all the old classic clichés and turns it into something extremely original. We all know from the beginning that there is something wrong, but the problem is the audience can never figure out what is wrong and the direction the film is going to go.The acting was spot on by everybody, especially Daniel Kaluuya and Alison Williams. The direction by Jordan Peele was surprisingly spot on and he manages to mix Horror and Humor into this extremely well. It also moves along at a good pace, and it keeps you guessing what the heck is going on. The music was spot on as well. Very unsettling, extremely over the top, but it suites each scene perfectly. I don't think there's anything I would change in the movie.By the time you get to the end and you have figured everything out it really does make you wander how they managed to pull it all off! There is a lot of racial stereotype in this movie. I think it works, though. It never really goes full on with the racial stuff, but there are several scenes that may offend or even just make people shake their heads, but in the end it's just a movie and it's for pure entertainment. The Autistic Reviewers give this 4/5 stars. It really is a great and unique film. We both highly recommend it to all of you.

Brilliant directorial debut for Jordan Peele,"Jordan Peele makes his very interesting directorial debut in racial commentary/horror film ""Get Out"". I really enjoyed this movie, the lead Daniel Kaluuya was really good in this movie and he portrays such an interesting character. The supporting cast was also amazing including, Betty Gabriel who plays the housekeeper Georgina.What was really great about Get Out is its ability to blend comedy with horror tropes, so this is really something to congratulate Jordan Peele on in his directorial debut and it would be very interesting to see what he has to come. I believe that many of Jordan's personal experiences come through in this film as well, I do believe hearing Jordan Peele commenting in one interview about how he often feels uncomfortable if he was the only black person amongst a group of white people. That sense of paranoia really comes through and is fully understandable and relatable for a non-white viewer like me. However Jordan Peele takes a more comedic route with this adding some light heartedness to an otherwise serious topic.The horror and underlying mystery of this movie was also really great and the build up to the ultimate reveal was a very good process of which tension arise, so the horror aspect was taken care of also.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

It's not like they could do anything outside of that eitherActing was good and I think it was perfectly cast. And even though , it did feel like a little bit of a knock off of the Skeleton Key, It still had it's original spin and uniqueness to it and the suspense was good.One thing I couldn't really get past was their motive. I get they were going for a minority group for obvious reasons, they kept emphasizing how it was because they wanted a superior body ( quicker stronger) but why would that even matter if they are filing the role of a gardener and a cleaning lady. At that point it's better to go for other minority groups that are known to live longer and aren't as prone to some diseases.The only reason I'm bringing this up, is because this film was supposed to be ""smart"" and serious so it was hard to move past it.I'm still giving this a decent rating, I liked it.

Get In!,"This review of Get Out is spoiler free**** (4/5)AS IT HAPPENS, there is indeed no perfect time for Jordan Peele's directorial debut to come out. In a year when we've already had Hidden Figures, Loving, Fences and the Best Picture winning Moonlight taking their challenging turns in showing how racist America used to be. Peele who's also lived with racism decided to input all them racist thoughts into the incredible Get Out. The social commentary is cleverly crafted, too, not only adapting racism to the 21st century but also giving hilarious moments especially from the scene stealingly funny LilRel Howery who thinks that Chris is being hypnotized into a sex slave, cleverly changing the narrative but also giving laugh out loud moments. The film's design is purely intended to lift the façade of post-racial America and showcase the ugliness still lying beneath; the astounding thing about it is he not only sharply manages to craft the film with racism but crafting it so that he even made a hugely entertaining thriller with horror elements.Still it's not an easy watch for the modern audience, given that a young African-American man as a target for this goes without saying horrific, but incredibly well. The young African-American man here is Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) who's in a relationship with a young Caucasian woman Rose (Allison Williams), he's particularly nervous having never met her parents. He gets the idea that they're going to hate him, while on the other hand trying to make him a slave. When they arrive her parents immediately take a liking to him, they become instant friends. This is when the film changes pace, Chris notices that aren't quite right with this average American family estate he takes a certain notice to the African-American janitor and housemaid helping on the house - perhaps hinting that this family are stuck in the past.Peele makes us wait for even an immediate thrill to take place, to perhaps give us a jolt, but it's as while before this happens yet when it does the Goosebumps are relentless it's only a second but it's effective. Given that the tension slowly rises and it keeps our fixed gaze on the screen. Keeps the audience on edge as if tied to the seat, wondering what's going to happen next.What follows are relentless thrills and jump scares as Chris is scared lifeless, he's hypnotized to quit smoking which takes to bigger effect later, and he's left to a moment when he has to escape after being brutally warned to ""Get out"" by a fellow African-American in post-trance state. Peele amps the tension up to 11 here giving no boundaries as to how far he'll take this. The secret reveal takes a turn for the worse when Chris finds that his girlfriend isn't who she says she is – adding to the rising shock factor.Slowly turning into an escape movie when Chris is hypnotized he has to escape from a cell-like room. It has moments of Stepford Wives and there is a deer antler impalement reference from Silent Night, Deadly Night. This confident debut is never boring, it's hilarious, it's thrilling and it's original. Peele has come a long way since the altruistic comedy standings of Key and Peele and last year's muddled, Keanu. But here his dark side shows it's strength, Get Out is the cleverest horror we've had in ages and it's just what we need.VERDICT: A thrillingly confident debut by Peele a masterfully constructed plot carefully matching horror with hilarious social commentary with natural seat-edge suspense.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Nearly Flawless Horror Flick,"Holy crap this is a good movie. Admittedly, it's been a little while since a down and out great film has graced the screen with its presence; and longer still since a great, mainstream American horror movie has so effectively clutched the collective pearls of moviegoers across this country. Thus sounding off on this film might just be the product of being starved for truly awesome content. Still, the nerve of this movie; the brazen, gargantuan balls of this freaking movie – they're a thing of beauty.Those who have glanced Get Out's chilling trailer will no doubt know the setup. A black man named Chris (Kaluuya) is brought to the childhood home of his white girlfriend (Williams) in order to charm her upper-crust bourgeois parents. She insists there will be no issues, though it's obvious to Chris and everyone else in the room she's being just a tad naive. Consequently when the couple drives up to the stately family manor on the lake, he suspects little other than the usual barrage of forced, vaguely racist pablum. Yet the longer he stays, the more Chris notices everyone around him seems to be acting rather peculiar; including and especially local blacks who behave more docile and compliant than he's used to seeing.Using razor-sharp social commentary, quick-witted humor and good 'ol fashion suspense; Get Out has all the hallmarks of an above-average, turn of the century horror film. It balances its blunt themes with a lot of expressive imagery and a consistent tone of protracted, off-kilter foreboding. Between Catherine Keener's hazy somnambulism and Bradley Whitford's subtle coaxing the movie quietly spins on an ever tilting axis of weirdness. Every time that spin slows or the film's center conflict starts to wear thin, we're treated to the bizarre, show-stopping conduct of Betty Gabriel, Marcus Henderson and a particularly good Lakeith Stanfield to keep everything head-cockingly strange. And at the front of it all is Daniel Kaluuya who remains understated throughout, though his smirk can't help but channel Sheriff Bart's in Blazing Saddles (1974).The obvious comparison here however would be The Stepford Wives (1975), which attempted to do for gender politics in the 70's what Get Out does for racial politics today. The difference here is while one faltered in the realm of active, engaging storytelling, this movie keeps use glued to the screen from start to finish. Its escalating stakes and clever little setups and executions become the glue that holds Get Out together as it wades through the treacherous waters of third-act fatigue. Instead of veering bigger and louder like A Cure for Wellness (2017) does, Get Out keeps its tone and relies on its atmosphere and those sweet, sweet payoffs to tickle your brain and keep you invested.And boy is this, a tense and engrossing film. It aptly juggles all of its various mission statements in a way that is both enthralling and surprisingly polished. Director Jordan Peele (of Key & Peele fame) slips into the directors chair as if it were a second calling. His technical prowess is reminiscent of early Shymalan only with narrative twists and turns that feel organic instead of back-breakingly absurd.His freshman film is liable to leave appreciative audiences with a gregarious feeling of catharsis while leaving the rest of us in a state of shock.

I just don't get the hype,"Frankly, I really didn't understand the hype, and I found the racial aspect quite tacked on.

The only memorable element of the movie was the best friend's comic relief.Hey, I'm not saying it was bad, all things considered. It was a perfectly serviceable sci-fi/horror thriller.

Relevant Horror trip,"I was curious about the hype. While I don't think it is an astonishing film or anything huge or completely new, I cannot deny its a refreshingly original approach of the racism topic. It is like 12 Years a Slave as a horror film, in some ways at least. Also the twists the film contained kept me interested throughout the whole time (although the midsection had some lengths, but that was essential for the ending). The acting was solid. I really liked Daniel Kaluuya who I foresee to have a great career in Hollywood. Such a charismatic and expressional actor who hit all the right tones with his performance. Also Allison Williams was decent and charismatic. We will see more of her too. Always nice to see Catherine Keener. Bradley Whitford was also fine. Caleb Landry Jones creepy as usual but he really is good at that. Would make a great Joker one day. Great soundtrack that was only a small part of the excellent symbolism provided by Jordan Peele throughout the film. The screenplay was the MVP for sure. The ending revelation was a bit too out of this world and exaggerated for me, the rest worked as a fine horror drama with a lot of depths.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

This is highly irresponsible and offensive to any white person and if the film was the other way around with whites and blacks then there would be a massive backlash. How many films now play the race or sexism card now?!

Guess who?,"On a visit to his white girlfriend's parents a black guy finds his hosts have more than just a few awkward moments planned for him ...Well paced thriller, with some creepy moments and a fair amount of gore, but not a real horror. The set up is nice and snappy, and we settle into a weekend that escalates from social antagonism to outright exploitation. The mood is developed through the alienated existence of the weird black characters, and there's plenty material on the theme of race, but the whole thing is let down by a ludicrously elaborate plot. There are echoes of the disturbing Skeleton Key, but this experience falls short by comparison.The performances are solid, most memorable being from the actress playing the maid, who delivers some genuine weirdness. One character designed for comic relief is too deliberate, and fails to fit in to the plot at the very end.

"Real, honest, emotional and eerie.",The movie was emotional and heart felt from the outset. Romantic themes are present throughout showing how love can be wrecked by tragedy. The music builds tension well and the characters are distinctive and unique.Control is a key theme throughout which gets transferred regularly. This keeps things engaging and shows how easy it is for sides to change. The plot is anything but heart felt and is certainly sinister enough to warrant the horror genre. All parts seem played well by the cast and the movie doesn't scrimp on effects or acting/ surrounding scene quality.Perhaps it's appeal is how real it seems both emotionally and through strong acting . scenes eliminate the need for gimmicks and gremlins.,8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Jordan Peele's gutsy comedy-horror hybrid is not just entertaining, it is surprisingly smart in its daring satire","Get Out is a combination of a comedy and a horror, but it certainly isn't your average horror-comedy hybrid. It is one that makes a daunting achievement of not only evenly balancing laughs with a grim tone, but providing a fascinatingly unique examination on racism, an issue that is overwhelmingly relative in our society today. There are gut-busting laughs, there are some dark moments, and are even some scenes of gore. But above these components is an intelligent, yet bizarre allegory of the African-American community falling victim to racial prejudice among a society where racism has run rampant. The mastermind behind this treat is Jordan Peele, the sketch comedic star fresh from Comedy Central's 'Key and Peele' and taking the seat in his directorial debut. With a blend of vulgar humor and gags centered on racial stereotypes, Peele's comedic flair definitely bleeds through. This film focuses on Chris Washington (played by Daniel Kaluuya), a twenty-something year old African- American man who sets out to spend the weekend with his Caucasian girlfriend Rose Armitage (played by Allison Williams) at her parents' house. Upon meeting her parents (played by Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener) for the first time, Chris quickly begins to witness some strange behavior among the family including relatives and their house maid Georgina (played by Betty Gabriel) who happens to African-American. This leads to one major conclusion: something is not about this family.It is significantly rare that directors successfully pull off an congruent balance of outrageous laughter and spine-chilling scares, let alone splicing smart social commentary on racial prejudice. Jordan Peele manages to hit that note in nearly every way possible to the point where there is never a dull moment. The film spends the first half showcasing the paranoia of the lead character's uncomfortable situation including calm interactions with his girlfriend's family that quickly morph into awkward circumstances. Throughout the time, Peele does a tremendous job at breathing suspense into the atmosphere that viewers feeling off-kilter and questioning what on Earth is happening around the lead character and what the characters are thinking about the lead character being colored skin and dating a white female. In turn of satirizing the subject matter, the film does so by providing witty social commentary about the African-American stereotypes rather than being going the obvious route by preaching about racial bigotry. Along the way, there is more than a handful of laughs to be offered, most of which come from the lead character's best friend played by LilRel Howery who spends most of the time away from the chaos. It is not until the final half-hour however, when the film escalates into a gory and unnerving fiasco, challenging viewers' expectations upon every turn. While the ending does not the strike a chord in the surprise department, Peele never fails to defy against uniformity nor does slap viewers in the face with his political message.Get Out is an entertaining, audacious, and surprisingly brainy horror-comedy that not only showcases Jordan Peele's unexpected directorial talent, but opens the door to an outrageous fun, yet bizarre good time. Marking this film as cinematic gold for both the comedy and horror genre may be saying a lot. At the same time, it wouldn't be too unreasonable, especially as no Hollywood director has a made a more daring comedic endeavor such a long time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Fresh new Horror Film!,I went into this movie with high hopes and it truly delivered and then some. The film allows the viewer to sympathize with the main character in a way that many horror films have tried and failed. There's also hints of dark/awkward humor spread out within the film that either lighten up the mood after an intense scene or reveals a character's true intentions. The film is very suspenseful but there are some really great horror scenes that fans of horror films will enjoy.

This is a strong debut directorial and I can't wait to see what else Jordan Peele comes out with.,10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Darkly funny and whip smart satire of our time,"Get Out is a timely entry in these cynical pressure-cooker of times. It is a piece of compelling entertainment, ensnaring the viewer with a rising intensity of stirring paranoia; it is a sly whip-smart satire of our current world wrecked day in day out with racial tension and inequality. How it never becomes top down heavy and preachy is sheer master-craft.Part of the fun of Get Out is the winding twists and audacious turns, and a discussion of the plot will rob you of the fun. So I will refrain from doing that and will also not post the trailer. Best to go in blind. Believe the hype.Writer-director Jordan Peele's debut film is assured and deliciously wicked. Get Out feels like an extended Twilight Zone episode. It is a potent genre blender, pushing many racism buttons, sending them up in a refreshing manner without being preachy. Peele's comedic roots is showcased here and the high-tensioned wire-act is neatly interspersed with some hilarious respites, which believe me, is much needed. Peele also achieved some great tonal shifts as the narrative easily slides out of comedy into horror and vice versa with a snap. I love narratives I can't guess the outcome and even though I could see some twists coming ahead of time, I never felt short-changed because the characters are so well- drawn and the situation so twisted.Daniel Kaluuya, best remembered as Emily Blunt's sidekick in Sicario and an episode in the excellent Black Mirror series, is outstanding as the deer caught in the headlights. He demonstrated a lot of range and his character arc left me breathless as he raced toward the devastating finale. It is a dazzling performance that will make your blood run cold.When the ultra-violent final denouement rolled in, I was punching my fist in the air; only the really good ones can make me do this. It is definitely one of the most satisfying endings I have experienced in cinema and Peele has knocked it out of the park with his first film. Cleverly written with a pulse on today's crazy world and deeply unsettling, this darkly funny examination of what happens when you have got nothing left to lose is brilliantly addictive. This is a must-see for anyone who is occasionally reckless, ruthless or just plain psychologically weird, and anyone who loves clever movies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"""Get Out""- A genuinely entertaining and oft-thrilling horror-comedy filled to burst with strong social satire.","From the mind of comedic genius Jordan Peele comes ""Get Out"", a new horror-comedy that delivers the laughs and thrills at a mile-a- minute and generally excels in every department despite a few minor hiccups in the pacing department. Horror and comedy are very unique and strangely similar genres- both very much based on instinctual and visceral reactions (the tendency to fear in terrible situations and the desire to laugh), and it's always a pleasure to see a film that combines them so well together. Add in a dash of all-too-real social satire regarding subliminal racism, and you got one of the better mainstream creep- shows in recent time!The excellent Daniel Kaluuya and delightful Allison Williams star as Chris and Rose, an interracial couple preparing to spend their first weekend together with Rose's parents. While Chris has some minor worries about what they'll say about their daughter dating a black man, for the most part things seem more- or-less ordinary when the first arrive, save for Rose's father Dean Armitage (Bradley Whitford) trying a bit too condescendingly hard to be a ""cool"" and ""open-minded"" guy (""You know, I would have voted for Obama a third time!""; ""So, how long has this THANG been going on?"") and his psychiatrist wife Missy (Catherine Keener) pressuring Chris to stop smoking for health- reasons. But things quickly start to go a little... strange. Especially when it comes to the Armitage's black servants Walter and Georgina (Marcus Henderson, Betty Gabriel) acting increasingly out-of-the- ordinary and Missy's push to try and use hypnosis to ""cure"" Chris' smoking habits. And soon enough, Chris will discover that despite the idyllic facade crafted by the Armitage household, there are dark secrets hidden away within the home that could spell doom for he and Rose...Peele proves a more than capable first-time director in this spine- tingling tale, and he loving pays homage to a number of the genre classics that have obviously inspired him while never going to far as to lose originality. With shades of everything from ""The Stepford Wives"" to ""Night of the Living Dead"", Peele is obviously an affectionate fan of old-school horror, and weaves in subtle and rewarding parallels that other fans might pick up on. His eye for composition is quite stirring and I was really taken by some genuinely effective uses of extreme wide and extreme closeups that pleasantly reminded me of some of the greats like Hitchcock and even Sergio Leone in a few key moments. I also appreciated his general sense of deliberation... Peele doesn't feel the need the throw in loud stingers and non-stop jumps to jolt the audience into paying attention. He knows atmosphere is key.The script is a great deal of fun, and Peele's handling of characters and the subtle racism of old-school societal expectation leads to many moments of pure gold. While he never lets up on the ever-growing and slowly-building sense of tension and intrigue, he injects just enough humor of the film (much of which relates to a delightful character played by Lil Rel Howery) to give the audience breathing room and supply some genuine laughs. The fun that's had with social satire (especially about subtle racism) is a breath of fresh air and adds quite a bit of depth to the film's story. When Chris is told that his being black is ""fashionable"" and ""in"" nowadays by a character who is trying to be nice to him (despite dehumanizing him into little more than a fashion statement), you can't help but both laugh and cringe a little on the inside because you definitely know that's the sort-of thing that all too many people hear in the real world.The cast is just perfect. Kaluuya is endlessly likable and plays his lead role in a very thoughtful way. You always get the sense that there's a lot going on beneath the surface, even when he tries to play it cool for the sake of his relationship, and there's a lot of really nice moments that delve into his past that give Kaluuya some good material to sink his teeth into. Williams is sweet and likable. I've only really been familiar with her through her singing and music, so it was a very pleasant surprise to see her stretch her acting chops in such a good role. Keener and Whitford are phenomenal in their roles and have a ton of great moments. While you know something is definitely up with them... you haven't seen the half of it until you've seen the film. And supporting roles by the likes of Howery, Henderson and Gabriel (and even a small cameo-role by the great Stephen Root) are exceptionally well played.Really, the only thing holding the film back from attaining a perfect 10 from me are some very troubling issues I took with the pacing and structure in the film's second half. Whereas most films tend to outstay their welcome and go on for a bit too long... I felt ""Get Out"" was perhaps about 10 minutes too short, and the third act in particular rockets by in a way that made it lose some of its impact for me. There's also a few jarring scene transitions in the moments leading up to the climax that felt inorganic, which also hurt it. The film really has an ideal first two acts... and merely a pretty decent, but not quite great finale.Still, I can't do anything but give Jordan Peele's ""Get Out"" the highest of recommendations. It's already one of my favorite films of the year, and I can't wait to see it again and again.I give it an excellent 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

But that's pretty much it..Nevertheless, it was a gripping movie with a fairly good pacing that has you guessing and waiting for the next scene to happen.

Get Out,"Not surprisingly, ""Chris"" (Daniel Kaluuya) is apprehensive of his first meeting with the parents of his girlfriend ""Rose"" (Allison Williams) as the couple arrive at their remote country home. Now what we can plainly see from the outset comes as a bit of a shock to the folks, but they are cordial enough and it seems that maybe this weekend isn't going to be so very bad for ""Chris"" after all. Thing is, as their stay continues the young man starts to feel distinctly uneasy. He can't quite put his finger on it and the arrival of some close friends to help observe a family tradition (that Rose appears to have forgotten about) only serves to increase his anxiety. To add to this intangibly toxic mix, there is the behaviour of her brother ""Jeremy"" (Caleb Landry Jones) and the almost robotic behaviour of the family's two retainers - who seems oddly detached from any reality. Regrettably, he isn't and as his race becomes more of an issue, we sense that danger might not be far away. Satire can be very difficult to pull off with subtlety on a big screen, but Jordan Peele uses some clever writing and a great deal of the nuances of human nature to do some characterful manoeuvring here. There are some fairly obvious issues simmering away, but there are also quite a few subliminal ones that are disguised - to varying degrees - in politeness, however shallow. Is it an horror film? Well I'm not sure about that, at least not in any typical sense for the genre. It's not scary at all except in attitude and by the start of the denouement I was beginning to feel the point maybe a bit laboured. Indeed it rather runs out of steam having so intricately laid the foundations for something just a little more sophisticated than what we get. Still, Landry Jones delivers well as the odious sibling and Betty Gabriel presents us with a characterisation that wouldn't have looked out of place in the ""Stepford Wives"". Maybe it will resonate more in the USA but it's still quite a potent look at prejudice in many of it's different guises.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Rating: A,"Here in Portugal, Get Out was released later so I actually watched it at home ... twice. Yes, a movie like this needs a second watch, a more focused look at the details and a more concentrated mind to find all the clues to the expected twist in any genre film like this one. Well, I'm happy to say that Get Out is right up there in the contenders' list for the best movie of 2017 so far!I never was a big fan of horror movies, but as time goes by I keep enjoying them more and more (maybe before I just watched the pretty bad ones). I didn't know the cast, but I did know Jordan Peele ... However, not as a director. My God, how great is he?! Excellent directing skills throughout the whole runtime: amazing camera-work (some cool long takes), efficient jump-scares with the adequate loud and brief background sounds, but his major achievement is definitely the screenplay. Thought-provoking, disturbing and it handles racism and any preconceptions in a way that, by the end, floored me. Great concept, executed seamlessly.The unknown cast (to me, at least) is just an awesome surprise. Everyone shines in this brilliant movie and elevate it to a super captivating story that already has a fantastic mystery and intrigue surrounding it. Daniel Kaluuya is unbelievably amazing, all of the actors portraying the Armitage's family and housekeepers are equally spectacular and LilRel Howery (Rod Williams) is amazing as the comic relief guy.The tone switches a lot throughout the film. Peele goes from comedy to horror, from drama to thriller in an instant, but it's so well- directed that its fluidity is near perfection. Also, the editing is flawless to my knowledge and the way he depicted and explored every preconception and racist stereotype is really brilliant.A movie definitely worth watching, at least, twice. It has a huge replay value and I already see it as a horror classic.Does it have flaws? Unfortunately, it does ... In the smallest details, but it does. Watching a second time I couldn't help to notice that some scenes are just weird, with no real meaning behind it. Rose's backstory is my main and only issue with the screenplay, but I really can't get more in-depth than this unless I spoil it for you, which I won't. I can just say that there's a plot point that I still struggle to accept/understand.There are also some exposition scenes that could have been handled differently and the pacing dragged a little bit in the second act, but it didn't affect me that much since the writing is so great that it almost passed by without me really noticing.Get Out is probably the most underrated movie in Portugal so far and I'm thrilled that I was able to catch it and watch it twice. Jordan Peele proves that his directing skills are something extraordinary, his screenplay is pure brilliance and his cast is unquestionably incredible, starting on the protagonist, Daniel Kaluuya, to LilRel Howery, the man behind the comedy bits in the film. A very important and thought-provoking movie with social preconceptions on other races explored to the tiniest detail, that only fails to deliver a precise backstory to Rose and it has some really minor issues with its second act's pacing and exposition scenes.MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Anti-white racist propaganda,"Not a bad movie itself-kind of interesting,some good acting,cinematography is fine...but story is ridiculous with too many plot holes-10 or so black people are missing all connected to the same white girl and no one finds it a little bit strange? Anyway,this is propaganda piece which makes it worthless in my book.All whites are crazy,all whites are evil,all whites are jealous at black people cause they have better bodies and so on and so on...this movie pretends to be social satire toward racism but it ends like being racist itself.p.s. Microsoft obviously spent some money on this movie and boy it is shown-they are literally everywhere...to see someone actually using Bing as search engine was even more weird then all that brains transplantation stuff!",2.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Get out,"This movie Get Out was a great film in my opinion. One thing I like about this film is the subliminal messages they try to give off through out the movie. In the beginning of the movie, when Chris and Rose were on there way to meet with Rose's family a deer jumped out into the road and got hit by the car,the deer represented Chris's mother. Chris's mother was killed in that same fashion as the deer was. If you pay attention to Chris he was traumatized by the deer and it reminded him of his mother. Another message Get out was trying to send out was the cultural appropriation. Rose's family and friends were using black people to reach a new discovery in their studies. They were hypnotizing these people to use their bodies to reach another goal. This mission represents the cultural appropriation that has happened in history and modern day. Overall the movie was a really good movie. The humor of the movie was one of my favorite things about it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Horror Worth Watching,"There was a ton of positive press from others about this movie which is totally justified. I watched a single trailer sparingly and carefully avoided reading or watching spoilers about this one to savor and keep my viewing experience unspoiled and I'm glad I did. This may be the best horror movie of not only the year but the past few years. I can say without spoiling anything that this movie combined the best of ""Guess whose coming to Dinner"" and ""Rosemary's Baby"" feel. What made the movie even better was that I had some guesses about what was going to happen in the movie but the story hits you with a sucker punch from a completely different direction that we've never seen before. This is an utterly new and different horror experience. It has some dry situational humor but remains an utterly dark and worthwhile horror experience. This is definitely a keeper and worth multiple viewings.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Excellent movie that touches many genres without being limited by any!,"This movie is unexpected and unpredictable - think Twighlight Zone, Alfred Hitchcock, My Mother the Serial Killer, Stepford Wives, The Lottery - put them all in a blender with great actors and spooky music and it comes close to describing this film. Jordan Peele slices through political correctness like a neurosurgeon. You end up hating the characters you liked and liking the TSA! Nothing ends up the way you expect. Heading in one direction, you think you have it figured out and all of a sudden, you take a proverbial left turn off a cliff (with a stupid brother playing banjo) and things are not what they seem. Pacing, timing cinematography, lighting, music all combine to keep things tight and focused. Funny moments but this isn't a comedy.

Interesting Horror Movie That Could Have Been Better,"""Get Out"" is a good horror movie that could have been better. The potential was there, but it fell back on conventions at the climax, which made it ordinary. It's definitely not a bad movie, but the rating on here is too high. It is more like a 6-6.5 type of horror movie. It's worth a watch, but it's not as amazing as the hype would have you believe.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Lame Name - but an exceptional flick!!!!!!!!!,"In retrospect - Perhaps the best way to experience this film is to read nothing, including genre classifications. It is extremely well written, acted and directed and is unlike so many movies out there - new clothes for an old body. This film is unusual in so many respects - from the symbolic scenes and gestures, and the music choices to the way it unfolds. After watching this film, I felt like I'd read a very satisfying book. More than most films I've seen in recent years, I really wanted to watch it again after having a fuller understanding of everything it contains. Sure, there were some 'plot twists' that I saw coming right from early into it, however these didn't diminish my enjoyment of seeing it all unfold.Thankfully, I did come here and read some of the ""Spoiler Alert"" Trivia. It revealed a few things that I would have missed. Obviously this is a film worth talking about with others, seeing again, rethinking, etc. On the other hand, I felt the name was very poorly chosen. Right from the first time I saw it advertised, I just about overlooked it, as the name, combined with the genre, suggested that it wasn't probably the kind of film that would interest me. I'm so glad that I decided to check it out. I suspect different people will have very different reactions to it. It touches on some serious points, strikes unexpected nerves, and has some very unpredictable scenes.Hard to believe that this is a first time director.A very strong piece of work, with great contributions from most departments: (preproduction, production and post production)UNFORGETTABLE!",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Oh yeah: a horror movie that is actually good. A rare bird, this, no?","You could predict the quality – or at least freshness – from the trailers but nothing will quite prepare you for this joyride which is a contender for the best horror movie of recent times, and crafty enough to satisfy also those who don't really care about horror movies. Such as me.Brother (Daniel Kaluuya) dating a white girl (Allison Williams) is dragged to her family estate for the weekend. But something is off from the very start of the journey, and it gets stranger by the minute.There's a variety of cool cats in smaller supporting roles and you will probably not know them by name, but I will list them anyway: Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener as the mother and father, Caleb Landry Jones as the brother, Betty Gabriel as the house maid, LilRel Howery as one of the funniest cases of black guy acting like Hollywood comedy black guy I can remember.IMDb claims he is a rising stand-up comedy star, and he's surely an instant crowd-pleaser here. You will love every precious minute the guy gets to grace the screen.But back to the movie at hand. Get Out"" is an effective horror piece but director-screenwriter Jordan Peele's ambitions are decidedly wider than that, and he can meet the high standards that he has set.If I have to to summarize his biggest accomplishment, then I would say that Peele proves to be a master storyteller.There's a surprising diversity and depth to material. It can be followed as social commentary (what it's like to be different; how covertly racist the modern society can be), classic horror story (adventurer braving the lands unknown) and a crafty cat-and-mouse thriller where the joy of watching rises from following how every ""chess piece"" is moved and how the others react.In addition, there's an unexpected comic relief going on, mainly acted out by LilRey Howrey as mentioned above. And last but not least, the movie makers have really taken their time with the characters and the setting to build an natural, convincing atmosphere which can stand on its own and doesn't have to rely on cheap horror tactics as sudden horrifying noises and movements.Peele actually uses some of those too, but in a way that doesn't feel exploitative; these help to strenghten the oppressive atmosphere and further show how the main character feels.If I may nitpick a little, the central hero deserves to have some more individuality because he mostly gets to react to awkward and/or unpleasant situations like in black version of Curb Your Enthusiasm"" or something. This one-note-performance by Kaluuya honestly gets a bit monotone before the action-filled final act.But all in all, the chosen approach is understandable because Get Out"" is only 103 minutes long and has a lot happening. And to credit the cast one more time, everybody's offering a top-quality work, even the people in smallest roles.Considering how much their faces are shown up-close, it's no mean feat. I'd even call it one of the most memorable ensemble movies of recent times.There are also some pacing issues, mostly during the end which would be more hard-hitting if played out faster, especially as some major turns are not that hard to figure out by the middle.Of course, that would require attentive watching and not checking your phone all the time, as many youngsters do these days. Also, horror fans would probably like to see more gore but this is not a problem in itself. So the movie's not near perfect but what is, eh?Get Out"" is that rare kind of horror movie that really deserves some major-ass awards or nominations. Maybe Oscar noms for original screenplay, directing, and several possible picks from supporting cast (Betty Gabriel, Bradley Whitford, LilRel Howery if I can pick three).If you liked this little gem that deserves to be called born classic, then you will be pleased to know that it's been already popular in cinemas. It only cost 4.5 million USD and has already brought 113 mil from the U.S. box office alone.""Get Out"" is the best movie of 2017 I've seen yet. And I have seen ten!

This Generation's African-American Horror Epic -- A Darker Blacula For Our Times,"Not since Blacula in the early Seventies has a brilliant African-American film electrified the horror audience and changed the way the mainstream audience thinks about race, horror, and the power of storytelling. But where Blacula was patterned after the relatively mild, almost romantic horror films of the early Thirties, GET OUT is a relentlessly terrifying thriller that captures the stifling, shocking paranoia of ROSEMARY'S BABY, THE STEPFORD WIVES, and even darker classics like THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE.By now everyone knows the basic plot -- a young black man visits his white girlfriend's parents in the luxurious home deep in the country. This journey is an ironic reversal of Marlowe's journey up the Congo in HEART OF DARKNESS. Daniel Kaluuya plays Chris, the innocent victim turned hero who becomes the perfect symbol of the courage, decency, and humanity that white America so often refuses to acknowledge in young black men. No one else has said it, but it seems to me that Kaluuya's performance is strengthened by his uncanny resemblance to a great black actor who left us much too soon -- Howard Rollins. The movie plays with the fact that Chris is much like the black officer Rollins played in A SOLDIER'S STORY -- the honest observer, the courageous truth seeker, the lone survivor. There are moments that seem torn right out of the earlier classic, just in the way Chris shows so much sadness with his eyes as the other black characters are demeaned and humiliated.But this is not just one man's story. Allison Williams as Rose Armitage is a revelation. Again, it's astonishing the way this gifted and sensationally gorgeous young actress channels the aura of earlier icons. Early in the picture, Rose comes across as exactly the character a young Jane Fonda or Katharine Hepburn might have played. She's the aristocratic ingenue with a prim demeanor and passion lurking underneath, seemingly cool but full of red blood and passion as well as sympathy for the less fortunate. The genius of this movie is that it takes this archetype, so beloved by white liberals, and then transforms the character in ways that are both terrifying and darkly funny.Catherine Keener as Mama Armitage was equally unforgettable. I'd seen her in a light-hearted comedy, HAMLET 2 with Steve Coogan. I noticed then that she has a way of striking sparks, sounding discordant notes, making the story turn dark just by her very presence. Here she's even more sensational!This movie is one of those rare classics that feels totally original -- yet at the same time it's full of tributes to earlier films. You can't see Chris tied up in a chair and shedding tears without picturing Alex in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. The use of hypnosis brings back memories of THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE. Nothing ever feels fake or added for effect -- GET OUT just resembles those earlier classics because of its power, style, and depth.GET OUT is a movie that has no weak spots, no slow scenes, no bad performances. It's the most economical thriller I've ever seen. You will not forget this young man's journey into a uniquely American vision of hell.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A mix and blend of horror and drama a social mind spin.,"Finally saw ""Get Out"" one of the most talked about movies of 2017 and I must say this work from director Jordan Peele was interesting as it's a take on society and a spin on race and class as it's blended with themes and elements of drama and horror and the film twist with suspense it's a real guesser and almost mind numbing.The story is that of an interracial couple Chris(newcomer Daniel Kaluuya) and Rose(Allison Williams from ""HBO's"" ""Girls"") who one weekend drive to visit the well to do parents of Rose. And from the start Chris feels out of place even though Rose swears that her parents are not against black people. Still all of the hired help and servants are black it seems like slave days. And the talk and questions used around Chris make him uncomfortable.Then strange happenings begin is it real or is just Chris seeing things? This film has you thinking too, as it's a plague as it's like Chris is falling deeper and deeper into this secret society as his entire mind and world is changing. Really this picture is a strange and different style of horror suspense drama that twist with a spin of race and social themes.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Clever and original 'horror' movie for the thinking person,"The opening scene of ""Get Out"" (2017 release; 103 min.) shows a black guy being abducted and thrown into the back of a car as he was talking at night in an unspecified suburb. We have no clue what is going on. After the opening title, we get to know Rose and Chris, an interracial couple . They are getting ready for a weekend visit to Rose's parents, who have no idea that Chris is African-American, but Rose insists all will be fine. On the drive up, when their car is hit by a deer, the cop asks Chris for identification, even though he wasn't driving. Rose takes offense at the seeming racial profiling. Finally Rose and Chris arrive at her parent's place, a suburban McMansion, and receive a warm welcome. At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie is a labor of love from actor-writer-producer-director Jordan Peele, making his directorial debut. Peele, best known for comedy, goes into a vastly different direction, presenting a clever and original 'horror' story for the thinking person. If you are expecting a 'slasher' horror movie, the likes of which are all too common these days in the horror genre, you will be disappointed (or relieved, depending on your viewpoint). Instead, the story focuses on an increasingly discomforting situation where a black man gets introduced to a white family (and circle of friends), who ""would've voted for Obama a third time, if I had the chance"". British actor Daniel Kaluuya, whom we most recently saw in the outstanding ""Sicario"", is even better in this lead role, playing the cool-as-cucumber Chris, until things aren't cool anymore (mustn't say more--biting my tongue here!). But the big star, even though he never appears on the screen, is of course Jordan Peele, who shows enormous promise in his directorial debut. Working on a (for Hollywood) microscopic budget of a mere $4.5 million, Peele gives us an accomplished 'horror' movie where less is more. Can't wait to see what Peele will do next, but whatever it is, I'm all in!""Get Out"" opened wide some weeks ago to immediate critical and commercial acclaim. This movie may well become the biggest financial success (as in: return on investment) of the year (rapidly approaching $150 mill. at the box office in North America). The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati this weekend was PACKED and sold out to the very last seat, quite unusual for a movie that's been playing already for weeks. But the positive buzz and correlating word-of-mouth surrounding this movie are absolutely merited. Even if you're not a fan of the horror film genre (like me), I encourage you to seek this out, be it in the theater, later on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. ""Get Out' is, in every which way, a WINNER.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Eerie,"I am definitely not one for horror films, and if you take a look at my other reviews, there is only one other review that would fit the horror genre - The Exorcist. And I only have that because I was forced to watch it for a film studies class, which in hindsight, I may have been able to request to not watch it.Anyway, the reason I am saying this, is because I looked online beforehand to research extensively, how much horror this movie contained. I read a review that said it was more thriller than horror, and the person wrote in detail the parts which would frighten. It wasn't much of a spoiler for me, because I usually don't remember the things I've read or seen when watching a movie. Anyway, I decided to trust this person, because they sounded quite honest. And it was worth it. For anyone out there who cannot stand horror movies, I am with you, and this film is OK to watch. There are a few scenes that initiate jolts - and this is mainly accompanied with loud sound effects. But for the most part, these scenes are quite troll like, in the sense that Peele wanted visceral reactions (as heard in an interview with Jimmy Kimmel), and inserted these loud, abrupt sound effects in order to achieve that.What I can't stand about horror movies, is mainly the horrific make- up/ costumes, and of course, the eerie soundtrack which no horror movie is complete without. But for this movie, it focuses more on the story, rather than the actual scaring part, and so I would say they wrongly categorized it, as it is more thriller than horror.Moving on, Kaluuya puts on an amazing performance. I previous saw him in an episode of Black Mirror, and have to say that he is really talented. His expressions in Get Out, and especially the iconic 'sink' scene (which can be seen in the trailer), is phenomenal. Williams too, does a great job, and their chemistry on screen is well established. I would have to say that Gabriel was another actress of which the film would be incomplete without. Her emotionless stares are super bizarre, but is what makes her character. Howery, plays the comic relief for this film, and his personality really shines through. His character helps the movie stay above the line into total darkness.However, the ending pushed it over the edge into ridiculousness. It was bordering between being realistic but freaky, and sci-fi comedy throughout the film, but the ending just pushed it all the way into the sci-fi comedy realm. I'm not saying that the genre is bad, but it was so good at giving that thrilling atmosphere, until it just gave it away.So, in general, I'd say that this is a great thriller, with amazing acting, directing, and cinematography, but a poor ending.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Nail-biting, creepy, funny and enormously entertaining","This is such a clever film. Not only does it have a thrilling, unpredictable and often shocking plot, but it also brilliantly interweaves the horror/mystery element with fantastic comedy and strong social satire. Brilliantly directed by Jordan Peele from start to finish, and featuring an entire cast of excellent performances, Get Out is a hugely entertaining movie that you really won't be able to take your eyes away from.If there's one thing that really works about this film, however, it's the story. Don't go into this expecting a typical horror movie, because you'll come out disappointed. Whilst Peele brilliantly honours so many classic elements of the genre, this is much closer to a mystery thriller than a bog-standard scarefest, and although there are one or two fun jumpscares, it's the tension of the story that'll really get you hooked.With an immediately unsettling atmosphere, Get Out is a riveting watch right from the start. However, what it does best is patiently build more and more tension and mystery into the plot as it moves along. The opening act won't have you on the edge of your seat, but it effectively establishes the strangely uneasy atmosphere of the big country house, something that plays a big role in making the following two acts work so well.From then on, it's twists and turns galore as the film dives into thrilling and even shocking territory. I'll avoid all spoilers as always, because you really don't want to miss the incredible reveals that happen again and again throughout the movie, reveals that turn it from an unsettling thriller/horror parody into something much darker, and yet so ludicrous you could never see it coming.And that's where the comedy comes in. As strong as the eerie atmosphere is throughout the movie, the story would be lost if there wasn't a good sense of humour thrown in too. As I said, things do take a turn for the more preposterous in the latter stages, but it works perfectly because the film always lets you know it's not taking itself too seriously, right from the start.But the great thing is that it's not the sort of comedy that would make this a horror-comedy. Whilst it definitely leans more towards enjoyment over scares, the humour in Get Out is fantastically nuanced throughout, never cheapening the nail-biting thrills of its atmosphere and story, yet still making for some brilliant laughs.You do get a good bit of comic relief from time to time thanks to Daniel Kaluuya's effortless charisma, as well as the hilarious supporting performance from Lil Rel Howery, but the best laughs in the movie come from the mix with the almost comically unsettling world of the upper middle class white people.And that's where the last spark of genius comes in. Jordan Peele's screenplay is already thrilling and funny, but what makes it even more impressive is its ingenious social satire. Although a little heavy-handed on the subject in the opening act, the film eventually gets into its stride with an utterly hilarious series of jabs at the suspiciously sanitised world of upper middle class white people.With all of the actors playing along brilliantly, to the extent where you get an insanely creepy Village Of The Damned vibe from the white side of the cast, there's so much fun to be had with the film's satire of that side of society, as well as awkward race relations that are brought up time and time again. It's a brilliantly clever touch, and it adds so much enjoyment to the movie as a whole.Finally, we need to quickly talk about the performances and the directing. The entire cast is fantastic throughout, all playing their roles appropriately for both a horror movie and something a little more comical, helping to glue Peele's two genres together so effortlessly, with particular stand-out performances from Daniel Kaluuya, Lil Rel Howery, Betty Gabriel and Stephen Root.And then we come on to Jordan Peele's brilliant directing. I've already talked about how perfectly unsettling and creepy this movie is from start to finish, as well as its brilliant blend of humour, satire and thrills, but I also can't ignore how well-paced and well- established this film is. With some excellent editing as well, Peele's fun- loving yet unnerving style works an absolute treat throughout, and that's the final reason that this film just comes together so well.Overall, I absolutely loved Get Out. It's a seriously creepy and unsettling film right the way through, and one that will have you biting your nails and sitting on the edge of your seat right up to the end. However, it's also much more than a brilliant thriller, with amazing humour and social satire thrown into the story, a whole host of amazing performances, and stunning direction from Jordan Peele.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Chris and Rose are a biracial couple (Chris being black, Rose being white) who go on a trip to suburbia so Chris can meet Rose's parents; but ""Meet the Parents"" this is not. There Chris sees himself in a plethora of surreal & strange situations, which I won't divulge because I don't want you to ""get out"" of reading my review if I reveal spoilers.

Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener nailed their performances as Rose's parents, Dean and Missy. I was especially hypnotized with Keener's work.

"Predictable, but still enjoyable","I've heard a lot of people talk about how shocked they were at certain elements of this movie, but that wasn't me at all. From the opening scene, I had a clear direction of where the movie was going. What did surprise me was the fact that the predictability of the movie didn't ruin it for me. The acting was solid, the writing was even better, and there was a very strange Twilight Zone vibe throughout that kept me engaged. The ending for me was really rewarding after all of the suspense and build up (even though I knew it was coming). I'd give it a 7.5 if half ratings were allowed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I liked it but didn't love it.,"A black man named Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) has a white girlfriend (Allison Williams). One weekend they go to visit her family for the first time. Her parents live in a huge mansion in the middle of nowhere. Her family welcomes him warmly but then he starts noticing strange things happening and realizes he may be in danger.It's a good thriller. The acting is good, the twist unexpected and there's some STRONG bloody violence at the end. However it moves slowly and there were a few plot loopholes that I could not ignore. So it's good but has been wildly overpraised. Recommended but don't watch it expecting a masterpiece.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Go in knowing it can't meet the hype,"Perfectly watchable little tale on the Horror-thriller spectrum.Could have easily been a fair bit better than it is with a script that is somehow very subtle in some areas and painfully on the nose in others. Missed some potentially excellent fridge horror moments.But I like the story, it's fresh, well paced and has well developed characters. The racial aspect seems more cosmetic than substantial to me, not that that really takes away much.I feel the script deserved a more experienced director. It's not badly directed but there are several scenes and instances that just feel naively realized, especially regarding the generic score that gives the audience a heads up about what they're supposed to be wary of which kills a lot of the horror potential.But despite the many wrong notes, the film is essentially made of superior stuff and if only we could maybe get a differently edited version ,this could be a masterpiece.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"A great film, but needed more horror","As a film, this was great; the plot was engaging and unexpected, the characters were constantly evolving, and the acting was very good. However, it doesn't strike me as a successful horror movie, because whilst there is a little bit of gore and some suspense, I didn't really feel very scared, just curious. It needed some more jump scares and more time to build suspense.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Must See Movie!!,"Get Out is horror thiller that dives much deeper into a commentary on the topic of race and racism in America today. This film does not leave you once you watch it, this film lingers in your thoughts well after the credits finish rolling. This was Jordan Peele's debut in directing a horror movie. He masterfully and subtly payed homage to classical horror films while still putting his own foot-print on the film. It specifically pays homage to The Stepford Wives and Night of the Living Dead. The film was casted beautifully and the two actors that stood out were Daniel Kaluuya who plays Chris Washington and Lil Rel Howery who plays Rod Williams. This was Daniel Kaluuya's first major role in a film, and I believe that he stepped up and his acting looked effortless. Lil Rel Howery was the perfect fit for the movie because he has starred in the role of comedic relief in many movies like: Uncle Drew and Tag. Next, the sound design gives the audience Toby Oliver and Jordan Peele work skillfully together to create the images in the film. There is an alluring scene where Chris is in the sunken place. This was very elegant and chaotic at the same time. They wanted to create a feeling of the sense of him floating in a black void with the screen above him. They achieved this by simulating Chris being uracistnderwater while he was on a dry set. Another great scene is when actor Betty Gabriel, playing the maid gets a close up of here crying and laughing at the same time while the camera was about 8 inches from her face.I would rate Get out an 8 out of 10 and a must see.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Modern day Frankenstein,"The movie is a contemporary Frankenstein enhanced with a racial edge. It is indeed a horror movie as classified but carries none of the worn-out cliches of this genre like an eerie soundtrack, spooky settings, creepy kids, cheap jolts, paranormal events all of which test our intelligence and patience because we've seen them over and over again. Although the main idea is 200 years old, the movie doesn't dwell on it but only makes a passing reference, thus keeping its originality. All in all, this is a brilliantly made movie worth seeing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Love This Psychological Thriller!,"I decided to watch this film after seeing Jordan Peeles ""Us"" and I am sure glad I did! I thought ""Us"" was great ,but I ended up liking this one even more! I love Jordan Peeles style and these films finally offer fresh new storylines and concepts, that Hollywood has not in recent years.

Amazing Horror,"This movie definitely lives up to all the hype and talk about it. It's been awhile since it came out, however, it is still a great movie to watch even now; and I believe that it is going to be relevant in the future as well. The character development is strong; stronger than most movies that are written. This one is beautifully written from beginning to end. This movie isn't like all the other horror movies that seem to be cliche from the start of it. The plot flows with plot twists and suspense. The premise of this movie seems to be something that can actually happen within our society and the society in the future as well.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Well directed and subtly terrifying: get out is my kind of horror movie.,"This picture honestly came out of nowhere, because who would expect from Jordan Peele, a man who was knee-deep in comedies and humorous yet of poor taste comedic duos, would write and direct this visionary picture. 'Get out' is by far my most favourite horror film, a classy film that does not rely on cheesy jump scares and completely irrelevant stories, it is a film that raised the bar of great scary movies and transcended to a high artistic level, utilising the power of cinematography, dialogue, soundtrack, symbolism and acting to crate a gem , a movie that sends shivers down one's spine without any kind of conventional scaring technique . First of all, this movie is a directorial triumph, with a scent of classic Tarantinesque vibe and subtle foreshadowing and clever writing, Jordan Peele took Hollywood by storm with his first and original work featuring an ensemble cast of both new commers and more experienced actors. Photographer Chris Washington , portrayed genuinely by Daniel Kaluuya, is an African-American photographer who has an interracial relationship with white wealthy southern girl rose Armitage , depicted by Allison Williams, and is obliged to meet her apparently opened family ,but after experiencing multiple incidents inside the family's residence, it is clear that the Armitage family has other plans for the poor Chris. The great amount of fear and plain confusion that Chris feels during his visit is beautifully screened by the incredible and Oscar worthy performance of Mr.Kaluuya , this added to the intimidating and honestly anguishing performance of Catherine keener added more depth and creepiness to the already shocking reality conveyed by the theme of the movie itself . Another crucial element in the success of the movie is the brilliant use of camera angels: the movies is a collection of perfectly shot and unsettling scenes that gave this movie its originality and granted its success. 'Get out' sets itself apart from its peers, giving more importance to writing, seen in the well-crafted screenplay, and vivid performances of its cast making the audience clench to their seats in both awe and fear. But what made me love this picture so much was how visionary the overall directing was, how much importance was given to the smallest details in the film, to a point in which you will always miss something in the first time you will watch this movie.
Another important aspect of this movie was its noble cause, or at least is noble message. The entire movie is an allegory of the racial state of some of America's communities especially towards people of colour, 'Get out' recaps rather brilliantly what has been said multiple times in many significant Hollywood films, but this particular picture meant the most to me because it made itself as a work of art in the process: this mesmerising picture is going to be the best start for a staggering career for the ascending director Jordan Peele.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Seriously ???,"I should have Got Out before the movie started..I am shocked by the high ratings this got. Seems like a case of the Emperor's New Clothes to me.

"Hardly a ""Horror"" but still enjoyable","This is hardly a horror movie. This sits firmly in the psychological thriller category. There were no scares that make up what is the basis of the horror/slasher genre. Even with the violence at the end, it is quite tame in comparison.Now this movie won't be for everyone but I'm willing to bet those who gave it a low score simply did it because of how white people are portrayed in this movie.The one thing I did think about throughout this movie and definitely when ""Chris"" got the big reveal about his girlfriend is from a movie I love. ""Sex with a white woman. A black man's kryptonite."" - Undercover Brother",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Get Out - A Bone Chilling Masterpiece,"The 2017 film, Get Out by Jordan Peele is a unique horror/thriller that uses satire to illustrate the injustices faced by the black community in America. In 2018, the film won an Academy Award for Best Screenplay and received nominations in both the Best Director (Jordan Peele) and Best Actor (Daniel Kaluuya) categories. Get Out was produced in order to defy the statistic that the black character is typically the first to be killed in horror movies.Get Out follows a black photographer, Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) and his white girlfriend, Rose Armitage (Allison Williams) as they take a trip from the city up to Rose's family's rural and luxurious property for the weekend-reaching the ""meet the parents"" milestone of their relationship. After Rose's parents Missy (Catherine Keener), a hypnotherapist, and Dean (Bradley Whitford), a neurosurgeon, meet Chris, the weekend slowly goes sideways. Rose's parents are overly accommodating of Chris and their daughter's interracial relationship which culminates to a series of unforeseen and increasingly disturbing events.The award winning screenplay of this film was excellent in foreshadowing the future actions of the antagonists. Missy and Dean's behaviour lead viewers to believe there is an ulterior reason for Chris' presence. The storyline of Get Out encapsulates white privilege; tbe setting of the grand estate embellishes the theme of the purity and superiority of the white race through a white supremacist's eyes.The soundtrack that accompanied the hypnotic storyline of the film featured Billboard Artist, Childish Gambino, and one of his most popular songs, ""Redbone"". Jordan Peele discusses why he chose to feature the song in his film: ""I wanted to make sure that this movie satisfied the black horror movie audience's need for characters to be smart and do things that intelligent, observant people would do.""The special effects in Get Out accompany the uneasiness of the film phenomenally. The effects exhibit many Hitchcockian elements (elements that are commonly seen in films of Alfred Hitchcock's) that are almost more unsettling than the storyline in itself.Even if you aren't a fan of horror, I recommend watching this film. The cinematography and screenplay alone are so captivating that the disturbing scenes are worth watching!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
More of a thriller than a horror,"Get out is not a horror movie. Don't be misleaded. It's more of a satirical thriller movie. But sometimes things seems forced.

Thrilling but Overrated,"I'd been postponing to watch this movie for a long time. Not having found any interesting movie as I wanted, finally I decided to see if it's a good movie as much as the people say. At first I thought that it was going to have a cerebral scenario but it does have a very straightforward one.As you now, Daniel Kaluuya was nominated for Oscar, but he didn't get it. I didn't think he would anyway. But I have to admit that, he remarkably acted well. You can feel the emotions and anxiety through his eyes. I'm a bit surprised to see his unexpected performance.The scenario is Achilles heel, the movie was relatively short and this may be the main cause why you feels so empty when the credits begin to roll. I don't want to give any spoiler but the less expectation you have the more joy you have is how I can summarize the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"well, dont think i ll see it again","This movie was nominated to best picture of the oscar in the 2017 edition, but why ?, i really wouldnt know, could be because of the controversy of 2016, about no black actors been nominated, and really was about lack of diversity in the nominations. Maybe this movie is just a scape goat.
So the movie..., very interisting plot, so much that they could have done with that i think, but this plot in the middle of the movie gets totally smashed by the comercial thriller wagon. Some of the scene were very well done, but most of them (the goodies) were the comic parts, or the conspiration ones, the rest of the movie feels very flat.
Acting its not the best in my opinion (although in movies like this is probably not the most importat), keener was a delight though.
In summary great start, but ends like a mission imposible sort of film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
They've got to be kidding me with this nonsense.,"I just wasted nearly two hours of my life watching one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen, I had heard great things about it, it sounded like an interesting concept, and to be fair, it does start off very well and draws you in. Young Chris Washington, an amiable fellow who's a professional photographer goes to spend the weekend with his white girlfriend's family - he's nervous, as most young men are when meeting their girl's family and that his girl hasn't disclosed his race to her parents puts him even more on edge. At first blush, her parents are typical upper-middle class professional pseudo-liberals - even without what follows, they're not at all likable - the young woman has a brother who looks like white trash, gets drunk at the family dinner that evening and, in his passive-aggressive way, really wants to kick the crap out of Chris. There's an extended family gathering that weekend - which makes poor Chris even more anxious, but he outwardly calm and unflappable and is a good sport, if only to please his girlfriend.I won't disclose what happens next - but the story just devolves into abject stupidity. Pointless, in my view, violence and a denouement that is anti-climatic. I couldn't wait for this film to be over - for a film that got off to such an interesting and promising start, I was greatly disappointed.If the message here is that white people have a desire to continually subjugate Blacks, meh - as a white man, I can't even take umbrage at that because A) I'm not sure that's what Jordan Peele is trying to assert and B) in its execution, it's just plain silly and mindless.Nota bene - I rented this from Netflix on Blu-Ray - there was a very clear message that if you WANT to see the bonus features, which looked very interesting, you had to OWN the DVD - the Netflix copy was a no-frills, movie only copy - really? Is this something new or Universal being withholding and just plain idiotic. Speaking for myself, I can't recommend this film - it's a cut above a made-for-television feature - it tries, in its way, to bring a ""Rosemary's Baby"" suspense to it and it just fails miserably in that regard - perhaps they were aiming a bit too high.",3.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Run,"The film Get Out is a satirical horror film. The movie is based on an interracial couple (Chris and Rose) and their visit to Roses family. In the movie every character has a large roll. From the house maid Georgina to Chris best friend Rod Williams. From the beginning you can see that the film is heavily influenced by its director Jordan Peele and his great humor. Mr Peele uses a social issue in the movie and plays it out until it's almost satirical to the audience. One of the reasons I enjoyed it so much is for how relateable it can be for anyone no matter race or gender both sides can relate. I really didn't like that get out tried to be like other horror films and have shock scares. It was a failure in my opinion.
On the other hand the cinematography was great in this movie well shot and really made the movie scary. They didn't spend a lot of money on the gore aspect of this film but you can tell they spent time on the special effects part of the movie in certain scenes. Get out pays homage to films such as Psycho and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. I would recommend watching Get Out it's a great movie for people that love horror as well as people that don't really enjoy it. I enjoyed every second of it made me have so many emotions in one movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A dark story accompanied with heavy social commentary,"The story was fantastic, it really scared and disturbed me for days.Of course, the movie was polished with exceptional acting and a twisted plot.I loved the idea behind the story and social commentary on the main character and the others. It did a great job on setting an evil and ominous tone and setting for the movie.My heart was beating hard through the film. There was something about this film that was really offbeat and dark. Those twists in the story that were really twisted.However, as soon as the movie really got into main problem, the movie became a little rushed, so as soon as we started to understand everything in the movie. It was over. Over before we knew it.Other than that, it's a masterpiece. I think that all horror fans must watch this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
different,well i seen such movies a lot but only the difference that movie had its end i loved the acting of the guy hero of movie. from the beginning it took a bit weird how a girl of such beauty will fall for such a guy but other way around love is blind second the family acted so calm and cool having no issue about who was guy mostly families react but they were like already prepared. the brother than proved that something is fishy in this family the way he was acting. the movie becomes a bit dragging in between slightly boring but i loved the end do see it i will not spoil by telling the movie story so go get out,7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
