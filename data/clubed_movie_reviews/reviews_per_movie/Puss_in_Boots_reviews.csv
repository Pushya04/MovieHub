A Nutshell Review: Puss in Boots,"Shrek had run its course, having forcefully pushed itself into a fourth film that was really too trying, but I suppose Puss in Boots, introduced in the second film of the franchise, proved to have nine lives, and extended his longevity through a spin off film of his own. After all, there are plenty of cat lovers out there, and his antics in the Shrek movies were undoubtedly the highlights when the Ogre and his pet donkey were getting really tired. Originally intended for straight to video, Puss in Boots proved to have what it takes for a big screen outing, and it didn't disappoint.Dreamworks Animation may seem to have a stranglehold on making a mickey out of well known fairy tales, and this continues in its re-imagining of characters adopted for the Puss in Boots origin story, where we go into his background as an orphaned kitty cat brought up by Imelda (voiced by Constance Marie), only to disappoint his foster mum when he got betrayed by best friend Humpty Alexander Dumpty (Zach Galifianakis), a brilliant inventive and creative mind who had turned to a life of crime, staining the honor that Puss had gained through a heroic deed, banishing him forever as an outlaw and bandit.The two major story arcs in this film enriched the narrative, one dealing with the past of Puss in Boots, while the other having him reluctantly team up with Humpty once again if only to get close to his new squeeze, the master thief Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek), to take on the very grown up and nasty Bonnie and Clyde inspired Jack and Jill (Billy Bob Thorton and Amy Sedaris), who are in possession of the fabled magical beans belonging to the other Jack (and the Beanstalk), where planting them at the correct spot would mean a path to the heavens to gain access to the goose that lays golden eggs, with repercussions of course that comes with a force of nature to be reckoned with.What worked for Puss in Boots were the strengths of its story arcs, the major set action pieces, the voice cast really providing that level of flair to the many flamboyant characters in the film as well as dramatic, emotional depth to key characters, and who can forget the comedy. There are plenty of sight and verbal gags, and innuendos galore that hardly a moment goes by without something naturally hilarious happening, and does so quite subtly without screaming and forcing their way down your throat. Which I had found the later Shrek films guilty of doing just that.Antonio Banderas provides the voice for Puss in Boots, and it's quite convenient that the character gets modelled after Zorro through a series of identifiable elements from costuming, behaviour as well as style, a character that Banderas himself have played twice in live action films. Puss continues to drawn upon established abilities especially that of its iconic hypnotic eyes, which somehow in a self-fulfilling fourth wall prophecy, will have any audience in stitches as well as held in captivating aww/awe. Zach Galifianakis voices the misunderstood character Humpty Dumpty to perfection, providing that balance of villainy and sympathy, while I suspect that the animators would have had a field day with Humpty especially with the plenty of movement gags that he got himself into, and playing upon none too subtle fat jokes on the character, resulting in the character stealing the scene most of the time. Hayek on the other hand did just enough providing her sultriness to the incredibly sexy feline that looked like, erm, Batman in costume.Hitting the right notes consistently throughout the film, here's a pussy cat that's both a lover and a fighter and a film that can appeal to both young and the not too young at heart alike. The producers of Shrek and Kungfu Panda may have found itself another character that has enough legs to carry off yet another franchise on its own, but please don't let it merge or include characters from Shrek too soon, as this kitty deserves a rogues gallery and supportive allies of its own.

A good family animated film.,"This movie must have been one of the first to take a frankly secondary (but funny) character from an animated film and to give it a prominent place in a film of its own. Its a fad of animation studios that has not always been able to make good movies but has certainly helped to increase their profits.The first appearance of this cat is during ""Shrek"" franchise, but in this film we can see Puss in Boots in a different way, mixing ""Zorro"" with elements of the traditional tales ""Jack and the Beanstalk"" and ""Chicken of the Golden Eggs"". I think it's not necessary to mention that cinematography and animation are excellent and everything looks quite beautiful and elegant. The performance of voice actors is good, with António Banderas and Salma Hayek in the lead. It's an entertaining movie, to please both young and adult, and will definitely be a good choice for a ""family get together"" evening.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
An enjoyable adventure,"This film is about a cat and an egg, who have been childhood friends, working together to find the golden goose to repay the town what they robbed years ago.""Puss in Boots"" is an adventure filled with fun and action. It has cute characters and colourful animation for children to enjoy. Puss has a wide variety of facial expressions, some of which are so cute that he is irresistibly cuddly. The songs and dance provide great entertainment too. Adults will find ""Puss in Boots"" entertaining too, as the plot is filled with proper adventure that is appropriate for both adults and children. The brotherhood subplot is strong and gripping, and provide the emotional elements to make ""Puss in Boots"" even more credible as a film for the whole family. I enjoyed watching it.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Pulls itself away from the Shrek franchise, which is a good thing.","Like many others, I was getting fed up with the Shrek movies. The characters, the way they were structured. It all made it obvious something fresh and new was needed to spice up the series and make things interesting and fun to see again. The way they did this was by releasing this spin-off, which involved just the popular Puss in Boots character, from the previous 3 Shrek movies, voiced again by Antonio Banderas.So basically this movie is being set in the same Shrek universe but without some of the familiar tropes and characters. This allows ""Puss in Boots"" to do its own thing and picks its own course. The movie definitely differs in style, humor and its buildup, from all of the Shrek movies. And this is a good thing really. It makes this movie like a much needed breath of fresh air for the entire franchise. However I'm still now more interested in seeing a ""Puss in Boots 2"" than a ""Shrek 5"".Simply said; this is a very entertaining movie. It's a movie that lets you sit back and make you enjoy the ride. It's filled with some great new and fun character, good humor and some nice action in it as well.The story is not great but it definitely serves its purpose. It provides the movie with plenty of action and adventure elements. Besides, it also provides the the origin- and background story of the Puss in Boots character, which I'm sure lots of people would be interested in.Absolutely no other characters, from any of the previous Shrek movies, appear in this movie. This means that this movie introduces a whole lot of new characters but luckily not too many though. Basically only two are really important; Kitty Softpaws, the love interest and Humpty Dumpty, the villain, voiced by Salma Hayek and Zach Galifianakis. And they are welcome as characters in this movie. Especially Humpty Dumpty, who is of course absurd to have as a villain, works out really well and entertaining for the movie and Zach Galifianakis did a great job voicing him.It's still mostly being a kids movie but that of course does not mean it's not fun for adults to watch as well. There are some jokes and references, which only the adults will get, while there is still plenty of silly and slapstick comedy in this movie to amuse the youngest kids. In other words; it's a good family movie!Visually and technically these movies are also only getting better and better. Especially the movements for all of the characters also seem more fluent than ever, which allows them to do a lot of convincing fighting and battling in this movie, sometimes even the two combined.Simply a very entertaining movie, that more than serves its purpose and is a real much needed breath of fresh air, after already 4 Shrek movies.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
They also call me Chupacabra!,"""Puss-in-Boots"" is one of the funniest and most entertaining animated movies I have seen in recent times. Its not perfect by any means, as some parts seem to drag and at times the movie felt a bit too long for its own good, but on the whole it made for a nice viewing.I remember a decade or more ago when CGI movies were an event to behold. Each release was noteworthy. Movies like the original ""Toy Story"", ""Finding Nemo"", ""Ice Age"", ""Monsters Inc."" and the first ""Shrek"". To that veritable gallery I would venture to add the spectacularly underrated ""Final Fantasy"". When I saw that movie back in 1999 (damn, I can't believe that was soo long ago...holly crap I'm getting old!), the potential of CGI movies was fully revealed. I thoroughly enjoyed the visionary creativity of that film, especially since it had a more mature, adult slant (something sorely lacking in CGI movies, especially in North America, where CGI movies seem to be exclusively aimed at a young audience).Since then technology has advanced by leaps and bounds and so have CGI movies. Now it seems that there is one of them coming out every other week. This has not necessarily translated into an all-around positive effect, because while their quantity has increased, their quality has steadily declined. Adding 3D effects and cutesy side-kicks cannot make up for the lack of having a compelling story, an interesting plot and well developed characters.This brings me back to ""Puss-In-Boots"". This movie has all that, a compelling story, a good message, funny characters and a lot of humour, including a healthy dose of those ""in-jokes"" intended for the adults in the audience, in most cases the parents who tag along with their kids to watch the movie. That makes it a truly good family viewing because not only will the children have a good time, but there is plenty for the adults to enjoy too.""Puss-In-Boots"" is the most entertaining CGI (animated) movie I've seen since ""Despicable Me"" and ""Monsters Vs. Aliens"". Not on par with the gem that was ""UP"", but a solid offering of funny!""We found a bag of catnip on you!"" jail guard. ""Its for my glaucoma!"", Puss.Enough said...",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fun Movie for Kids and Adults,"Puss in Boots was what I expected - interesting characters, some great laughs (including the Shrek-like humor for adults only), and an interesting backstory. Unfortunately, no cameos from major Shrek characters (I always get a kick out of Gingy).Antonio Banderas does a great job voicing the ""hero"" Puss, and the movie provides Puss' history with some good laughs and great images. The big eyes look of the adult Puss is topped by the young Puss, and we learn how Puss received his name and his boots.Humpty Dumpty is Puss' long-time friend, who becomes jealous of the young hero Puss and betrays him. But, Humpty Dumpty returns with a plan to achieve their lifelong goal - get the goose that lays the golden eggs. Humpty Dumpty has some funny lines and great visual humor. My favorite was Humpty wearing a golden egg costume.Joining the adventure and rounding out the trio is Kitty Soft Paws, who transitions from Puss' nemesis to love interest. The pair has some great chemistry for animated characters. Their adventures include run-ins with Jack & Jill (not what anyone will expect), magic beans, the beanstalk, and the goose that lays the golden egg.Overall, kids and adults will love the movie for its humor, cute characters, and action. Puss in Boots is a worthy spin-off of Shrek. And, the movie has a great message about learning from our mistakes, retribution, and making good choices.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"7 stars, and that's pushing it.","A wonderfully good looking movie about 20 minutes too long. All the chase scenes, the flying-through-the-air scenes, the long back stories grew tiresome, so I can only give it a basic five stars. I am adding one because the cats are just so darned cute, and one more star for Lady Gaga's song ""Americano"" which somehow I never heard until I saw this movie! The little puns and bits of 'cat business' were cute, but I wanted to punch Humpty Dumpty in the face after a while! He was a bad egg, get it? And there should have been a little more fairy tale and a little less 'Zorro' type swashbuckling. A good movie, but not great. But if there was any spin off from Shrek, Puss In Boots was the logical result.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Puss in Boots is another entertaining Dreamworks animated movie,"From the Shrek movies comes the Puss in Boots character voiced by Antonio Banderas with all the charm one expects from the character with the addition of Kitty Softpaws (Selma Hayek) and Humpty Alexander Dumpty (Zack Galifianakis) also joining for a fun ride of trying to avoid being pursued by Jack (Billy Bob Thornton) and Jill (Amy Sedaris). Many funny scenes and lines but also much dramatically compelling close calls abound especially in 3-D. Many amusing mixups of various fairy tales with ""Jack and the Beanstalk"" being mostly used as source. If you were among the disappointed (I wasn't by the way) when watching the last 2 Shrek movies, this one may make you forgive the Dreamworks animation factory. So on that note, I highly recommend Puss in Boots.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
It needed more,"Probably after you watched Shrek 2,a thought popped in your head and it was ""what if DreamWorks made a movie all about puss in boots and how he came to be the fearless cat we all know today, well honestly the movie was okay the animation was good as well as voice of Puss in boots was good The characters were all right. The only thing I can honestly think what was wrong about the movie was a pretty big and important thing about a movie and that is that is the story it's honestly your usual almost Indiana Jones adventure but so many other movie have a plot like this and it's kinda cliché overall I wished they made the movie more memorable like the newest one.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Below average but enjoyable,"Here's the good news: the artwork is outstanding, and the kids will love it for the most part.Here's the bad news: the story is cobbled together and confusing - children used to strong story backbones like the Pixar films may find their attention wandering. I mean compare this to Up - it's chalk and cheese.This comes across as an idea (money making opportunity) looking for a real story to carry it - it will be enjoyable for kids, so shouldn't be avoided, but it will hardly be remembered in a few years time.For some reason IMDb likes 10 lines to make it a legitimate review! - strange because this film doesn't need 10 lines to get to it's gist!",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Kitty's got enough lives to make it!,"Now before we begin, I'll make this quick on what i thought of the Shrek films. The first one, at the time, was a clever work of art that got Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy as a pretty good duo of animation voices for quite a while now. It was fresh, new, and one of Dreamwork's best CGI animated features. Shrek 2, was absolutely amazing. It took everything that made the original Shrek good and made it an amazing comedy! It introduced Puss in Boots as a spin-off of Zorro just hysterical, ESPECIALLY since he's played by Antonio Banderas, who played Zorro in the Martin Campbell movies, Mask of Zorro and Legend of Zorro. Overall, Shrek 2 is by far one of the best sequels that could ever be made by Dreamworks. Now for Shrek the Third and Shrek Forever After, all i got to say for those films is.......meh. they were okay.So now, Dreamworks still has a good hold for the franchise, but now with Puss in Boots. So how was it? well, let's discuss it first.The movie's what you expect it to be, an origin story of the whiskered outlaw with boots. It explains his backstory on how he became an outlaw and what he did to redeem himself of being no longer the villain his home town thought him to be, seven years after he was betrayed by a former comrade. For what it gives us, it's a pretty entertaining movie and shows a lot to give.Antonio Banderas reprises his role as Puss, and does a good a job as he always he does. Salma Hayek plays Kitty Softpaws, Puss's love interest and a master thief. She could take the shirt off your back so fast, it'd take you 10 seconds to realize you lost it. Hayek's not unfamiliar with working with Banderas, so she knows the right style of acting to choose with him. Zach Galifianakis plays Humpty Alexander Dumpty, and is pretty good in the role. Despite being in the Hangover movies with barely anything funny once in a while, he at least tries to give a pretty good performance. Guillermo del Toro has a pretty good cameo in the film, and it works out well, since he's also the executive producer of the film.One more thing I want to talk about is the 3D in this film, and this film's in the category for good 3D. Animation. The animation in the film, while CG, is gorgeous. Dreamworks has a thing for making such well made animated films, becoming it's own stronghold for CG animation, along with some of their films to have some well done action. Sure, i still prefer hand drawn animation, but i'm not saying CG animation is bad. I'm just saying it's overused. But back to the 3D. Like i said, animated films are one of the only category in movies that work best for 3D. And for this, it looks amazing. Is it as good as Pixar 3D movies? No, but it's still worth it.Overall, Puss in Boots is a fun family film that really knows how to be entertaining. It's comedy, action, and dark story all in one.",,Anonymous,Animation
Puss in Boots and the fluid animation and action is what carried this movie,"Now this is a movie that kids and adults can enjoy. It isn't a great family film but it's still a enjoyable one. Now if you seen the ""Shrek"" franchise you will know who Puss in Boots when it comes to his character. In fact I found him to be a great supporting characters in the ""Shrek"" franchise so wasn't really disappointed when I saw the trailer for a movie just for this character. Also this could be a stand alone movie and is close to being good as the first two ""Shrek"" movies. The action is fast and entertaining and although the plot isn't anything special is simple and yet enjoyable to watch. The kids and adults were mostly chuckling there way through this movie. What I found sort of surprising though is how almost none of the ""Shrek"" characters are in this movie and doesn't even make a cameo. Which in my opinion didn't effect this movie at all. I am glad that this went in a theatrical release direction instead of straight to DVD direction the creators originally planned. Cause this way there was more input into the movie instead of hardly putting much effort into it. The voice acting is very good in this and the character Kitty Softpaws is a very good addition to this. She reminded me of other characters I read about or seen but she is a cat and I guess that is what makes this work for the most part, although that might be unjust to some degree. The story isn't good but Puss in Boots really is the character that carries this movie. On a negative note though the story just didn't seem developed enough and thus the whole thing comes off as more of an eye candy with it's fluid CGI and action. But overall the positive outweigh the negative and to sum it up, it's a good family flick just not a great one. Sad to know that I didn't even know Puss in Boots was a real fairy tale and not just some character that popped up in the ""Shrek"" series.7.3/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Weird Mishmash of Fairy Tales but Very Funny in Spots,"When we first saw the trailer for Puss in Boots, I can't say I was really excited to see it. But of course, the kids wanted to see it so we did (in 2D only). I must say, we all had a mighty good time! No regrets at all in watching this animated fantasy-Western adventure.We see Puss' humble origins as a kitten growing up in an orphanage in the Mexican town of San Ricardo. He develops an unlikely friend in one odd egg named Humpty Alexander Dumpty. Circumstances eventually break up the two friends. After several years, Humpty seeks out Puss (with the help of sultry seductress Kitty Softpaws) to convince him to help get Jack's magic beans from Jack and Jill. I know this sounds like a messy mishmash of fairy tale characters, and it was. The artists also take liberties in their visual interpretation of these characters, including the Golden Goose (which I personally found corny).Thanks to the Shrek films, we already know Puss in Boots and what to expect from him. His Zorro-like swashbuckling exploits, his charm with the ladies and his cute wide-eyed pleading look are all here, and Antonio Banderas too! Selma Hayek voices Kitty delightfully. This new character is quite likable, and you would like to see more adventures of the two cats. As for Humpty (voiced by Zach Galifianakis of ""Hangover"" fame) though, here lies the prickly problem. You may or may not like him, both his look and his character. Humpty can really be annoying!There are so many hilarious isolated situations that could make you laugh out loud. I certainly did at several points. My favorite funny moment was that when Humpty changed into his Golden Egg costume. I'm sure you can get an absurd image just by reading that last sentence. Haha! His line when he was running and commented that he needed powder to prevent friction in his pants (he was apparently not wearing underwear) really made me guffaw! You have to hear it to believe that a line like that made it into a children's cartoon flick.The artwork was of course flawless. The textures are palpable. The action sequences are exciting and funny at the same time. The fight scenes mixed with dance moves were quite interesting to watch as well. The 2D version looked adequate enough to enjoy the adventure. Overall this is a fun movie to watch with the whole family.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
These boot were made for watchin,"The Cat. The Myth. The Legend.The Boots. Purr-fectly Meowtastic!Puss in Boots kind of surprised me to be honest?I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did...
It's far more wittier than I expected it to be, nicely animated, has a lot of heart and features a charming story of forgiveness and redemption that is perfect for the whole family!Just like the Shrek films before it, Puss in Boots takes classic fairy tale characters and stories, and turns them on their head to create a fun and compelling story.Better than it has any right to be, Puss in Boots is not only action packed and clever, but also reignites the Shrek universe with renewed purpose, and renewed heart...
The film also has an entertaining Western style to it too which I enjoyed.Just like Puss's sword, the storytelling is sharp!Antonio Banderas IS Puss in Boots!Originally breathing life into this little feline when he first appeared in the hugely popular Shrek 2, Banderas' vocal agility and ability is unparalleled.The dynamic that he brings to Puss is multi-dimensional, emotionally challenging and fulfilling, and above all, fantastico!Admitting that he and Puss are 'very much alike...
(Both swashbucklers, fancy-footed dancers and Latin lovers!)
You can genuinely hear the joy, the excitement, the passion, the humour, with every syllable.Self-deprecating and dashing in character, Banderas captures the essence, nay, is the essence of Puss!It's as if Banderas himself is living each adventure and is up on that screen himself!There is nothing cold or flat in his voice performance and with every deep dulcet tone one hears coming out of this ginger cat, it just ramps up the inherent humour in the dichotomy of it all.Zach Galifianakis is a devil of an egg and eggs-ceptional as Humpty Alexander Dumpty.Giving an almost squeaky creepy tone to Humpty's voice, it sets the vocal tenor for the deceitful and duplicitous nature of the character itself...
Salma Hayek is a confident sultry joy as Kitty Softpaws.Her vocal infliction and intonation spans the emotional spectrum, and as with Banderas, in particular, she is so dynamic you can almost see Hayek herself locked in a spinning tango in the sky!Overall, Puss in Boots is a creative, witty, original and fun story for the whole family!There is a moral message here that is told without being too preachy.The script is full of life, originality, humour and double entendres which are punctuated with slick humour thanks to the all-star voice cast!These Boots are made for watchin...",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A film for the entire family,"This is just an adorable animated film with Puss In Boots as a swashbuckling outlaw of medieval Spain. The error most family-oriented films make these days is that they either end up too boring for kids or too inane for adults. Sometimes they manage to do both, but his film manages to avoid both of those traps. It's full of great action sequences - they almost overdo this - and some meaningful scenes between the characters. Like many Dreamworks films, there is considerable backstory that is told through flashbacks so you know how the characters got to this point. It talks about the importance of friendship and family and the importance of owning up to and correcting past mistakes and there isn't a political agenda anywhere to be seen. There is so much of that lately in film - I'm looking at you Disney - that maybe this refreshing lack of an agenda was more common in films from a dozen years ago and I just don't remember it.I will say that, if you are somebody who appreciates the cat and their unique behavior quirks, their blatant emotional manipulation, and graceful movement that you will probably get some added enjoyment out of this.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Nothing memorable, but enjoyable nonetheless","Sure, I can understand why DreamWorks would make a full-length movie from one of Shrek's most beloved characters, but then why does Puss in Boots feel like nothing more but a spin-off, instead of a full-fledged animation film?Well, first of all, the style is exactly the same as the Shrek-movies. Of course, it would've been weird to see Puss in a completely different animation-style, but copying literally every single detail that made the Shrek-franchise so recognizing? That's just lazy. There's nothing wrong with the animation, it's crispy and the 3D-effects are nicely done, but it doesn't feel as fresh as it did when the first two Shreks were released in theaters.Second of all, the story isn't that interesting. It explains the origins of Puss in less than 10 minutes and then kicks off with another Shrek- like adventure. Nothing new on the horizon. And when Puss and friends do finally discover something truly magical, there is only a few seconds of aw before the adventure continues like it always did. The movie references a lot of fairy tales, but never does something interesting with it. However, I am glad that director Chris Miller chose not to overuse this trick like he did in Shrek the Third. It's more balanced this way, though a bit dull since it has been done many times before by the Shrek-films.I may sound a little negative, but I have to admit that I did have a good time watching this movie. Like I said, the animation is very pretty. I can't say it's a huge improvement over Shrek Forever After, but looks good nonetheless. Besides the animation, the jokes are also pretty well done. The timing is good and Humpty Dumpty (an old sidekick of Puss who has a major role in this movie) has some nice one-liners, delivered by the always enjoyable Zach Galifianakis. Talking about voice-acting, Antonio Banderes once again delivers a fine performance as the Puss in Boots. He doesn't have anything new to do, but I don't think it was necessary, since his voice-acting is so refined. Salma Hayak brings the goods as the voice of the attracting Kitty Softpaws, her voice-acting is as well-chosen as it is predictable.In the end, Puss in Boots doesn't add anything new to the Shrek- franchise, let alone the genre. But it entertains and kids will love it, so if you don't know what to do on a rainy Sunday, give Puss in Boots a try. It won't disappoint.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
The only good thing about it is that it features cats.,"Dreamworks apparently managed to produce the ""Avatar"" or animated films: an un-thrilling story with dead tropes played straight, relentlessly obvious from beginning to end, and exhausting pretty much every cat-related joke and pun humanly imaginable. The main differences from Avatar is that it's not long enough to induce coma and that it has lots and lots of voice acting done by non-voice-actors -- but that, for Dreamworks, is business as usual.Actually, the movie is not 100% obvious and predictable, but everything that is not obvious is abhorrently stupid. For some reason, these people still think it's hot and hip to senselessly mix up fairy tales and nursery rhymes in ways that plainly make no sense. It's random humour without wit, or as Internet jargon has it, ""lol random"". So, for much of the movie, we are treated to this horrifying, pestilent talking egg. And what does Humpty Dumpty have to do with the story after all? Exactly nothing. Dreamworks thinks that is funny, but it's not. Not only it's already old, it wasn't even funny when the first Shrek movie did it.The only thing I actually like about the film is that it features cats. Loads of them. If you go nuts with pictures of cute kittens, this film will be a party for your eyes. THAT it does well. And, truth be told, the main character is pretty strong, and even though the movie really tries hard to make him shallow and annoying, they couldn't do it.The rest is failure after failure. If you have at least two braincells in your head, this movie is a great way to achieve time travel: you're always 30 minutes ahead of it. Of course, predictability per se it not bad, but when there is absolutely nothing else going on, there is just no motivation to keep on watching. I gave up halfway through, and I only didn't walk out because I was too bored even for walking. Come on, THIS is the studio that produced Kung Fu Panda? I can hardly believe it.One last positive side of this film is that it sealed the fate that I'll never watch another 3D movie. This one was the first and the last -- at least until people learn to use 3D to favour the film instead of vice versa. As of today, 3D basically amounts to you giving an obscene amount of money to Hollywood so they can through garbage on your face every 2 minutes. 3D does not aid the look and the atmosphere of the film, it needs atrociously ridiculous angles and effects to make it evident, and the fast-paced action scenes are just impossible to follow. I ACTUALLY found the film more watchable without the (dirty and uncomfortable) glasses on -- 3D was so bad that seeing double actually looked beautiful in comparison.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Entertaining and by the numbers,"I enjoyed the movie and I thought it was a really nice comedy. Having seen the trailer though, there was almost nothing left to laugh about. Most jokes are in there. Which of course can be said about most comedies and you wonder why the have to put all the jokes in there? Are they afraid no one will go into the theatre? Whatever the case may be, the movie is entertaining enough.But is it Oscar-material? I don't think so! In a year, where Pixar only had Cars 2 to offer, none of the rivals seemed to really catch the opportunity. And the one movie that actually should have been the winner wasn't even nominated (see ""Tin Tin"" the Spielberg movie). People would argue it was motion captured, but they still had to animate that and the backgrounds and everything else.Back to Puss in Boots, which sees Banderas reprising his role, having good chemistry with Salma Hayek (nothing to wonder here) and Zach G. doing his comedy routine. Unfortunately the movie takes again the completely inapt way of unbelievable villain turning nice and good again. Most of the movies who try that, just aren't convincing enough, as is this. But kids won't mind and you will have fun for the running time.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""Puss in boots"" use to be funny!","Like most, i thought the ""Shrek"" movies were OK. ""Shrek 2"" was the best off the bunch by far, and this was partly (maybe even mostly) due to Antonio Banderas stepping in as the hilarious ""Puss in boots."" A spin off with him as the lead seemed like a good idea, but really, this just felt like ""Shrek 5"" this.The Problem with the movie is that side characters tend too be way funnier in small doses. ""Puss in boots"" was the funniest character in the other movies, but here he feels over-used. I was expecting this film too be hilarious, but it really doesn't feel like their trying too make this a comedy, more another mish mash off different fairy tales. There just aren't that many funny jokes, and many off the gags are recycled or worse. I hate puns, and this film is full off them. Not only cat puns (a bar the cats in the flick go too is called the ""G""litter box, get it? Litter box? Sigh!) but ""Humpty Dumpty"" being in the movie leads too a number off God awful ""egg"" puns as well. Plus a lot off characters trousers seem too randomly drop down. Is this really such a great gag they feel the need too keep doing it?Granted this was a hard one too pull off, and does have some amusing moments, but more focus has been put on the story than the humour. Trouble is, I wanted gags, and the plot is just a few classic fairy tales thrown together. Wasn't the original idea off ""Shrek"" too make fun off these classic ""Disney"" style stories. Feels more like this wants too be one, than a spoof off them. Disappointing!",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
A worthy yet slightly flawed successor,"I was able to see the San Francisco premiere for Puss N' Boots last night. I would say the audience was about 50% children and 50% adults. The movie was shown in 3D and I would definitely recommend it.The star of the movie was definitely Banderas's Puss. If you liked the character from previous movies, you will not be disappointed. Salma Hayak as Kitty Softpaws was decent enough although not very memorable in any way. And finally, Zach Galifianakis's Humpty Dumpty will be a polarizing character in my opinion. If you thought Rumpelstiltskin from Shrek Forever After was a tad on the annoying side, I think you'll feel the same way about Humpty Dumpty.Anyways, the story is good. The integration of former players in nursery rhymes and fairy tales is seamless. And the comedy is standard Shrek-style delivering lots of laughs for children and the occasional adult-only joke (some very funny).The visuals are stunning. And the music is fantastic. It almost felt like an action-packed spaghetti western with a Latin flavor. I definitely enjoyed myself. I also talked to quite a few people afterwords and the consensus was that the children all loved it and the adults kept using the word ""cute"" in so many different ways to describe their feelings about the movie.",,Anonymous,Animation
Don't spin the egg!,"Oftentimes a spin-off that promotes a minor character to centre stage sputters like a damp firework. There's usually a very good reason for them to be supporting characters.Still in this case ""Puss in Boots"" is a legitimate character in his own right - as are all of the fairytale folk in ""Shrek"" - but so far he's the only one to get a movie.In that respect it's pretty good if not Oscar material. The script is witty and rammed with plenty of in-jokes, grown-up side comments and puns. So many puns. It's all pretty light-hearted and the actors do a solid job of spreading their Latin influence.There's plenty here for parents and kids alike but don't go in expecting Pixar levels of emotion and character definition. Instead it's a fun feline caper that doesn't take itself too seriously.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Better Than I Remember,"The first act of this movie is so bland that I almost gave up on it. If you can push through the first 20 minutes, ""Puss in Boots"" is worth it. Once Humpty Dumpty joins the picture, the story finds its footing.The backstory is strong and there are pretty funny moments, especially the one-liners. The pair of Jack and Jill are forgettable and some of the chase scenes are dull. When I look back on this movie, I tend forget the humor and actual narrative, which is unfortunate.Best Character: Humpty Dumpty

It put me to sleep,"Good animation. Good acting. I had good expectations going in and was wide awake. I wanted to like it. It was somewhat amusing in the beginning, but about half way through I found that I could hardly keep my eyes open and kept dozing off. I've often had that problem with animated features, as well as with non-stop action movies like the Transformers series. The problem seems to be that the characters don't seem real in any way, and the story makes no real sense, so it's hard to care about anything happening on the screen. Plus non-stop action just puts me to sleep. At the opposite extreme was Ratatouille, an animated feature that kept me completely engrossed, because it told a really good story. I'd rate that one as one of my favorite movies of all time. So I'm not prejudiced against animated features, per se.Someday I want to mount a TV in the ceiling above my bed. And I'll have a collection of movies on DVD, which I bought because they put me to sleep. Then I won't have to use sleeping pills any more. Puss in Boots will be one of the movies in my collection of ""sleepers.""",2.0,Anonymous,Animation

With superb animation works and nice plot the movie was enjoyable. I am glad they kept Antonio Banderas's voice for the Puss. He really got an enigmatic voice. Both kids and adults will find fun in the movie. The touch of creativity in the plot, Puss's adventurous journeys to the exotic places will keep you entertained till the end.

Great movie with one exception,"This movie was funny all over with the exception of making Humpty-Dumpty out to be gay. We laughed through most of it, but his character was flat out offensive. The kids did not notice the character as such, but other parents were asking if that one character was the way he was on purpose, because it didn't improve the plot at all.Puss was just as you would want a womanizing cad, and Kitty was outstanding in keeping Puss at bay, when she wanted to.Just be forewarned.We'll be adding it to the library.But it sure would be nice for the writers to stop injecting certain social behaviors into family films.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

A mostly decent spin-off that unfortunately stumbles hard in its third act.,"Set years prior to his encounter with Shrek the ogre, Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) is a fugitive wandering the land in search of his next big score. When his attempted theft of magic beans from the husband and wife team of outlaws Jack & Jill (Billy Bob Thorton and Amy Sedaris) is interrupted by interference by another cat outlaw, Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) she ends up leading him to estranged adoptive brother and childhood friend Humpty Dumpty (Zach Galifianakis) who approaches Puss with plan to acquire the legendary Golden Goose from the giant's castle which is accessible only by beanstalk. Puss is initially unwilling to help Humpty due to an incident years earlier where Humpty robbed the bank of San Ricardo and making Puss an unwitting accomplice, but is eventually persuaded when Humpty promises to return the stolen gold to San Ricardo and clear Puss' name. Now the trio must face off against Jack & Jill and brave the hazards of Giant's castle to obtain the Golden Goose.In 2004 Shrek 2 became a massive runaway success thanks not only to continuing the story of the titular ogre, but also expanding the world and introducing new characters and elements that resonated well with audiences. One such facet of Shrek 2 that was almost universally loved was Antonio Banderas' scene stealing performance as swashbuckling hired sword Puss in Boots who revisited his iconic Zorro persona by way of a cute anthropomorphized cat that got a lot of mileage from the fact they were playing the suave sword wielding rogue archetype straight while coming from a talking cat. With the character's popularity assured development began on a spin-off before the Shrek 2 was even released. Initially envisioned as a direct-to-video film titled Puss in Boots: The Story of an Ogre Killer before going through numerous revisions and becoming a theatrical release when the team decided the concept couldn't be done on a Direct-to-Video scale. While the Puss in Boots spin-off isn't strictly necessary, it's a fun albeit very flawed comic adventure with its own identity that allows it stand out from its original source.Par for the course, Antonio Banderas is pitch perfect as the titular Puss in Boots and with more room for the character to breathe as a headliner is allowed to expand on the characters appeal as a dashing gentlemen outlaw with a thirst for adventure and danger. Salma Hayek is also a fun addition as Kitty Softpaws, serving as a femme fatale cat burglar (no pun intended) counterpart to Puss and the two's romantic chemistry can be felt in the vocal performances which compliments the animation on screen. Zach Galifianakis as Puss' estranged friend Humpty Dumpty I was admittedly more mixed on. While Galifianakis' voice work is perfectly fine I felt the character was written very messily and I think Galifianakis struggles to find the right delivery for this character. Billy Bob Thorton and Amy Sedaris are fun as our main antagonists Jack and Jill playing sort of ""western outlaw"" archetypes that I thought made them an interesting set of characters.The plot is pretty standard adventure fare with most of the Swashbuckler/Western elements played fairly straight with the only real source of humor being that it happens to be a cat doing the swashbuckling. There's a good setup for redemption and confronting the past and the camaraderie felt among our main trio of Puss, Kitty, and Humpty feels genuine and serves as a solid foundation that the movie builds itself upon. The action set pieces are well handled with creative usage of the environments and contraptions with a particular highlight being a wagon fight in the middle of the movie with Jack and Jills pig drawn battle wagon and Humpty's wagon inspired by Leonardo de Vinci's vehicle designs. But the movie unfortunately stumbles in its third act with an unnecessary twist that breaks all credibility and recontextualizes several previous scenes with this unnecessarily elaborate ""plot"" that has so many moving pieces with such a shallow goal that's not based on reality that it takes the movie down a notch from where it might've been otherwise. While the action in the third act is entertaining, the lingering ""stink"" from that third act twist really undermines an otherwise solid film especially in how it expects us to find emotional resonance in the character for instigating this twist.Puss in Boots is a really strong film with good performances and a strong sense of adventure, but when the third act comes around it squanders much of the good will it built up by yanking the rug out from under the audience. Depending on how forgiving you are of this twist you can probably add another star to this review. But for me it turned a good movie into an okay movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Eh, hope the sequel is worth watching this.","For some strange reason, while I usually really enjoy most animated movies I never really fully liked the Shrek universe... in fact I don't think I watched all of them. And so I was never interested in this spin-off. But it has come to my attention the recent sequel has gotten some crazy praise and rating so I am intrigued. And so I had to watch this one first to get some background... and it really confirms my feelings about the Shrek universe. It's a decent little animated movie but I am not sure why, it feels like something is missing. I think kids will like it but there are some grown-up jokes here and there so that probably makes for a nice family watch. I am now really hoping the second one lives up to the hype.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
1/2 Original,"I say 1/2 original as during Shrek the cat had its own personality but during this movie I could see a huge amount of similarities between the cat and Zorro (The mask of Zorror (1998)) which spoilt the movie for me as the cat didn't have its own personality. Rather more of a rip off / cop out from the writers. But on the other hand there were some really good quotes and funny moments in the film, as well as adding characters from other fairy tales with their own little twist just like Shrek. Which made up for the film. I did like the film and find out how the cat started from being just a cat to being Puss in Boots.Though the ending was a little confusing. It's a bit of a metaphor but I don't think it was needed as it didn't make sense.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not Exactly the Cat's Meow,"Puss in Boots is a competently made kids' film in the sense that its colorful, quickly paced and accessible. If you're an undiscerning parent their are certainly worse things to see with your children; mindless dribble like Spy Kids 4D comes to mind. Alas, despite occasional flashes of originality this spin-off of the immensely popular ""Shrek"" series seems as phoned-in as an episode of The Flintstones.The story begins with our titular hero (Antonio Banderas), living on the razor's edge of the law searching for his next big score. Intrigued by rumors of magic beans, Puss looks to steal them from the dastardly duo Jack and Jill (Billy Bob Thornton and Amy Sedaris) but not before bumping into like minded thief Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) and former friend/adopted brother Humpty Dumpty (Zach Galifianakis). The three then forge a shaky alliance and hatch a plan to steal the beans, plant the stalk and make their way to the castle in the sky to find a gold-laying goose.The most glaring problem with the film is the script which possesses a solid outline but little else. The jokes are sparse and mostly revolve around our hero being a cat or Humpty Dumpty being an egg and character motivations are fuzzy to say the least. It seemed almost as if the writers wanted to do ambitious things but didn't have time for a few more rewrites before the project was rushed into production.Still, its refreshing to see a Dreamworks Animation production that isn't heavy on the pop-culture references. Additionally the animation itself is beautiful and Antonio Banderas once again projects his Latin lover persona into the role with gusto.At one point a crucial character tells Puss to stop stealing informing him that ""you are better than this."" truer words have never been said and no sounder advice can be given to this film's creators.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Feline animated fun with Puss in Boots,"Dreamworks has been inconsistent for me. I loved The Prince of Egypt, How to Train Your Dragon, Shrek, Spirit, Kung Fu Panda 2 and Antz, liked Shrek 2, Monsters vs Aliens, Sinbad, Kung Fu Panda and Road to El Dorado and didn't care for Bee Movie and Shark Tale(the 3rd and 4th Shreks are between the slightly liked to didn't care for categories). Puss in Boots is not Dreamworks' best, though I do consider it one of their better ones recently. The animation is stupendous, especially in the rich colours and fluid backgrounds. The humans are not as well-drawn as the animals, then again to a lesser extent I found that with the Shrek movies too(especially with Rumpelstiltskin in Forever After).The music is rousing and gives a sense of jollity and adventure, and Puss in Boots is a cleverly written film with cat puns, witty dialogue and veers from Daesperado, Zorro to Mother Goose and a touch of Sergio Leone. As for the story, for what there is in predictability is made up for with excitement, helped by the hilarious dance fights and superbly choreographed chases up beanstalks and over bridges. The characters are generally great, though I didn't really care for Humpty Dumpty as a character or a villain.Zach Galifilianakis deserves a lot of credit for his voice work, but while not as bland as Rumplestiltskin, Humpty Dumpty's motivation could have been better explored and he is never really likable or interesting. Consequently by the end, which compared to the rest of the film was too dark for my tastes, he didn't garner my sympathy, like I did with Rameses and especially Lord Shen. Kitty however is wonderfully slinky, and voiced beautifully by Salma Hayek, but it is the title character(one of the Shrek franchise's best characters) who steals the show.Marvellously voiced by Antonio Banderas, Puss in Boots is suave and although the cute big eyes gag is used quite a few times, I find it far too endearing for it to be getting old. Overall, a fun film, beautifully animated, generally exciting and clever. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Best kids movie ever.,"Puss In Boots may be a little cliche and the twist may not make a whole lot of sense, but that doesn't mean that this movie isn't entertaining, action packed and funny.",,Anonymous,Animation
Good fun for a younger audience,"With huge saucer eyes and Antonio Banderas providing a South American lilt, Puss in Boots was the star of Shrek 2. Dreamworks knowing they were onto a winner, have spun their favourite kitty into his own adventure.Puss gets to exist in a similar universe where children's characters happily or unhappily, co-exist with animated humans as if everything was completely normal.Puss has been a bad kitty when we meet him and when we travel back in time, we see why he is ostracized and lost his metaphorical place by the fire.As always when characters go bad, it's Humpty Dumpty's fault (Galifianakis), a bad egg if ever there was one. A character with a thin shell albeit quite capable of breaking a few eggs to get what he wants.Puss and Humpty are searching for beans, magic beans The film is an adventure following Puss's attempt to find redemption after his earlier misdeeds. The story follows the search for the beans that will grow into the mythical beanstalk leading to the ""golden eggs"", a source of unimaginable wealth, something every cat and egg partnership always dream's of.Standing in their path, in a very big way, are Jack (Billy Bob Thornton) and Jill (Amy Sedaris). This odd couple are somewhat meaner than I remember them, both with anger issues they need to work through, clearly they have not received the mental health help they need.To add a romantic interest we have Kitty Softpaws (Salama Hayek), a feline temptress if ever there was one, learned in the ways of the catwalk. Teaming Banderas and Hayek together is of course a stroke of genius and their scenes together add to the film. A ""Dance Off"" rather than a sword fight is the order of the day and is choreographed with great care.Galifianakis plays Humpty Dumpty, channeling all of his previous downtrodden, left behind characters from his previous movies, sometimes his schtick wears a little thin but the character just about works here.The film does aim relatively young, there are some more mature references and enough to keep adults borderline entertained but this does not have the depth of later Pixar efforts. Kids will love the action, the colours and probably the depth of the 3D version (not reviewed here). Director Chris Miller has made a better film than his previous weak Shrek 3 entry in the series, here clearly showing some care and affection with this well loved character.As always animation is now at a level we just accept perfection as the norm. It's almost as if these characters just exist and are merely filmed, rather than spending hours inside a mainframe being painstakingly rendered frame by frame.There are periods where the story flags, the strongest elements are the flashbacks, children however will not notice, as there will a chase scene along in a few minutes.Who would have thought that an animated cat, wearing boots and carrying a sword would earn over half a billion dollars at the worldwide box office. Whoever came up with the character clearly deserves a raise.SummaryGood fun for a younger audience, parents should just about find enough to keep them entertained.Puss goes from strength to strength, clearly breaking free from his Shrek origins and on this evidence, there may be a few more lives left yet.http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
If you are a Shrek fan or/and a cat lover You shouldn't miss this,Before viewing this movie I was unsure whether Puss in Boots would be a good mainstream movie as it was originally planned as a direct-to-video film.But thankfully Puss in Boots can hold its own as a stand alone movie.This is a 90 minutes movie with brisk pacing and interesting characters.Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek shine in their voice roles as Puss in Boots and Kitty Softpaws respectively.Their chemistry is what that makes this movie very entertaining and humorous.Zach Galifianakis as Humpty Alexander Dumpty is OK in his role.Antonio Banderas gives a charming and funny Zorro-esque performance as Puss in Boots which is necessarily a very good thing.Overall its a nice movie and if you are a cat lover or a shrek fan then in noway this movie can disappoint you.So go and watch it if you haven't watched it already.,7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Good protagonists, forgettable plot","The Puss in Boots spinoff movie takes the titular character from the second Shrek movie and sets him into his own story. The puss being voiced by Antonio Banderas is interpreted as a sort of Zorro-ish swashbuckling epic hero and hence the movie takes place in a sort of Mexico/Western ish surroundings as opposed to the medieval fantasyland of Shrek.Having come from a post-communistic eastern European country I have been brought up with a different set of bedtime stories, nursery rhymes and children's content than would be common to someone from a more western upbringing. Keep that cultural difference in mind when you read my review.The plot and the newly introduced characters are somewhat hit or miss. You have the newly introduced love interest Kitty soft paws whom is pretty cool. Jack and Jill are sort of forgettable and I straight up dislike Humpty Dumpty as a character. The Nursery Rhyme of Humpty-Dumpty is not something I knew as a child hence there is no callback to any nostalgia. If I take the character at face value, the design is uncanny valley, the behaviour and characterisation are unlikeable, even the voice is unlikeable. I disliked him from the start, and the plot didn't offer any redemption for him.Most of the movie being set in a desert, you have a sort of orange filter over everything and the whole movie just looks sort of dry and dirty... ugly. There I said it, the movie looks ugly, especially compared to the sequel or even the Shrek Movies.The redeeming qualities are the Puss himself and Kitty Softpaws. There are funny gags and Antonio Banderas as the Puss about as good as in any other iteration of the character, which is to say very. I am not yet tired of him and this is a case of a good character in a not so good movie, hence I give average rating in the middle. I don't mind watching the movie, but I wouldn't think to put in on myself. My toddler liked it, let's see how she likes the IMO superior sequel.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Entertaining Family Fare!,"While not being the best film DreamWorks Animation has ever made, Puss in Boots is a good, warm-hearted animated feature that will easily entertain family audiences.

Salma Hayek, Zack Galifinakis, and Billy Bob Thornton are all nice additions to the cast and they voice their characters well.Overall, this is a good animated feature which is bound to receive much love from the younger children.

"Better than expected, but far from greatness.","""Puss in Boots"" is a perfect example of a movie I absolutely never would have seen if I hadn't gotten a pass to a free screening. And if I had gone to see it — and, to reiterate, I wouldn't have — there's simply no way I would have seen it in 3D. But it was free, so I did. I guess you could say I had low expectations.Some background: I loved ""Shrek"", I basically couldn't stand ""Shrek 2"", in part because I found the Puss in Boots character more annoying than charming, and I never bothered with the other ""Shrek"" sequels. Life is just too short. So I expected ""Puss in Boots"" to be, at best, tolerable, stupid, and intermittently funny. Imagine my surprise when I found that it was somewhat better than tolerable, more than intermittently funny, and actually kind of clever.The story, as should be expected from a member of the ""Shrek"" lineage, plays fast and loose with fairy tale characters, plot points, and conventions. Puss, an orphaned cat now branded as an outlaw, joins forces with Humpty Dumpty, an egg of questionable intent, and Kitty Softpaws, a feline fatale, to steal the magic beans from Jack and Jill, grow a magic beanstalk, and find the golden goose of legend. Naturally, things don't go according to plan, and the plot thickens. It's pointless, but fun.There are instances of real invention here. The first is the setting, which is sort of a medieval spaghetti western, although the western card was played better in ""Rango"". There are several great visual gags, like what happens to Humpty's covered wagon, and a dance fight that is easily the best part of the movie. Without giving anything away, I'll also say that, the more you think about the identity of the ""monster"", the funnier, and the more fitting, it becomes. However, the storytelling is sloppy at times. There's at least one plot point that is dispensed with far too quickly, and the fate of one character simply doesn't make sense. Still, it all kind of works, and the good parts are good enough to help you forget the shortcomings.Ultimately, the movie is saved by its pacing and its animation, which, as much as I hate to admit it, is absolutely stunning in 3D. I can't recommend paying the 3D up-charge, but I will say that those who do will probably not be disappointed. This isn't a cheap, gimmicky use of 3D, but one that actual adds depth and detail. There was one particular scene, a chase that, oddly enough, reminded me of ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"", where I found the use of 3D really creative. Would I pay for the 3D? Probably not, but for those looking for a 3D experience, you could do a lot worse.""Puss in Boots"" also raises the question of whether or not it's worth it to have major stars as voice actors. Actually, I take it back. This movie doesn't so much raise that question as answer it, resoundingly, with a no. As much fun as Antonio Banderas is as Puss, I'm not convinced that he brings anything to the role that a lesser known actor couldn't have brought. Salma Hayek and Zach Galifianakis are completely wasted as Kitty and Humpty. Billy Bob Thornton is a good choice as Jack, but that's largely because of the clever writing. Understand what I'm saying: I'm not being critical of these actors' work. I am being critical of the decision to cast them in a picture like this, where the most clever aspects of their characters come from the animation, not from the vocal performances. My suggestion would be to save the money needed to hire such big names, and use lesser known actors, perhaps from Broadway. That way, it would be easier for ""Puss in Boots"", a movie that many people will approach with a deserved amount of skepticism, to make money, and struggling actors will find more work. Believe me, the movie won't suffer from it.This isn't high art. It's not nearly the equal of ""Shrek"", and it doesn't have one iota of the heart of most Pixar films, or of DreamWorks' ""How to Train Your Dragon"". But at the same time, it's not bad for what it is. It's clever, witty, well-made, and fast-paced. It's nothing like a masterpiece, but as far as diversions go, it's quite diverting.",,Anonymous,Animation
Puss without Boots,"ATTENTION - There might be spoilers ahead!Puss in Boots and the Donkey are my two favorite characters from the Shrek franchise, so you can imagine that when I heard about this movie I was divided between the expectation to watch it, because, you know, its Puss!, and the idea that the movie could be very disappointing.Despite this last feeling of mine I decided to watch it and here is what I thought:As usual, Antonio Banderas gives an incredible performance only through his voice and for me, it was by far the best part of the movie.The cat's childhood was very catching and different from what I expected, providing us the knowledge of how the Puss became an outlaw-Kitty Soft-Paws (Salma Hayek) is a good addiction to the animation, and quite interesting, once she and Banderas played a couple in Desperado and Once upon a time in Mexico. However, her character's personality and actions were very predictableThe animation was great, very colorful and realThere were a couple funny moments, specially at the beginning and all related to Puss.Humpty Dumpty was a terrible villain. I hated him, mainly because he was so predictable and his decisions changed drastically from one minute to anotherMost importantly, the whole story about the magic beans and the golden goose was extremely disappointing. It lacked development, twists, imagination and comedy.Overall what I can say is that I could perfectly pass without watching this, once it added nothing to my emotions or to my life.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Doesn't reach the heights that the early franchise, and character, set as a bar.","Desperate not to let the franchise die but doomed to do so regardless, the folks over at Dreamworks decided it'd be a good idea to do a 'Shrek' spin off centred on everyone's favourite Hispanic cat but in the process forgot the fact that the series itself was originally created to lampoon its fairytale groundings and Disney-esque stylings, slipping into origin-story stereotypes and a silly plot somehow not based on the eponymous fable. 'Puss In Boots (2011)' is not a bad film by any means and is in fact rather entertaining, besting the latter two 'Shrek' sequels thanks to its bouncy set-pieces and an improved sense of humour, but it doesn't reach the heights that the franchise or character have set as a bar.

Fun character but he needs a sidekick,"Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) is a wanted criminal, but he wants to clear his name.

He has the charisma, and he has an interesting story. However I'm struck with the lack of a sidekick. Shrek has Donkey, but Puss has nobody. Humpty is more of a villain in hiding. There is always a constant threat of double dealing. It's not the same thing. Other than that, this has enough charm and a few funny jokes.

Instead we get Salma Hayek as Kitty Softpaws, the Pussy Galore to Puss's James Bond but no slouch herself when it comes to buckling a swash; Zach Galifianakis as Humpty Alexander Dumpty, Puss's best friend from their childhood in the San Ricardo orphanage; Billy Bob Thornton as Jack and Amy Sedaris as Jill, brutish, plug-ugly thugs; and Constance Marie as Imelda, the nurturing, encouraging foster mom at the orphanage.We see in a flashback that both Puss and Humpty feel that the other betrayed their friendship when they were both teenagers, but now Humpty, allied with Kitty, seeks Puss's aid when it comes to snatching the 3 magic beans from Jack and Jill so they can ascend the giant beanstalk to swipe the Golden Goose from the cloud giant's castle.This is all accomplished con brio y la leche.There's a lot of stirring music here, with original compositions by Henry Jackman making excellent use of Spanish flamenco traditions, guitars, and trumpets. The opening fight scene between Puss and the leather-masked Kitty turns out to be a dance-off, and a pretty good one.Puss is alternately sly, noble, supercilious, brave, egocentric, generous, and forgiving — and always athletic — altogether a fitting hero. Good dialog by screenwriters David H. Steinberg, Tom Wheeler, and Jon Zack, with nicely paced direction from Chris Miller.Unfortunately, while this is certainly a pleasant diversion, and the animation is up to the usual DreamWorks standard, there isn't much adventure, and the comedy is thin, nor can you really consider it much of a character study, tho it's more about character than plot. There are misunderstandings and redemptions, intrigues and stereotypes, flattery and flirtery, but the good guys are worth rooting for and, not surprisingly, prevail in the end to rollick another day.Basically, there's just nothing outstanding here. You won't consider this a waste of money while you're in the theater, but a couple of months hence you'll probably have a hard time remembering why.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Very cool movie to watch !,'Puss in boots' actually wasn't that bad of a movie like i thought it would be from the trailer they showed on TV. they were more focused on the fact that its a cat who other cat fall in love with then the fact the movie has an actual plot and its not about the cat being a womanizer or something like that. its also in some aspects follows events from the actually tale which reminded me half way through that Puss In Boots is actually a tale and not a character invented by Dreamworks.the 3D offcours was awesome and in many parts of the movie you feel like dancing to the music thats playing or just staring at these interesting characters and the sounds they make.not so much as the best cartoon even but its definatelly watchable and i cant wait for the sequel !,8.0,Anonymous,Animation
About as bad as any of the Shrek movies,"A spin-off of the Shrek series starring Antonio Banderas' character, Puss in Boots. Puss in Boots was the best character in any of those movies (thank the Lord we didn't get a Donkey movie!), but that's damning with faint praise. This film isn't noticeably better than any of the Shreks. The writers of these films couldn't come up with a decent joke if their lives depended on it. All they've got up their sleeves is having the heroic, swashbuckling Puss act like a real cat every once in a while. Really, that's about as clever as it ever gets. They even brought in Salma Hayek as the love interest. The least they could do was reference Desperado. It'd be a cheap gag, but the film is so dry I'd have taken it. They also have Zach Galafianakis as Humpty Dumpty, Puss's former partner with whom he teams back up. And, again, they have nothing for him to do. Why hire a well-known comedian to play this character? Literally anyone could have voiced him (you can't even recognize Galafianakis), but instead they threw away a bunch of cash. Burning it would have at least kept them warm for a few seconds. The animation is as ugly as it ever was in the Shrek movies. The human characters, in particular, have always been beyond hideous. Humpty Dumpty also looks terrible. The action sequences, however, aren't too bad. They've improved that aspect of the animation quite a bit since the last Shrek movie I saw.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
What 3D is made for!,"Right off paw (as opposed to ""off hand"" ) I should note the title means a cat, literally in boots. I suppose that is obvious to most. But when I asked most adults it conjured up everything from cat food to a Saturday morning cartoon. But not a cat musketeer. This film is actually, but only very loosely, based upon the fairy tale Puss n Boots written at the close of the seventeenth century by Frenchman Charles Perrault (1628–1703). This film is sort of the 2011, The Three Musketeers film for children, only much better.This film version blends a story of child hood pals Puss in Boots (Banderas) and egghead, Humpty Dumpty (Galifianakis) in pursuit of selfish dreams to capture the baby goose that lays golden eggs. Puss falls for Kitty Softpaws (Hayek) and the friendships between Puss, Humpty and Kitty all get a bit confused in pursuit of riches. The writers mix in (and mix up) bits of half a dozen other childhood fables from Jack and Jill to Jack and the Beanstalk. It is all clean great fun and funny for kids and adults along the way. There is a great fight and dance scene that few animated films can match. The PG rating was certainly garnered by the swords and violence, but there is really nothing to disturb even the most delicate of children's emotions. Any child old enough to watch television has seen far worse. My only concern was a brief reference by Jack to swearing off ""murdering and thievery"" as fun, but it may be time to move on. They might have left that worthless line out of the script. And why Jack and Jill had to be portrayed as anything but two nice kids going up a hill to fetch a pale of water might confuse a few kindergärtners.The hoopla over the new 3D in films is really reserved for animated films like this. The 3D is truly amazing with animation while it adds little and is not nearly as impressive with most films. For animation, it is here to stay. Seeing a cat drink milk from a regular glass is funny and watching milk get spilt in slow 3D is captivating. Watch for the funny reference later in the film to ""catnip for glaucoma""–an obvious cross reference to a funny scene of Galifianakis in last year's Due Date. Puss ""in"" boots or out of them, adults and kids alike will laugh and enjoy this adventure all the way through.",,Anonymous,Animation
Innocent Fun with Zorro-Puss,"Who can deny it, the Latin-inspired Puss in Boots definitely adds more interest than the traditional version. He's just far cooler in the way he personifies an animated photocopy of Antonio Banderas' Zorro. The slyness, the brash overconfidence and of course, the ability to create havoc; the ingredients are there. He has the savoir-faire of Charles Perrault's character as well as the morals. Though, overall, he distinguishes himself from any other take on the classic character and ends up as being just good, fairly rollicking fun.As for the production itself, it was just a good little adventure and what was particularly nice was the lack of complication which many animated features, including the later Shrek films which brought this specific 'Puss' into the limelight, had to their detriment. By no means do I imply however that it was an overly simplified, mundane script either, that wouldn't go together with Puss' vibrancy. Although, it probably deteriorated a touch in even animated film persuasion as it went along, culminating in a slightly underwhelming way. It promised better and in that regard, lets itself down.Once again, similar to 'Shrek', I thoroughly enjoyed the humorous, light-hearted parody of fairytale characters. That characterisation makes the whole thing even more fun. Banderas is unquestionably the right man to voice a 'Latino Puss' despite overdoing it a bit at times and being slightly overbearing. I'm not complaining though, that sort of exaggeration was the essence of his character. The characters of 'Humpty Alexander Dumpty' and 'Jack and Jill' were well thought out and depicted by their respective voice actors and actresses. My only qualms lay with Kitty Softpaws who didn't initiate sizzling enough chemistry with Puss, they seemed slightly detached from one another although engaged in themselves. Her character didn't leave as much of a mark as the others.'Puss in Boots' is undoubtedly childishly funny but even adults won't be able to resist a few smiles throughout. Ultimately, it may not deserve the superior label of 'swashbuckling' but it was plain, straightforward fun that you cannot go too wrong with.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Funny,"Rewatching this movie as an adult made me realise that although this is an animation, it is not a movie made for kids. I finally understood all the jokes that had gone over my head as a child and I can better appreciate the movie's humour now. This was such a hilarious movie in how absurd it was. There were times where I just burst out laughing because of how silly a scene was. In terms of the actual plot however, it was a twist on children's fairy tales. But this means that one would need prior knowledge about these fairy tales to understand the storyline of the movie, otherwise I reckon that it would be a pretty confusing or boring movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Puss in Boots (2011) Light and fun,"Puss in Boots has always been one of the favorite characters of most people who watched Shrek, but making a solo movie of him could go very wrong. Fortunately, that's not what happened. Puss in Boots is one of the funniest movies in the entire franchise. It's funny, has really fun characters and a good story. It is not a perfect film, in fact it is far from it, but it is very good to watch, it is an incredible experience to see a film as light as this one. It has a bit of drama, but that's not something that affects the film in a negative way, because it combines humor and drama very well. This movie is adorable and one of the coolest in Dreamworks history, proving that for a movie to be fun, it doesn't have to be great.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Neither great nor anything terrible,"A pretty generic, run-of-the-mill feature with a story of betrayal, revenge, and reconciliation that has been told many times before, so there's nothing new in here from a narrative perspective at least.Having said that, I did admire the animations, despite the fact that they are showing signs of ageing given that the film is now more than a decade old. The score, too, has a dated feel to it, but it appears to work well with the vibrant visuals.In terms of the characters, I liked Puss and his quirky, ostentatious mannerisms, but a little more emotional quotient would have made his part more memorable; the same remarks apply to the rest of the ensemble as well.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Funny, but less than I imagined","If this was a standalone animation film, maybe I would have considered it above average, but my reference is Shrek and, even if the last films of the franchise were not great, Puss in Boots is not at the same level.Yes, it does try to capitalize on the remaining Anglo-Saxon fairy tales like Jack and the Beanstalk and Humpty Dumpty, but it fails short of the character extravaganza that Shrek was. And while Antonio Banderas is very good as the cat, the Western like setting and even the animation is not expressing enough emotion to make one empathise with the characters. And I am a cat person, so that's saying a lot.Bottom line: I've laughed aloud a few times, but that's about it. The combination of a man and a cat got stuck right in the middle, being neither attractive, nor cute. The story felt fragmented and the dialogues forced. I am sure children would love it, but it was a disappointment to me.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not as good as I expected,"I had heard a lot of hype for this movie after the second one came out and after listening to my children rave about it. I love the Shrek movies, but only kind of like this one. I wish there had been more exposition regarding Puss rather than just start the movie in what seemed like the middle of a story. I didn't like the usage of Humpty Dumpty and Jack and Jill. I was also unclear on the world building. Why are some animals anthropomorphic and other ones weren't? In the end, it seemed like a movie that didn't necessarily need to be made. It wasn't awful, but it was a great either. You won't waste your time if you watch it, but you also don't miss out if you don't.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

A Totally Im-purrfect family movie. Sucked!!!!,"The reason i am giving this film a 1 is because of the animation quality. I was quite looking forward to watching puss in boots and when i did see it, i was bored pretty much tot he point of sleeping.I did not make the mistake of comparing it to shrek as i feel that would have ruined it for me even more. I did not like the movie at all and after watching it for the First and only time, i swiftly sold it as it did not deserve the time of day on my DVD player again.Congratulations to Dreamworks for the absolutely brilliant animation but as mentioned previously, the film was a let down on so many levels. it fell flat on its face and would definitely not recommend the film to anyone else, shrek fan or not.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Puss Deservedly Gets His Own Film,"Finally Puss gets his own movie and the absence of Shrek, Fiona and Donkey does not take away from this film. As a standalone, 'Puss in Boots' is sheer feline fun. It's much better than the last couple of Shrek flicks. The story, even though it follows the fairy tale path, is richer and more layered. Even Puss's boots have a significant role other than being his cool footwear.The humour works splendidly. The creators have definitely come up with some cool innovative ideas. The inclusion of Humpty gives it a new and funny twist. The cat jokes and gags are a treat and they made me laugh out loud. There's also a fun catfight-dance sequence that's full of energy and even some sensuality. The adults jokes tickle the funny bones and are subtle enough not to make one uncomfortable when watching children. Yet, it includes dark themes, such as that of betrayal and death, which does make 'Puss in Boots' somewhat more mature than the usual fluff stuff.The voice cast is excellent. Salma Hayek and Antonio Banderas reunite after appearing together in three films but this time they're cats. Their chemistry is certainly a plus. Zach Galifianakis is great as Puss's childhood friend turned enemy. Amy Sedaris is hilarious as Jill and the rest of the cast do a fine job.The sense of adventure is maintained throughout. The animation and visuals are excellent and the editing is brilliant but the heart of 'Puss in Boots' is the writing: the story, the characters and the humour.This just goes to show that how much Puss deserved his own film and with some fine support he is fully capable of carrying a story.º If there are going to be more Puss films, I only hope they manage to keep up with this level of quality and not go the 'Shrek' way.",,Anonymous,Animation
I love it!,"Another addition to the shrek universe and a great one at that, this movie really expands the universe and presents a much bigger scale of a movie compared to all the shrek films. This movie is like a heist movie a western and a shrek film all in one. Its absolutely hilarious aswell, some of the jokes are so subtle and yet so funny, definitely some humour for the adults aswell which is nice to see. All the voice acting is amazing and perfectly casted which I love. Some new character additions such as Humpty Dumpty and Jack and Jill are great and helps it keep the fairy tale vibe just like shrek. All in all an amazing addition for this film franchise and really hope to see more puss in boots and maybe even other spin offs. I'd love a gingerbread man movie, make it happen dreamworks. Great movie!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Puss in Boots rides again,"And does it more or less brilliantly now in the good company of Humpty Dumpty, Kitty Softpaws and Jack and Jill here transmuted into a couple of dangerous violent bandits. Dreamworks does a good job again in terms of animation, visual effects and characters design, expression and movements, making them looking human indeed. I have however a strong doubt about if this is an adequate movie for children given the violence of some scenes including a murder when Jack and Jill arrive at the hotel and shoot someone (whom we nevertheless don't see in fact just only hearing the shot and the body falling down) to get a vacant room. But a good animation movie to be seen by adults anyway. Ah and the story? Well the story is almost only a mere pretext to the images.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Puss gets a starring role,"First seen in the Shrek franchise, Puss in Boots gets his own hero story in this Dreamworks Film.Most of the film is indeed funny. Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek voice feline foes and tangle with sword and tongue heartily throughout the film. Funny, but not worthy of repeated viewing.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Strong characters hold up this adventure.,"Whether the scripts deserve it or not, Antonio Banderas has always brought his top game with the character of Puss. In his first standalone film, Puss in Boots not only gives a backstory to the protagonist, but provides an adventure with a hot pace, solid supporting cast and a thumbs up score to boot. Indeed, the three main characters have a rapport that pushes aside the leaky script and meh plot to give Puss in Boots an added flavour of fun not often felt in family films.When outcast Puss returns to his homeland of San Ricardo, the opportunity to repay an old favour arrives when word of magic beans have been found. No easy task, though, as the murderous outlaws Jack and Jill have their own ideas on what to do with them.The script rehashes a bit too often, and many of the zingers miss more than hit, but thankfully it's an insecurity of the writing, since the plot does plod and lose steam in the final act. That's why the chemistry of Banderas, Hayek and Galifianakis is exemplary for an animated film here. The conversations between them contain more substance than the final third of the movie altogether. That trio, mixed with a score and cinematography tailor-made for Puss, essentially creates an exciting pace, before and minding the 'twist,' altogether creating an entertaining family film, one that still holds.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Not a good year for animated films,"¨My thirst for adventure will never be quenched! ¨Puss in Boots is a character we came to love in the Shrek franchise, and this time director Chris Miller (who wrote the original Shrek screenplay and directed some of the sequels) makes him the star of his own animated film. Antonio Banderas is back again voicing his character, and the similarities with the Zorro can't be ignored (considering he played this famous hero in two films). Puss in Boots takes place before the adventures with Shrek, and we get to see his background story and his interactions with other famous fairytale characters such as Jack and Jill, Humpty Dumpty, the Mother Goose, Jack and the Beanstalk, and many more. Of course the stories are very different from the ones we've heard: Jack and Jill are two thieves who remind us a lot of Bonnie and Clyde; Humpty Dumpty is a smart great inventor, but at the same time is always getting into mischief; Jack sold a stolen cow for the magic beans and therefore is in prison, and so on. DreamWorks has done the same thing with the Shrek franchise so we are used to these funny alterations to classical characters. I really enjoyed the first half of this story and laughed throughout it. Puss in Boots is a great character and he deserved to star in his own movie. I did have a problem with some of the secondary characters, and especially with the last 20 minutes of the film which just got beyond ridiculous. It's too bad because the film really had a lot of potential and it began with a lot of promise.Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) is a wanted man, or should I say cat. There is a reward on his head and he's living as a fugitive traveling from town to town and gaining reputation with the kitties. One night at a bar he hears that Jack and Jill (voiced by Billy Bob Thornton and Amy Sedaris) are headed towards their town and that they have stolen the magical green beans. Puss wants those beans and is ready to steal them, but another kitten gets in his way: Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) so neither of them is able to do so. Puss is furious and when he discovers that Humpty Dumpty (Zach Galifianakis) is involved he wants nothing to do with them. Dumpty and Kitty both want Puss to join them and help them finding the beans in order to climb the beanstalk and reach the giant's mansion to steal the goose that lays golden eggs, but Puss wants nothing to do with Dumpty. Something happened in their past and he refuses to help. After Kitty insists that he join them, Puss tells her how he met Dumpty and what happened to their friendship. We see a flashback of how Dumpty and Puss met in an orphanage where they were taken care of by Imelda (Constance Marie) and how their friendship begins. We even see how Puss gets his boots, but eventually he is betrayed by Dumpty, and they each go their separate way. Eventually Kitty convinces Puss to join them by telling him he has a chance to clear his name, and therefore the three embark on the mission.I really enjoyed the first half of the story, the dialogue was funny and the main characters were interesting. The movie felt kind of fast paced at first and everything was happening real fast. Puss, Dumpty, and Kitty were interesting characters, but the villains aren't really memorable. My favorite part was perhaps the flashback where we get to see Puss's background and how he was betrayed by Dumpty. Another great scene was when Kitty and Puss have a dance off in a glitter club full of cats. Those were the highlights of the movie, but then once they get a hold of the magical beans the movie goes downhill. The plot gets really ridiculous and ends pretty badly. I wish they would've just kept the same pace of the first half of the movie. Puss in Boots still had its funny moments and I found myself laughing a lot, but I was disappointed with the second half. This wasn't as good a year for animated films as it was last year, but I guess I would have to say that my favorite one this year is Rio. The best thing about this film is definitely Puss and his endearing eyes.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

It has some similarities to The Mask Of Zorro which Antonio Banderas stars in.The cast selection was tremendous. They strongly committed and connected to the storyline and to their respective characters. Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek always have strong and terrific chemistry between them whenever they work together.

Stereotypical Dreamworks Animated Production,"As a prequel to the Shrek series, Puss in Boots serves to tell the origin story of the titular character's (Antonio Banderas) rise to prominence. A slick thief with a haunted past, Puss takes on a dangerous job in which he attempts to steal the fabled magic beans from a pair of hardened criminals known as Jack and Jill (fortunately not Adam Sandler in drag). His plan goes awry, however, when he comes into contact with another thief, Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek). Softpaws engages Puss in a (dance) battle and eventually brings him to meet Humpty Dumpty (Zach Galifianakis), an old friend-turned-enemy. But Humpty has a plan to right an old wrong and convinces Puss to join him in the undertaking of a dangerous but lucrative adventure.I have to hand it Dreamworks animation, they know how to make a solid children's movie that adults can sit through comfortably. They've developed a formula that goes something like this: Likable Characters + Outstanding Visuals + Recognizable Voice Talent + Borderline-Illicit Jokes That Kids Won't Get - Any Semblance of Heart and Emotion = A 3- Star Film That Kids Will Flock To. Shrek, Kung Fu Panda, Madagascar and the rest all work within this equation and Puss in Boots is no exception.Let's work our way through that formula as it applies to this film. The characters at play within Puss in Boots are good-enough, though none of them quite measure up to the best of the Dreamworks universe. Puss is probably better served as an ancillary role but he is not overmatched with carrying his own film and his surrounding characters are all enjoyable if underwhelming. Puss looks predictably beautiful with rich scene structure and exquisite character details. The soul of Dreamworks animation is in their visuals and this film is nothing if not gorgeously animated. Another staple of the Dreamworks feature is the use of big name actors to voice the characters as opposed to the Pixar method which often employs lesser-known performers. The risk of using well-known voices is that it can cause the audience to see the characters not as themselves but as the actor providing the voice. Here, though, I think Banderas and especially Galifianakis do a good job of putting their respective characters above themselves, not always an easy task. The jokes, meanwhile, come early and often and fall right in line with the line of humor we were treated to in the Shrek films. Dreamworks has mastered the art of cramming adult-oriented jokes into their films without ever allowing young minds to become the wiser and that is, of course, a large part of their success. Puss manages to push the envelope in sly ways and that provides a handful of big laughs.The major issue with Puss is the same one I have with just about every Dreamworks feature: there's almost nothing in the way of emotional connection. Whereas Pixar always strives to create organic connection between the characters and the audience, Dreamworks doesn't always seem interested in taking their films beyond above-average children's fare. I feel like steps have been taken to correct this problem in recent years. Kung Fu Panda comes closer to striking an emotional note from time to time and How to Train Your Dragon is absolutely up to the Pixar standard in every way. But Puss in Boots is decisively shallow, never bothering to even scratch the surface in terms of resonating beyond a mildly entertaining level. There's simply no depth whatsoever and while that does indeed fit into the Dreamworks formula, at some point you have to ask yourself if the studio is progressing or simply painting by numbers.Please see my reviews at thesoapboxoffice.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

I don't really know why I watched this..,"This movie focuses on Puss, who is mostly known for his appearances in the ""Shrek"" films. We learn about his background story and how the past led to the task that Puss has to face now- find the magic beans.I decided to see this on a whim, really. I wasn't really planning to watch this movie at all, but it just came to me! I couldn't do anything. So yeah. This movie was entertaining, but it didn't really make an impression on me. ""Puss in Boots"" is just another animated movie to me.I liked how all the fairy tale characters just meshed and blended with each other- a detail that I always liked from the original ""Shrek"" movies. I would have liked to see a little bit of how Puss ended up meeting with Shrek and the rest of the gang. But this was also okay. Jack and Jill, Humpty Dumpty, the Golden Goose and many more!I just found myself getting confused at the end. I had a lot of questions and found that there was a lot of loose ends. The movie didn't have a good ending, in my opinion. But the movie had lots of funny parts and it did keep me laughing. My reason for giving this a 4 is that I just don't think I'll be wanting to re-watch this movie any time soon.

Unexpectedly Enjoyable,"I totally expected this to be a steaming pile of a washed-up franchise that DreamWorks was trying to squeeze the final pennies from our children out of. But it ended up being a fun movie with some laughs and a actually decent story, and unlike a certain other company's cheap sequel animation, this is as good as any other DreamWorks movie. The new villain was intriguing and the other new characters were well done as well. Seeing Puss on his own didn't flesh out the character much more than we already know from the Shrek films, and I was surprised to not see more cameos from other franchise characters. But no matter, a fine film for your collection. Even though it was only her voice, Salma Hayek is...muy en fuego.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

What is the plot to this movie?!,"I really didn't want to see this movie so I didn't see it at the cinema. So I've waited for the DVD and it wasn't even my choice to see it but I had nothing else to do at the time so I sat down and watched it.The beginning of this movie is an origin story and it becomes a story within a story for a short time and then you think you know how it's going to go and it changes so you have a new version in your mind and the it's not until the last 15 minuets you realise what it was; some movies I like that but this wasn't great; it confused me a lot and then some of it didn't make sense. So apart from the plot being choppy what I did like about this film is it wasn't all for kids; I saw a few scenes for the parents too, the humour was funny and the animation was very good. I was hoping for a Shrek reference but that never came but overall apart from how the plot went I did enjoy the character's and settings. Not at all like a Shrek movie and you could watch it on its own without seeing the entire Ogre franchise.http://theojreviews.blogspot.co.uk/",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
Kitties are great but a very pointless tale,"All the years that we have seen the Shrek movies both myself and my wife have LOVED Puss...By far the best character in the series.Especially with his repertoire with Donkey.. Puss needed his own movie......Sad to say..This movie fell way short of our expectations..The best I can say about it is that it was cute with a few laughs now and again. Puss didn't have near the spark that he had in the Shreck movies and although including Ms Kitty Softpaws was an awesome idea (instead of having an Equine sidekick!)..there was no real great moments between the two leading toons..Some innuendo,some smiles..Not near as much as there could have been.One question for me was why the makers included the worthless Humpty Dumpty in this film,who whined and squealed through the role of the ""Forever Brother"".I could have seen a lot better movie here if the whole fairy-tale theme was carried through with the other main four characters..(The two Kitties and two baddies.) If ever there was a more pointless inclusion...This is it Dreamworks.Now a lot of people will say that ""Aww..c'mon..its a kids movie..give it a break""..Actually,No there is way too much a lot of kids will miss.This is a family movie but with quite a lot of the humor targeted at the adults in the audience and I think there will be a lot of adults (and some kids for that matter)looking for a little more from a story in a theater!!Quite disappointing movie really...My best recommendation for Puss fans is save your money and skip the movie theater..Wait till this comes out on DVD and is about the $5 to $7 mark..Then it will be worth while for a movie night at home..",,Anonymous,Animation
Pretty good movie that was overshadowed by its' sequel,"Yeah, the first Puss in Boots is a simple movie, but it is still a delightful spin-off from the ""Shrek"" franchise. The story is fun to follow and the Puss works really well as a protagonist of his own story. The film introduces new characters like Kitty Softpaws (voiced by Salma Hayek) and Humpty Dumpty (voiced by Zach Galifianakis), who add depth and humor to the story. Their interactions with Puss create a dynamic and engaging narrative that balances humor, adventure, and heart, appealing to both children and adults.Visually, ""Puss in Boots"" is quite pleasant, with vibrant animation and beautifully rendered landscapes that bring the fairy-tale world to life. The action sequences are thrilling and well-choreographed, showcasing Puss's agility and flair. Although it's not as good as its' sequel, the film still successfully expands the ""Shrek"" universe with its charming characters and entertaining plot, making it a good animated film for the whole family.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Puss in Boots (2011),"Hollywood just don't know when to quit, in this instance that proves to be a blessing. Puss in Boots is a spin-off from Shrek, but gladly stands on its own two-boot encased-feet. The film follows Puss' early life, from orphan to outlaw. We learn of his relationship with fellow orphan Humpty Dumpty and their quest to obtain the magic beans which will lead to the golden eggs. Puss is hailed as a hero in his hometown while his brother Humpty is lead into a life of crime to prove his worth. Their interactions form the main crux of the movie. They both consider themselves betrayed at one point or another, and seeing their brotherly love gradually return is a joy. The films biggest success is just taking one character and actually creating a story around them. There isn't a single nod to Shrek, and overall it has an entirely different tone. Even the fairytale references are played down for a more western feel. The voice work is spot on, with Banderas taking his role very seriously. Hayek adds some nice chemistry as his female equivalent, and even Galifianakis shines. This is probably his most emotional role, and he avoids becoming an irritant. The animation is wonderful, and really captures that Spanish/Latino flavour. The writers knew exactly when to focus on exposition and when to add an action scene. This is mostly an action adventure movie, with some comedy. A great film that should be wary about trying to spawn its own franchise.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fun for kiddies and adults alike.,"With the big green ogre well and truly running his course, the time has come for scene-stealing ex-sidekick Puss (Antonio Banderas) to take centre stage. It's not surprising that Dreamworks chose to give this swashbuckling feline his own movie; his arrogantly suave persona, Zorro-esque action moves and razor-sharp wit all combine to deliver a highly watchable lead character that will no doubt generate his own franchise. The film itself, however, struggles to maintain the entertaining antics of the first two acts – a dance-off between Puss and his rival / love interest Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) is exhilarating – when it comes to the cut and paste final act. Despite its narrative shortfalls and a less-than-brilliant third wheel co-star Humpty Dumpty (Zach Galifianakis), it looks terrific. Every strand of fur, every human character and every Sun-drenched dusk setting are rendered in flawless CGI, with the third dimension subtly incorporated (the way it should be). Plenty to work on for next time round maybe, but there's more than enough here to ensure it's a satisfying 90 minutes for kiddies and adults alike.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Puss in Boots,"The suave and debonair ""Puss"" has been hard done by and is determined to clear his name of a scurrilous conviction that has shaken him to his very boots - but that's no easy task, especially when he manages to get himself embroiled with ""Kitty Softpaws"" and his erstwhile pal ""Humpty"" who was responsible for most of his troubles in the first place. It's the latter egg who wants to retrieve the elusive magic beans that will enable them to shoot up the beanstalk and retrieve the golden goose. Simples? Well no, not really, because there's a load of baggage between these three and the menacing ""Jack"" and ""Jill"" - think Bonnie & Clyde, only nastier - are also on the trail of these magic pulses. It's now a race to the top as ""Puss"" hopes to prove his innocence and maybe there can be a reconciliation too? This is a stylishly put together animation with loads of character, mischief and some quite witty dialogue as the fables are effortlessly mixed together, disregarding the bits that aren't so convenient for this energetic plot. As origin stories go, this is good fun as it spares us any sentimentality and just entertains. I enjoyed this.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A typical and should have been expected flat Disney sequel,"I halfway expected it after the lacklustre Shrek 3 and the appalling Shrek Christmas, but still I managed to get up enough interest and hope to go and see Puss in Boots. It was even more disappointing than I expected. There was only 1 or two halfway funny jokes in the entire movie, the rest of it was frankly dull, just the continued overextending of a tired formula that has become synonymous with Disney over the past 16 ears.The worst part of the film is the character of Humpty Dumpty, who fails to even crack when he falls off the wall, but the main problem was simply the complete lack of humour in a movie format that relies upon it entirely for success. All the nursery rhyme angles in the film are poorly adapted and irritate rather than engage and the overall film simply falls flat. The excellent voice acting by Antonia and Salma aside, the best part of this film was the preview for the new Muppets movie, which were the only real laughs heard.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
"This is how all Spin-Off Movies should be,","Puss In Boots is a terrific film with a very well developed storyline and a brilliant voice cast. It's a very good spin off film, something that rarely turns out well, but this is an example of one that is done right, Puss in Boots was the perfect Shrek character to give a solo movie to, he's the most underdeveloped character and this movie provides us with plenty of information on his origins. The only thing I think is missing is more humour, it took itself much more seriously than the Shrek movies did, there are no characters, like Donkey, that provide comic relief, it is still quite funny but I felt, for an animated movie, it's a bit too stern. The voice cast is superb Antonio Banderas is voicing Puss for the fourth time now and it is abundantly clear that he is very comfortable with the character, Salma Hayek delivers with Softpaws, as does Zach Galifianakis with Humpty Dumpty, a very well written and flawed character. Entertaining, adventurous and fun for people of all ages, I would recommend Puss in Boots to anyone looking for s good family film.Puss in Boots heads on a journey with an old friend and a new love interest in search of golden eggs.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

I feel like kid-friendly movies can sometimes be a bit dull in terms of comedy, but this one had my husband and I cracking up.

"Missed opportunity, could be better, no contrast","One of the main reason why Puss character shine in Shrek movies was the donkey, and donkey was like a dog.A cat movie/ a cat character without a dog and mouse feels empty.

Puss In Boots,"Puss In Boots is the prequel spinoff of Shrek 2 about the character of the same name. It details his earlier adventures and how that made him Puss In Boots. It has more of a hispanic and western feel to it compared to the first two Shrek movies but still has some folklore origins to it. It brings in Humpty Dumpty, Jack and Jill, the magic beanstalk, and the golden goose. Though it doesn't seem to parody Disney as much as the actual Shrek movies.

The boring parts are: when the puss does battle dance with the kitty,when The puss is in jail, and when the characters are having conversation I'll give rating 6 of 10.

Zip-a-dee-do....Nah.,"I'll be frank right up front, even though that's not my name. Puss in Boots isn't a very good movie. It attempts to cling to the tattered coattails of Shrek an is just good enough to sustain interest for you and your littlest of little ones. It does have good voice acting, but the writing's kind of flat - hardly any jokes, puns, pop-cultural references, etc. - and on the whole it's just not very exciting.This is the tale (ha! pun) of how Puss (Antonio Banderas) came to be, growing up in an orphanage where his only friend was Humpty Dumpty (Zach Galiafanakis). The two spend most of their time trying to find the whereabouts of the magic beans owned, apparently, by Jack and Jill (Billy Bob Thornton and Amy Sedaris), who here are bad people. The beans will grow a beanstalk that leads to a giant's castle, where the goose that lays the golden eggs lives. Sort of a mish-mash of fairy tales, but what the heck.Puss and Humpty, the little scamps, become thieves in their small border town; when a heist goes wrong, Humpty is left to, er, take the fall, and a bounty is put on Puss' head. That's where the mystique develops - the hat, the boots, the sword, the attitude. Later, as Puss is about to finally get a hold of those magic beans, Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) shows up for the same score. But it's totally, okay, because she's a foxy feline, and our hero is a lady killer. As an added bonus, she's a plot contrivance.This is a movie about betrayal, revenge, an reconciliation, so it's really a movie that's about the opposite of different from other animated movies and not a small number of live-action ones. If you cared enough, you could predict each turning point in the film, but you and your kids will be better off just letting that tendency zoom right on by. You'll do yourself no favors by thinking about the plot and how uninventive it is.See, unlike the Shrek movies that spawned it, Puss in Boots has precious few references to fairy tales, which is a shame. Jack and Jill were brother and sister in the old stories, and here they're husband and wife. And bad, bad people. So why even refer to them as Jack and Jill? Then the movie has to confuse Jack of ""and Jill"" fame with the Jack of ""and the Beanstalk"" fame; not the same Jack. That's sort of explained by a cameo by the latter in a prison for no good reason.If you did enjoy the Shrek films - any of them - you're not likely to like this one very much. It lacks all of the charm and wit that helped make the others successful. Okay, so the third Shrek and maybe the fourth were both sort of mediocre, but each is much better than this one, which may as well have been done for television by the old Filmation studio that put out the He-Man cartoons each Saturday.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
A great laugh for kids and adults,"This was simply fun. It had great laughs that were aimed at both adults and children, the plot was entertaining and original. Great action scenes. And it even had a dance fight!The voice actors were excellent, giving life and depth to their characters,and the artists then added a wealth of believable, and sometimes subtle expression and character to their drawings as well. You felt everything Puss in Boots felt.The plot was original and extremely fun, there was a perfect balance of back plot and story that gave an entertaining insight into Puss. The movie then seamlessly blended action, tragedy and humour into a delightful tale that both adults and children will love too watch again and again. Which is good because with my kids I'm sure I'll have too.I would compare this to the first shrek movie, awesome animation, just enough character depth to entertain both adults and children, inspired humour for both adults and children, and a wealth of action scenes that are so beautifully drawn and animated that the entire film is just eye candy. Without doubt both adults and children will love this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Has kitty got claws?...,"Well animated with a nice musical score by Henry Jackman; the quality of the picture is great as well (no 3D here). Performance wise; well it wouldn't be Puss in Boots without the voice of Antonio Banderas in the starring role, and he really nailed it again here! Salma Hayek did a very decent job as Kitty Softpaws and Zach Galifianakis was adequate as Humpty Dumpty (more on him later). Honourable mentions go to; Billy Bob Thornton as Jack, Amy Sedaris as Jill, Constance Marie as Imelda and Guillermo del Toro as Moustache Man/Comandate.Although, in parts it was pretty funny and there were some nice one- liners and the usual subtle references to other movies; I felt there was something missing (apart from Shrek and Donkeyetc). At the end of the day I put it down to the fact that I didn't find the character of Humpty Dumpty very convincing. His motivations seemed very vague for the amount of effort he put in. This aside, it's well made, pretty enjoyable and it's got Antonio Banderas as Puss in Boots!

"Unneeded, but entertaining","The big problem about Puss in Boots is that there's really no reason for its existence. In a Disney franchise, it would have been a straight-to-video sequel at best. It distinguishes itself somewhat by focusing more on action and less on fairy tale gags than the Shrek movies, but it's not enough to make up for the very flat, predictable storyline. Every new character introduced for the sake of this movie is also a one-note gag, the protagonist remaining the only one with any real characterization.In spite of all that Puss in Boots is pretty entertaining, and it's notably better than the last two entries in the Shrek series - animation included, while the animation in Shrek Forever After was lazy and bland, Puss in Boots was made with a lot of imagination and attention to details; the animated cats are all hilarious, their behavior filled with wonderful observation of the real world counterparts, lovely visual gags that make up for the general lack of fresh humor. The movie is bland and forgettable as a whole, but it's a pretty fun way to spend 90 minutes, especially if you enjoyed Kung Fu Panda.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Meowz Up!!,"I've been watching a lot of animated movies off late and am a cat lover as well! So there wasn't much of a debate whether to watch this movie or not. My opinion might be based on what I think an average animated movie watcher like me goes to a movie for. First is to see an unthinkable fantasy world come to animated life and second is to get some cute fun in the process. With this in mind I'd rate this movie an 8 out of 10.The story of the fugitive cat 'Puss in boots' is compelling enough to grasp the viewer in his adventures and there is a lot of other interesting characters, some cute and some stereotypically evil ones on the way as well. We are introduced to the story of friendship, betrayal and reconciliation of the main protagonists Puss and Humpty Dumpty in the beginning and the rest of the story follows vividly from there. All of it is done with little distractions here and there but no cheesiness. But there is still a lack of that charisma for people that look for more in their movies. Which is why this movie might not become a classic like Lion King, Nemo or Shrek for that matter. If you are expecting one then you will be a tad bit disappointed like me.The cutest part of the movie has to be the baby goose. I could hardly care who else was in the frame in those scenes.Good job! The performance of Antonio Banderas is what make this movie so energetically moving. It's going to be difficult for anyone to personify the lovable Puss In Boots in a different way or a different level above the memorable voice Antonio gave to an otherwise well known parallel character from story books. I cant say the same for any other characters in this movie. Even Salma Hayek falls flat except for a few instances in her performance of Soft Paws. I didn't really grow fond of Humpty Dumpty(Zach Galifianakis) either and I don't hope for these two characters to grow further as well if there happens to be a sequel.All in all this is good clean animated fun at its best.

Should please little kids.,"'PUSS IN BOOTS': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A spin off prequel to the four 'SHREK' films focusing on the character 'Puss in Boots' (once again voiced by Antonio Banderas). Joining him in the voice cast is Salma Hayek (once again playing a love interest of Banderas's), Zach Galifianakis, Billy Bob Thornton, Amy Sedaris and Guillermo del Toro. The film was directed by Chris Miller (who also directed 'SHREK THE THIRD') and written by a team of writers including David H. Steinberg, Tom Wheeler, Jon Zack, William Davies and Brian Lynch. The movie is pretty much a waste of time in my opinion. It's nether funny nor involving in anyway as there's just not much done with the characters.The film is set several years before the first 'SHREK' film when 'Puss in Boots' was a wanted fugitive. Puss plots to steal magic beans from Jack (Thornton) and Jill (Sedaris), who are criminals, in order to clear his name. He meets up with an old female friend named Kitty Softpaws (Hayek) and his childhood friend Humpty Dumpy (Galifianakis) who betrayed him. Puss must decide if he can trust the two before agreeing to team with them. They then plot to steal the beans together, get the golden goose from the Giant's castle and clear Puss's name.I was never a big fan of the 'SHREK' films. I enjoyed the first one to a certain extent but found all of the sequels to be lacking any real entertainment value of any kind. They do seem to appeal to kids though and they're not painful to watch for adults so I'll give them some credit for that. I'd say the same thing is about true of this spin off. It probably would have been a lot more entertaining to see a 'Donkey' prequel starring Eddie Murphy but the Puss in Boot's character could have been interesting. They of course failed to make use of anything they actually had going for them with the character but the movie still should please little kids.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDQQKEqGhZQ",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Better than expected.,"Interestingly, the Puss in Boots character was created as far back as the 16th Century.

The film also features the classic characters Jack and Jill, and Humpty Dumpty.The film is filled with action, adventure and humor. Although there are serious undertones, it is presented in a very lighthearted way, so a young demographic might not even be aware of these underlying themes.

Cat in the hat,"This quite amusing spin-off prequel from the ""Shrek"" franchise follows the adventures of lovable rogue Puss In Boots as he establishes his legend in an adventure which takes in the nursery rhymes of principally ""Jack and Jill"" and ""Humpty Dumpty"", and ""Jack and The Beanstalk"" with a little splash of ""Little Boy Blue"" thrown in for good measure.It starts well as we get re-acquainted with the daredevil adventurer Puss, with some nice gags and terrific animation but rather runs out of steam as the story gets elongated by extended chase sequences by which time I came to the conclusion that this was a short padded out to feature-length. Perhaps Puss can't really carry a film on his own and familiarity breeds a little contempt as many of the cat-related gags employed seem recognisable from the earlier Shrek films, including those involving fur-balls, cat's eyes and how a cat always falls on its feet.I quite liked the Kitty Softpaws character as well as the villainous Jack and Jill protagonists but felt that the tie-up with Humpty Dumpty somewhat contrived. The best scene was probably the early dance-off between Puss and Kitty but the conclusion with the returning giant Mother Goose again was too reminiscent of the flying dragon climax to ""Shrek"".""Puss In Boots"" as I indicated doesn't quite step up to major character here and while containing many fun and amusing moments never achieves the heights the mighty Shrek achieved. Never really had a cat's chance, did it?",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Sleepworthy for Adults; Enjoyable for Kids,"Let's face it. Any nicely animated film will entertain the children and this one does the task. The animation is well done and the voices are also well done. The children will recognize the characters from nursery rhymes--Puss in Boots, Humpty Dumpty, Jack & Jill, The Golden Goose, the Magic Beans/Giant, etc. They will be entertained and probably want to watch it again. It does the trick.Adults have also grown accustomed to seeing animated films that work on two levels since the days of Bugs Bunny. So many of these films have in jokes and double entendres and wonderful cultural references. The plot moves beautifully and the dialog keeps us entertained while we have to watch a children's movie. Unfortunately, this is not the case. If I had to rate this solely from an adult's point of view, I'd rate it a 2. It's pretty painful. You can actually predict the dialog. There is little of interest. No bones thrown our way to acknowledge that we have to sit and watch this with the young ones. Well, there's some nice dance moves, but that's about it. So, watch it in the background and have some cards.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Two Paws Up For This Film,"This film gives us the back-story on Puss in Boots. It is a good film based on fairy-tales (or should I say fairy-tails) that will have you laughing like a kid again.Kitty Softpaws - Loved her! When I first saw her I thought she was a he like Puss did. ""Bat Cat"" was my first thought.... then I said to myself no it is a she ""Cat Woman"" lol. Well I like the name Kitty Softpaws and the character. She's lovable.Humpty Dumpty - I did not know if I liked him or despised him until the end of the film. I decided that he is a likable egg. Very funny character - just as funny as Puss.Puss in Boots - Funny, adorable and charismatic as usual (See: Shrek 2). I'm glad he got his own spin-off movie.

There's no tripe for cats,"After four movies on the main character, ""Shrek""'s saga turns on one of the most popular mascot of the franchise: Puss in boots. But the spin-off that represents him doesn't catch all the play of references and parodies that shapes the shrekian concept, and the pastiche that would have to be the point of arrival is just alluded, with the mix the histories of Puss, Humpty Dumpty and the magic beans. The result is an anonymous film sanza infamia e sanza lode, that follows more or less all the stereotypes of the adventure ""for kids"": the journey, the betrayal, the redemption toward love. It affects, at most, the rancor that can be hatched inside of what at first seemed to be the best friendship; but the pale result reveals how the Puss character works well, instead, only near Shrek and company.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"This is very good film, although not sure if its worth paying the extra to see it in 3D 8/10","Well I went and saw this film without reading what it was about or seeing the trailer just knowing it had something to do with shrek. Having now watched the film, it is like a spin off of skrek, the film follows the story line of jack and the beenstalk. The 3 main characters are:Puss in boots: He is desperate to clear his name, since something happened between him and Humbty Dumby, not saying what though you will have to go and watch it to find that out.

It is Fe Fine,"Looking back, this film will go down as a neat bit of trivia. People will say, oh yeah, ""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" has a prequel. The way the cover of the film changed, it seemed like stores were trying to trick people into buying this film thinking it was ""The Last Wish"". Where this film does not come close to the greatness that its sequel reached, how does it hold up? It's very OK.After the character was a big hit in ""Shrek 2"", and the series reached a conclusion with ""Shrek 4"", Puss in Boots received this film as a spinoff. Where Shrek is mostly a satire, poking fun at different fairy tale and adventure clichés, Puss in Boots embraces them. It still has a sense of humor, but the feeling of adventure is more sincere.The action, music, voice acting, and comedy are all good. What keeps the film firmly in the just fine category is the story and some of the characters. The story feels like they dusted off an old adventure script that they had sitting in a vault for years and hastily painted on the Puss in Boots character. The story does not capitalize on the setting or the characters. It is just your basic heist, just in a fairy tale world.Puss in Boots and Kitty Softpaws are fun characters who work well off each other. Jack and Jill on the other hand are very forgettable antagonists. And Humpty Dumpty flip flops so often that you get no grasp on who the character is.The movie came out when 3D was all the rage, and it is clear that a lot of the action scenes were made with that gimmick in mind. It isn't the most distracting thing, but it is something that you notice.Overall, there is a lot of potential in these characters and in this world. It just isn't capitalized on until the next movie. We can all be grateful, that this cat had another life left in him after this one.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fab film especially for cat lovers,"Great film. It's a spin-off from the Shrek series so if you like the Shrek movies you will probably like this. There are lots of cat-jokes that are very funny for cat-owners but they might go over the heads of non-cat people. So the 9 out of 10 score reflects that I have a cat but I think most people will like this film generally. The characters are very likable, apart from maybe Humpty Dumpty (what is there to like about an egg - its just weird!). I didn't see it in 3D so can't comment on that but the animation is visually good. There are some great action scenes too especially the cat dancing.

The slick feline manages to carry his own movie in high fashion.,"Arguably the most popular character of the long running Shrek franchise, it was inevitable that Puss in Boots would receive a movie of his own. To the wrong hands, this could have been a monetary gain, but qualified loss, but the slick feline makes every second of his movie count.While still staying true to the storybook characters and ideologies of the earlier Shrek films, Puss in Boots is actually a very inspired deviation, being that it plays out more like a spaghetti western rather than a fairy tale. It may not be as wacky or surreal as Rango, but it has an undeniable charm, and one that's honestly a little more easy to digest. Antonio Banderas, as always, is smooth, witty, and charismatic as our nine lived lead hero, but also conveying an honest emotion beneath, especially when the attention is turned onto the old friendship between Puss and Humpty Dumpty.About 20 minutes through the film, it takes a slow turn from the quick paced, action packed side of things, and builds up a fascinating back story between the two (This sequence takes up about ten whole minutes, but man, it's so good). This friendship is where the movie's emotional core lies, and Humpty Dumpty (Excellently voiced by Zach Galifianakis) is one great character.But not everything in the movie works. The character of Kitty Softpaws (Voiced by Salma Hayek) is a rather flat one, and I never really bought her romance with Puss. There's also a twist near the end of the film which feels kinda obvious. But at the very least, this is a well done and constructed movie, with beautifully composed animation and camera-work, thrilling action scenes, and to add to all this, Henry Jackman (Whose musical score is surprisingly pretty awesome) clearly channels the great Ennio Morricone, complete with gorgeous Latin Salsa rhythms, and sweeping choirs.*** out of ****",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

I know not everyone is a fan of 3D but I think it was used in a great, fun way here. I loved all the characters in this movie and enjoyed watching them go on their little adventure, and happy to see where the story would go. I do think the film slows down a little bit in the last half but then picks itself up again for a nice end, but all round a great film.

8/10 because Humpty is ugly,"Many of my friends said that this movie was nothing to be excited about and I watched it without high expectation to fill my evening.But I have to admit, I was very nicely surprised - honestly, this movie is one of the best motion pictures I've ever seen: It has stunning visuals, an amazingly written and animated choreography (both for the fights and for the dances - every hair, every muscle of the cats just plays so nicely), it shows great love to the most tiny detail, good and easy to follow story (which is not always the best, but it's an animated movie kids should understand, so this time it's desired), it sports a well written and most importantly well played/animated love story, quite good action, well placed references to other media (First rule of bean club...) and of course - the cats.OK, I admit - I'm a cat person, I basically am a cat, so that probably casts a slight shadow on my review but still, Puss in Boots is a very good movie.Two things I would change to make this movie simply the best movie of all times: come up with a better visual idea for Humpty Dumpty (he's really ugly) and place Jack Black in his role (though I guess his ego wouldn't comply too well with playing a sidekick :D)",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the best westerns i've seen to date...,"I don't know what people were thinking when they rate this 6.7, according to my book, this deserves at least 8.

I liked it more than all the shrek movie's i've seen.I'd say if you are in to movies like Indiana jones, Holes, Tremors, Zorro, Quick and the dead, Mummy, or any other fun to watch kind of westernish adventures. Go ahead, watch this movie and i guarantee you'll love this. This also reminded me a little bit of Brisco County Jr. (an old TV series).It has captured every moment perfectly, from getting fairy tail characters to co exist in real world to weaving a awesome western adventure. If you like cats, dancing, a little gun fights and sword fights, awesome cart chases... this is the one for you.Don't think twice of watching this... i don't want to spoil it further by telling you what's it's all about.

cat story,"Puss in boots is one of the few animation movies that includes comedy. Even though it is based on shrek, puss in boots has its own character, with many Spanish influences. The story even includes twists (the egg is looking for revenge after all) and romantic parts. Clever lines make the film even more amusing, and the familiar characters blend in with the new ones very nicely. In addition, the main stars, the cats, are very cute, especially the one that says ohhh in the bar is a nice detail.However, the movie cannot escape from the well known ending- the hero saves the day, the bad become good by doing a dangerous act...All in all, puss in boots is an exciting family movie with lots of laughter and adventure.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
The greatest hero,"Remember the good children's tale about the cat and its owner Marquis Carabas? Well, this cartoon is not about him, and the brutal and insidious killer of giants from Shrek - Cote boots. But that is if he really and what is hiding behind his cute attractive face? That's what we decided to tell Dreamworks. By the way, strange enough, but kids in the hall almost was not, basically a couple (well, this is understandable, even seals on YouTube are popular.)The script tells us about the past of the hero, including a mini-story of the Cat, about his childhood. But the bulk of the followers of Jack's adventure takes the bean stalk and hunt for golden eggs. Of course, many changes, but it is a modern cartoon fairy tales treatment now in vogue. There are two main story lines: friendship and love. To be honest, both are shown in this way that children will hardly interesting morality, are not mature enough yet to treachery and romance. But the jokes, dances and other frills - just for them. Shrek style is preserved, ""his wife flowers, ice cream ditYam"", well, or a great moral uncle and aunt, and children - humor. Both lines are disclosed in some detail, especially friendship. Then you and flashbacks of the meeting, and this association, and of course fix the bad guys. And love - is all the chances to continue, maybe we'll see him someday.The picture is even interesting. I really do not like 3d, but would not say that it was a lot, but overall not bad. And the scenery, ""wild west"", and urban slums, and even cloud castle - all beyond praise. The soundtrack, like in Shrek, does the job. Where should he play fonchikom where you want to highlight key, and even during the dance, listen to it - a pleasure.Side of humor, as I said, at the level of Shrek. There are jokes for both children and adults have. In recent years, taken to introduce any exotic character that will appear periodically in the background, and to publish funny sounds, comment, or ape. Here he became a cat out of the bar, with its ""Uooou."" I do not quite understand why the place of the partner chose the egg, though of course it is logical in relation to the golden eggs, but they could not bother and we are so deep, sometimes just annoying.Overall, this movie I would suggest to look in love (in the end, many in the room kissing), it is natural to children, and indeed all relax does not interfere. Easy, not too deep a cartoon, of course, with a happy-end, which will teach you how to take care of Lady, and to seek adventure on his butt.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

The voicing is great Antonio Banderas with is Spanish accent is as always great as lead voice of Puss in Boots, Salma Hayek as Kitty Softpaws and Zach Galifianakis as Humpty Dumpty were also great.

Retrospective Reviews- Puss in Boots (2011),"Let me get this straight, I don't HATE Dreamworks, I like some of their films, and others I don't. This film is one that I like!.PROS: First off, the animation is great, it looks so much better than any other Dreamworks films done in the past, it just looks so complete and real, it looks like they did what Rockstar Games did for 'RED DEAD REDEMPTION', they rendered and created the animation to 100% perfection so it looks like a real environment, and I loved it! The voice actors were good also, Antonio Banderas was great as always, he was funny and was trying to play it serious at the same time, which is what we always expect from something like this. Salma Hayek and Billy Bob Thornton were average as their characters, but still gave their characters a bit of depth and fun, but the absolute best part of the film was Zach Galifianakis as Humpty Humpty, he was SO funny and actually became my favourite character in the movie. The story was good, and I enjoyed the action and adventure parts of the film as they were exciting and fun to watch.CONS: Like most of my reviews, the negatives are just a lot of little things, and that would be the jokes. To be honest, I DID laugh while watching this film, it was very, very funny, it's just that, like other Dreamworks films, some of the jokes fell flat. But that shouldn't stop you from watching it.

I can also appreciate the fact that they didn't go nuts with big stars after the main leads, as quite often films like these are overloaded with them which takes away from the story as they all try to fight for supremacy and more lines.

Following the story they will steal it from jack and jill which are a great villains' but not a lot of plot twist happened there but still a good wife-husband villains , The story follows and the adventures continue till what's beyond what i expect , The visuals are Stunning here for a 2011 movie which is phenomenal and trust me when i say this movie is underrated I MEAN IT , this movie changed my life as a kid and i think i've seen this movie for like 100+ times ( i don't finish it every time but still ) this movie is so enjoyable and not a single moment i felt boredom , the voice actor of this amazing character is Antonio banderas which happens to be a perfect fit for this character. This movie's vibe is unbeatable not even spiderverse can beat the vibe for me this movie has a special place in my heart and without ANY doubt. The most unspoken of and most UNDERRATED movie ever made. I just want to say that if you didn't watch it Don't be ignorant and watch this wonderful masterpiece from the creation of dreamworks which a lot of movies they make are GOATED , and one thing that people get familiar with this movie is the song by lady gaga which is a Classic , at first the song made me more attached to the movie than ever , and i must say that this movie never failed to make me smile , such a wonderful movie, I genuinely recommend this movie to anyone that didn't watch it , and from my experience you should NOT listen to the negative comments this is a masterpiece from a start to finish, I am glad i stumbled upon this movie when i was a child and now i appreciate having this aspect in my life.

Cat characters were not cute enough to be cats!,"As a big cat lover, I was disappointed the way the animated characters turned out, not cute enough to look like cats, and the story could have used more feline signature behavior, not just drinking milk and chasing a light. In ""How to Train Your Dragon"", for example, the writers and the animators utilized more of cat demeanor in the dragon characters than the writers and animators did in the cats, in ""Puss in Boots"".Although the team involved in this project was responsible for one of my favorite animated films, ""Madagascar"", I wish they hired a team of REAL CAT LOVERS. Someone, like the creator of ""Simon's Cat"".Moreover, the characters in ""Puss in Boots"" did not look feline enough. They looked like toys or robots. Furthermore, the eyes and noses did not have enough detail, and the proportions of the faces were not accurate. The fangs were shortened, the whiskers too. If they merely took a picture of a real cat and just copied it, it would have been a much cuter looking character.In closing, I enjoy watching ""Simon's Cat"" more than I did ""Puss in Boots"", and ""Simon's Cat"" is always free on the internet! :)",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Very Entertaining!,"Puss in Boots. The first time I saw the poster, I imagined about a classic story, that tells about a cat that wore boots, that later in the story made his owner rich by his tricky way. It also reminded me about Shrek movie. But when I watched it, it's so different from what I expect it would be. The story, the characters, and others are so different. Only the cat that wearing boots that still the same. Well, this movie is about a cat, named Puss, that wanted to clear his name because he was trapped by his best friend, an egg named Humpty Dumpty, that made him as if he robbed a bank. But now their back and now their main bounty is the magic beans, which they had dreamed about since their childhood. The magic beans, remember it from a classic story, ""Jack and The Beanstalk"". Their journey began...From all, I think this movie very entertaining with many tense action, and jokes and foolishness from the characters.

"A Charming, Spin-Off Prequel That Can Stand On Its Own Two Feet","To understand what made the character Puss in Boots come to be before meeting Shrek, this spin-off prequel proved to be a movie that can hold its own. While anticipating what the next installment of this orange tabby feline will be with The Last Wish, it's best I started with this origin story first. The comedic energy intertwined with fairy tale concepts and twist on these characters is what made the Shrek films recognizable, so the execution of all that is retained in Puss' own film as well. Keeping the ""Shrek"" lineage.Puss in Boots is a notorious outlaw who was once a symbol of honor, but when he is reunited with his estranged, childhood friend-turned-enemy Humpty Alexander Dumpty and the aid of another fellow rogue named Kitty Softpaws for a daring adventure in pursuing magic beans to find the fabled Golden Goose that lays golden eggs, Puss learns that this is more than just about clearing his name.With the voices of Antonio Banderas as the titular role with costars Salma Hayek (reunited with Banderas in their fifth film together) and Hangover star Zach Galifinakis, this proved to be quite the ensemble cast. Their unique talents in bringing these characters to life really caught my attention. I should even add that the addition of musicians Rodrigo y Gabriela for the ""dance fight"" sequence is a nice Latin American touch. Since Shrek is completely absent from this movie after seeing his own films that featured Puss in three of them, this is an interesting way to see more of Puss' backstory as the cat with a Zorro complex (a role Banderas once played with such charisma). There seems to be a moral lesson as the story progresses as well. Though Puss holds a grudge against Humpty for betraying him years ago, they learn from each other as being the better person. Their differences are what makes them see why they do what they do. In the end, I liked what I saw and it definitely explains why it received similar accolades to the first two Shrek films. It's quite a charming movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Smart Flick!,"I really enjoyed Dreamworks ""Puss in Boots"" I thought that it was very clever and had a rather interesting premise and an interesting way of telling it. Throughout watching this film, I have not experienced boredom once due to the carefree and rather interesting character of Puss, from his heartwarming origin to his ever-determining personality. This cat was a great protagonist and had the necessary enthusiasm. Then we have his companion Kitty who also has a great spirit she is rather aggressive to our protagonist at first but then learns to love him towards the end. Lastly, we have the complex yet intriguing character of Humpy Dumpty who helps the film propel even further due to his genius methods of overcoming obstacles. The animation was rather amazing, and the scenery and backgrounds of this film were realistic yet breathtaking. So overall I would recommend this film, and this is not a skip. Therefore, leading me to give this flick an 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Very Fun,"Fun as ever, Puss in Boots decides to do something new with the titular character- and the result is something quite magical and very exciting. Puss in Boots isn't a perfect animated film, it has its flaws here and there, mainly do to its dramatic tones at times- and forced jokes at its beginning. Once we get into the plot however, the film is quite nearly perfect. It may not be like the other Shrek films where Puss in Boots himself gained his legacy, but giving the film to the character, its able to make a much more unique take on the tale- and prove to be a quite exciting adventure all the way throughout. I was thoroughly entertained watching the film throughout, there were times simply were I forgot it was an animated movie completely, and focused on it as an action movie. It has a cool and charismatic vibe, and it's orange color palette makes for some beautiful scenery and animation throughout. Its music is excellent, and its voice performances are nearly all top notch. I liked the character of Humpty Dumpty- but wasn't a huge fan of Zach Galifianakis's voice work on him- not that it was bad- but it just felt a bit bland at time. Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek provide excellent performances though, respectably- leading a charismatic and magical story that would be so much flatter without them. The script is interesting and truly embraces the new world at hand, it may be different, may not be what you are expecting, but in the end, Puss in Boots is a rather clever and very fun ride.My Rating: 9.3/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Dreamwork's Enjoyable Prequel,"Puss In Boots is a pretty enjoyable movie the way it is a prequel to Shrek 2. Sure, there can be some moments that get predictable. But it bring in a lot of fun moments the way it tells the story how Puss is called Puss In Boots and some of the events we would see in Shrek films. The animation is great that experiments its visuals. The action scenes are a blast. And the characters offer good development as an origin film of Puss In Boots. I know there's people that would say Shrek has ended for the better. So if you would like to see at least something different as a Shrek reboot, this would be a pretty good option. In my opinion, this movie would be between the four of Shrek movies. Not as great as the first two, but liked it more than the last two. By watching the movie, I'm pretty hopeful for The Last Wish.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Someone give this the cream. But non-diary because you're not supposed to give that to cats. It's good is what I'm trying to say.,"You know, when I first heard of this I did not expect much. Total cash in that would be worthy only of home media, I thought.But I was wrong. This was so well devised and thought through, keeping with the same fairy tale gimmick but now with the caliente back drop of Spain rather than the medieval aesthetic of Shrek.An engaging, funny and also very poignant narrative of old relationships and new ones each alike being tested. Letting Puss meet his match in a female cat could have felt pandering but they handle it very well.In short, a great animation experience worthy of being in the same regard as Shrek 1 and 2.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"6.6 on IMDb?! RIGGED, this movie is SOLID FUN","Puss In Boots (2011) starring Antonio Banderas, Salma Hayek and Zach Galifianakis together is an excellent combination of actors that deliver a memorable trio/team as Puss, Kitty and Humpty in that respective order.After the last movie Shrek Forever After (2010), fans of the franchise felt it was done for, but eventually the legendary feline Puss In Boots himself would receive his own spin-off that is a prequel/follow up to Shrek (2001) before he made his first appearance in Shrek 2 (2004).The plot is relatively simple but satisfying with an average runtime of an hour and 30 minutes. It is fun, adventurous and a movie for all ages alike. Jack and Jill as the villains was also a cool and unexpected addition as they deliver a great threat and unnerving presence to our main protagonist.Readers if you're reading this review and haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend it if you're into the Shrek movies since I've been watching this movie plenty of times for years, the animation holds up brilliantly for its time. This movie also has a sequel which some may argue it is even BETTER than the first movie, and that movie is Puss In Boots The Last Wish (2021),
Overall, I still think this movie holds up and is pretty good and should get more recognition.7.4/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A decent film but dreamworks has done it better many times,"This movie is a perfectly fine action kids movie. The film has some surprisingly really good action in some parts but doesn't overly run with it's spoofs of fairytale characters unlike the shrek films. The movie is also not overly funny it has some funny moments but is more or less an animated action flick. The story is also not overly interesting and the morals are nice but more of a background piece and isn't as good as other dreamwork films. I'd recommend to just skip this and watch the shrek films or puss in boots the last wish, that being said it still has some funny moments and the action is well done so I guess it's basically watch it if you want but there are much better movies involving the character.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Amazing film to watch!,"Joel Crawford directed this film to establish more of Puss in Boots' history. It is a Comedy/Adventure film about a cat with nine lives but wastes one to discover he has one more life before he dies. He has his worst nightmare, and his terror causes a werewolf to attack Puss in the Boot. The director achieves his purpose by letting viewers experience their emotions over Puss in Boots as he is terrified and his life flashes before him. The story structure was created by creating two essential characters, Kitty Softpaws and Perrito, the dog, introduced in the film to help Puss rebuild his trust after losing it. Throughout the film, he must earn their confidence by accompanying them on the Last Wish journey. Various problems arose, including the werewolf and Jack Horner hunting Puss, both antagonists attempting to take Puss's life. Antonio Banderas does an excellent job as Puss in Boots because he convinces the audience that he is performing real acting. I liked all of the performers in the film. Still, my favorite was Perrito because he was both energetic and caring. He was always very nice to the cats, no matter what they said or did to him. Harvey Guillen portrays the role with tremendous insight and does an outstanding job. This is a must-see video since it has many implications that individuals may not know but are critical to comprehend. The new films Dreamwork has been creating recently may have been better, but this was by far the best. It depicts a fantastic example of Puss in Boots. It shows the audience how to conquer their fears and become better people.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Hilarious and clever,"I remember seeing this one in the theater and thinking it was funny. But I was 13 back then, so of course I did. But due to the Hype around the new film and surprisingly not loving it after watching it in theaters myself, I spontaneously decided to watch this one on Netflix a few days ago.To my surprise, this movie is hilarious. It has that dark Shrek humor that I love and excellent characters. I could listen to Antonio Banderas as Puss all day. It's just so much fun. He also has great chemistry with Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek). Watching them together is great in this movie, and none of their banter gets annoying, even though it does border on being cliché.Humpty Dumpty plays the main antagonist of this story alongside Jack and Jill, and luckily, they don't try to make it a twist, and they hint at it multiple times. Humpty and Jack and Jill also get a few laughs and are enjoyable to watch.The jokes in the film are mostly excellent and don't rely on a comedic relief GIF and Merch generator to say wacky stuff.It also has decent emotional moments, while not taking itself too serious, and does give the villain a pretty great send off that I didn't expect. It's not brilliant, but its neat.The Animation is also really fun. I know a lot of people have criticized the look of modern animation, but I believe a lot of the comedy derives from the way the people look in the Shrek series. Slightly uncanny, but it also looks endearing when it needs to.I definitely have to choose it as the stronger movie between the two, and I know everyone I've seen online disagrees, but that's just me. You're free to choose your favorite.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Like Shrek, But Without Shrek In It","Puss In Boots – without the extra cast of Shrek – is very hard to relate to for half the movie. True, the kids loved it so much that they wanted to add the film to their wish list for a birthday or Christmas, but as to Family support and the average ""Let's get together as a Family and watch a Family Film"", there is more on offer to this genre than ""Puss In Boots"".It may be a sad fact to many that the film is a singular, rather than a joint addition to the Shrek Series, but in all fairness, people will have the twitching feeling to expect Shrek or Donkey to appear anytime soon throughout the whole feature.It is – kind of – fresh in the way that it concludes a single adventure of the much loved-to-be-hated would-be assassin of Shrek, Puss In Boots, who will without a doubt enchant and entertain even the youngest of kin. More to the point is that if there are any children out there who have not seen any of the ""Shrek's"" then this is the film for them.Review By Marcus De Storm 2011",,Anonymous,Animation
"Fun and well made, bursting with extra delicious flavors on top","'Shrek,' and its first sequel, are undeniable modern classics, joys of animation and storytelling that twist familiar fairy tale figures to delightful new ends. The 2004 film was an especial blast, I dare say, as it introduced us to the Shrek-verse's characterization of Puss in Boots: a dashing, swashbuckling, and adorable rogue who readily stole the hearts of one and all. It was perhaps inevitable that DreamWorks would give the feisty feline a feature of his own, and I'm so very glad they did. Sure, this 2011 picture plays fast and loose with conventions of storytelling, being extraordinarily direct with plot development and scene writing, and further weaving in certain anachronisms; some bits lean particularly hard into appealing to the kids int he audience. This is all just part and parcel of the fantastic slant of the saga, however, nevermind the ridiculous fun - and golly, is this fun! Jokes, gags, and the sweetest of furball idiosyncrasies connect to the character's catty constitution (a cause for celebration for any ailurophile), and the nature of others and the setting, and scenes are further filled with fabulous wit, situational humor, references, and abject silliness in their own right, let alone an endless array of puns. This is to say nothing of the simple pleasure of the story, the excellence of the animation, or anything else on hand. 'Puss in Boots' is a really great time!True, I might be predisposed to liking this given my own absolute love of cats, but I know well enough to judge a picture on its own merits - and this has nothing but. The voice cast is clearly enjoying themselves all so much, Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek above all. Henry Jackman's original score readily invites the appropriate airs of adventure and daring-do, and it makes me extra happy to instantly recognize the dulcet tones of Rodrigo y Gabriela on the soundtrack. The landscapes and cityscapes across the runtime are gorgeous, and all the characters were given such lovely, wonderfully detailed designs. All the action sequences are duly exciting, and every effect and otherwise active element of digital splendor is just plain stellar, as one would quite expect of the studio. Despite its forthrightness, relative simplicity, and rather brisk pace, the narrative is very well-written in addition to just being a gallivanting good time - and I'm personally impressed that it takes a couple steps I wouldn't have anticipated, and which are slightly ahead of its time for 2011. It's a little understated, yet there's no mistaking that 'Puss in Boots' technically includes a disabled character among its primary cast, one with abuse in their back story, who nevertheless succeeds despite their limitations and use them to their advantage. In the same stroke, there's an underhanded and gentle condemnation of animal cruelty and archaic practices of human-animal companionship. Would that the picture were more strident with these notions, perhaps, but the matter is noteworthy all the same.A few emphatic, vibrant scenes of song and dance add further to the cat fancy, gleefully layered on top of the splendor already invited by the action, the comedy, and the otherwise craftsmanship of the feature. Maybe the plot is familiar in the broad strokes, and nothing wholly extraordinary, yet all the terrific flavors added on top enrich the experience beyond the sum of its constituent parts. That goes for the music, the voice work, the animation, every last scene in and of itself and the action not least, and more; all the little flourishes of cat behavior woven in, well, those are the best of all bonuses. When all is said and done this may not be a revelation or an absolute must-see, but the tale of the gallant gato is highly enjoyable from top to bottom, and I would have assumed no less. Whether one is a fan of the 'Shrek' pictures, of fairy tales broadly, of cats, or just looking for a good diversion for ninety minutes, this is one slice of cinema that's well worth digging our claws into. 'Puss in Boots' is splendidly entertaining, and earns two paws up from me!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Very Fun movie,"Puss in boots was a pretty good movie. No bad language that i could hear of. Also the rude humor was not that bad. My take on the film was brilliant, very exciting. Put me in the mind of an old western. So I highly think you should watch this movie if you like cats, comedy, adventure, then this film is for you. I was suprised at how good this movie was, most dreamworks movies have bad language, too much rude humor. I also think you should watch Spirit stallion of the cimmeron, Spirit untamed, Kung Fu Panda, the other Puss in Boots film, and i'm sure there are more. So I hope you watch this movie, I hope I was a big help to you and enjoy.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
The origin of Puss In Boots according to the Shrek universe,"The original story of Puss in Boots is characterized by having an ingenious and cunning character of French origin, while this film is a complete imagination of the character with a different story, an origin that leaves aside the original story and presents us with this Spanish version. Of the character we met in the second installment of Shrek. What we see here is a Shrek spin off where we meet a cat of Spanish origin whose personality and profile is based a lot on actor Antonio Banderas, who gives him a voice in both the original and Latin dubbing. That's because this cat was based on Zorro who Banderas also played and has all the characteristics of the actor. This cat is a complete gallant and is quite agile, but he is also a rascal that in a certain aspect respects the essence of the original character of the story. Set in the Shrek universe that parodies many elements of fairy tales, here Puss In Boots is an outlaw with a sad past and who throughout this journey manages to be a great hero. Antonio was a good choice from the Shrek series, as he brought a lot of his personality to the character and he did it very well. Salma Hayek also manages to play Kitty very well, giving her that femme fatale and seductive charm. Humpty Dumpty is quite the subject, as he is a fairly old character of English origin who has been reimagined in many versions throughout history. Humpty actually manages to have a very good participation in the story by being linked to the cat's past. Although the story is nothing out of this world, because it takes the magic beans tale as its central focus, the film is enjoyable in terms of its production and development. The animation is as good as in the other Shrek movies, giving the settings and characters a very realistic look. The soundtrack by Henry Jackman together with Rodrigo & Gabriela is not far behind for having an epic musical atmosphere plus that beautiful style of tango and flamenco. Puss In Boots is a decent spin off and an acceptable movie to learn about the origin of this curious character and a little more about the Shrek universe. My final rating for this movie is 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

I thought the movie was really funny, and I loved the chemistry between Puss in Boots and Kitty Softpaws! I also really liked the action sequence. I think the movie really teaches us about friendship and forgiving others. I really liked Kitty Softpaws because she really embodies the strong female character role and I think that Salma Hayek was a good choice for her voice. She kinda reminds me of Carolina, Yelena Belova, and Marian Ravenwood. Even though it didn't win the Golden Globe and Oscar, at least it deserved to be nominated.

Milking the Shrek,"First it was ""Rio"" and now its ""Puss in Boots"", both have the ""Tex-Mex"" flavour of tacos, nachos and jalapeños. The ""Puss in Boots"" character obviously is big time inspired by Antonio Banderas ""Zorro"". It adds the track of ""Humpty Dumpty"" to give a emotional side to his personality. And then we have ""Kitty Softpaws"" thrown in for a romantic angle. As always with the series, there are hoards of comic characters who have moved on with life and scare the living daylights to rob your childhood memories. Especially Jack & Jill whose have grown up to reprise the animated version of Bonnie & Clyde.Don't get me wrong, it entertaining but. The plot moves on predictable lines. Animation has to lauded as its top-notch. Background score delivers a punch. You will walk out of the cinema with a feeling of having succumbed to the ransom by your little tykes and duped by production houses under the garb of franchise.",,Anonymous,Animation
lukewarm material that has its moments,"Functioning as both a spin-off and a prequel, with the titular feline character that first appeared in the second Shrek film getting his own full-length feature that spotlights him as a wanted fugitive from the law. There are more cat puns, idioms, and witticisms than you'll likely care to count, some which hit, some which miss, as well as some sly Zorro in-jokes so as to take full advantage of the vocal talents of Banderas, and familiar characters on hand like Jack and Jill, and one Humpty A. Dumpty. Despite all the characters and colorful lines the plot is pretty flimsy, and the protagonist seems better suited for a supporting role within the company of Shrek and Donkey instead of having his own full-length feature, as even with a fairly short running time it feels padded-out. The content is tame enough to attract its target audience, but not inspired enough to spawn a new franchise. **½",,Anonymous,Animation
A kids' movie that won't bore adults,"Some movies made explicitly for children can really wear on an adult's nerves, either being too saccharine or trying to be too cool for school to appeal to those kids who think that they are, yes, too cool for school. Puss In Boots is neither of those. Instead, it's a charming little tale about the adventures of the swashbuckling feline Lothario before he met Shrek and Donkey and the rest of gang. There are a couple of gags inserted into the movie that are strictly for the grownups who've made the trek to the theater with their little ones, but overall, it moves at a quick enough pace so that the small fry won't get bored. Antonio Banderas gets to show his comedic talents as the voice of Puss, while Salma Hayek is perfect as his occasional foil/love interest Kitty Softpaws. Puss and Kitty re-unite with Puss's old chum, Humpty Dumpty (Zach Galifianakis) to retrieve Jack's mythical beans to grow that giant beanstalk of myth to find the goose that lays the golden eggs. The jokes are silly but there are more than a few memorable funny scenes, like the one involving a dance-off of sorts that's both comical and wonderfully ridiculous, for instance. It must also be noted that using the voices of Billy Bob Thornton and Amy Sedaris as the film's lead villains, Jack and Jill, was brilliant casting. Their two characters, ugly as sin, really chew the scenery and have some of the funnier lines of dialog in this flick. With all the movies coming out in droves this time of year that seem to be geared toward an older audience, it's kind of nice that this kid-friendly film is in the pack to offer families something lightweight and amusing to see. Little kids will most likely enjoy this one. Check it out.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Funny, excellent, puurrrfect fun.","Puss and his disgraced ex-pal Humpty Dumpty team back up with the help of Kitty Softpaws, a female equal of Puss to acquire the golden goose while trying to out-thwart Jack and Jill.Puss in Boots is witty fun for all the family, director Chris Miller appears to deliver far more action than the Shrek series and the more realistic Spanish like setting make it more accessible. There's sharp humour and the character play is superb with surprisingly plenty of depth. Humpy and Puss are given flashback scenes with entertaining back stories. Both lovable rouge come, hero and outlaw Puss is again wonderfully voiced by Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek gives Kitty Softpaws the perfect Latino sound. Including the likes of Guillermo del Toro, Billy Bob Thornton to name a few the other voice actors are also on fine form and the computer characters are wonderfully animated and brought to life.Like many of these computer animated features it feels 10 minutes too long, but for characterisation, feats, dance off's and double crosses its pure entertainment with plenty for the adults to enjoy as much as the children.",,Anonymous,Animation
