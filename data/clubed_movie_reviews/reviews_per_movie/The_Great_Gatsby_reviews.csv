Anachronistic soundtrack spoils an otherwise great movie,"The use of modern music (rap, EDM, etc.) that sounds nothing like the Roaring '20s is jarring. It rips you from the story, and it's hard to get back into it afterward. In some scenes, it's like watching a parody because the mismatch is flat-out laughable. Using era music for an era piece would've added a lot of character to the movie. And this movie, which I otherwise loved, deserved better.Don't get me wrong; I do like those songs, and I get why the soundtrack was a hit. They just shouldn't have crashed a movie that's set in the 1920s. The distraction they caused did nothing but damage -- lots of it.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Maybe Someday!,"Maybe it's not possible to portray one of the greatest books ever written on the silver screen. This is at least the third time and I've been really disappointed all three. Neither DiCaprio or Redford (both of whom I really like) catch the true sense of the mysterious Gatsby. At least Redford was a bit detached. His failures of the past are in his head. DiCaprio (or the script he must follow) make him seem like a giddy love soaked schoolboy. He is so obsessed as to appear weak and maudlin. Another issue, however, is with the portrayal of Nick Carraway. Tobey Maguire is just too cute. I never pictured Nick as the little boy seen here (Sam Waterston, while not perfect, at least seemed like a possibility). Again, I like Maguire in other roles, but here he seems nothing more that Gatsby's toy. He's still physically lacking as a leading man. Mostly, it just lacked a bit of pizazz. Luhrman seems to think he can do it all visually, but this is a story of lost souls, trying to recover something they can't seem to reach. It fades and fades and in the end, it's hard to care much. Also, the portrayals of Daisy and Jordan just don't seem to draw us in.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Film was good except the annoying music/soundtrack,"I like Luhrmann's take on films and soundtracks usually - but this film's strange annoying choice of music style was really off-putting. It was so mismatched like they were trying to MTV it with advertising Coke or something mainstream. Shame, would be great to see this with a soundtrack that suits the style of the storytelling/theme.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
The soundtrack made it unbearable,"Whoever decided that blaring modern pop/ hip hop music into a story of the early 20's was a good idea needs their heads examined. It not only removes you completely from the story but jolts you so far out of it that you need a few minutes to try and refocus yourself back into the story. (and that's not a knock on this genre of music, it just has no place here..)After an hour, I could stand no more, the acting and story seemed great, but the soundtrack was too much to take.So much great music was made during this time period that if used effectively could have elevated this story. Such a waste.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Good film, bad musical score","Only a poor soundtrack filled with contemporary music spoiled this latest version of The Great Gatsby for me. In a tradition of blond Gatsbys, Leonardo DiCaprio steps into the shoes of Alan Ladd and Robert Redford in essaying the part of the social climbing bootlegger from the Roaring Twenties. All that will make Jay Gatsby's life complete is the love of Daisy Buchanan whom he courted before his service in World War I. The problem is that she's slightly married to upper class Tom Buchanan. Daisy is played by Carey Mulligan and Buchanan is played by Australian player Joel Edgerton.In fact except for DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire as Nick Carraway the whole cast is mostly Australian which is to be expected since most of the production was shot there. I have to say that the Australian studio did a marvelous job in recreating New York of the Twenties and the ritzy and glamorous part of Long Island where most of the story takes place.As the book is written in the person of Nick Carraway it was also a good move to have Maguire narrate the story. Tobey's narration gives us the background of the story and Carraway's character functions as he should.Leonardo DiCaprio does a wonderful job playing the social climbing Gatsby who weaves his own legend as he gives fabled parties on Long Island where the illegal liquor flows freely. Beneath his self assurance there is a bit of a frightened edge like this is all going to be taken away from him so enjoy while you can.Perhaps the producers thought that no one would see a film with old music in it. There is some there, Gershwin's Rhapsody In Blue comes to mind. But the contemporary music on the soundtrack is jarring and out of place.But overall this is a good telling of F. Scott Fitzgerald's tale of the Roaring Twenties.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
An intriguing story re-told again with attention to mystery. 8/10,"8/10.I know a lot of the other reviewers will compare this film to the older one and also the book, so if you're interested in a comparison, stop reading here. I want to review this film as a movie that tells a story, like every other film. I don't want to review this as a film that tried to beat its preceding film adaptation.I myself have read the book and have always been so intrigued with the character of Gatsby, and when I heard a few years back that he would be portrayed on the big screen by DiCaprio, I couldn't wait. The character carries such a mystery about him that was delivered so excellently by Leonardo DiCaprio, and made it so fun to watch. It was almost like I didn't know what the ending was because I was so immersed in 1920s New York, and in the lifestyle of The Great Gatsby.The film itself, as a film, was awesome! The visuals and soundtrack were captivating and lavish. The acting was great overall, as you can trust these actors to deliver.I read somewhere on IMDb (message board or another reviewer, I can't remember) that Leonardo wasn't a good fit for the role of Gatsby. I think this statement couldn't be more wrong. If you have read the book, you must have some idea about the depth of Gatsby's character, the depth of his mind, his desires. The false smiles, the phony handshakes, the uneasiness in being in public, the way Jay Gatsby conducts himself in front of Daisy, and in pursuit of her. All these things are delivered so well by DiCaprio. His nerve, his frustration, his determination...all so eloquently portrayed. But most of all, his passion, and as Nick Carraway, our narrator so emphatically reminds us, his hope. The character development of Jay Gatsby, and the development of all those surrounding him gives us such a deep look at the relationships of such a diverse category of people.The storyline is obviously interesting: A man realizes his new neighbor is a mysterious, and incredibly wealthy man. Like how awesome is that? Throughout the whole film, as the relationships between all the few main characters become deeper and deeper, and the questions become answered, you just can't help but feel so into the characters' lives. Great writing for the characters, great directing, great great great acting.Overall, this is just a great film. If you go into the theater thinking ""oh this'll suck compared to Robert Redford"" or ""I bet the book is way better"", you're setting yourself up for a bad 143 minutes. Don't be so close minded and try to view it as just another film that tells a fictional story, and a great one at that.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Modern Music Ruined it,"OK, when I read this book, I hated the Gatsby Story. But I loved that Fitzgerald made me feel like I was in New York in the summer of 1922- the heat, the droning of fans, the smells, the ashes...Knowing that I didn't care for the story, THAT was what I wanted, to feel like I was there. I wanted to see 1922 New York, to be a part of a party in the Roaring 20's, to sweat with the characters, to feel the wind in my face during a ride in an open 20's era car...It almost did it for me... except the music. The pounding bass and the rap just ruined it for me. I wanted some amazing jazz. I wanted a real Roaring 20's party. The Rhapsody in Blue was cool, but I was already disappointed.The cast was great and the acting superb.Leonardo was impressive, maybe one of his best roles. Mulligan, breath-taking, she looked like an angel. Toby McGuire was a great choice for Carraway- who else could pull off an awkward mixture of likable guy, wallflower, and main character? They did a great job of sticking to the plot and emphasizing famous lines of the book.Overall, everything was done really well... but why couldn't we get era-appropriate music?",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Worst soundtrack ever,The sound director of this movie should never find work again.,6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Nothing exceeds like excess,"THE GREAT GATSBY There is no movie I have been more prepared to dislike than this one. How dare some Aussie come over here and tell us about the meaning of one of the great works of American literature. Especially this Aussie, Baz Luhrmann, who is known to overload, over-hype and overcook his theatrical product into a glittery miasma of small meaning and little consequence. (i.e. Moulin Rouge)But I was wrong.Jay Gatsby has achieved success in a fashion beyond most imaginations, excepting his own. In true Horatio Alger tradition he has worked hard to improve himself, but when his past creeps up on him and threatens his well crafted self image, he suavely and effortlessly changes it, his past, and he inhabits the change until it becomes the reality. He is the self made American man in every way. He is the American success myth both personified and perverted.Unlike Alger's heroes, he has not followed the straight and narrow. He has acquired his fabulous wealth through bootlegging and stock swindles.This belief, that he can change his past, to correct it as it were, has given him a veneer of respectability that has put him in good stead with his underworld connections. But it is not for them that Gatsby has made this remarkable metamorphosis. No, he did everything, and I mean everything, for the love of a woman.Daisy was Gatsby's great love, but he lost her, and now in one final herculean effort he is going to correct his past this one last time. He is going to win her back and make things as they should have been.Leo DeCaprio is the only actor of this generation that could play Gatsby, just as Robert Redford could only play Gatsby the previous generation. Redford's Gatsby seemed reticent and insecure about his past; regretful that he must live a lie in order to accomplish his goal. DeCaprio's Gatsby is forceful, decisive; he is a determined man of significant accomplishment and great ability. He has a plan and he is going to execute it and as far as he is concerned, for all the right reasons. For myself, it is DeCaprio's best and most powerful performance.This decision (both DeCaprio's and Luhrmann's) to take Gatsby down from some ethereal literary icon into a flesh and blood human being gives the movie an intensity that the 1974 version and most of the literary criticism of the book that I have ever read, never perceived. This is not a shining white knight rescuing a damsel in distress; this is a bare knuckles brawl for the hand of Daisy, and she is going to have to choose.Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton) is Gatsby's antagonist. He and Daisy were married when Daisy could no longer wait for Gatsby to prove himself worthy of her. Tom is as rich, maybe even richer than Gatsby, but his money is old, he is an aristocrat with a deep sense of entitlement. He has status and wealth because he's supposed to have status and wealth, and he's not about to give up all that, and certainly not his wife, to this new money usurper Gatsby, without a fight.Bruce Dern played Tom as a kind of loopy (Dern's specialty) racial conspiracy nut, but Edgerton gives Tom a much harder edge. When Tom espouses his vile racial philosophies one might think that someday he might actually do something about it.Daisy (Carey Mulligan) is a tough role. For all the time that Gatsby spends trying to prove he is good enough for Daisy, the audience, for the book or the film, is led down the path that she is not good enough for him. Mia Farrow played Daisy as an airhead and a dingbat, but Mulligan gives Daisy a bit more spine, and fashions a character that has a pretty good idea where her self-interests lay.Luhrmann and co-writer Craig Pearse stay pretty close to the text with a few additions and devices, most notably, to those of us who read the book, know that it is Nick Caraway (Tobey Maguire) who tells the story, and is a firsthand witness to all the events, but we never knew from where he tells the story. Luhrmann tells us it is from a sanitarium where Nick is drying out from excessive alcoholism.As for Luhrmann's reputation for excess: Well, he certainly visualizes Gatsby's parties as excess, but they are supposed to be excessive, excessive materialism is part of the point of the story. There are times when Luhrmann can't resist himself and feels the compulsion to punctuate matters with some visual flourish, but I did not find it too distracting. His decision to go 3D however, I think was wise. The characters seem to come out of the screen and get next to you. You get to know them personally, and after all this is a very personal story.I think this story has survived the test of time so well because it is basically a love story. Whatever the viewers or readers opinion of the characters are, Gatsby and Daisy do love each other, but Fitzgerald was not interested in boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl and they all live happily ever after. Where Fitzgerald reached his own aspiration of creating high art is in wondering if living happily ever after is even possible in an age of class consciousness, even class warfare, that is driven by a compulsive materialism in a world changing so fast that we can't even formulate the question before we have to come up with an answer. Luhrmann stays true to these themes and displays an avid curiosity about them himself.What he has created is a work of art that stands very well on its own.check out http://blognmovies.tumblr.com/",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""I wasn't actually in love, but I felt a sort of tender curiosity.""","I watched this film with a sort of tender curiosity.It was deliciously excessive and exaggerated, as expected from a Baz Luhrmann production. Leonardo DiCaprio made Gatsby his own (""Old spor'!"") while retaining a feeling of familiarity. The screenplay was a faithful adaptation and even helped me understand some of the novel's themes more clearly. And though you'd think hearing dubstep during the Jazz Age would be jarring, the soundtrack worked very well.But I couldn't love it. And it's (mostly) Tobey Maguire's fault.Gatsby loomed so large in the original story that it's not hard to forget all about Nick. But it can be argued, and often is, that it was Nick and not Gatsby who was the protagonist of the novel. Fitgerald's story, told from Nick's first-person point of view, was only as good as Nick's narration; Gatsby was only so great because Nick viewed him that way.Unfortunately, Maguire fell completely flat in his role as narrative guide. There was always so much else going on and so much of Luhrmann's dreamscape to absorb that Maguire seemed to get lost in it all. And — with him — so did the viewer. Without a strong presence from Maguire, Nick was relegated from having a role as interpreter of events to being just another character (and a rather unimportant one at that).Luhrmann tried to maintain Nick's narrative frame by having him tell the story — first as a patient speaking to his doctor at a sanitarium, then as a writer trying to explain his grief through prose. But those scenes came across (at best) as heavy-handed expository or (at worst) as Maguire's uninspired take on an abridged audiobook version of ""The Great Gatsby.""I wanted to love this film. I really did. It had so many wonderful qualities. But with no Nick (only a Tobey) to help make sense of the people and events, ""angry, and half in love with {it}, and tremendously sorry, I turned away.""",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Stop being pretentious and enjoy a decent film.,"After seeing this film I was more than a little disgusted to see so many negative reviews. The main problem with this film I find is in the first 20-30 minutes, a common problem I spy in Luhrman films that should by no means define an entire film. Giving away nothing the film begins at a brisk and overly flamboyant pace but after a bit it hits what I like to call ""Baz's golden point"", slows to absolute perfection. That first half hour will leave more than a few shaking their heads, but power through it and you will find The Great Gatsby in all its glory. Luhrman stays as true to the source as he can and Dicaprio gives yet another glorious performance. If I'm going to be honest I think a lot of the negative reviews coming in are due to the ""classic"" status of the book, people want to act like the hours of school discussions should make this film less fanciful and serious 100 percent of the time. Thing is we have that version twice over in the 1974 & 2000 adaption. Gatsby 2013 is beautiful, over the top, heart wrenching, and thoroughly enjoyable flick that I shall always highly recommend.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

But even though the 3rd act felt like some fresh air, it only showed that the movie could have been so much better.I would have loved a more character driven story. With more spirit and character. And more stylelized in the camp eastetic of the roaring 20's. But alas, we're left with this stinker of a movie, that draged its feet 75% of the time.

Dazzling The Tale,"The Great Gatsby tells a lot of stories and gains more themes so on. This new adaptation takes a different direction and unique scale. The experience feels familiar to other Baz Luhrmann film, which means it's quite dazzling by his fabulous style and creating an over-whimsical version of the setting. The easiest thing to say is it's fun as a Baz Luhrmann film, but it kind of glosses over the story too much. While it's generally stunning, it didn't dig deeper within the context. The Great Gatsby is fascinating enough but it could have been much grander than what it was shown on screen.The film did follow the book, it takes a lot of time exploring its setting, characters, and conflict, but explores only little on what's beneath it. The Great Gatsby actually has something more than just romance, but the film's storyline ambition mostly lies in there. The film mostly glosses at the points that suppose to provide more depth to the story which makes the possible satires of the period feels missing. But the film still has plenty of life. Beginning with the performances, Leonardo DiCaprio is definitely the kind of actor who can perfectly play the role and he did standout to be the better Gatsby than anyone else who portrayed the role. Tobey Maguire did what he usually do in movie but he is fine enough as Nick Carraway, same goes to Carey Mulligan as Daisy. Joel Edgerton steals all of his scenes by his intense performance as Tom Buchanan.The direction is spectacular however. Baz Luhrmann still perfectly uses his own style to tell the story. There are many extravagantly magnificent sequences, especially the party scenes that works amazingly even in 3D. The style really shows how ambitious this film will be and it transcends the scale which makes it wholly an interesting cinematic ride. Around with visual pleasures, there's the soundtrack and music score also keeping things groovy.It's hard to deny how enjoyable the experience is, but it could have also taken a higher perspective to the actual story. To be much fair, it did a remarkable job bringing it to the screen in a spectacular way with a cast who are very enthusiastic. While the visuals flare endlessly, the storytelling makes the overall film gripping. It's somewhat disappointing how some of its morality was left as a background even though people will say it's not necessary to take it seriously, but everyone has their own aspect on reading the book. The Great Gatsby is not as satisfying as it deserves but it manages to be incredibly eye candy and thoroughly entertaining.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""The Great Gatsby"" Review","Baz Luhrmann's ""The Great Gatsby,"" is fairly accurate to the classic novel and keeps most of its themes intact. However, Luhrmann's own flair adds a new dimension to the story. Visually this film is incredibly stunning. From grand sets to the detailed period dresses, this film is a treat for the eyes. Never once does it not take your breath away from its impressive scenery. Many people might be worried about the updated music, but there is nothing to fear. Jay-Z's track works incredible well with the film and complements the era in which it is set.The direction in this film is impeccable. The cinematography is marvelous and really lets the viewer absorb the sheer artistry that has gone into making this film. Luhrmann keeps a high level of energy throughout the film and the party sequences are choreographed and edited in a way that it makes you feel envious of not being apart of it. Editing in the film is seamless and really keeps the viewer engaged. A common criticism the film receives is that it is more style than substance, however, I must disagree. This modern interpretation doesn't forget its themes and morals from the classic F. Scott Fitzgerald tale.Performances are phenomenal by the entire cast. Carey Mulligan's Daisy is every bit as careless as one would expect, but she also manages to show some complexity in her role. Tobey Maguire is a great avatar for us to take on as we enter this film. He is very much the viewer as he sees everything happening, but is ultimately helpless to change anything. The true standouts in the film are Joel Edgerton and Leonardo DiCaprio. Edgerton as Tom Buchanan brings a lot of personality to his character that I thought was absent in the book. He's a bit more tender and more vulnerable, especially when he finds out his wife's secret. The true award recognition worthy performance comes from DiCaprio's Gatsby. He hones on being a respectable, but idealistically insane man. His performance is not only compelling, but also charming and quit hopeful. He truly deserves some recognition come Oscar season.Overall, ""The Great Gatsby"" is a fantastically entertaining and enthralling film. It is horribly underrated as it is filled with awards worthy visuals, sets, costumes, direction, and performances. It is a great time at the movies for anyone that enjoys the classic novel or who haven't even heard of it. Not only is this film dramatically satisfying, but also quite humorous and a spectacle like no other. I give it 4.5/5, a great adaptation of one of the greatest novels ever written.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Moulin Rouge in the 20s,"Watching Gatsby, one gets the impression that Baz wanted to remake Moulin Rouge! In 3D and couldn't find a good way to retrofit it, so made a non-musical story on similar themes, using some of the exact same camera shots. However, the movie is not as gaudy or over-the-top as I fear/hoped it would be. But it does feature cartoonish elements that distract from the seriousness of the overall story.The first point are the performances. Often, when modern actors try to imitate old fashioned acting styles, they fail miserably. Often this is the case with actresses doing mannered/expressive acting common in the 30s and 40s. However, the actresses in this movie do a better job than the actors. The only flaw is that some characters, especially Daisy (who really is a shallow and symbolic character) are presented with much greater depth than they were meant to possess. Meanwhile, Tobey Maguire gives a performance so mawkishly earnest and cornball, he's sometimes like something out of a Capra movie. Leo DiCaprio looks better than he has lately in a Redford-esque role, but his accent is all over the place (could it be that he's a self made invention or just can't master an accent? We don't know). His pronunciation of ""Old Sport"" is jarring. And while the movie keeps telling us he has charisma, he does not project enough of it. Joel Edgerton, as Tom, is giving a performance as a type of man seldom seen in modern movies and does his level best, but we are never quite sure what to make of him. He seems at turns goofy, villainous and sympathetic. The scenes of Tobey and Leo together highlight the sublimated homoerotic tension many people have discerned in the book. It's almost like they're picking up where they left off with their quasi romance in This Boy's Life.Secondly, overwhelming all else is the camera-work and atmosphere. The 3D is occasionally distracting, but also brilliant in bringing out small details, like the exquisite sets and costuming and tiny elements like confetti or pearls. The photography can also overwhelm the Moulin Rouge! party scenes and make certain elements look cartoonish (when you see people hanging out of cars it's reminiscent of the weasels in Who Framed Roger Rabbit?). I would not have wanted to see this movie in 2D, or certainly not on the small screen, because of the visual treats I might miss. I'm not sure it would be a different movie entirely. The incorporation of modern music is not overly distracting, and done in a similar way to Marie Antoinette, with modern music simply played over a period scene with period dances. I wouldn't say that any particular song is moving or evocative enough to rise to the level of great uses of song in romantic films, but it's also not terribly distracting. The use of rap music does highlight gaudiness and false showy glamor, as opposed to stately tasteful wealth. And in a sense, Jay Gatsby does represent this factor, so it sort of works.The adaptation of the book seems fairly reverent in every regard except what I have mentioned about modern music and crazy camera work.It was hard to get a read off the preview audience, and I think this movie will be divisive. In the 70s, they did a big budget version of Great Gatsby, trying to make it the new Gone With the Wind, and it failed. Here, a 100+ million effort at combining Titanic and Moulin Rouge! could also be an Ishtar level disaster. On the other hand, I think when you get sucked into the world of the film, it really works. And as in Moulin Rouge!, repeated viewings might take some of the shock out of cartoony or jarring elements and bring out the human, small touches that really won me over.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Loved it!,"For the record, I've read Gatsby at least every other year since I was 17, so, believe me when I say I have been counting down the days and minutes until the new movie opened.Here it goes then, I saw Gatsby last night and......absolutely loved it! In retrospect (as in halfway through the movie), it just clicked, Leonardo was perfect. He wasn't Redford, but in my humble opinion, better! He nailed it, portraying Gatsby as this truly multi-dimensional character. At first, we're introduced to Gatsby, the well-rehearsed old sport telling his canned story about studying at Oxford, Montenegro medals, etc. etc., but then slowly that forced veneer peels away, and he gives us this angsty, desperate, so-happy-in-love, we can remake the past, tortured soul. Much, much better than Redford. And, the same goes with Daisy. Mia Farrow's Daisy was all flighty and light as a feather, pretty pathetic and self-absorbed, you wonder, what's the big deal with this woman who everyone loves....but with Carey Mulligan, you get it. The scenes of the two of them as young lovers explain it all. Finally, Tobey McGuire....I love him as Peter Parker, Homer Wells and now Nick Carraway. I thought the idea of having him author Gatsby from a hospital was very clever, allowed him to read long passages directly from the book. As for Jay-Z et al., I really didn't mind it, as far as I was concerned, it didn't distract and certainly worked to illuminate the frenetic energy of the 20's. Please, give it another try, see it again. From my experience, a Baz Luhrmann movie is always better the second time around (Moulin Rogue).",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Gatsby As You've Never Seen It Before-- A Must See!,"A remake of a remake of a remake of a novel that pretty much every high school in America includes in its curriculum is not an easy legacy, but I think Baz Luhrmann does a fantastic job of tackling the material. His somewhat flashy, story-driven methods give the novel life in a way that's never been seen before. I'm not going to compare it to the other remakes, because that feels redundant and pointless, but insofar as the book goes, it was a great adaptation. The director stuck close to the author's intent and really got the audience invested in these characters. The cast gave a great performance, with Mulligan and Clarke going above and beyond. Maguire, as usual, is unintentionally comedic in some of his expressions, but as someone who is not a fan, I thought he did pretty well. The sets, costumes, music...everything was flashy and exuberant and perfectly matched the mood of the movie.I know a lot of people are complaining about the soundtrack, but that was one of my favorite things about the film. Luhrmann didn't even try to stay period appropriate, because The Great Gatsby is a novel that transcends the time it was placed in. By using contemporary artists, he was able to effectively position the film in the audience's mind as something they could relate to. To borrow and roughly paraphrase a quote from the book/movie, the soundtrack invited them within, even as they were without. I'll admit, he made a few missteps where the music just flat-out took the viewer out of the movie entirely (a certain Jay-Z number comes to mind), but overall, it was a brilliant directing choice.I'll also say that the movie ran a bit long, with certain parts feeling overdone and unnecessary. I watched it in 3D, which I would not recommend unless you really, really love 3D. The movie is visually stunning and does not need the added dimension; in fact, I'd go so far as to say it hurts the tone of the film. That said, it was a great film and I would definitely recommend it.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Leonardo as Gatsby in real life.,"I have always looked in those deep, intense, passionate blue eyes and wondered what would that man be like in real life? Perhaps he wanted to answer that question for all those out there like me, so be became the Great Gatsby of F.Scott Fitzgerald. Or perhaps he loves mysterious characters. And that's saying a lot, because it defined his entire life.Obviously I thought something was intensely defining, daring yet also silently questionable about Leonardo when he appeared in 'what's eating Gilbert Grape' as a perfect actor. But then he did more than amaze the world in Titanic. Then something happened as 2000 began, beginning of the new millennium in your lifetime or something, he began endless series of what seemed like chapters of shutter island all the way;Gangs of New York, Blood diamond, Revolutionary road, Inception, J.Edgar, Django unchained, Great Gatsby of course, and now post production is 'The wolf of wall street'.I mean, what could be 'wrong' with the most celebrated actor of the century? Fame could be what happened but I maybe just blabbering.So what is The great Gatsby like; it's like perfect illusion, perfect acting, directing and it does justice to the story. But I am the kind of person who just can't help imagining what would be behind the screen, it's just irresistible; how would Leonardo relate to Gatsby while acting, or how would Tobey Maguire to Nick, or Adelaide Clemens to Daisy. I loved the way Adelaide said it, as if she could be this girl in real life; 'That's the best a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool'. How honest that sounded, as if she understood the character. But I couldn't help notice that something about this movie didn't seem to make it look complete, it had a missing part, or I guess too much in it, or perhaps imperfect lines, or the music, something seem to be missing. But maybe again, maybe that was what it was supposed to be like, for every Leonardo's movie, there is something that leaves people wondering about the answers, or perhaps about the real questions. I love this guy though, I love his work. And yes, it is Amitabh Bachchan the Bollywood actor, HATE him, I do, but yeah, Leonardo seemed to get well along with him, who am I to blame, it tuned out to be a good movie. For those who are wondering why such low rating for a Leonardo's film, let me tell you people, it's something with the rating and the romance movies, they seem to reciprocate each other.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
'Gatsby' proves not as great as classic novel,"There comes a time in a director's career when he or she may face one of the seemingly impossible cinematic feats: to make the movie better than the book.Director Baz Luhrmann accepted this challenge when he signed on to direct a new theatrical take of ""The Great Gatsby."" F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel is considered an American literary classic, a staple in high school English courses. To tamper with greatness could spell disaster for the film and disappoint fans. With this in mind, Luhrmann took the details that made the novel so successful and generously applied them to his film.The result? Beautiful visuals, awkward editing and overblown symbolism.The adaptation is narrated by Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire), who recounts his adventures on Long Island to a doctor while at a sanatorium. Using word-for-word passages from the novel, Carraway describes his move to New York to try his hand in the bond business. There, he reconnects with his cousin, Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan) and learns his next-door neighbor is none other than Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio), the secretive millionaire known for his lavish parties and fantastical reputation. Little does Carraway know that Gatsby acts this way in hopes of winning back Daisy's love despite five years of separation and her marriage to another man.Hoping to live up to its hype, the movie tries to be as fantastic and flawless as Gatsby himself. Servants open doors and move about the house like choreographed dancers. The grand landscapes of New York City and Gatsby's estate look pristine. And the parties are a flapper's dream, with the vibrant outfits and music for dancing (although the occasional rap songs seemed a bit out of place).Unfortunately, the flawlessness stops with the visuals. Reminiscent of ""Moulin Rouge,"" Luhrmann's excessive cuts put cinematic emphasis in all the wrong places. The opening scenes fly by with exaggerated zooming and cutaways that disturb the flow of the script. Yet during the climactic standoff between Gatsby and Daisy's husband, the camera comes to a virtual standstill. Without the dialogue, it would appear no different from any other scene.The film was also keen to draw on, and overemphasize, some of the novel's best traits. Carraway speaks Fitzgerald's words like poetry, which fans of the book will appreciate. Yet seeing them additionally written on the screen is distracting and unnecessary, no matter how artistic the font is. Likewise, the symbolisms that added such value to the novel do not translate as well on screen. We can only see the green light so many times before its significance starts to fade.Luckily, the lead performances keep the plot comprehensible even when the camera is having a spaz attack. Few (if any) actors would be better suited as the suave, slightly obsessed Gatsby than DiCaprio. He and Maguire enliven the unlikely relationship between Gatsby and Carraway with their occasional comic relief and intimate conversations. Mulligan also gives a strong portrayal of Daisy and her struggle to choose between Gatsby and her husband.There is potential for the film to be marginally close to par with the novel. Unfortunately, it gets lost in the pomp of Luhrmann's chaotic editing, which proves what literary purists have been saying all along: Only the book can put the ""great"" in ""The Great Gatsby.""Stars: *** ½ (out of 5)Read more: http://www.973radionow.com",,Anonymous,Romance
Just saying my opinion.,This movie is great. The characters fit so well and the scenes are always leaving a good taste in the watchers mouth. Architecture is also very good ... With Gatsby's castle and Tom's mansion also Nick's little house is very nice. What I can say more about this movie is that it has a great story behind and it will always be re-watchable.,8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Classic novel retold... and it works,"Having finally got round to reading 'The Great Gatsby' (and enjoying it immensely) I was looking forward to seeing this most recent film adaptation. And I'm glad I did.There are problems with it, my main one being the choice to cast Tobey Maguire as the narrator (or to cast Tobey Maguire at all... in anything) but even that I got over after about half an hour when it became clear he wasn't going to take up too much screen time.What makes the original novella truly stand out is the beauty of the language used and the construction of truly perceptive, insightful imagery regarding human nature, and I think that is captured well for the most part. Granted, you do have to sit through the typical Baz Luhrmann epileptic colour schemes and 2 second shots but this, like the Maguire problem, also wears off after the first act, once Gatsby and the context are established and it slows down to explore the characters.Leonardo Di Caprio and Carey Mulligan (fairly obvious age gap aside) do a great job as the romantic leads. In fact the parts are played so well I started reconsidering some of the evaluations I had made of the characters whilst reading the novel, which is pretty impressive and unusual for a movie adaptation.So it's a strong 8. At times style over substance, and you have to suffer through some Tobey Maguire, but otherwise a very well measured interpretation of F Scott Fitzgerald's classic.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Sizzle without the Steak,"Another iteration of The Great Gatsby. Another miss. I've never read the book. Apparently, it's one of the ""Great"" American novels. That may be, but it seems impossible to translate the material of the book into a truly awesome film. And if this attempt can't do it, then I believe it's just not in the cards. The plot is boring. It just is. I was surprised to see that Mad Men totally ripped off Don Draper's background with that of Jay Gatsby? Although, I now think less of Mad Men. This movie ONLY gets a 7 because everything besides the story/plot of the movie is boss af. Everything. Baz Luhrman is a new iteration of Terry Gilliam. His movies have a flair for the extravagant and audacious. So it's fitting that he's the director, because he truly did everything he could to pull people into terribly banal source material. Cinematography... boom! Soundtrack... boom! An all star cast again(like Luhrman), did what they could. I mean, DiCaprio is soo G he raises the movie grade up a star by himself. Perfect personification of Jay Gatsby. Although it isn't exactly a tough task to make the party scene of high society socialites in the Roaring 20's look super cool. Also, the movie was just too long. My god. Overall, you'll probably end up saying: ""It was pretty good?"" Finding a few things in particular you liked. I'd still say check it out. If for no other reason, than to see that baller DiCaprio cheers made famous by countless memes lol.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
An absorbing and entertaining tour de force of artistry and film making that succeeds on many levels.,"For a while yesterday I'd been wondering whether or not to postpone going to see The Great Gatsby, tempted as I was by the significant amounts of blue sky and sunshine outside. Once the film started, and for the next two hours and twenty something minutes, my thoughts never once strayed to the weather outside. Within minutes of the start I, like Nick Carraway (the film's narrator), was being drawn into the sumptuously glamorous world of 1920's New York high society. The film making is simply astounding. At times the screen seemed filled from corner to corner with both elegance and frivolity. This is, however, a film that's most certainly not 'all visual spectacle' though. Several of the film's main characters were developed in sufficient detail to allow me to form meaningful opinions about them. Without wishing to give away too much, I found The Great Gatsby to have elements of a love story, a tragedy and (last but not least) a critique of a way of life having strong parallels with what is happening (in certain sections of society) in present times. Acting and cinematography are top notch. The 3D is cool. Some of my favourite actors and actresses are in it (DeCaprio, Isla Fisher) as well as some new ones I was impressed by (Elizabeth Debicki). Oh, and did I mention the music? I was the last person out of the auditorium. I simply had to stay and listen 'til the very end of the credits just to hear as much as possible of the amazing musical score. (Make sure you stay for Sia Furler singing Kill and Run at the very end of the credits.) OK. I think I've prattled on enough. I loved it and can't wait to see it again before it ends its run. Films don't come better than this (at least for me that is).",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Yikes!,"One wonders what English Teachers across the Country are saying to their Students when confronted with the inevitable...So Miss. So and So what did you think of the new Movie? How do they side-step that one.

"An artful film where artifice replaces emotion, highly refined stuff","The Great Gatsby (2013)Unlike both ""Moulin Rouge"" and ""Romeo & Juliet,"" two amazing movies with literary roots, Baz Luhrman's ""The Great Gatsby"" does not quite let go of reality. The effects and the general visual license throughout are in service to a very literal love story, which rules the movie.This might be what is best, but it means there is no release into this other world of Luhrman's fancy, which is the real joy (and astonishment) of the other two movies. Instead there is an utterly crystalline attention to light and detail. And to scenes that are themselves over the top and are merely filmed with ordinary brilliance. This is Luhrmann the stage director set loose, and for theatrical excess some of the party scenes are pretty wonderful, recalling (for some reason) the crazy party scenes in DeMille's ""Madame Satan"" (shot back in 1930). But then, DeMille and Luhrmann are both about spectacle.I'm not sure the story, which is the heart of this, survives it all. The plastic falseness of the approach (the color and light and camera as well as the sets themselves) gets in the way of the drama, the very human and very 1920s American drama. Leonardo DiCaprio is excellent, though not what I'd call transcendent, which is unfortunately what the role needs. Jay Gatsby is nothing if not a mysterious and highly idealistic man caught up in old fashioned ways. His sidekick and narrator is played by Tobey Maguire, and I usually like him a lot but here he is so detached from the action, as if playing the narrator physically, he ends up adding to the plasticity rather than the human depths of the story.Third in line is certainly the woman who has Gatsby's attention (and obsession), played by Carrie Mulligan with some deliberate force. She, also, is very good but falls into the idea of the story more than the emotional expression of it. Some of the more minor characters add to this general array of true ""characters"" as if they are types, or as if they are actors playing roles.In fact, this intentional stylizing of every part into a kind of presentation of ideas, told with visual fireworks, is the point. For some people it might sit perfectly on the cusp of art film and naturalistic drama. If things got pushed into even further stylizing we'd have a piece of art on our hands, and it might have a smaller but more fervid audience. I think it might have tipped further to an old school Hollywood drama with characters who rip your heart out and close-ups that make you weep. That, however, is not possible with so much artifice center stage.So we have an ambitious, beautiful, curious movie. I wish Luhrmann could say, aloud, what he felt he didn't quite get the way he wanted. He has admitted that filming the movie was no fun at all, and I can imagine the work and attention to detail it would require. It's worth seeing if you like movie-making, or like Luhrmann's other movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Just barely saved by the acting,"Whew!I have not read The Great Gatsby or seen the previous film but the first 30-45 minutes of this movie for me was nearly unwatchable.I kept turning to my significant-other and saying ""WHY DO THEY KEEP CUTTING AWAY FROM STORY TO BAD CGI AND TERRIBLE MODERN MUSIC?!?!""Shortly after the first real Gatsby party this terrible style of blending modern music poorly into period pieces with horrific CGI is drawn back a bit. When the actors take-over from the ridiculous direction, music and effects the movie hums along quite nicely.It's not the best tragedy ever but it's fine and I felt DiCaprio and Edgerton were both great and carried the narrative with a nod to.All in all if you could find someone to edit the first 45 minutes and change the score the movie would have been far better. Probably could have cut 30 minutes all together quite easily.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

You could feel the lost love between them and their desire to be together. The emotions were felt on an almost personal level for me. The character of Tom was exactly who you wanted him to be.

A dazzling and depressing tale,"""The Great Gatsby"" by F. Scott Fitzgerald is considered one of the best American novels of all time. Its themes of love, loss, obsession, friendship, greed and social status has made it a timeless classic, but the previous film adaptations have all been considered poor attempts at capturing the complexity of the novel. Baz Luhrmann's new version has also received its fair share of criticism, but in my opinion almost all of the complaints are unwarranted. Because this movie is nothing short of a masterpiece.The movie tells the story of how Nick Carraway gets acquainted with his neighbor in West Egg, Long Island; the mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby. Opposite the bay lives Nick's socialite cousin Daisy Buchanan with her husband Tom. Soon Nick finds out that Gatsby and Daisy used to know each other when they were younger, and that their relationship is far from over.The first half of the movie is a bit duller than the second and makes the movie seem shallower than it really is. Many of the criticisms the movie has gotten has been that the director has prioritized style over substance. But while the movie indeed is beautiful (more on that later) it is also complex and emotional, and from when the movie picks up (I'd say this is when Gatsby and Daisy first meet at Nick's tea party) and onwards it's a near-perfect film. Stand-out scenes include the tour of Gatsby's house, the flashbacks to his youth, the confrontation between him and Tom in New York and the final pool scene.No other actor could have portrayed the elusive Jay Gatsby as well as Leonardo DiCaprio. Every single one of his personality traits, from the romantic idealism to the self-doubt, is apparent in his amazing but subtle performance. He is the core of the movie and all scenes without him feel lacking. Carey Mulligan's daisy is a more complicated performance to judge. On one hand she truly is lovely and the audience immediately sees why Gatsby is in love with her. But at the end of the day Daisy is such an unlikeable character that not even Mulligan's natural likability can make the audience sympathize with her. Joel Edgerton as her husband is, on the other hand, pure perfection. His menacing but nuanced portrayal of Tom is second only to DiCaprio in terms of skill. The worst casting in the film is Tobey Maguire as the narrator Nick. He is wooden, uninteresting and has no chemistry with Elizabeth Debicki(who plays his love interest Jordan). Only in scenes with Gatsby is Nick an even vaguely interesting character, and this is undoubtedly due to the fact that DiCaprio is strong enough to carry both of them.Ever since I read the novel I have been aware of the depressing message that the story conveys. But while both the novel and the 70's film version are sad, they aren't even half as heart-breaking as this movie. Many will relate to the story of Gatsby, a man desperate to"" fix things just the way they were"" and realize with him that it just isn't possible. It's a gloomy realization but a good one nevertheless. Yong people especially will benefit from understanding that no matter how hard you work for something there is no guarantee that you will get it. But all of the messages in the story aren't depressing. One can also relate to the ""extraordinary sense of hope"" that Nick describes Gatsby as having and see him as an inspiration to never give up.Visually the movie is impressive. The costumes, sets and special effects are dazzling, and since the soundtrack is modernized it was a smart move by Luhrmann and production/costume designer Catherine Martin to keep the rest of the film period-accurate. The 3D-effects however are pretty but forgettable and add nothing to the movie. Just like everybody else I was skeptical when I heard that Luhrmann had hired Jay-Z to helm the soundtrack and meant to include hip-hop and rap music. My suspicions turned out to be completely unnecessary. The modern music works very well (especially during the party scenes) and doesn't even include many hip-hop tracks. Variations of Lana del Rey's ""Young and Beautiful"" is used as a ""love theme"" for Gatsby and Daisy and I wouldn't be surprised if the stunning track get an Oscar nomination for ""Best Original Song"". The soundtrack is actually one of the main reasons that the movie feels current and inspiring in contrast to the at times dated novel.So no matter what critics have said I think ""the Great Gatsby"" is an amazing film. It tells the interesting and important story just as well as the novel, but Luhrmann has added even more glamour and excitement with his visually creative choices. That makes it not only a satisfactory adaptation of the classic novel but a completely fantastic film. Beautiful, emotional, well-acted, unique and thought-provoking it truly is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Luhrmann comes through!,"Baz Luhrmann's visuals are amazing as usual. Of course the story is compelling being based on such a popular book. The acting is also done very well. DiCaprio's Gatsby is perfect in displaying the true nature and complexities of the character. It all comes together in a truly great adaptation.By the end of the film you realize why so many people have loved the book (myself included). However, it's Luhrmann's visual style and storytelling ability that bring the classic to life on film. It is an absolutely beautiful film from start to finish.The quick pace at the beginning of the film is mildly jarring and that is somewhat typical for Luhrmann's more eclectic films. I also think that is somewhat the point of those scenes. While some may see this as a mistake I also can't help thinking that the indulgence is intentional as it relates to the ideas and themes of the book.This one is definitely worth seeing in the theater. I don't think you should see it in 3D but I don't really think you should see anything in 3D. It's a brilliant film. Bringing Fitzgerald's Gatsby to the screen is an incredibly difficult task. Luhrmann not only accomplishes that but he does it with a style and flair that add to the story and present it in a unique way. That's the reason you go see an adaptation. The more I think about it the more I like it. That's the mark of a great film.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"actually, it's pretty good","I never liked the book or the other Gatsby films I've seen, and after all the negative reviews I thought I wouldn't enjoy this movie.But I did. The cinematography, elaborate visuals, set design, costumes, all bring the story to life in a way I was never quite able to imagine before. The yellow car was sublime, and the billboard with the eyes - in the book somehow I never was able to picture that and this film actually helped me understand the geography of the story better, in the drive between Long Island and Manhattan. The film is faithful to the original story. The editing was nicely done; I didn't feel that the film wasted time or dropped the ball with the story. Acting was fantastic from absolutely everyone, I loved Leonardo DiCaprio and Joel Edgerton. I didn't expect to feel sorry for Tom and somehow I did at one point. I was worried about the music after hearing the reviews but should have known better. Baz Luhrmann knows what he is doing. It was modern enough to be relatable but still connected to the older time - loved the Gershwin, very nice touch. But Nick Carraway stuck with me the most, after the film was over - excellent job by Toby McGuire and the writers. Nick is both a voyeur and a participant in the story - both outside and inside. The film really made that clear to me. I'll be thinking about Nick for a while, and what he could have/should have done differently, and how this story changed his life.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Takes a while to settle in, but good overall","This telling of The Great Gastsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald is, overall, a solid outing.I wondered if it would be as the story began, however. The first part of the movie comes off a little cartoonish and over the top. Yes, I know Gatsby's parties in and of themselves were over the top, but this portrayal of it bordered on caricature several times. There may have been a little too much pushing the wildness of the scene without letting the scene tell its own story. Yes, caricature is the best word to describe how it was done.Eventually, however, the movie settles nicely into the story, and the caricature is left behind.From a literary point of view, I think much of Fitzgerald's poetic descriptiveness and sarcastic humor are missing. The movie doesn't have the same beauty as the straight words of Fitzgerald, but, once again, it slowly emerges over the course of the film. By the end, it is there... beautifully.Now, for the seemingly controversial use of modern music in a period piece. As soundtrack and music that frames scenes, the modern music worked well. It was not distracting and served well for setting the mood. When music was part of the actual scene, however (a band playing a party, for example), the modern music was distracting. To see trumpets, trombones, and a drum set at a 20s party while hearing hip-hop is a big disconnect. But, this is confined to the early parts where I felt everything was a bit cartoonish anyway.Some points of the original novel are left out, but in terms of making a movie, they were not missed. Overall, it stuck to the book well.If you are like me, you'll sit through the first part of the movie thinking, ""Uh oh, they really goofed this one up."" But after a while, you'll see the beauty and true story emerge and be pretty happy with it by the end.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Worth a second watch...,"I teach 11th grade literature. My students read ""The Great Gatsby"" earlier this semester and their verdict was a very unenthusiastic ""it's okay."" Now this absolutely horrified me, as I am a huge Fitzgerald fan and completely in love with the novel. So I thought that maybe if the students saw a visual representation of the novel, they would come to appreciate this beautiful tale.Now, I had watched the 1974 Redford version and really liked it. However, it's a little long and a little boring to show to a group of 17 year olds. So I decided to give this film a try.I bought the film and watched it at home with my husband (I wanted to make sure it was appropriate to show my kids). I have to admit, the first time I watched it, I wasn't blown away. I found it intriguing....but not great. I decided, however, that I might as well let them see it since I had paid 10 bucks for it.It would be an understatement to say that my students LOVED it! They loved the sets, the music and, of course, the girls went crazy for Leonardo DiCaprio Moreover, for the first time ALL YEAR they were able to intelligently discuss character motivations, tone, mood, theme, symbols and literary devices...and not just from the film... they actually insisted that we go back and re-read sections in the book! And they were so thrilled to see much of the same language in both the book and this film. Because of this film, my students were able to appreciate a classic piece of American literature! As for me, this movie definitely got better the more I watched it. It is visually stunning, and surprisingly loyal to the book. DiCaprio gives a beautiful portrayal of Gatsby-- I'd say even better than Redford (and I love him)!Give this film a second chance, or maybe even a third. It's worth it!",,Anonymous,Romance
A mixed bag,"Attempting to adapt a literary classic like F. Scott Fitzgerald's ""The Great Gatsby"" to the screen is always a tricky proposition. Just ask the makers of the 1974 version who got their rear ends handed to them for their efforts - by both critics and audiences alike. The risk, of course, is that devotees of the work will balk at any attempt to expand or modernize it beyond what is contained on the printed page. After all, great works of literature exist primarily in the individual's imagination, and the way one reader envisions a particular scene or character is likely NOT how another reader - or filmmaker - sees them. The result is that literary adaptations all too often turn into stuffy affairs, with movie makers taking the safest possible approach to the material in an attempt not to offend anyone while still trying to make the piece work in an entirely different medium.All of this is prelude to saying that when it comes to Baz Luhrmann's adaptation of ""The Great Gatsby,"" regardless of how one feels about the final product, one has to at least admire the chutzpah of the effort. (His trumped-up modernized version of ""Romeo and Juliet"" similarly divided audiences in the 1990s).A high school English class staple if ever there was one, the highly prescient ""Gatsby,"" published in 1925, is often considered to be THE archetypal novel of the Roaring '20s, focused on the party-like decadence, conspicuous consumption and spiritual emptiness of a decade sandwiched between a Great War on one end and a Great Depression on the other. At the center of the piece stands Jay Gatsby himself, the self-made millionaire who achieves the American Dream through a combination of dreamy-eyed determination and corrupt opportunism (with much of his wealth gleaned through bootlegging and gangsterism). Yet, for all the wealth and material possessions he's managed to accrue for himself, Gatsby (Leonardo Di Caprio) can never find true happiness until he re-connects with the girl of his dreams, Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan), an alluring Southern-belle he fell in love with while still a penniless officer in the army. In the five years since their last encounter, Daisy, who is willing to go a certain distance with a fantasy romance until the going gets too tough for her, has gone on to marry the brutish womanizer Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton). Gatsby, in that same period, has bought a mansion across the bay from Daisy's house, hoping against hope that she will one day wander into one of his parties and that they will be able to rekindle their love as if nothing had happened in the interim. It is to this end that he befriends his next door neighbor, Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire), a naïve bondsman from the Midwest, who's moved to New York to make his fortune on Wall Street and who also happens to be Daisy's cousin. It is Nick who narrates the tale (in this version from a sanitarium after suffering a mental breakdown from the trauma of the events he's witnessed), claiming to be an objective observer of what's going on around him, but in reality casting moral judgments on the people he encounters all along the way.It's easy to understand why the filmmaker was drawn to the material in the first place. With its wild parties and overall air of carefree abandon, the era practically screams out for the Baz Luhrmann treatment. But does the novel? I'm not so sure. The problem is that ""The Great Gatsby"" is about so much more than just unrestrained partying, and the director (along with his co-writer Craig Rearce) often seems oblivious to that fact. Luhrmann typically drenches his film in all sorts of visual razzmatazz, but the result is that the movie is so over-stylized that the characters are all too often reduced to caricatures and the whole thing to the level of a cartoon. The parties themselves become out-of-control orgies as seen through the lens of Simon Duggan's hurdy-gurdy, hyper-kinetic camera. Meanwhile most of Fitzgerald's nuance and subtlety are wiped away in the phantasmagoria. A case in point is the first appearance of Gatsby in the story. In the novel he literally sneaks up on Nick - and us - as just another anonymous and inconspicuous party guest who engages Nick in conversation. In the movie, his entrance is greeted with a literal display of pyrotechnics. The stylization extends to the décor as well, which often reflects ""Alice in Wonderland"" more than 1920s Long Island. Nick looks like he lives in an enchanted forest attached to Gatsby's mansion, which has more turrets than Blahousie Castle and manicured grounds that would put the Palace of Versaille to shame.Viewed another way, however, Luhrmann's approach seems to make a certain amount of sense. The grandiose, over-the-top theatricality, and stiff, yet, at the same time, over-emotive acting are aptly reflective of the silent movies of that era. It's hard to actually evaluate the performances since the actors have clearly been instructed to ham it up as much as possible (especially Edgerton). At times, they come across as little kids engaged in dress-up and playacting. But in the context of this particular film, is that necessarily a bad thing? (I will say that Robert Redford cut a more impressive figure as Gatsby than Di Caprio does here).And there's one other thing that can be added to the movie's win column: its overall manic energy, which seems a direct attempt to avoid at all costs replicating the mistakes of the heavy, inert 1974 version.Luhrmann knows that he is treading on sacred ground here and he clearly doesn't care. He's going to give us ""The Great Gatsby"" as HE envisions it and to hell with the rest of us. In this age of artistic timidity and over-cautious commercial calculation, that attitude turns out to be both admirable and refreshing when you come to think of it.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

I can't imagine any other actor ,at least at this day, who could portray Jay Gatsby as Di Caprio did. This elegance and charm he clearly possesses just make him ideal for the part. Mulligan is a little bit indifferent but you can't say she is not playing well. Maguire is also great , even if the idea of telling his story to a psychiatrist seems a little out of the spirit of the film. But there is high drama in this film especially at the end. You must not miss this one. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
I don't care what anyone says,"No, no, no, no, no. I wanted to love it..... scratch that I did love it uh i'm so confused. Let me elaborate, You see ""old sport"" I went to watch this movie rather later than the rest of my peers. So I kept hearing how it wasn't as good as it could have been and how Tobey Maguire mutilated his character and gave a weasel performance. So then there I was, watching it with all these negative views already imprinted in my brain. I personally haven't read the novel, or seen the original (don't shun me I'm relatively young) but there's been only raving reviews. So this was a fresh story for me and desperately trying to neglect anything I was previously told. I have to say, I did love it. Tobey Maguire did play a spineless Jesse bell and was rather insipid at times but I felt that he was only our intermediary for Gatsby so I wasn't really all that bothered that his performance didn't blow me away. Leo gave me exactly what I needed from him, he can play any charismatic character and have the audience fixated on him for the rest of the movie. It's nature Vs nurture and you cannot teach charisma to anyone, they must be born with it. I had an immense feeling of exuberance anytime he was on screen. And I have to admit I've never rooted for anyone to prevail as much in my entire movie watching life until Gatsby. I suppose I'll give the others a mention too Joel Edgerton(the warrior) gave a mentionable performance playing the arrogant, pompous ass Tom Buchannan. I think it's his face he's got a long career ahead of him playing the antagonist... I despised his character in the warrior(ALL THOSE WINS BY TAP OUT). Carrey Mulligan(Daisy Buchannan) also gave a very endearing performance she leads us to believe she is as delicate as a flower, only to find out that the flower is the most poisonous of all flowers and will draw you in and suck the life from you. Isla fisher was okay, she had sex appeal.If you scrape away at the superficial facade of wealth and the fête in the story you will find the real profound meaning to this tale that Women and Money are evil.Both known to extremely cloud your judgement. The great Gatsby is a unique love story and open to many interpretations. Watching this movie, It was the first time that I had noticed that the upper class are actually being slated at every opportunity. I have no problem with it I just wonder if they are really that shallow and conceded. If not it must be hard being a multi millionaire with an established family name... my condolences. Last but not least I wish to commend Baz Luhrmann I don't think he's been given enough credit(everyone saying his movie is mediocre) for really capturing the glitz and glamour side of that era. From the automobiles to the illegal backroom drinking and from the beautiful mistresses to the extravagant parties it was all quite remarkable. Excellent story I loved it",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A flawed, but visually beautiful film if you give it a chance","I'm not exactly a fan of Baz Luhrmann and I have yet to read the book, but after seeing the trailers for this upcoming film, I went to see it with my siblings and my sister's friend yesterday in 3D. Later, when it ended, we walked out with smiles on our faces because I think this is a beautiful film. It does have some problems here and there that I will explain in a moment, but despite the mixed reception it received, I think this is a good film if you give it a chance.Like I said before, I have yet to read the book, but while it does have some nice moments and it is faithful to F. Scott Fitzgerald's vivid writing, it does sacrifice the heart which is the reason why it got such hatred from the critics. It's also a little bit long and it does drag a bit long; on top of that, I felt like there was too much rap music throughout the film aside from a nice music score from Craig Armstrong.Flaws aside, everything else is perfect. The direction from Baz Luhrmann is tolerable enough and it does have a lot of focus while adding some atmosphere. The dialog is smart and refreshing, the visuals and scenery of New York and Gatsby's house is so beautiful to look at especially in 3D which I think kind of works. The costumes designs and make-up is excellent and the 1920's setting is nicely detailed, but the strongest aspect would have to go to a solid cast of actors.Tobey Maguire did a fine job as Nick Carraway and his narration was perfect; Carrie Mulligan did great as the beautiful Daisy, Joel Edgerton (who voiced Metalbeak in Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga-Hoole) is solid as Tom and Isla Fisher is also great, but Leonardo DiCaprio, one of the greatest actors in history, steals the show for being the right choice of portraying Gatsby. He seemed fit as a fiddle by showing the darker side of Gatsby's character.Overall, The Great Gatsby does have some problems and I understand that it got mixed feelings from the critics, but for me, I would recommend others to see it even if they haven't read the book.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
An absorbing and captivating story is being told again with a subtle sense of vagueness.,"I really don't get the reason behind so many negative reviews of this film. I thought visually this film is incredibly stunning. From grand sets to the detailed period dresses, this film is a treat for the eyes. The direction in this film is impeccable. The cinematography is marvelous and really lets the viewer absorb the sheer artistry that has gone into making this film. Performances are phenomenal by the entire cast. Carey Mulligan's Daisy is every bit as careless as one would expect, but she also manages to show some complexity in her role. Tobey Maguire is a great avatar for us to take on as we enter this film. He is very much the viewer as he sees everything happening, but is eventually helpless to change anything. The true standouts in the film are Joel Edgerton and Leonardo DiCaprio. DiCaprio is probably the only actor of this generation that could play Gatsby, just as Robert Redford could only play Gatsby the previous generation.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Music tried to be the star...,"This is a spectacular story...(done well by Robert Redford's portrayal of Gatsby all those years ago when he was gorgeous!). Leonardo DiCaprio stood out and was impressive (gosh he's good!) and that's the only reason this movie was worth my time. OK, yes, it was pretty to look at when you were in the party scenes but I have to say, the music was way too distracting for me. How can you take such a loved novel and put in today's type of music and think it's cool? There were times where the music was better because it was ""period"" music. But frankly, when you get into rap or hip hop in a movie that takes place in the 20's, that's corny to me. It took me away from the storyline into thinking it was a concession to the music moguls who were part of this production. I also laughed at some of the dancing girl scenes, wondering if some of those dance moves were done in that time! (Maybe they were and Beyonce, et al, are just copycats!). All in all, it came off as corny to me and I'd tell folks to wait for the video and read the book or see Redford's version. Gosh, I hope this director doesn't take on Gone With The Wind!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"over-mannered in style, but effective and incisive","Luhrmann's Great Gatsby is first of all brightly-coloured imagery and powerful audio-solicitation, excessive and over-mannered, as to get, sometimes, grotesque, but certainly appealing, mainly while depicting the extravagance of sumptuous parties. But this is the spirit of the roaring twenties, vibrating with intoxicating energy, and the style employed is well matched with the sparkling vitality of those times (and, by the way, you cannot expect sobriety in a work by a director like him).So, splendor of the scenery, awesome costumes and jewels, marvelous cakes and sparkling champagne abound and appeal the viewer since from the very beginning of the picture. Not to mention the irreverent use of music, with shocking covers and an hazardous contamination between hip pop and traditional jazz. The picture, however, is not only explosive energy and affected mannerism, on the contrary it pulses with emotion in dialogues and situations, and here the novel upon which it is based emerges clearly.Of course, if you compare the movie with Fitzgerald's work, you realize that some depth is missing, especially that sense of decay and despair typical of those same shimmering years. However, it is always difficult, sometimes impossible, to transpose complex literary works, especially those where the evocative power of the written word proves superior to the necessary directness of the visual image. But the screenplay and the use of camera help emphasise the inner anxiety of Gatsby and the mysterious nature of Nick, supported by the talented performances of the actors (Di Caprio is great as usual, and more handsome than ever), who interact very well with the female performances. To sum up, the final product proves effective and incisive, and the long timerun never bores, on the contrary the picture keeps its quick pace and brilliant touch till the end.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Did Anyone Read the Novel?,"Ostensibly not! What an incredible load of pretentious rot. Incredible misfires in the casting department: Toby McGuire as Nick? Carey Mulligan as Daisy? Leonardo as Gatsby? Nope. Clayton's 1974 version was weak, unfocused and trite but at least Redford and Farrow were fairly close to Fitzgerald's original characters.Luhrmann's approach to the novel is an unfocused disjointed fantasy free for all. It's bewildering that he was able to get financing for this mess and further bewildering that Leo signed on. Don't waste your time watching this ridiculous, embarrassing and smug interpretation.

Gatsby I Presume,"Hello all, it's me Robbie K finally returning after a three month dry spell. I apologize for my absence but I return once more to attempt to inform you about the latest releases at the theaters. My first review back is on the book made movie/remake of a literary classic: The Great Gatsby. I'm sure if you are like me; you might have big expectations for this movie, or at least were hoping that Hollywood didn't screw it up. Well if you've got a few minutes keep reading to hear my opinions on this film, if not well hope to catch you next week.Instead of giving you a summary of the trailer, I'll jump straight to what I thought about this movie. Let's start with my favorite thing about the movie, the soundtrack. Rather than falling into cliché of using the music of the era, this rendition of Fitzgerald's literary classic chose the path of blending modern, orchestra, and jazz into their music mix. Modern rap and hip hop opened up the party often showing the masses conglomerating into the house. Once inside the party zone, the music transitioned into the jazz to provide the ideal beat to support the various dances the extras performed. Of course the movie isn't just about partying, but also has a lot of emotion tied into the film as well. While jazz and other current hits, the orchestra track provided the extra kick needed to bring out the emotion embedded into the various scenes. Sure I may be too obsessed with the musical score, but the truth is an epic soundtrack can add an extra edge to make a scene more memorable.Of course what is a movie without stunning visuals? Usually not a very good movie, but luckily Gatsby has got some pep in its step. The parties in particular were what impressed me the most. All the partygoers were dressed in the 1920's fab, filling the screen with both chic fat cat swingers, and stunning women in gorgeous dresses. The setting of Mr. Gatsby's house was also detailed and dazzling filled to the brim with elegant artwork, beautifully crafted outdoor porches, and of course enough room to provide plenty of angles to capture the party goer's adventure into wild, alcohol infused fun. For this reviewer, I applaud the balanced mix of close up dance moves and wide angled shots that showed the masses interacting with Gatsby's house, especially for those that chose to dance and mingle around the pool. Now the rest of the movie was pretty well designed as well, but to my eyes it looked like the editing crew had a fair share of input in this movie. Often many of the car scenes looked fake, with many of the trees, buildings and coal piles looking a little too smooth and polished. My guess is this artificial environment was created for the 3-D version of the movie. Unfortunately there also seemed to be a rather fast, glitchy, movement to the actors in certain scenes that was a little odd to see. It could just be my old eyes, but past this minor glitch and over polished world, the world was well crafted.By now you might be saying, ""You idiot what about the acting? Did the acting do the characters justice?"" I say yes, especially for that debonair man himself Leonardo DiCaprio who was a shoe in to play Mr. Gatsby himself. Leo's charming smile fit perfectly in the billionaire, containing a combination of confidence and arrogance that was offset by the kindness in his eyes. Over the course of the movie Leo not only added the stereotypical snooty tone of a rich playboy, but evolved to deliver his poetic lines with the emotion of someone who actually wrote those very words. And when the time finally came to display the last parts of Gatsby's emotional spectrum, he transitioned flawlessly into the anger and sadness that followed. Of course Leo isn't the only actor in this movie is he? Tobey Maguire, formerly Spiderman, surprised me with his performance in this movie. The role of Nick Caraway was perfect for him, playing the odd, scared, and rather immature stock boy that tell the audience the story. I must say I enjoyed this role a lot more than the last few roles I've seen, despite his insane rants and depressed writing. Carey Mulligan was a vision of loveliness as well, her looks dazzling and a pleasure to look at. As for her acting, I think she did a good job, though I don't remember the character of Daisy being so annoying. I don't know if it was the directing or what, but somehow Ms. Buchanan was a little too clingy, desperate, and annoying to really get attached to her. Then again I never was able to relate to soap opera drama queens who are stuck on love. As for the rest of the cast well they did fine too, but I don't have time, nor do you want to hear me describe every single character.I did enjoy this remake of Gatsby very much, and thought it was a good movie to continue drawing people back to the movies. The settings and music went hand and hand, and the acting for most of the cast I think did a nice job bringing the characters to life in the modern age. How well did it stick to the book? I can't answer that question as it has been 5 years since I last turned the pages, though I intend to read it again. My final comment on the movie is that the pace needed a little tuning up and probably shortened a bit to help keep my attention. My scores for this film are the following: Drama/Romance: 8.0 Movie overall: 7.0-7.5",,Anonymous,Romance
There was a dark side to this world of gold and luxurious living,"In the presence of real aristocrats, Gatsby seemed even more impetuous.

It's well filmed and Baz Luhrmann's direction is overblown but still visually stunning. It's well paced and the music by Craig Armstrong is really good.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Great Film (no matter what they say),"I haven't read the book so i can't judge by the similarities and accuracies the movie has to it.Judging it as a stand-alone movie i actually found it really entertaining. DiCaprio gives a really good performance and although he sure lacks of chemistry with Mulligan. Tobey Maguire, although his role is not doing much in the film but narrating from his side of view is also decent.I couldn't help but love how the director captivated and presented the 20s in his own unique way. The costumes and the choreographies are entertaining as great and i had no problem with the modern music attached to them.I can't really tell why people don't like the music to be honest. Its definately ambitious to combine a dark themed age like the 20s with modern fun-time songs but the way the director presented it really works for me( he took a risk and won)I definately understand that the book must have a lot of differences from the movie (from what i read on the reviews) but its one of those times i really don't care at all.The movie was great after all.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Too much gloss does not make a good movie,"Not all than shines is gold and that could not be truer that ""The great Gatsby"". To be fair no one can deny the ambiance of this film which puts us right in the roaring 1920's New York. Well made and fast paced it will transport the audience to a bygone era, which is as good as it can get.The problem is that its over-reliance on the A list cast to deliver did not work, as far as quality is concerned because there is no doubt in me, it will do well in the box office. A shiny retro looking Di Caprio, Maguire and Mulligan, who arguably played well, could not give this initiative the wow factor. In my quest for substance beyond the gloss and glamour I found none.There were moments in this film, I could not help but think: ""where is this heading?"" ....and such thoughts are never constructive. The fact alone that it left me with a sense of indifference regarding the outcome, only shows that it failed to be an effective movie.On the effectiveness side, it must be pointed out that putting contemporary R&B/Hip Hop music on a retro film was an utter disaster; it was like having Hercules dancing on Vanilla Ice. Bad idea all around.Undoubtedly, a very typical Hollywood project that does not do the classic novel much justice being a mildly pleasant experience that is it best to not watch with plenty of expectation.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"The Great Gatsby, magic on its own","""It was good, but not as good as the book,"" most would say after watching an adaptation film. In fact, even positive reviews somehow tie the film with its original content, which detracts from the movie experience. I say Ignore the classic Fitzgerald novel (for two hours at least), and let Baz Luhrmann take us into the magical world of The Great Gatsby.From the gorgeous visuals to interesting choice of soundtrack, Luhrmann presents a refreshingly new environment. We see the glamorous parties, interesting people, and a roaring 1920s New York City accompanied by modern hip-hop music. This unique clash of elements blends surprisingly well because it is fresh, pioneering, and intimidating at the same time. These genuine feelings allow the audience to see through the lenses of Nick Carraway – innocence for the story.""I had to block out all the noise about expectations, or 'Oh, he's doing it in 3DOh, hip-hop, it's all going to be flash and dazzle',"" said Luhrmann in an interview with Jake Hamilton. ""Listen, the film Gatsby is flash and dazzle.At the end, the film still comes down to the actors and the story of their characters.Leonardo DiCaprio as Jay Gatsby was nothing short of brilliant. Aside from the natural confidence and enigmatic charisma DiCaprio has, his portrayal of the iconic figure was genuine and down to earth. He somehow managed to blend contradicting emotions into one package and instill it not only onto Gatsby himself, but also the man's dreams and aspirations. ""When you make a film version of a great novel like this, you as an actor – as a detective – you get more insight onto the character's thought process,"" said DiCaprio in the same interview with Hamilton.DiCaprio will probably get another Academy Awards nomination for playing this great figure, but will he finally get the nod? We'll see.Tobey Maguire as Nick Carraway was also very believable. Maguire's vivid narrative helped the audience maintain curiosity and the right amount of distance with the film and the characters in it. I would have loved to see Carrie Mulligan and Joel Edgerton as Daisy and Tom Buchannan a bit more. The relationship between these characters is a lot more complex than what was allowed on screen.The overall pace of the movie felt a bit rushed, especially prior to Gatsby's entrance. There were a lot of scenes that would have been more suspenseful if they had more time to develop. With that being said, it is a difficult task to present all the intangibles of this particular story without losing a main focus and even worse, losing the audience.Even with my premise, this production will always be compared with the classic novel. But why? Why deprive yourself of a chance to get completely lost in a cinematic ride. Whether or not the movie does the book justice is irrelevant. The acting was superb, the story was intriguing, and the visuals were breathtaking. Beyond the flash and dazzles, there is a beautiful story waiting to breathe on its own.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Stunning Visuals,The movie may not reach the depths of the book of Mr. Fitzgerald but anyway I like it - stunning visuals and a little sip of a long gone time got me well entertained. Not as great as Moulin Rouge! (regarding the visuals) but still a good one.,7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Visual Noise - If I could score lower than 1 I would,"This film is what I'd describe as Moulin Rouge's yeasty feculent crotch.
Fails in every way a director can...
1-The majority of the scenes aren't framed properly by using the rule of thirds which is rudimentary film making.
2-The overs are totally out of synch.
3-Clipping and cutting of each scene is irrational and garish.
4-Use of modern day music in a beloved period piece makes it unbelievable and unrelatedly foolish and brash, not to mention irritating.
5-Despite Dicaprio being in it, the acting is abysmal - but this can be tracked back to the fact that the film itself is wayward and the embodiment of ""style over content"". It's overuse of clipping and visuals is a testament to the fact that the director doesn't know what he's doing.
To summarise, a total pile of pig farts that should be found in the bottom of a Woolworths bargain bin with Hasselhoff's last singles that didn't make the German charts. Or the last wiping of a ill digested Saturday night bargain vindaloo.

Puttin' on the Glitz,"The film is not recommended.The latest adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's great American novel has again transitioned to the silver screen. (There have been 5 previous films, none of which were successful at the box office or achieved critical raves.) Now, the ""enfant terrible"" of cinematic excess, Baz Luhrmann, has taken a crack at it, turning the romantic drama into a melodramatic concoction of flappers and booze with a stylish 3-D approach added to his usual opulent visual imagery. The result is like an expensive vodka martini, extra dry, and with enough garnishing to shock Mrs. Astor's pet horse. It easy to liken Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby to an uninvited drunken party guest that you hoped would have left hours ago. It outstays its own visit.Yes, this party goes on far too long, with too many impeccably tailored bystanders in their fancy duds and inebriated guests hanging out just for show. Do the filmmakers capture the circus atmosphere of the twenties and its bacchanalian orgy of carefree decadence? Absolutely. The film looks perfect, but it's all facade. The glitter, and there are tons of it, fades, leaving a rather tame tale in its wake. Do they create compelling dialog, believable characters, and an interesting story? Sorry, old sport!￼For those unaware of the story: It's the Roaring Twenties and everyone wants The American Dream. Nick Carraway (Toby Maguire), cousin to the lovely Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan), befriends his rich and mysterious neighbor, Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio) and gets involved with his hedonistic lifestyle. Gatsby, who has been secretly in love with Daisy for some time, uses Nick's friendship to rekindle this romance. Unfortunately, Daisy is married to a brutish husband, Tom (Joel Edgerton), who is having a affair with a waitress on the other side of the tracks named Myrtle (Isla Fisher). All of these soap opera relationships collide with tragic consequences.Now the underlying power of Fitzgerald's masterwork is in its prose, not in its plot. And the script by Craig Pearce and Luhrmann rarely reaches that level, or any level, of artistry. The film plays like a Cliff Notes version of the novel, relying too heavily on narrative voice-overs and overstated visuals that work on the page but not on the screen. The characters are so one-dimensional and lacking in any nuance. The actors, try as they may, are all constantly upstaged by their opulent surroundings and stilted conversations.￼DiCaprio is perfectly suited for the role of Gatsby, literally speaking. With his boyish good looks and charming personality, he wears the period costumes well and has enough charisma for his enigmatic character. DiCaprio displays the correct measure of ambiguity and desperation with his portrayal of Gatsby. However Mulligan as his romantic partner lacks the allure and frailty needed to make her character remotely likable. The pairing just doesn't work. Maguire as Nick plays his part with his usual innocent demeanor as he has in past performances, which still works here. The other actors fail to bring any nuance to their sketchy roles, with the exception of Elizabeth Debicki in her short role as Jordan Baker. Edgerton makes his repellent character villainous to the point of caricature as well as Ms. Fisher' as his floozy mistress. However she would be an ideal choice to play Miss Adelaine in a summer stock production of Guys and Dolls.￼As with most of the director's films, production values are flawless. One can see the big budget lavishness in every detail. Costumes and production design by Catherine Martin, Baz talented spouse, is truly stunning. Simon Duggan's vertigo inducing cinematography, though far from subtle, successfully captures the atmosphere and the opulence that was the Jazz Age. The hyperactive editing by Jason Ballantine, Jonathan Redmond, and Matt Villa helps to liven the film's prodding dialog. It is a feast for the eyes.As for the ears...Much has been said about Luhrmann anachronistic use of music, combining today's pop and hip-hop musicians to create new songs for this period piece. (The director used this same approach with his earlier hit, Moulin Rouge, with mixed results.) The same can be said here too. Too often, he overstates his scenes with a soundtrack that telegraphs its message long before its actions.Just as the character of Nick Carraway, Fitzgerald's alter ego in the novel, always appears to be observing the proceedings from the outside looking in. So was I watching this film. Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby never connected to me emotionally. It becomes so overindulgent, like the era it tries to depict. Ultimately, the film is as phony and glib as Gatsby himself. It left me wanted more and wanting less simultaneously, a strange contradiction to a strange and ultimately unsatisfying film. Sorry, old sport! GRADE: C+ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.comNOTE: The 3-D effects truly energize Luhrmann's vision. The director continually plays with foreground and middle ground dynamics which gives the film a unique and slightly artificial theatrical edge which works well with the spectacle. Now, if only the script could provided some of that same passionate spirit.",,Anonymous,Romance
Cut cut cut,"It's a grand spectacle and it delivers the famous story of Jay Gatsby fairly well. It withholds some of the key parts but the depth of it falls short. I did get an emotional reaction to some parts of this film, that I feel like I should've. Those moments I did, was not very impactful.Cinematography looked very expensive and it was stunning at times. The money shot is of course Gatsby's first appearance. Brilliant moment from the visual and story side. Art direction and set design was incredible as well.The editing I think ruined most of my experience with this film. I understand the decision of making it fast paced to shorten the runtime and perhaps display the craziness of these characters life, but it was sooo messy. It cut all the time like Mad Max but didn't have any sense of coherency.

"may be a mess in part, but in other parts is faithful in tone and spirit to Fitzgerald with excellent performances","I was reminded of this latest adaptation of F Scott Fitzgerald's seminal work on wealth and identity in the early (and beyond) 20th century. Baz Lurhmann directed it; it's hard not to tell, and especially if you've seen Moulin Rouge you know how he will take this time period (like Shakespeare and just uh, musical Paris in 1900) and make it into a fiasco and fresco of images. It's hard not to when dealing with the high-frenzied party world of the early 1920s in the Jazz age, when people with money had a lot of the (illegal but who cares) hootch, and a person like Jay Gatsby could make a name for himself as... whatever he wanted. Of course, he was a bootlegger in this story, but that's if you look at what he technically does. He's much more in the eyes of Nick (Tobey Maguire, with DiCaprio as Gatsby): he's mythical, and charming and rich, and then... other times completely out of control and unable to really connect with what to do with himself, especially when it comes to his long lost love (Daisy, Carey Mulligan is really great in just that way of being delicate but smart).The frenetic style is not unexpected for these early party scenes, but they can get so crazed that I grew weary of the anachronistic use of the music; for some reason in Moulin Rouge this worked a little better since it seemed all a delirious fantasy about LOVE (in capital letters) with only a vague sense of the place and time. In Gatsby it's clearly this period - oddly enough DiCaprio appeared before this in Django Unchained, another film by a director who revels in music from today in a period setting, but there it was done very much with a wink and a grin, a audacious black comedy. But here it's a dark drama at heart about the failure of the American dream in the midst of being able to achieve it initially: become whoever you want to be, reinvent yourself, and it can be great. Or, if it spins off the wheels, not so much.There is conventional stuff that can't be avoided if really delivering Fitzgerald's story, which includes how Daisy is already with Tom, played by a very great Joel Edgerton, especially in how he gets angrier and more intense in a particular argument scene that is, for me, the real centerpiece of the film. But for this second half of the film, when Luhrmann gives us less of the full-blown, Jay-Z soundtracked spectacle, we get the story of this love-that-cannot-be, and with scenes that vary between tender admission (the ""you can't repeat the past"" dialog between Gatsby and Nick), the awkward reuniting of Jay and Daisy, and that giant argument scene. This and other stuff IS faithful to the book, and the actors help sell it so much even with (or despite) the Luhrmann over-flourishing.But maybe this material in 2013 could only be made (or sold) as this frenetic spectacle. And you do get that, and it is so much it becomes too much. And maybe that's the point and I just didn't get it or respond to it. But The Great Gatsby is still a good movie because the story at heart is so incredible and deep and you can read so much into how characters who lose sight of what they want, or know what they want and muck up getting it - and it's all under that watchful 'eye' of the billboard en route to Long Island from New York city - that it breaks your heart. When it goes for it, this cast (DiCaprio gives it his all, which could have been funny in the wrong hands; Maguire is just the solid core, as he should be in this story, constantly watching and as the audience's eyes) sells it excellently. I'd watch it again, and is a good adaptation if not a great one of a book that lives up to the hype.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Fan favorite,An all time favorite of mine. DiCaprio and cast do not disappoint. I remember the book and became excited about the film. The cinematographer and costuming was beautifully done. Setting the tone for Gatsby's world in an exciting way. I also loved the soundtrack. Blending modern and classic sounds gave a fresh take on how the music supported the storytelling. A film I can watch over and over again. Two thumbs up for me.,10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Baz being Baz,"The editing in the first 45 minutes is chaotic. I get the idea - Luhrmann loves this in his films - but this can put a lot of people off right away and can be overwhelming.DiCaprio is an excellent actor. Yes, one of the greatest. Mulligan, Debicki, and Edgerton always give their characters what they need. Tobey Maguire is always Peter Parker.I understand that some are offended by the soundtrack. I personally like the modern touch that Luhrmann wants to introduce in his period movies. It makes those movies something different, with their own identity.Sometimes this is a five-star movie. Other times two stars. It's not homogeneous, but that's kind of exciting.Daisy, I will never forgive you.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
I was certainly glad to see this movie,"A few months ago I saw the first trailer of the great Gatsby and thought it was going to be great, now an hour after watching it, was it actually that good?The great Gatsby is a very good movie with just as good actors, when the movie starts you can feel and see it was expensive and did cost a lot of effort to make. the story is well written, the characters are interesting and the shots just looked great.The first half of the movie just feels like magic, all the unreal parties which everyone would like to join just look great. the custom made car Leonardo Di caprio's character drives in would easily be chosen for world best car.After an hour the passing slows down and the story starts, I am not going to spoil any part of it but i can tell you it is good and unexpected this happen all the time.Are there any bad parts in the movie? yes in my opinion the ending could have been done much better, the movie leaves you with an empty feeling which was not necisery.I give this movie a 9 it is one of the best movies seen this year and it will most likely end up in my top 5.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Great Gatsby - Noodles Review,"American classic of literature... The Great Gatsby... can somebody please tell me why this movie needed to be in 3D? The Great Gatsby is a very character-based story; the story can only proceed through how well the characters are portrayed, not the in-your-face style. Thankfully, the characters are most great too. Anyways, The Great Gatsby is a pretty simple story. There's an awesome rich guy, Jay Gatsby, whose pretty much the Hugh Hefner of the 1920s (although they were probably the same age in the '20s). He's in love with the narrator's cousin, who happens to be married to a douche with a lot of inherited money. That's some simple and classy drama there, right? Well, let's just add an insane amount of noise and a lot of green screen and now we have a movie.The first thing you gotta talk about with this movie is Leonardo DiCaprio. The guy's like one of the best in the business right now and personally my 3rd favourite actor. You just can't help but root for him in whatever movie he's in (hell, I almost even rooted for him in Django Unchained... but that would've been bad) and ya root for him in this movie. He kills it as Jay Gatsby. One thing that was great was the subtle mystery of his character (one really great film aspect is that he wasn't even shown for the first 20-30 minutes of the movie) The rest of the cast is good; especially Joel Edgerton who plays the dick so well, helping us to appreciate Gatsby even more. Toby Maguire (who we've all come to know as Spiderman) is fine in the movie as the narrator but I feel his role could've been played by anyone. Carey Mulligan, who plays Daisy (the girl Gatsby is infatuated with) overacts a little bit but I feel that's good for the character she plays and the style of this movie.The style of the movie is really one thing that's really crucial to its likability. For me, I like where they were going with it, but it's just too much.for the movie. Baz Luhrmann is the director of this movie. If you don't know who he is, imagine what would happen if Zack Snyder started making artsy movies. He's a very visual and striking director, which sometimes works but not always. They use a lot of noise and colors for this movie. It's, in a way, visually loud. So much is going on that its just like there's noise on the screen. And a lot of this movie is shot on green screen, with a lot of visual effects that don't really need to be there. I don't think there's much need for that in a drama about love. While it does work at some times, I didn't think it did much justice to the overall film. What I really liked are the scenes that take place in one room where people are just talking or arguing. You can feel the tension and emotion of those scenes really well.Still, The Great Gatsby puts a little too much flair into a simple character-based drama, creating an imbalance of style over substance. The acting was great and the script seemed like it was probably great too; but the way it was conveyed was a little too much. The clash between the premise of the movie and the ongoing visuals really compromised the overall quality of it. While it's an interesting and, in a respect, a unique movie, The Great Gatsby is not as memorable as I hoped for it to be",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Seriously?,"How this horrid mess has such a high rating is beyond me.Cinematography: 7 Script: 3 Soundtrack: -23 Adaptation from book: I can't count that low.The thing that makes me want to vomit the most is how this movie tries to take an older culture and 'spice it up' by adding modern things. It fails miserably. If you have seen ""The matrix"" trilogy, imagine the big party/rave scene after Morpheus' speech being filled with banjos playing Mozart. This movie is that style of brain violation.Anyone who has read a book once or thrice prior to it being turned into a movie will understand that you can't capture everything from the text in the time allowed for most films. This is different, it's an abomination. Not only were many key elements left out of the story, it's like it was produced by teenagers who work for Disney and have seen no other sort of film and have probably never read a book.Honestly, the price of buying or borrowing the book is far less than the cost of theater tickets or a DVD. Even if you're into downloading pirated movies, this one isn't worth the bandwidth. Anyone who rates this above a 3 clearly lacks the intellect and attention span to have even made it through the Cliff's notes for this, much less the book. This is truly horrible.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Lavishly constructed,"It's been many years since I read the book, but Baz Lurhmann's interpretation seemed pretty faithful. The production design is astounding and really sucks you into the glitzy time period. A lot of people complain about the excess in this film, but it honestly fits the story and era very well. Plus, it just adds to the fun of watching it. Leo is fantastic as Gatsby, maintaining an intriguing mysteriousness throughout. Edgerton and Mulligan are both great as well. Tobey Maguire however, did not really work for me. Part of it is his constant unnecessary narration and the other part being his goofy, aloof performance. He was pretty miscast as Nick Carraway.The beginning moves at a lightning pace and its hard to pick everything up, but it slows down in the second half. My biggest issue is probably the music. The contemporary songs of Jay-Z and Beyonce just do not fit the time period and it's very distracting. There's still plenty of good here though and this interpretation is fine entertainment.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A highly enjoyable film,"I really enjoyed this film.On a separate note, I also really enjoyed the book.I am confused why a number of people are posting negative comments based on the fact that the movie didn't match identically to their interpretation of Fitzgerald's storyline/characters etc. The film is an 'adaptation' not a replica or an identical copy. The whole theory behind the creation of films is in order to entertain people, and this film, very effectively entertained me.Another fantastic Di Caprio performance, will this chap ever do a bad movie?",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Pleasure-drenched Celebration of a Time Gone By - Best Adaptation Till Date!,"Gatsby, The Classic American Novel; when a movie is made on such a novel, which has gained so much popularity in the past decades and has even become a part of American high school curriculum, it is bound to get a lot a heat. Luhrmann's adaptation, though having some glaring flaws, is the best attempt till date.The movie enthralled me with its spectacularly breathtaking visuals and strong soundtrack. Lana Del Rey's 'Young and Beautiful' is powerfully beautiful, and certainly deserves some awards. Coming back to the visuals, Luhrmann pays so much attention to the details from a character's dress to the carpets to the chandeliers - everything is colourful and extravagant. But this same attention to detail becomes a drawback as the emotional and intimate scenes lose some of their intensity behind these picturesque details. The interactions and confrontations feel like scenes from glitzy operatic drama. But other than that, the story is told quite well keeping with the pace and suspense of the piece; the mystery is maintained quite well.With Leonardo DiCaprio's talent and persona, I could think of no one else who could have played Gatsby's role better; he sustains the shades and elements of the character quite naturally. Carey Mulligan plays the attractive, but self-centered and shallow, character of Daisy with such beauty and grace. Tobey Maguire is excellent as Carraway, and his brilliant narration helps in bringing the feel of Fitzgerald's lyrical prose.No matter how much the movie is trashed, I can aptly say that it skillfully portrays the basic elements of the characters and the story - the roaring 'Jazz Age' of the 20's, self-reinvention, the great American dream. lost love, and unwillingness to let go of the past - and stays true to the book. Rather than being a completely conventional adaptation, it's more of a pleasure-drenched celebration of a time gone by.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Much better then I was expecting. Slow start but makes you glad you finished. Never read book but I liked it OK. I say B.,"""When I came back from New York I was disgusted. Disgusted with everyone and everything. Only one man was exempt from my disgust."" Nick Carraway (Maguire) is a war veteran and aspiring writer who is working as a bond salesman on Wall Street. When he stops to visit his cousin Daisy and her husband he begins to see lies in the marriage. One day he receives an invitation to a party thrown by his millionaire neighbor Gatsby (DiCaprio) and his world becomes changed. This is a movie that I was really not excited about seeing at all. In spite of myself I am a DiCaprio fan and I have liked the movies that Luhrmann has made but to me the movie looked boring. I have never read the book so I wasn't really familiar with the story at all. I had an expectation of the style the film was going to be but that was about it. I thought the beginning was very slow moving and I was worried that the movie would not hold my attention. While it never really picked up too much I did find myself sucked in and am really glad that I stuck it out and finished it.

It's a Love Story,"I barely remember this story as required reading in high school but did not recall it as a love story, or more accurately a love triangle of doom. The scope and scale of the film is grand but the cast made it lightweight, meaning the cast didn't do the opulent, extravagant set justice, they weren't up to the challenge. It was refreshing to see the roaring '20s brought to life in color here, though. I realize L DiC is a leading man type but he was just wrong for the role of Gatsby. In fact, it should've been a much larger and impressive man and an unknown at that. Gatsby was a man of mystery and casting an A-list actor taints that element. Tobey M didn't add much either, also miscast. However, a surprise treat of sorts was Carey Mulligan as leading lady ""Daisy Buchanan"" since Carey now stars in ""Promising Young Woman"". The story itself is pedestrian, a doomed love triangle at its heart so of more interest to chix than dudes, and how Gatsby meets his end is wholly unlikely. The writer/producer/director - Baz L - should've written a much more plausible ending, maybe where Gatsby is exiled, sent on-the-run instead, leaving Tom and Daisy to remain on LI, would've made much more sense.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

I did not entirely hate it,"What I thought worked in Luhrmann's Gatsby:I thought DiCaprio was a better Gatsby than Robert Redford (Redford was too old and underplayed the character). I thought DiCaprio understood a complex character and was adequately convincing.I Love Carey Mulligan and thought she was mostly convincing as Daisy.I liked it when the story stuck to Fitzgerald - which was about 75% of the time. (having just read the book again in the last 6 months, I recognized most of the Dialogue as true to the book)I thought the Costume Design was exquisite. Catherine Martin has done costume work for all of Baz Luhrmann's films and won an academy award for costumes in Moulin Rouge!(as well as being nominated for Romeo + Juliet and Australia. Her work is again superior here - one of the real strengths of the film...I thought the 2nd half of the movie was much better than the 1st. While I generally did not like the soundtrack I loved that Gershwin's' Rhapsody in Blue' snuck in there in the first scenes in Manhattan.The ""Valley of Ashes"" and the ""Dr. T.J. Eckleburg, Occulist"" sign are really well done - but sadly, the scenes there are so rushed and so downplayed as to prevent that location from being the symbol of death Fitzgerald intended it to be...The scene in Nick's house where Daisy is invited to tea and re-meets Gatsby.What I did not like about it:Every scene with Tobey Maguire in it. His Nick Carraway is too much of Gatsby's lapdog. He is too wide-eyed throughout the story. By the end of the movie I was praying for George Wilson to shoot him.Luhrmann's story telling device (Nick Carraway in a Sanitarium telling the story to a Doctor who encourages him to write it) - Really Baz Luhrman, you're gonna improve on Fitzgerald?Luhrmann's other story telling device: the words on the screen. Yuck!The Art-direction. Everything was too over-the-top and garish. Gatsby's house looks like a Disney creation. One might argue that this is okay because the new-rich are often garish. But part of the character that Fitzgerald wrote was that he was convincing as a monied man.The sound-track of the 1st half of the movie. Typically Luhrmann; and I have loved it in other contexts. It did not work in Gatsby. After the last party scene, the soundtrack was much better and the rest of the movie felt like Fitzgerald to me.BTW - I generally am a fan of Baz Luhrmann's work. I loved Romeo + Juliet while it was being panned by professional critics. And I found Moulin Rouge! delightful..Moet Champaign (which apparently bought huge stock in this movie)Joel Edgerton ('nuff said)The over-the-top garishness of the production is so distracting that the great social themes of the day are almost completely lost. They are so subtle int he book and they must be subtly depicted in cinema. They are so subtle as to be almost entirely lost in this production. When I first read the book I felt such sympathy for almost every character (except Tom Buchanan). I did not really care about the characters in this movie at all.That Damn green light - much too much. It is a powerful but subtle symbol in the book. Let a symbol be a symbol without having to constantly refer to it and without hitting your audience over the head with it.Because I did not think it entirely sucked, I will give it a 5. Adolescent girls will disagree with me (even as they are failing their Gatsby finals because they based it this mediocre retelling of the story). Fitzgerald and Gatsby fans will think I am being too generousNote to Hollywood - If you are going to make a movie based on a great work of literature, respect and humbly submit to that greatness, and make a movie worthy of the original.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
As Close To Definitive As Is Likely Possible,"There was enormous hype preceding the release of this film, given the nature of the original novel, and big names involved. The initial response was mixed. While my expectations were somewhat muted, I was pleasantly surprised and, although the film wasn't perfect, can't imagine how a ""Gatsby"" adaptation could have turned out much better.I'll talk about the performances first since those are what most readers will be most interested in. DiCaprio is very good in the title role. There are inevitable nitpicks to be had in regards to his performance, and Gatsby is such a nebulous character that it isn't possible to truly represent him as imagined in the book, but DiCaprio's choices are all sound. Tobey Maguire and Joel Edgarton are solid. Carey Mulligan made Daisy a bit too sympathetic in my opinion, but was still passable. Isla Fisher was the main disappointment for me, as I believe she turned her character into a caricature. Elizabeth Debicki was the other standout; she perfectly represents the literary Jordan Baker with much charisma and screen presence.I also enjoyed Luhrmann's direction. He brought the roaring 20's and Gatsby's elegant lifestyle to life with much flair and beauty. As for the much maligned period music, I found it to be a good idea that was not well executed. The idea of playing the modern day equivalents to Jazz in the soundtrack to better communicate the atmosphere to modern viewers was good, but some of the songs simply did not fit and were quite jarring.My main criticism is that the movie would be confusing thematically for anyone who had not read the book. This is an inevitable problem for Gatsby adaptation, since so much is communicated through narration in the novel, and as it is the movie relies too heavily on it. This prevents the film from getting anywhere near the heights of the novel. Nonetheless, for the time being, this is the definitive Gatsby adaptation, and it will likely remain as such for some time, given the strong performances and that most of its problems were unavoidable.",,Anonymous,Romance

It would have been better had they minimized the CGI so it wasn't obvious computer BS. A great story ruined.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Flashy adaptation of a seminal American novel,"Baz Luhrmann has crafted a feast for the eyes and ears in his opulent adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's famous novel. Having never read the book, I can't judge the film on its faithfulness to the source material. And also having never seen the 1970's film version with Robert Redford, I can't compare it to that either. So as a standalone film, THE GREAT GATSBY mostly works. Despite from anachronistic soundtrack choices, they still felt in tune with how the 1920's might have seemed to those living in that time period. As for period-appropriate selections, I liked the usage of George Gershwin, particularly ""An American in Paris"" which serves as a nice reference to F. Scott Fitzgerald, and other members of ""The Lost Generation."" Visually, the movie is stunning with great attention paid to detail. The only areas I felt lacking was in some of the pacing and the thematic department. The early scenes with parties play fast and hard, with dialogue coming about as fast as one could comprehend it. It is a bit of a head trip, but it wouldn't be so jarring if the movie didn't slow down to a crawl once the melodrama takes over. I also felt that the whole ""new money vs. old money"" angle could have been explored a little more. As it stands, the film merely scratches the surface of its characters rather than delving in and attempting to understand any of them, except for maybe the titular Gatsby. However, I do think the movie did a good job of portraying excess. Overall, it's stylistically brilliant but the story could have used some more fine-tuning and attempted to explore its characters more than it did for a 130-ish minute movie. Going in, I wasn't expecting too much, but I was pleasantly surprised which made for an enjoyable viewing experience.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
a solid film regardless of its source material,"Watched this topical Baz Luhrmann extravaganza in a plain 2D version, adapted from a world- famous classic, the daunting comparison is predestined, lucky me for being completely oblivious of the original novel and its earlier cinema adaption, so I feel privileged to take my pleasure from viewing this film without being nettled by any premeditated notions whatsoever, blessing the ignorance!Zero expectation does assuage the nitpicking impulse, this period film establishes its unparalleled visual spectacle which its additional charge of a 3D fee could be considerably goaded, it has been the first time I wish I could watched it with the unease gizmo since INCEPTION (2010, 9/10). The upbeat Hip-Hop infused party music and retro-induced melancholiac strains (now I can not get Lana Del Rey's YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL out of my mind) is another novelty rarely being presented in a period drama, Luhrmann again victoriously testifies himself is the maestro of contemporary cinema's flamboyance and garishness (without any pejorative overtone).The long-time-no-see former Spidey Tobey Maguire (who is still able to pass off as a twenty- some due to his perpetual baby-face) is the narrator of an ill-fated love story, and surprisingly he does occupy such a lengthy screen time, even outstays DiCaprio's Gatsby. He is the observer, the bystander and a useful buffer between Gatsby and Daisy, Luhrmann and his co-writer Craig Pearce intentionally sacrifice his personal life (no relationship entanglement at all) to intensify his unspeakable admiration towards Gatsby (a bromance in the period time?), he is the one who is captivated by Gatsby's beguiling friendship, his grandstanding lifestyle and the money to sustain all these grandiosity and opulence. Maguire is impeccable as a wide-eyed third wheel, a surviver who is destined to tell the tale.Then comes the problematic couple, Gatsby and Daisy, both being introduced under the heightened and pompous settings, Mulligan's Daisy is first seen by her slender legs swinging with curtains fluttering around, a spoiled flapper subordinated by male chauvinism (who sincerely hope her young daughter would be a fool since it is the perfect niche for a girl). Gatsby, whose front officially being spotlighted during the lavish party, with tender golden light lingers much longer than it should be, DiCaprio's over-familiar persona almost prompts me into laughter. Both thespians are impassioned with the best they can offer, their first meeting in the film is a marvelous romantic gambit, and Baz still gets it!I must be too optimistic to say DiCaprio may stand a chance to win over Oscar's attention this time, his red-faced yelling outburst during the conflict is his Oscar-bait, but makes me squirm a bit, since it is his stock antics. For Mulligan, her role has an innate defect for being the collateral culprit of the denouement, so the misogynous judgement aside, Mulligan is praiseworthy in balancing the morally equivocal personality with her dainty style. My only cast gripe is the usually-outstanding Edgerton, as Daisy's gentrified husband Tom, Edgerton is too vulgar in physique and looks like a nouveau-riche doesn't tally with the chic surroundings.A few technical glitches, the editing is a shade too fast in the first half, noticeably during the happy-moment sequence of the reunion, the glitz does hurt my eyes. Then near the end, the caption-floating of Fitzgerald's text is a lame maneuver, we all know there are too many to tell in the book, however poetic it is, a more subtle approach is recommended.It is an over-romanticized saga, the final telephone call good-heartedly bookends it, even facing the demise, at least a tinge of warmth manages to run through our senses, one may call it over sentimental, others may refer it as poetic license, all in all, I think it is worth your ticket, and I cannot believe I would say that, even in the despised 3D form.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Delight to Behold!,"Baz Luhrmann's interpretation of ""The Great Gatsby"" combines the latest motion picture technology with the essence of F. S. Fitzgerald's over 80 years old modern-classic novel in order to make cinema at its most magnificent, most excessive.This movie has such a great power of attraction you can hardly escape from, it's fast and dynamic - like a good party, and you as the viewer are in the center of all the exuberant happening revolving around you in a hurricane of glance and glamor; it smiles at you with a raised cocktail glass as Mr. Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio) did when he welcomed Nick Carraway (T. Maguire) in his castle for the first time and from this moment on, there is only one question: What's behind his whimsical smile?The cinematography: the camera-work (tracking shots, pans, zooms, different perspectives, high-angle shots, &c.), the 3D effect that suited well the pomp, the editing (fast cuts, time leaps, different color filters, text sequences, archive footage...) as well as a cool, contemporary score with jazzy remixes of known hits by various artists such as Beyonce or Lana Del Rey, is what makes this movie stand out beside a very strong cast with DiCaprio's intriguing performance at it's top. The ""Roaring Twenties"" were never more vital and the old New York never shone brighter or was dirtier (like in the ""Valley of Ashes"") than in this motion picture I acknowledge as a really good piece of art which I refuse to compare with ""Moulin Rouge"" (as some critics did) since it is neither a musical nor a comedy although it certainly had one or two humorous scenes.Carey Mulligan as Gatsby's love interest Daisy Buchanan is a delight to behold like a rare pearl you long to call your own, of a fragile and tender nature torn apart between Gatsby and her jealous husband who is played by J. Edgerton with such hypocritical arrogance that you cannot but find him unlikable in a positive way. Only Jordan Baker (E. Debicki) disappoints because she plays a rather shallow role which should have been a somehow emancipated opposite to a dependent woman of the 1920's who Daisy certainly is. N. Carraway recounts the tale in retrospect using Fitzgerald's powerful prose, a tale not so much of a tragical love affair as of a mysterious billionaire who is enormously wealthy and yet unhappy for the one true love of his life is married to another man.This movie aroused my wish to read the book again and this is indeed a good sign: highly recommendable!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
My view,I have to say that if DiCaprio wouldn't have played in this movie i would have gave it a 4 because it would have bin worse and not just OK. because the story is great of course this is the fifth movie about it. But all the actors apart from DiCaprio where just not good. They where overacting making weird faces and some spoke with the tong of the time then and some of the tong from our time. The difference between A-actors and B- actor was to good to see. But most off all the fact that during the movie you hear music from the last 4 years just threw me of the story line and that was upsetting. But forgetting all that the performance of DiCaprio makes much good. The way how he plays his character is amazing to see. And the story line is of course amazing this is the fifth movie about Gatsby and you can see why. I enjoyed watching this movie but i will say it isn't great but you will enjoy all the minutes you watch.,7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Enjoyed this lavish adaption,"Enjoyed this one, an adaption of the classic novel following Toby Maguire as aspiring writer Nick Caraway. I liked Toby's narration and how the story was told from his perspective after he moves next door to aloof millionaire Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio). The two from a friendship... of sorts as Gatsby throws ever elaborate parties in the hope of rekindling his romance with Nick's unhappily married cousin Daisy. While these celebrations are spectacular some of the dancing/party scenes went on too long.It's a visually stunning film with glamorous costumes and lavish production design, to the degree that it looks almost artificial or cartoony at times especially the New York scenery/bridge sections.I liked the music (Jay Z ) even if it was jarring because it is so far removed from the period this is set in.Toby's character while, yes meant to be an observer actually got to be a bit creepy as he is always lurking around watching with no real development on his part -flat.Leonardo DiCaprio is fantastic as Jay Gatsby, displaying mystery, ego, madness, shy, nervous, longing and ultimately sad and lost.

An emetic visual diarrhea ... sheer hyperbole,"Well ... that was a waste of time ... just watched 30 minutes of the new Great Gatsby movie and was not impressed at all. It is like a long study in visual effects: like those horrible fast paced cut jump commercials you see on television. All glitter and no substance. Eye candy that reflects the emptiness of American culture ... a nauseating, stomach-churning, sickly sugar coated stench of a movie ... disgusting in it's endless glitter and carnival atmosphere. Another Hollywood action packed visual monstrosity bereft of meaning and an insult to your intelligence ... Over the top and into the garbage can. Hollow facade and veneer.

"I wanted to like it .... so bad, but ....","Nick Carraway in a nut house? What? His time with Gatsby gave him a nervous breakdown? Why? You stink Chris Pearce (screenwriter) This concept undermines F. Scott's entire point!!!!This is an unnecessary film captured in the swirling glory of 3-D, sweeping cameras, excess and the decadent rich ad nauseam. With the author's prose in actual words on the screen and fireworks in the sky, we are given a weak script, failed characterizations devoid of all meaning.The music takes you completely out of the jazz age and dumps you in a glitzy nightmare populated with no characters no audiences can invest in.On a personal note DiCaprio is not good looking enough nor talented enough to play Gatsby. No one is.There should be a rule regarding certain pieces of literature, filmmakers can't film them just to make money.Walking out of the film I am reminded of parties I have attended, and stayed too late, only to wake up amongst the stale remains and debris of the previous nights excess.When DiCaprio said, ""Old Sport"", the audience laughed. Like the film itself, it was unnatural.",,Anonymous,Romance
"A rare treasure that captures the power, heartbreak and pain of its source","Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby is the 5th time this great American novel about how greed and excess corrupt and destroy us has been adapted to the screen. However, unlike the 74 version I truly left the theater like I did after reading the novel disturbed and haunted by the characters', their actions and moral values set against this ""time of wealth and happiness.""The acting in this film is surprisingly great... Dicaprio is amazing as Gatsby and really in my opinion shows Gatsby as being who he is, he's rich yet he's also self-conscious about how he acts and talks to keep up his illusion of grandeur(Many will say Dicaprio is confused, but I feel this was essential especially even when he's taking to Nick or when he waits out in the rain for Daisy and even tries to leave prior to her arrival to capture Gatsby's character: He's empty, confused and desperate to live the life he craves where he is someone, he has love and bliss and is able to live the ""American dream"" that everyone else claims they're currently living in this time with all the parties, technologies and so on. He truly deserves Oscar consideration as does Joel Edgerton who simply BLEW ME AWAY as Tom Buchanan and truly captured Tom's bigotry, contempt and power as he shatters Gatsby's dreams at the Plaza by revealing how he's associated with gamblers, he's a bootlegger and a liar about his past. The scene at the Plaza hotel leading to the shouting match over Daisy was heartbreaking and great with the ice-pick serving as tension-building and Dicaprio flipping at Tom who's shattered his illusion of grandeur and respect as he begins after losing his cool to stammer and falter breaking Daisy who's unable to say at this point she never loved Tom.Carey Mulligan who I had doubts in actually really played Daisy spectacularly as she played her not like Mia Farrow as a ditzy and over-the top, but gave her a level of subtlety, nerve especially when she talks back to Tom which was not as seen in the book, but was great to show Daisy not as a total ditz... and will that gives her character a level of vulnerability and strength that makes her love for Gatsby more believable cause she does love him too(aka the scene where she rips her wedding dress when she finds Gatsby is till alive). She was excellent t showing how Daisy craved Gatsby, but was unable to bring herself to make that fateful leap to him and his idealism, instead falling back to money and security, rather than love and freedom to be her own boss.Tobey is OK as Nick and he does seem believable in some scenes, and not in others. The music and the beginning was a bit odd, but the music really worked in the last hr and a half which were exceptionally filmed and really highlighted the chief symbols of the green light(hope, desire and Tj Eckleburg(God looking down at the moral decay of society.) The people who played the Wilsons were good, and weren't hurt by lack of screen time and the one who played Jordan was also quite good in the role. The novel in itself a criticism of America as its growing and evolving, yet at the same time losing its human and moral values as they slip into racism, bigotry, ignorance and individualism which is eerily similar to America today. The scene where Gatsby and Nick are talking about the past in my opinion was the greatest point in the film, and in my view get Leo the Oscar he deserves. Gatsby is like Jack from Titanic, he dreams of a life where he can get the love and fullness he craves, yet their destroyed by tragedy and classism of rich and East Egg looking down on the poor or old money. We all want to try and keep things as they were, but we can't as people and lives change and must move on to prevent us from suffering inside and outside which sadly Gatsby can't do and the real tragedy is he's the most honest, hopeful and real ""American"" who wants to change himself to achieve his dreams which instead lead to his destruction.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
don't know how i feel,"my girlfriend and i sat down and decided to watch gatsby. with decaprio i figure it would be great. decaprio was good at times, particularly the end. for some reason though none of the characters really garnered any interest from me. i get that it's a book adaption and that apparently the book was a love story, but i just couldn't enjoy it like i wanted to. aside from decaprio a lot of the characters were stale. i figured 2 hours and 22 minutes something is bound to keep my interest, and yet there were no highs whatsoever in the movie. not one climax or anything. the only reason i kept watching is because i paid 4.99 for the movie on demand. aside from the visual aspects the movie was highly disappointing. story and ending were decent at best. mysterious man? there wasn't much mysterious about him the whole movie. it was clear he was involved in bootlegging early on and i was waiting for some scene that would be so well crafted as to what gatsby was illegally in to. but of course there wasn't one. no climax, no point in the remake.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A mystifying hit, old sport","F. Scott Fitzgerald's timeless novel ""The Great Gatsby"" is a wonderful piece of literature that dabs into many themes and events despite boasting a rather simple premise. Its commentary on the American Dream, its noted palette of colors, and array of ambiguous characters make it one of the most fascinating books I've read in high school. However, it's an understandably challenging read, seeing as the visual representation of the color and descriptions of the parties are left confined to the viewer's imagination, making something very important to the book abstract and personal.It comes as a small surprise that he who mans the camera in the film is director Baz Luhrmann, a longtime Hollywood-man known for showcasing incredible visuals and limitless set designs. Luhrmann's grandiose vision is perfect for a story of this magnitude. He provides us with the best film rendition of ""The Great Gatsby"" I have yet to see, and one that perfectly compliments the style, tone, and thematic tendencies of the novel.The story is difficult to summarize to those who never read the novel. I question if those unaware of the book or its plot before the release of the film expressed interest solely by the trailers. The story concerns a group of wealthy socialites in 1920′s New York, with the central focus on Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire), a young, ambitious writer-turned-bond broker. In the middle of studying business, he is instantly taken by the way the areas of East Egg and West Egg interact and hangout and becomes immersed in the desirable lifestyle, reconnecting with his cousin Daisy (Carey Mulligan) and her husband Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton).He soon becomes aware of a man named Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio), an elusive figure largely concealed by his enormous parties that disguise his presence and true character. Many rumors exist about who he is and what he does, but the character is vacuous to everybody but Nick, who strikes up an early friendship with the man. Nick learns the justification for Gatsby's larger-than-life parties and mystifying ora is an overall attempt to get closer to Daisy. After being shipped off to war, he lost all contact and desperately craves her love and tenderness once more.Like most great works of literature, ""The Great Gatsby"" can be seen as an embodiment of several themes and ideas. Most commonly associated are its symbolic representation of the American Dream, along with a romantic love channeling obsession and the idea that money can't buy or produce happiness. Writers Luhrmann and Craig Pearce beautifully articulate this in an accessible, yet versatile way. The film should not be viewed as a party movie, although the parties are extreme and excessive. Nick describes them as a ""kaleidoscopic carnival"" and that is, by far, the best summation of the lavishness and vivacious qualities of a Gatsby party.The performances here are divine. Tobey Maguire and Leonardo DiCaprio are wonderful fits for their respective characters, each emphasizing their own particular qualities. Carey Mulligan of Steve McQueen's ""Shame"" is, at times, mesmerizing here, Elizabeth Dibecki does some fine work here, in terms of creating a character out of small parts, and Joel Edgerton is terrific as the incorrigible brute that is Tom. The talent combined with the pulsating energy of Luhrmann's production and effects creates an indescribable allure.This is the second film by Luhrmann I have seen, with the first being his dismal ""Romeo + Juliet,"" a film modernizing the iconic play by effectively creating a film for kids who don't like reading. With ""Gatsby,"" he has left a lot more in tact with the original novel and doesn't make too big of an attempt to rewrite its devices with things from the new-age. If one can overlook the anachronistic music by Jay-Z and Florence + The Machine, which can blend awkwardly with the aesthetics of the Jazz Age/Roaring Twenties, this is still a faithful adaptation of the beloved book. It also helps if you overlook the use of phrase ""old sport"" at the end of nearly every sentence Gatsby says.It's always intriguing to see a film based on a book many kids have read in school be adapted into a mainstream film. Detractors of it now become anxious to see it, and those who loathed it just because they were required to read and test on it in school flock to see it. For ""The Great Gatsby,"" I think it helps that Luhrmann's distinctly flashy style and bombastic image took the foreground for the marketing of the picture. Thankfully, this isn't a hollow and superfluous adaptation with little below the surface. It's a visual spectacle and a delightful picture completely fit for the cinema.Starring: Tobey Maguire, Leonardo DiCaprio, Carey Mulligan, Joel Edgerton, and Elizabeth Dibecki. Directed by: Baz Luhrmann.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Much more interesting in the second half.,"This movie did some justice to the book I feel. Leonardo was a good fit for the character of Gatsby, as was everyone else who was casted. Perhaps Jordan felt different in my mind. Toby Maguire was a mixed bag really, Ih haven't taken him seriously in other movies, but his performance was ok.What really lets this movie down is the CGI and the music. Both stick out like sore thumbs and are hard to get by. The CGI was terrible, many of the backgrounds reminded me of the images you could use on Apple products in Iphoto. The whole movie had an odd translucent glaze over it and the quality of the CGI for 2013 was woeful. The music was also a huge let down. Why were they playing music from the 2000's? Rap and club songs in the 1920s? It looked and sounded more like a college fraternity house party, than what would've been a reality in 1920. It felt like giving machine guns to Ancient Greeks and expecting them to treat it normally. This did not fit, it was a missed opportunity to bring to life everything that a book can only do in imagination. The costume design was a better fit and did not distract as much.I disliked the first half of the movie strongly for those CGI and music reasons alone, which were especially obvious during the party scenes. The movie was much more interesting, as was the book I found, when it came to the big conflict in what was Daisy going to do, and the fall out of the events that followed.This was done much better and my opinion and saved the movie from being a complete fail.Overall a missed opportunity on what could've been a great film.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Fitzgerald Passes It Over to Luhrmann The ""Great"" Great Gatsby.","It's usually on the second viewing of any film that I turn from the innocent audience member into the scrutinizing critic. I save the first viewing for total absorption in the movie. My first viewing of The Great Gatsby was quite an euphoric experience. Nevertheless, I don't expect everyone to love the movie the way I did because at the end of the day it's a matter of tastes and interests. All I'm trying to do here is to give you some reasons why I think Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby is an exceptional film.Let's start from F. Scott Fitzgerald's book. Most people have read the novel at some point in their lives. The Great Gatsby stands as a literary landmark in the history of American literature because it not only incarnates Fitzgerald' smart and swift style but also levels harsh criticism against the American highlife in the early twentieth century and iconically presents the complexity of the human psyche. Whether you like or hate the novel, do not let your judgment transform to prejudice, because Luhrmann's adaptation is a unique work of art that uses its literary source merely as a preliminary structure. That's why I will not get into useless comparisons and contrasts.The film has the unmistakable, authentic stamp of Baz Luhrmann an audio-visual feast for the senses. The extraordinarily picturesque quality of the film gives the story a visual edge that doesn't exist in the original text. Luhrmann's exuberant camera movements and his use of luscious colors and extravagant visual techniques create a sensuous atmosphere and succeed in conveying the lavish lifestyle of the American upper-class. Regarding the music (which I believe is not less important than direction, performance.. etc.), Luhrmann follows his genius habit of mashing up modern music and customizing it to old settings. In The Great Gatsby, his musical choices are BRILLIANT in the sense that they cover a wide range of genres including jazz and hip-hop (I never thought that one project would bear the names of both Fitzgerald and Jay Z!). The songs fit the film and its themes perfectly. They also give the story human depth and help in extending the movie horizontally by relating the mad 1920s to our 21st century. Honestly, the soundtrack needs a review of its own. Having a character of their own and contributing to the significance of the story, Lurhmann's image and music both join hands in fully engaging the audience's senses and hearts.Leonardo DiCaprio was outstanding! Do I need to say more? The guy never seizes to surprise me with his ever-maturing acting skills and his great selectivity (I still can't believe he's the same Jack Dawson I used to despise). Not many actors are capable of choosing their roles that wisely. In the film, DiCaprio breathes life into Fitzgerald's tragic hero and manages to capture all his charm and misery. Similarly, Joel Edgerton stands out as the oppressively dominating Tom Buchanan. As for Carey Mulligan (playing Daisy), I do believe she is a beautiful and talented actress; however, I don't think she was the right one for the role. She shows an overacted emotional involvement that contradicts with her character's deeds. The rest of the cast were definitely lovely.Back to Luhrmann, I believe that he deserves more credit for his bold choices and his ability to defy all the snobbish voices that frown upon modern adaptations of canonical literary works. His first adaptation, Romeo+Juliet, made his point clear. His second, The Great Gatsby, sets his own cult.Again, I don't expect anyone to love the film the way I did. But for me, a good film is the one that makes you hate going back to reality after watching it... the one that makes you wish it lasted a bit longer. Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby is definitely one.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Touch the Green Light,"Greetings again from the darkness. Movie versions of beloved books are always a risky proposition. Devotees of the written word recoil in disgust when a filmmaker dares re-imagine a character or scene, while critics take delight in itemizing each and every stray from the source material. Director Baz Luhrmann is an artist. His canvas is the silver screen, and he thrives in presenting his interpretations and visions. When he agreed to take on F Scott Fitzgerald's 88 year old masterpiece  one that consistently lands on the lists of top ten novels of all-time  he most assuredly prepared for the onslaught of criticism and outrage that would follow (and has). He must have also known that his work would delight and entertain those open-minded viewers not shackled to thoughts of a single ""correct"" form (it has).If you have seen Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge! (2001) or Romeo + Juliet (1996), then you are prepared for a Gatsby vision significantly different from director Jack Clayton's somber and oft-dreary version starring Robert Redford and Mia Farrow. Taking a different route altogether, Luhrmann worked with Jay-Z on the soundtrack that mixes Roaring 20's jazz classics with contemporary hip-hop. He worked with award-winning Costume Designer Catherine Martin (his wife) on creating a kaleidoscope of colors for dazzling outfits that range from Gatsby's pastel suits to the glitzy and sparkling party dresses at his over-the-top parties. Additionally, Luhrmann invoked the newest 3-D technology to add even more emphasis to the visual spectacle that included free-flowing champagne, high-gloss and high-powered automobiles screaming down narrow roads, sky-filling fireworks, and enough glittery confetti to stop down a parade. Jay Gatsby may know how to throw party, but so does Baz Luhrmann.Knowing this movie was coming soon, I re-read Fitzgerald's novel back in January. While I was once again struck by the depressing feeling it leaves you with (it is after all a tragedy), I was also reminded of what stunning prose the writer lays out. At times I find it borders on poetry. You may agree with many of the 1925 critics who claimed the characters are unlikeable and the plot has little to offer, though you must also acknowledge the work acts as a timeless reminder that the vast majority of us could never come close to writing something as beautiful.The cast members are talented and game for Luhrmann's world. Leonardo DiCaprio infuses the Gatsby character with the uncertainty and teetering balance of secrecy that Redford never could. His obsession with Daisy (Carey Mulligan) may be difficult to understand, but then why should obsessive love make sense? Joel Edgerton (as Daisy's husband Tom) is a womanizing brute who sets his own inherited wealth and culture as far apart as East and West Egg. Tobey Maguire's Nick Carraway is our lone claim to normalcy. He is thrust into the Gatsby world and never really understands it  but then who could? The Carraway character is my single biggest complaint in regards to the movie. The framing device of Nick writing the story down for his psychiatrist as part of his therapy, means we get entirely too much Tobey Maguire and Nick Carraway for my tastes.It's also a bit disappointing that we get so little of the strong supporting cast: Isla Fisher as Myrtle, Jason Clarke as Myrtle's husband, and especially Bollywood star Amitabh Bachchan as Meyer Wolfsheim and newcomer Elizabeth Debricki as Jordan Baker are seen and heard from entirely too few times. In fact, the Nick and Jordan connection from the book is mostly ignored. These are all fabulous actors who did what they could with the characters, but we should remind ourselves that Fitzgerald's book was always more about the prose than the characters or plot. He told us what he wanted us to know more than have his characters show us. That was his art form. Baz Luhrmann's art form is showing  and his show is quite a treat!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Luhrmann's back in shape!,"Luhrmann has been one of my favourite directors solely relying on his mastery with ""Moulin Rouge"". I enjoyed ""Romeo+Juliet"" also, but nowhere near as much as MR, and then Australia was kind of a let down. His visual style, however, has always been consistently amazing and his films are a true feast for the eyes.""The Great Gatsby"" continues this trend, and possibly pushes it further. With Luhrmann's trademark great and innovative cinematography, editing, costume design and art direction, Gatsby is technically top-notch. The impressive line up for the soundtrack also adds layers and layers to the film, in a choice similar to ""Moulin Rouge's"" soundtrack back in 2001. While some have complained about the over-stimulus visually and the over-the-top costumes and parties depiction in the film, I felt as if it was quite appropriate. It truly showed the lavishness and shallowness of those events, costumes and places, while at the same time allowing for the audience to see the emptiness of Gatsby's life.My only concern was the length of the film, but it is manageable. Almost as long as ""Australia"" was, it still managed to feel reasonably lengthy, instead of being a drag. Overall, ""Gatsby"" is a well-executed film with lavish sets, amazing costumes, beautiful soundtrack and all other technical aspects. Acting is rather good, too, with DiCaprio having a stand-out performance, while Mulligan and Maguire are rather sidelined in their conventional acting and do not quite push the envelope far enough. Nonetheless, it is a good film and I'd recommend watching it!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Walks a fine line between a musical and a movie,"Overall I enjoyed this movie for it's spectacular cinematography. Having read the Great Gatsby and enjoyed it for it's intelligent insight into the ""human condition"", I was pleasantly surprised that for the most part the movie delivered this in a visually stunning package.At times the development of the storyline, the imagery and the music all combined in such a way that you could be forgiven for thinking that you were for just a few seconds watching a musical. Often these moments caught you by surprise and distracted you from the key messages that were being conveyed.Leonardo DiCaprio is completely credible as Gatsby and drives the movie from start to finish. The rest of the cast has good performances, but the gap between them and DiCaprio is clear.I would have given this movie a higher score if it didn't live so dangerously close to becoming a musical, and if the rest of the cast had closed the gap to DiCaprio's performance.Worthwhile spending your time and your money watching this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Baz Luhrmann and his Gatsby,"Baz Luhrmann and The Great Gatsby sounds real eccentric. And this adaptation is the proof. I admitt, for me, Robert Redford remains the only Jay Gatsby. And the spectacular recreation of 1920 decade, the flavor of period, the luxury mixed with heavy kitsch are far to be surprising from this kind of director. But the film has two good pillars, more than interesting - Carrey Mulligan as Daisy and fascinating Wolfsheim by the great Amitabh Bachchan . And, not the last, the shining di Caprio, more portrait from an old Hollyiwood poster than the expected Gatsby. Another good point remains the tragic romanticism use. And the nice Nick Carraway of Tobey Maguire. Short, a glamorous film. Seductive, mpressive, moving. Not the best but real, real good. For details, performances and its admirable director.",,Anonymous,Romance
"The Great Gatsby is a cinematic, dramatic & visual feast.","One of the most awaited Hollywood movie this year. Based on a novel, its a story of Gatsby, more accurately a love story of Gatsby. Set in the New York City of 1920s, The Great Gatsby a cinematic, dramatic & visual feast. 3D effects makes it immensely absorbing and attractive. The grand sets, the attire, cinematography, music, dialogues & performances, everything together creates impressive scenery on the screen.The film is narrated by Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire-aka Spider man), who is the cousin brother of Daisy (Carey Mulligan) , who is married to one the richest man of America, Tom Buchanan, & is also the ex of Mr. Gatsby.Mr. Gatsby is a mystery. Nobody has exact clue about what he does and from where he got millions of money. Some says he is a spy, some says a murder, for some he is an Oxford man, a war fighter, a drug dealer, a Mafia & interestingly some believes he does not even exist. But he does, he has money, depth in his mind, has desires, determination, passion & most importantly hope (as reminded by the narrator time and again).Gatsby throws the most glittering party of NYC, time and again, but he invites nobody. Interestingly, in NYC, if it's Gatsby's party, it is understood that whole of NY is invited. Glamour, glitz, alcohol, drugs, girls, music (Jaz), dance floor, you can have all of them, as much you want, at no cost. He has bureaucrats, administrative people, wealthy people, celebrities and all, as guest, in his parties. He is respectable to all of them. Nobody knows (or even care to know) the reason for these parties. But he had the reason. Gatsby acts this way in hopes of winning back Daisy's, his ex, love despite five years of separation and her marriage to another man, Mr. Buchanan. He planned his reunion with Daisy and took help of her cousin, who is also his neighbour, Nick.The first half an hour tries to baffle you in the name of Jay Gatsby. Director, Baz Luhrmann, unsuccessfully tried to create hysteria of Gatsby. But, when he really appears, some 30 minutes later, smiling, dressed elegantly & talking gracefully, you feel like on cloud nine.I am a Leo fan and firmly believes that he is the best we have today. Leonardo Di Caprio, as Jay Gatsby, is a treat to watch. He is undoubtedly the most ( successfully) experimenting actors, who keeps balance of both commercial & artistic aspects, in the world today. Whenever you see him, you do not want to see anything else. After playing a cruel plantation owner in Django UnChained, he is immensely convincing as a baffling lover, who has a father like figure, who guides him in his works, played by none other than Amitabh Bacchan. Mr. Bacchan, in an special appearance (which according to him is not his Hollywood debut but a friendly gesture to the director) left his mark as an actor, unlike Anil Kapoor in Mission Impossible. He was raw.Tobey Maguire, the narrator, has in fact more footage than Gatsby himself. You see the film through his eyes & heart. But that's where films negative point lies, if there are any. Carey Mulligan, as Daisy, and Joel Edgerton, as Tom Buchanan are good. Particularly Joel Edgerton played MR. Buchanan, a rich American, polo player & flamboyant to the core.Script is a delight. NYC going through changes, post World War I, in 1920s is, off course, a work of imagination but it works like magic. Screenplay and cinematography are top notch. Dialogues are impressive, & the best part is you don't have to see dictionary to understand them. They are simple but have sole and wit in them.Overall, The Great Gatsby is a love story of selflessness which has some really good looking dishes on the supper table with an average starters, but good main course and desserts. Anything less than 7/10 will be an underestimation of this charming tale. What say ""old sport"" ??",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great adaptation of the book,"First of all, let me tell you that usually I don't review movies, unless it's a movie that either really impressed me, or it was really bad.I first saw the trailer of this movie a couple of weeks ago and then I've decided to read the book. I didn't manage to finish the book, (I've read around 80% of the it) and saw the movie. Later I've also watched the one from the 70s to be able to make a comparison.There are here people who tell that the book is the best and the movie is bad. This is partly true, your imagination when reading the book cannot be surpassed by the vision of one's director. However, I have to say that this is a very good adaptation of the book( nearly as good as Shutter Island, which is the best one I saw until now , in my opinion, of course)Leonardo DiCaprio does a hell of a job in giving life to the character of Gatsby. He's just like I've imagined while reading the book. So does Carey Mulligan(Daisy) and Joel Edgerton(Tom) too. Unfortunately I cannot say the same about Tobey Maguire(Nick), somehow I've imagined Nick as a different character: more confident, with more life. He's just a person that even if he knows he's poor, it doesn't bother him to hang around rich people. Don't get me wrong, Tobey does it's job well, he just doesn't excel in doing it. Jordan's character is hollow, but she's not very emphasized in the book either.What I really liked is, compared to the old movie, which is just the transposition of the book into the screen (just like a theatrical play), this movie manages to express all the emotions and feelings of the characters while preserving most of the dialogs present in the book. This is mostly the merit of Leonardo DiCaprio and Mulligan, of course, but all the other characters contribute to this.The set is very nicely done with beautiful ""special"" effects, especially at the beginning of the movie. However, the director took always great care to follow the book. The interior decorations are astonishing, by the way.The music: Now this, at the beginning of the movie was a bit disturbing, as it's a combination of music from the 20s with modern nuances; but it fits very well, making the story of Daisy and Gatsby timeless.What I really disliked, and this drifted from the book, is the fact that Nick is telling the story while writing the book. No, this was really unnecessary and the credit always belongs to the author, Fitzgerald. But the way the words appear on the screen... I have to admit that it was very nicely done.This movie is a must see, I'm sure it will win a lot of Oscars this year. Even if you have already read the book, you won't be disappointed, go and watch it.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Middling Gatsby,"Another entry in the Gatsby sweepstakes this is not a terrible film but strip away all the flash and it's an average affair.For some reason Hollywood continues to fail to understand that the magic of the book was in its elegant construction and beautiful phrasing where the specialness resides.The cotton candy excess of this version is very pretty but also unreal and adds nothing to the story. Another demerit is the controversial decision to use contemporary music in place of the appropriate jazz numbers that would give the proper sense of time and place. It's a nice try but distracting rather than enlightening and pulls you out of the story whenever one is played.That leaves the actors to drive the story over all the pomp, in most cases they fail.Leo is okay as Gatsby but only occasionally seems to get under his skin. Joel Edgerton cuts a fine figure as the boorish Tom Buchanan but the production swamps his few moments to shine.In the most problematic role of Daisy Carey Mulligan, a very talented performer, is unable to make her come alive. More of a concept than a character the part has more or less defeated every actress that has attempted her. Requiring a gossamer glow as well as a tinge of tragedy there are few women who have the proper mix to succeed in the role, perhaps the young Jessica Lange but she has no contemporary equal who has both of those rare traits.The characters of Jordan Baker, Myrtle and George Wilson have all been shunted to the side in favor of another CGI moment of showiness so the actors really don't have the opportunity to make much of an impact.The weak link in all this is Tobey Maguire who is terrible as Nick the narrator. He neither feels part of the period nor does he make his commentary compelling as Sam Waterston did in the Robert Redford/Mia Farrow version. His task is to pull the viewer in and his flat delivery doesn't do that for a minute.An ambitious failure but misses greatness by quite a margin.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

The Great (at least good enough) Gatsby,"Baz Luhrman knows how to throw a party. The party scenes stand out for the right reasons. The melodrama scenes stand out because they are on the stiff side. The exposure of the gun in the drawer is humorous. Baz, ""Old Sport"" if they take a hydroplane ride, show it, don't just cover it in voice over. What's one more CGI effect?Interesting use of music, even if it is contemporary and wasn't written yet during the time period of the film. Great costumes, interesting sets and cars add to the fun. Good performances all around.The ""Daisy"" uttered in the style of ""Rosebud"" seems to sum up the intent. It doesn't come close to a masterpiece but it works as a visually feast.

One of the most loyal adaptation's I've seen,"My favorite thing about this movie was definitely how loyal it was to the book. The dialogues, the suspense of several situations, were portrayed in this movie as good as Fitzgerald did in the book. Leonardo Dicaprio and Mulligan did amazing Gatsby and Daisy and I really enjoyed the photography. The only thing I didn't like much about the movie was the music (except for the main song by Lana del Rey which fit perfectly), I think that Luhrmann could have taken advantage that the movie is based in the 20s and could have put more Charleston or Jazz; it was an interesting experiment to put Hip Hop songs in it, but Jazz would have fit best for it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Something different becomes harder to devise with that many cycles through the material. But this cartoon has bright colors, loud sounds, obvious dialogue, broad acting depicting narrow, one-dimensional characters, and arrow-straight plot development, meant to spoon feed today's attention deficit- afflicted audiences. All of which is in direct conflict with the novel, none of which does it any justice. He might better have named the film, ""Nick Carraway's Day Off,"" and let people draw their own conclusions about provenance. On its own, freed from our expectations, it could be an enjoyable spectacle.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
After a year of waiting.... I am soooooooooo not disappointed,"I read the book last year, loved it, have read it two more times since, and after seeing every trailer for the movie I just could not wait for it. I was a little worried that my expectations would be too high and that the movie wouldn't reach them, but it definitely did. I loved it. The direction is a bit flashy and over-the-top as most Luhrman stuff is, but only for about the first 40 minutes or so. Once Gatsby and Daisy are reunited, the film has so much heart and soul and the film intensifies all the way up until the end. It was sad, tragic, and best of all, it carries the same themes and motifs from the book. If you're not familiar with the book you may question some of the stuff in the film, but I honestly think if you love the book, and have been waiting for a GREAT Gatsby movie (I didn't like the '74 one much) that is very true to the book, has some great acting (Leo's Oscar-worthy here, folks, and Mulligan, Maguire, and Edgerton give some of their best performances I've ever seen, and newcomer Elizabeth Debecki is just wonderful as Jordan Baker), beautiful visuals, fun music (the music here is cleverly done and didn't feel TOO out-of-place, and the mix of old-school and jazz symbolically works here in my opinion) and a basically over-all understanding of the book and it's meanings, I feel you will not be disappointed.Even as just a film, I do believe this film will become a true classic years from now, despite it's less-than-stellar box office intakes or poor-mixed reviews it's getting, I feel over time this will get good word of mouth and the general public MIGHT learn to love it over time.But we'll see. I loved it. 3D was well-executed too, imo. 9.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

What a movie is about.,"I was only interested in seeing this movie for its visual possibilities.I'm not a huge Leo or Toby fan. The first 30 minutes of the movie I was bored, didn't like the music and soundtrack, thought the cast was so ugly they were scary and just didn't get it. I was almost where I was thinking hmmm maybe time to walk out.After the first 30 minutes the movie picks up the characters begin to develop and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Leo's character and acting are superb. Toby does a nice job and their chemistry works well. The supporting cast is very good and the story itself holds its own. This movie is not a instant classic, however it was a great view and i would give it a solid 7 stars out of 10.EnjoyOther good movies to see...Iceman Hangover III (very funny) not as good as one..

It was a treat for the eyes. CGI is well done with only a few boo-boo's.The story is served at a constant pace and gives you time to process all the details that are projected onto your retinas. Although I'm not a big fan of DiCaprio, he still managed to intrigue me and convince me he can be a great actor. Someone else couldn't have done a better job.This movie kept me on the edge of my seat throughout until the end. I hope to see more of Baz Luhrmann !",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Surfeit of everything, but deep respect for Fitzgerald","The following is unlike my usual reviews for IMDb and other Internet movie sites, but the comments that I emailed to a friend right after watching Baz Luhrmann's ""The Great Gatsby"":""Dear M-----,""I just got back from watching ""The Great Gatsby"" tonight. The excessive, exhibitionist style tendencies of director Baz Luhrmann that I had feared were plainly evident. Surfeit of everything: flowers, decor, set details, but fortunately often gorgeous. Rap hip-hop party music in the 1920s? Please, that's the sound of today's disco clubs, exactly.But Luhrman's deep respect for a dead man more than saved him and made the movie one of the best I've seen in the past two years. That man is of course F. Scott Fitzgerald. So respectful that the literary great's texts at times float dreamily on the screen.Luhrmann co-wrote the screenplay, which delivered the spirit of the novel despite the over-the-top production. The ""be impressed!"" sets and overall design, and the re-imagining of New York in the 1920s were certainly impressive and sure credentials for Oscars.The Aussie director's another weakness: the actors. Nobody connects emotionally to anybody in this movie, except perhaps Tobey Macguire as narrator Nick Carraway, who sensitively connects to us. It was painful to watch fidgety Leonardo di Caprio in the first half needing the right cues and clues for acting. And whoever tailored his unflattering suits should be sent to .....Carey Mulligan's assumed persona is too strong for the part. Wanted: another Mia Farrow out-daisying the delicate Daisy Buchanan. (Did you notice that Mulligan does a dual role as one of the whorehouse girls?)Cesar""",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Quality Film,"As with many modern adaptions of classic work, there was a lot to live up to. The media hype surrounding the film was somewhat of an annoyance, and I can't help but feel it sullied my perception of the film somewhat before I had seen it.With this said, I can say honestly that Gatsby has managed to live up to most, if not all, of the expectation placed upon it. Whilst not what I expected, the film presents a lavish representation of an even more lavish story. DiCaprio's performance is top notch, as is Toby McGuire's. McGuire is able to more than hold his own alongside DiCaprio, who's powerful performance conveys strongly the depth of Jay Gatsby as a character.Luhrman's conveyance of Fitzgerald's world is very bombastic, and at times ventures away from the contextual reality of 1920's New York and into a world of colour, show and performance. Whilst this is mostly in tune with the hedonistic explorations of Fitzgerald, it does at times seem tacky and unnecessary. This results in some scenes feeling very staged as if a theater performance, with some dialogue seeming very forced. However, in light of this, I feel this is simply product of Luhrman's unique style, which for the most part makes for an enthralling watch.Ultimately, the hyperbole of Luhrman's world serves to accentuate the stark contrasts present within Gatsby's world and highlight the ever present themes of idealism, opulence and materialism. The performances are all top notch and the setting is outstanding. A quality film by any standard, certainly worth a watch - for both those who have read the novel and those who haven't.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

The Great Gatsby- Baz Luhrmann's Disastrous Focus on Lavish Style Over Substance Results in a Disparaging Adaptation of Fitzgerald's Novel,"There is certainly a timeless allure to the thin yet dramatically perceptive novel ""The Great Gatsby"" by F. Scott Fitzgerald that keeps bringing failed attempt after failed attempt to cinematically adapt its feverish tale of love amidst the backdrop of the Roaring Twenties. No one has ever really captured the novel's delicate intimacy, the time period's extravagance versus dispossession, or the thematic criticism of American decline in full leaving behind unfulfilling experiences much like with Jack Clayton's 1974 version, which starred Robert Redford in the illustrious title role. But no matter how ineffectual previous versions have been none are more misguided or more disastrously disappointing than director Baz Luhrmann's latest disparaging adaptation of ""The Great Gatsby."" Known for his excessively animated flair in films such as Moulin Rouge and Romeo + Juliet Luhrmann has always been the subject of interest in all of his films making them megalomaniacal exercises in overindulgence. One can ultimately imagine that this type of self-aggrandizing filmmaking would be drastically inappropriate for an intimately constructed story such as ""The Great Gatsby,"" and that assumption proves correct in more ways than one. Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby becomes a divisive clash of tonally inconsistent scenes where the slim moments of dramatic sincerity are lost through the high energy chaos that is the Luhrmann style wasting a great deal of the novel's potential modern relevance. All of the poignant themes and dramatic sensibility from the novel are lavishly overstated through overly vibrant camera-work, disorganized editing, and disconnected performances distorting the very values that the original novel intended to highlight. Luhrmann's cliff notes grasp of the material translates into an incredibly hollow and artificial experience where the glitz and glamour of the time period receives the utmost detail in glamorous 3D while the characters slip away into one dimensional obscurity. In this version of The Great Gatsby it becomes increasingly hard to beat on, boats against the decadent current, borne back ceaselessly into wasted opportunities.Read more: http://wp.me/py8op-y9 More reviews: Generationfilm.net",,Anonymous,Romance
Spectacle over symbolism,"First off, I will fully admit to not really 'getting' the novel. I thought it was fine but it didn't really stay with me shortly after finishing it. I was somewhat hesitant to tackle this movie knowing it was directed by Baz Luhrmann who isn't known for much subtlety in his directing.It does begin with an almost absurdly over the top scene showing one of Gatsby's famous parties. It's bright, loud and kind of obnoxious. It does eventually quiet down into a real movie. I might differ in opinion with a lot of reviewers on here but I feel as if Luhrmann does understand the book. The lost and found again love between Daisy and Gatsby is complicated and not unrequited on both sides. He built his entire empire in hopes to be with her and in that time she made her own life trying to forget him.The last half of this movie mostly makes up for the unfocused first. Somewhere when going through the checklist of what needed to happen it finds some meaning in all the bright lights and fast cuts. It slows down and becomes a genuine movie. Or at least half of one.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Luhrmann's 'Gatsby' may seem gaudy at first, but overall, it works","Baz Luhrmann's 2013 'The Great Gatsby' is the first adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's masterpiece that I've seen. Apparently, Hollywood has a poor track record with this novel. After five attempts that, according to some critics, would be better left forgotten, this one is a huge success in some respects.First of all, one can't see a Baz Luhrmann film and not expect an abundance of arresting visuals. 'The Great Gatsby' is a great example of it. The mansions and parties poetically described by Fitzgerald in the source material look just as good as I imagined them when reading the book.Secondly, Leonardo DiCaprio's performance is stellar, as usual. Maybe the Academy Awards will choose to reconsider their ridiculous grudge against him and at least nominate him this year. At first, it seemed like DiCaprio as Gatsby was a slight miscasting, although it didn't turn out that way. DiCaprio was able to capture the vulnerability of Jay Gatsby greatly.Now, the reason why I think that the critics weren't so enthusiastic about this film adaptation: because it simply isn't as profound. When Fitzgerald wrote the source novel and published it in 1925, he had written a poetic, cerebral masterpiece (I've read the book). It wasn't a love story so much as a statement about the Roaring Twenties and the bourgeoisie during that time period. The one problem with this film (besides some of the scenes being a little gaudy) is that it doesn't really seem to make that ""statement."" It's much more emotional than intellectual. I'm not saying it's Hollywoodized dumbed-down entertainment for the masses, but at the same time, it indeed seems to sometimes lack that evocation of the time period and its morals that Fitzgerald succeeded at.In other words, it's everything I expected in a Baz Luhrmann 'Gatsby': while it may not show the same intellect that its source material does, it's entertaining, well-acted, and contains amazing visuals that ultimately make it a great movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Baz Luhrmann film,"If you don't like the director's style, you should skip this one because it carries his style from the first to the last shot.

It can get a bit boring at times but never for too long.The sets and costumes are very pretty and the acting is good.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
unique and beautiful but not for everyone,"Let me start by saying I have never read the book and never saw the movie with Redford. Also ever since Romeo + Julia I have been avoiding every Baz Luhrman movie. The way he destroyed that story still give me the creeps. However I heard that this movie was quite good, so I decided to watch it after all and I must say I was surprised by how good it really is.The beginning of the movie makes you remember Moulin Rouge, placed in a more or less fairy tale setting this movie has nevertheless a very dark and dramatic tone mixed up with a romantic story. Tobey Maguire and Leonardo Dicaprio do a good job, but it is Joel Edgerton that steels the show. In an unbelievable way he transforms himself in a very energetic antagonist that just gives you the chills.The Soundtrack is amazing, I was surprised about the mixture of the modern soundtrack and the old setting (beginning of the 20th century). Personally I thought it was a vivid and energetic mixture that makes the movie even better.After having seen the movie I didn't understand how so many people could hate this picture, the movie is definitely not for everyone but nevertheless it's a must see for everyone who likes a real dramatic love story.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A somewhat peculiar adaptation...,"7 because both Toby Maguire and Joel Edgerton were very, very good in this...Peculiar, because it completely moves away from the POV of the narrator in the novel; Nick Carraway. The novel has the narrator, although first person, telling the story in almost a third person POV; he is rarely seen in the story at all. He is the outsider looking in, and it is quite detached; it is this that makes it such an interesting and unusual novel.Baz has chosen to do something quite different here, and unlike the novel, and the first cinematic version starring the great Robert Redford as Gatsby (I love DiCaprio... but not the same), Nick Carraway's character, the narrator, becomes much more centre stage. In fact, this seems to be a study in what the viewers/readers would see, if this character was much more visible, rather than narrating from the sidelines.I thought that was an interesting perspective and idea, which worked well because Toby McGuire is so fine in the role... but it did focus on him so much, that it detracted from the original plot quite a bit. It stands alone as a good film, but loses some of the original depth, especially the enigma that is 'The Great Gatsby', because it's really Nick Carraway that takes the main role here... and there's no real reveal of Gatsby (and what is shown, seems rather trivialised). In the original (and the novel), a sense of pity, or at least empathy, is easily elicited for Gatsby – who is, in the end, a rather forlorn character... I didn't feel the same was induced at all in this production, and so it seems to have missed the point.Unlike Moulin Rouge... I hated the music choices here; there are so many fine jazz choices that the decision to use rap, house, and other inapt music really, really jarred. It was a wasted opportunity to include some of Australia's finest musicians (Goytye, my friend, Wally, in the closing credits, the exception, of course!).Overall enjoyed it, but far from a masterpiece...",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Mixed feelings,"For me the most enjoyable element of the movie were the nostalgia-like reconstructions of the historical city. Sure some scenes seemed slightly fake in places but the CGI was generally remarkably good and I loved the feeling of going back in time. Of course watching Black and White movies really do take you back, but, and I hate to admit this, colour does add that extra dimension. The rest of the movie fails somewhat. Modern Hollywood movies are generally acted pretty well except for one vital element - chemistry. Chemistry is missing so often in modern movies I'm wandering what the matter is. The leads seem somehow miscast. Toby M. seems too wimpy, the lady was not charismatic and Gatsby lacked presence. Tom was the only actor who did seem genuine. As for music, that was horribly judged. They put all the effort into the visuals to make us feel part of an historical world, then yank us out of it by playing modern crap like Rap. Note to filmmakers, Rap is cliché now, pretentiously besmirching a movie with it does not make your film hip with the kids. It just makes you look desperate. After the build up the movie didn't really seem to have much to say and was not at all moving. But the loving reconstruction of the old City was incredible.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Great Movie Downgraded By Its Focus On Spectacle Rather Than The Story,"I didn't (and still haven't) read F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby, which many consider to be the epitome of the great American novel. However, I have seen some of director Baz Luhrmann's work, being Romeo + Juliet, which I thought was absolutely atrocious and a failure at what it was trying to accomplish. Luckily, walking out of the theater I was not displeased or annoyed, but I felt like I had just watched what could have been one of the best movies of the year...had a few things been changed.First off, I got to mention Leonardo DiCaprio as Gatsby. I know it is a cliché to say that DiCaprio nailed it in a movie, but I felt like he really took over the role of Gatsby and breathed life into it. Every time he's on screen, he completely holds your attention. I'm not sure how his performance matches with the character from the book, but as far as I'm concerned, he killed it as Gatsby. I also have to give credit to Joel Edgerton as the antagonist Tom Buchanan. You absolutely hate his character and root for Gatsby to win in the end.There's also a really great script here. The dialog is fast-paced and well written, and the way the story goes and comes together is definitely well done. And it had characters that I was invested in. I was interested in seeing where Gatsby came from and how the main character (played by Tobey Maguire) dealt with being around all this madness. It also ends really sad too, and it definitely felt effective in many ways.Sounds like a pretty fantastic movie, right? Well, a lot of these things I enjoyed about the movie are often masked by the focus on the visual aspects. This movie has great visuals, sure. The costumes are excellent, the cinematography is gorgeous, and the visuals, when needed, look great. But they completely take over and feel so bombarded in your face that it took me out of the movie at multiple times. This felt very loud, in sound and style, and the modern rap songs played when the film is set in the 20's felt completely out of place. It feels like Luhrmann was trying too hard to make this modern and a spectacle, and in the process forgot to focus on the already fantastic script and actors in order to drive the movie.However, I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy The Great Gatsby. It was fun, well-acted, and had a great story and dialog. Even though I complained about the visuals being loud and distracting, they're still fun to look at and look spectacular. So while it may not be a perfect film, The Great Gatsby is one that I would recommend checking out, even if you're not a fan of Luhrmann's previous work.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A movie full of glitz,glamour,grace and Gatsby","Leonardo DiCaprio as always was the strongest force behind this movie, his acting skills were definitely a treat complemented by Tobey Maguire and his subtle but soft narration. i strongly suggest this movie if and only if you'd like to shut your logical thinking and get lost in the grand display created by Baz Luhrmann. good movie to people who like acting and art but can be a bit boring to the one's who are into commercial cinema. the reason i gave it a 7 is that the movie as a whole unit does look pretty appealing but then when you go ahead and watch it you realize that not much of it makes sense. Certain characters were more highlighted than the rest.I would say its a one time watch movie for non DiCaprio fans. if you are the kind of person who thinks about what has he/she learned from the movie, i suggest you to skip it but if are the kind who believes in true love and admire the zeal of a lover its a strongly recommended must watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
I really enjoyed it,"I had heard quite a few bad opinions of The Great Gatsby, and also a lesser number of good impressions, so I wasn't sure what to expect from it. For me, Baz Luhrmann has been mildly hit and miss, though mostly when it comes to his films I find that they're hits, for me personally. I do know that I can generally expect some wackiness from him, and Gatbsy didn't surprise me in that regard. But I'm pleased to say that all in all I did enjoy this movie.I thought it was beautiful visually, and compelling in terms of storyline. I can't say that I adored the soundtrack, unlike some of other films of Luhrmann's, but I didn't hate it or think it ruined the movie either, as some other people seem to feel.I love Leo and thought he was great in his role. It was a little strange seeing Tobey Maguire trying to be a ""wizened, washed out drunk"", but I still enjoy his acting and thought he was good in this. I love the world that he ventured into but found it pretty sad how things wound up - I could really feel the ""haunted"" vibe that he was talking about by the end, and felt the same way myself, as if I was actually there experiencing it.All in all I think it was a great cast and well-executed.

Only the second film that I have ever seen that must be viewed in 3-D,"I could not imagine watching Hugo in 2-D. I did not care much for it in 3D frankly but it was a superb use of the medium. For me 3-D has been disappointing more often than not, that includes Avatar and a host of Comic book films that I have seen plus a handful of animated films, though I also feel ""How to Train Your Dragon"" was certainly worth the extra few bucks for 3-D. So that is it out of a couple dozen films that I have paid to see in 3-D this is only the third one that was really worth the extra price. And truthfully, seeing ""How to Train Your Dragon"" in 2-d would be almost as good as in 3-d.I am also not Baz Lurhmann's biggest fan having felt Moulin Rouge and Romeo and Juliet were quite mediocre. I really enjoyed Australia though (I know I am in the minority on that one.)I guess I am glad this film has opened to some mediocre reviews because I didn't have the greatest of expectations, but it was a wonderful film. Starting with the spectacular visuals. I tell you I think I would have enjoyed the film with no sound just to watch it as a moving canvas. But the sound was almost as phenomenal. I am an old guy. The idea of Jay-Z doing the Soundtrack for a classic novel was underwhelming at best to me, but I was happily surprised by the beautiful soundtrack throughout. I enjoyed every note. It also helped tie in the themes of the novel with the excesses of our present society.I am a huge Leo DeCaprio fan and once again he gave a great performance. This was Joel Edgerton's best role besides maybe ""Animal Kingdom"" which is a real favorite film of mine. He does a sort of Gable impression as Tom Buchanan but it really works. Carey Mulligan was surprisingly strong as Daisy. My one disappointment may have been Tobey McGuire. I normally really like him as an actor but here he doesn't really deliver as Nick. In my mind, there is no great logical progression to the character that he has become in the first scene as he flashes back and tells the Gatsby story.An extra bonus is that my daughter is planning to read the novel now. She reads a lot, but has avoided most classics. I loved the novel when I was a teenager, I am glad the film pointed her to the book. My daughter is 14 now, so I am not seeing as many animated films as I did a few years back. Maybe 3-D has been used well in some more recent animated films, but I don't miss any Marvel or DC filmsTrust me, if you plan to see this film, and you really should, do yourself a favor and see it in 3-D.

Modernized a wrong novel,"Personally, the director Baz Luhrmann's unique transition style is not working. Camera Flies through air from a distance with CGI, awkward visual distortion to the actors and actresses' bodies. Distracting and a bit of a waste of time or budget.One of the many reasons that I was wanting to watch this movie was the great Jazz era of the 1920s that the great Gatsby has as its background. It was supposed to be the grand beginning of Jazz. However, Luhrmann ended up using very upbeat, modern artists such as Jay-Z or XX. I could think of that as a fresh point but I am not sure if that 'fresh point' is worth cutting out the powerful evocativeness of the 1920s Jazz era. Color editing in the movie was, I would say close to the mood that Jazz has, especially in party scenes with lots of blue, silver and cool green.In contrast to the negatives above, actors and actresses were tremendous in most ways. Although I think Leonardo Dicaprio was better in different movies, he is no doubt a great actor. So in this movie, 'Leonardo Dicaprio not being Jay Gatsby himself', wasn't a big deal. Also Tobey Maguire: I thought that I saw very similar acting or expressions to the 'Spiderman' trilogy. Anyway, Joel Edgerton who plays Tom Buchanon was absolutely suited for the role, and He was exactly what I imagined while I was reading the original story, and the rage looked so real. Just as these, I could see a decent amount of good acting and directing (camera movement also.).Good casting, good acting and then mediocre directing. 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Famous scenes and symbolism re-imagined beautifully but also problematically,"""In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since. 'Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,' he told me, 'just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.'"" I have been frequently convinced that Baz Luhrmann does not know how to read, but I do have the advantage of literacy. However, I am not Nick Carraway and am not compelled to follow his father's advice that opens Fitzgerald's classic novel ""The Great Gatsby"".The first big problem with this movie version is that Tobey Maguire's Nick is not the same Nick that we know and love from the novel. This Nick is a quirky, agitated simpleton who has gone insane and has decided to become a writer. His voice and disposition was all wrong. Nick is no longer our credible vantage point into the selfish, boorish ways of the old money and new money of Daisy, Tom, Jordan and Gatsby in East Egg and West Egg.Much has been said about the lavish style of the film's sets and imagery and even more about the ludicrous soundtrack. But it mostly works. I don't think anyone can deny that the unrestrained money, extravagant mansions, brilliant costumes and choreography with a lively score just make the whole story seem more fun.I still have no idea what the point of the 3D was. Nick's bow-tie and the strange shooting style (mostly prominent early on) just made everything look cartoonish. At times, it looked like they were driving Gatsby's yellow car through the set of ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"". The cartoon- stylings mostly affected Nick; Gatsby's parties are always supposed to be at least slightly surreal.Problems definitely arise in the beginning when Luhrmann chooses to use his typical flash editing and put some party scenes out of order. The randomness of it all and Nick becoming even farther removed from the narrator we once trusted, was only re-confirming that this was in fact the disaster many expected it to be.But then we met Gatsby. And more importantly, we met Daisy. And even more importantly, Gatsby met Daisy. It is literally impossible to live up to the expectations about Gatsby – both the man built on wild whispers of him being a war hero, but also the literary character so ingrained in popular culture that he has earned the adjective ""great"" in front of his name. Leonardo DiCaprio does as good a job as anyone could reasonably expect of him. He drew me in, and since Nick couldn't do that, it was even more than I could ask of him.One of the significant themes glowing throughout the novel is that of hope. Luhrmann even recognizes this with Nick referring to Gatsby as the singularly most hopeful man he has ever met. And then we would get a shot of the green light glistening off the water and through the fog from the end of Daisy's dock. The one thing missing from DiCaprio's interpretation of Gatsby was that earnest hope. I felt like a photographer on a model shoot: ""Now give me a look of hope! No, that's anger. Give me hope! No, that's sadness. Give me hope! No, that's frustration. Fine, just give me another look of despair.""Gatsby yearned for Daisy. And so do we. Carey Mulligan's Daisy was probably the most accurate character re-imagined from the novel. Starting from her introductory scene where she lay on the couch and the wind rustled her white curtains and her diamond ring sparkled in the daylight and then she turned to stare at Nick, she filled the screen with her ethereal beauty and faux innocence. I don't think it's surprising that the film takes its best form in the scenes where it's just Gatsby and Daisy.It's hard not to get wrapped up in the grandiosity of Gatsby, the grandiosity of the story, and the grandiosity of the film's visuals. It's a beautiful story and it does look beautiful on the big screen, but then comes the nagging suspicion that Luhrmann never actually read the novel. After all, half of the quotes are just paraphrased and are not the actual lines from Fitzgerald, and all of the scenes and famous imagery are only the ones that have seeped into the public consciousness (straight from the Cliffs Notes, perhaps).

Scott Fitzgerald novel doesn't needs its plot explained but I must admit that I've never quite experienced a film like it. I say this because I watch a lot of movies and most of them are either great, good, fair or poor. The strange thing about this movie is that the first hour is downright bad but like a miracle the second half is pretty much a masterpiece. I've never witnessed a film that managed to do such great things after getting off to a bad start. With Luhrmann you know that he's going to bring his own vision to the screen and for the first hour this style, fashion and glamor pretty much take over the story so much so that you really can't see any of the classic novel there. It seems that Luhrmann's main goal is to show off this CGI New York of the 1920s and the various ways that he can shoot a party sequence. I found these things to be rather boring and over-the-top to the point where there wasn't a need in called this The Great Gatsby as they pretty much could have just made a separate film about the Jazz Era. Even stranger is that I didn't care for Leonardo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire or Carey Mulligan during these early scenes. The only actor who can survive the crazy style was Joel Edgerton as Tom Buchanan.Then, the really strange thing happened. When Daisy (Mulligan) is invited over for tea and has her encounter with Gatsby (DiCaprio) it's a rather magnificent scene full of romance, drama, tension and a bittersweet laugh. From this point on the film settles down with the style and turns to telling its story and this is where the greatness shines. Whereas the actors were buried in the style and CGI of the first half, now they're able to really show their talents and each of the four main ones fit into their roles perfectly. DiCaprio is wonderful as Gatsby as he just has a certain look in his eye that manages to show off the character's rage and passion at all times. Maguire looks really bad in the first half because of non-stop stupid facial gestures that the director makes him do but once he can ""act"" he does a great job. Mulligan perfectly captures the spirit and look of the 1920s Jazz period and I thought she fit the role just fine. Edgerton is the real standout and does a masterful job with his role. The music score, the much hyped music score, isn't nearly as distracting as one thought it would be but it doesn't mix well with the over-the-top style.If you walked into this version an hour late you'd walk out feeling as if you've seen one of the best movies of the year. The second half of the picture really grabs you up in the terrific acting and the wonderful story and there's no question that the passion and haunted jealously of the characters really come to life. The final sequence inside the hotel room where all hell breaks loose is something truly thrilling to watch. With that said, you still have to wonder why Buhrmann would slow things down during the second half. For the life of me I can't understand why he ruined the first half with the non-stop style only to end it and let the story do its power. The final 80-minutes of the picture are excellent and would be Best Picture material but you still can't overlook or forget the flawed beginning.",,Anonymous,Romance
The Great Gatsby Forced through a Kaleidoscope -- And It Works!,"8/10Baz Luhrmann's ""The Great Gatsby"" is an eye-popping, over-the-top, hyperkinetic, loud, heavy-handed circus, opera, and kitchen sink drama. Luhrmann takes F. Scott Fitzgerald's quiet, brief, cerebral novel and forces it through a kaleidoscope, crashing and scattering images in a peacock-colored, geometric Busby Berkeley dance routine. The amazing thing is, it works. The heart and soul of Fitzgerald's novel are there on screen, and honored. Underneath the literal glitter – that sticks to characters' faces and shoulders in multicolored patterns – this is a genuinely serious film about big themes. It entertained me, it moved me, and I cared.I am very sensitive to color and there were scenes in Luhrmann's ""Gatsby"" when I was overwhelmed by chromatic sensation. There is a hotel room orgy. The women wear vivid, finger-in-your-eye obvious eye shadow that contrasts with their vivid, obtrusive colored jewelry that clashes with their crazily colored dresses which throb in contrast with the hideous, red, patterned wallpaper which I am sure is the wallpaper in the hell that bad interior decorators go to. In another scene, purple, blue, and gold metallic streamers cascade downward on a dancer in a buttercup-yellow, ostrich feather tutu.And it all moves so fast. That ostrich feather tutu is on screen for seconds. The camera just keeps moving on to the next visual sensation. The costumes, the cars, the special effects, Bollywood film icon Amitabh Bachchan as Jewish gangster, Meyer Wolfsheim!!!: this movie's fabulosity budget must have been a zillion dollars.Luhrmann lays everything on with a trowel. Long after the audience has realized that certain characters are users whose wealth protects them from the consequences of their evil deeds, Luhrmann tells the audience that, not just by speaking those words from Fitzgerald's book, but by writing the words out on the screen. Luhrmann shows, he tells, he beats you over the head. Only twice, though, did I feel he'd gone too far. Once when an obviously fake shooting star crossed the screen not once but I think three times, and when a character, struck by a car, is shown hurtling through space not once but twice. Once really was enough in both cases – one shooting star, one hurtling corpse.There is a scene in this movie that took my breath away. After all that jazz, and color and movement, the movie just  stops. It stops in a hotel room. If you've seen the film, you know exactly which scene I'm talking about. There are no special effects in this scene, no fireworks, no presto changeo. It's just a group of people sitting around talking. And suddenly you feel as if you are on Broadway watching a Tony-winning production of Eugene O'Neill. That scene make my guts churn; it broke my heart. Is Luhrmann showing off here? Saying, See, I could hook you in with fabulousness, and now I will move you with nothing more magical than words and real feelings.The cast is perfect. Leonardo DiCaprio totally owns Jay Gatsby. DiCaprio manages to be human amidst all the glitz. He conveys Gatsby's power and his vulnerability. His voice is perfect; he sounds like someone trying to sound like a Kennedy. Joel Edgerton inhabits Tom Buchanan's brutality and snobbery. Isla Fisher is solid trash. Carey Mulligan brings Daisy to charming, pathetic, despicable life. Tobey Maguire is appropriately observant, lost, tempted, and jaded as Nick. Gorgeous Elizabeth Debicki channels Kirsten Scott Thomas. Richard Carter conveys quiet menace as a character whose job it is to announce, ""Chicago is calling."" If you can make that line scary, you are very talented.The soundtrack mixes genuine jazz age music with rap-influenced music, and it works, too.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Pleasing to the Eye, Ear, and Heart","I've literally never seen more people divided on a film as people are on the Great Gatsby. Having seen it last night, I liked it. First of all, it was true to the book. When a moment happened in the movie, I felt the exact same way as I felt when I read it in the book. That, to me, is a successful adaptation. The sets was amazing and so colorful and gorgeous. I have never, ever seen sets like that. Some might say they were excessive, which they were, but I think the reason they were was to convey the time period's tone of excess and greed, which it did effectively. The cast was very good. Leonardo was a very good Gatsby, McGuire is perfect for the awkward, 3rd wheel narrator Nick, and Mulligan is solid as Daisy. Finally, for all people dissing Jay-Z's music choices, the soundtrack worked. The music fit the moods of the respective scenes and also fit with the colorful excess of the sets. Ergo, it did not feel out of place.My conclusion: It wasn't trying to be exactly like the book. It was trying to put a slightly 21st century spin on it, which I understood and appreciated. Was it excessive? Without question, but I almost feel like by being excessive, it properly conveyed the emotions the story is supposed to convey. In the end, I felt the way I was supposed to feel and while I probably wouldn't have chosen to remake the book quite this way, I thought this adaptation was interesting, colorful, emotional, and a solid film in its own right. Not great, but definitely good and worth seeing in theaters too. (This is coming from someone who hardly goes to any movies in theaters)",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Everything Old Is New Again, and Again, and Again, and Again.","Every time that Hollywood runs out of good, original, ideas, it reaches for the classic novels that made for good movies in previous iterations, and re-shoots them.Each time, they try to reclaim the factual past in terms of history, and yet tweak the story to make it seem fresh and new.For the fifth time, Hollywood has reinterpreted F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel of the same name, and, for the fifth time, the reinterpretation is about as far afield from Fitzgerald's original book as it is possible to do and still fill the theater seats.The production isn't bad, but there are historical glitches that jump right off the screen for those who know a little history.Nevertheless, the new generations will enjoy the story for what it is: a good yarn that is worth retelling.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Story is the best part - and that's great,"Not a lot of movies can leave a long impression on the viewer, but luckily this one will. I have to admit, I didn't read the book, nor did I see previous movies. But in terms of the story I was completely absorbed from start to finish. Who is this Gatsby and why is he doing what he does?The filmmakers did a great job bringing the roaring twenties onto the screen, the atmosphere, the costumes (watch the costumes closely, I'm a man but I have to admit, they're really beautiful), New York, cars, booze, dancing, pomposity. I'm not sure if mixing modern music with old was the best choice, I don't think it was, but it was certainly 'brave', and something different.I was disappointed by special effects, they look quite cheap in some scenes, and were distracting. The acting was truly good and although I found Leonardo really great in the role of Gatsby I couldn't shake the feeling off, that I could imagine someone else, slightly better, in his place.Overall I think the story is by far the best part of the movie, and I think you won't be disappointed by watching it. Now off to read the book:)",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Completely captivating and utterly breathtaking!!!,"I watched The Great Gatsby for the 12:00 premier date. Since then, I have been witnessing the mixed feelings expressed by other critics. I have to say, whoever does not approve of this movie, I cannot explain how they came about this disapproval. I, like many, have been waiting for this movie for over a year now. After watching all 2 1/2 hours of it, all I wanted was to hit replay and watch it all over again! If you've read the book, the movie is SPOT ON with the story as far as sequence of events and script performance by the star-studded cast. Baz puts the icing on the cake with his ""over CGI'd"" elaborate production, leaving every person bewildered and amazed. If Baz had stuck with a hum drum bland 1920's era set and production, The Great Gatsby would just be another puppy love chick flick with no pizazz or excitement. Baz, you are a genius at everything you've done with this classic American novel adaptation. I, for one, give The Great Gatsby a 10/10. I RARELY give that awesome of a rating for a movie (Inception was the last 10/10 I've given).",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Plain bad,"The most shocking in this movie is that a director managed such badly with regards to the cinematography — especially during the first hour — with those continuous travellings, CGIs and other unrefined green-screen that succeed each other at a frantic pace to try to blow the viewer away with this tawdry and corny universe. And what about the anachronistic soundtrack which associates rap, RnB or dance to the 1920's... it must be a joke.And if the form is a complete fiasco, the content also struggles to convince. The first hour is very long and doesn't develop much, favoring the visual aspect and stylistic effects. The movie becomes a little more interesting when problems arise but it remains really laborious until a final outcome that doesn't trigger any reaction. On the whole, the script is a lot too linear, it doesn't arouse any emotions and the characters, who are sold as ultra profound, all seem shallow as the tacky world they live in.Only the cast barely saves the day in this incredible flop that is The Great Gatsby.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Don't Waste Your Money or Your Time,"The Great Gatsby is one of my favorite novels. It was required reading in American Lit. However, the movie is mockery of F. Scoot Fitzgerald's novel. The novel left much for the imagination with its powerful imagery. This movie sucks. It is like a comic book version of the original novel leaving nothing to the imagination. It is only what the movie maker imagines, not what Fitzgerald had in mind. As for the cast, the last person that should have been cast as Gatsby is Leonardo DiCaprio. He not only doesn't fit the image of Gatsby, trying to make him Gatsby is like trying to drive a square peg through a round hole. And he doesn't even come close to acting like Gatsby.If a viewer had read Fitzgerald's book and then walked into this movie without knowing that it was supposed to be based on the novel, one would not have recognized the movie. Perhaps a viewer would have believed it was some sort of sequel.While the earlier Great Gatsby with Robert Redford was not perfect, at least it strongly resembled the novel, which this last version does not. So if someone wants to see a movie version of the Great Gatsby, watch the Redford version. Don't waste either your money or your time on this wacky version. Best yet, go read the book which I am doing again. That is the only benefit I got from watching the movie. It got me to read the book again which after this stinking movie, made me realize how good a writer, F. Scott Fitzgerald was.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Visually beautiful, ""The Great Gatsby"" accompanies a soundtrack that has everything to be a success in itself and has a well-sewn story, including some suspense","The opening minutes of ""The Great Gatsby"" seem to say: ""What you viewers are about to experience is something great. Forget that there are limits, budgets or technological barriers. This Hollywood cinema manages to trample. But be prepared: the road to this period adventure, even if it is immersive and dizzying, will also be winding during the 142 minutes that it takes"". Dry cut. Flashback. Flashforward. Ball scene. Now a flying tracking shot of the magnificent recreation of early 20th century New York. Back to the narrator character. This frenetic style printed in the first half of the plot does not deny, especially to those who have watched ""Moulin Rouge"", that ""The Great Gatsby"" is indeed a product of Baz Luhrmann's filmography. The director ""abuses"" these and other resources with the clear objectives of taking the spectator away from entertainment cinema and showing virtuosity and power as the conductor of the production, budgeted at US$ 105 million.For Baz Luhrmann, ""The Great Gatsby"" is a story that oscillates between operatic and melodrama - two tones absent from F. Scott Fitzgerald's book, which, in a lean and elegant narrative, used its characters as allegorical figures of a society whose economic prosperity appeared as a cover for a profound poverty of values - and which, in an almost prophetic way, indicated the inevitability of the approaching Great Depression. However, despite this conflict of atmospheres between book and film, it is curious to observe how Luhrmann's work is successful most of the time precisely by giving energy and color to Fitzgerald's evocative words while remaining faithful to its plot even adopting a new structure to transport it to the screens.Transforming Nick (Maguire) into a recovering alcoholic who is encouraged by a doctor to narrate his story, the script by Luhrmann and Craig Pearce focuses on the boy's arrival in New York in the early 1920s, when he decides to work as a stockbroker and moves into a small cottage situated next to an imposing mansion. Resuming contact with his cousin Daisy (Carey Mulligan), now married to the rich and pedantic Tom (Joel Edgerton), Nick eventually becomes friends with his millionaire neighbor, the mysterious Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio), who dreams of resuming his old love relationship with the cousin of the new neighbor.Opening the narrative with black-and-white vignettes surrounded by a golden frame that refer to the historical plunge that he will promote in an era of temporary abundance, Baz Luhrmann already demonstrates creativity by employing 3D in an inventive way by illustrating precisely this immersion - and , later, when he uses the resource to highlight windows of the neighborhood observed by Nick, we clearly perceive that the filmmaker is determined to use the three-dimensional language as an active part of the narrative instead of just as a slot machine resource. Furthermore, by maintaining a great depth of field in the long shots that traverse his universe in flights made possible by digital effects, the filmmaker creates an engaging visual spectacle, even if, here and there, his stylistic excesses really bother - as, for example, by focusing on Daisy and Tom's daily life as a life of luxury in which the servants open the terrace doors in a careful choreography and in which the living room curtains create a convenient ballet to introduce Gatsby's beloved.In the same way, the production design of Catherine Martin (wife of the director), although impressive in its scale, reveals a punctual inconsistency when oscillating between more naturalistic tones (although grandiose) and others that go beyond the border of caricature - as in the scene that focuses on a small party in a multicolored apartment populated by women wearing absurd make-up. In this aspect, by the way, even the actors' approaches vary wildly: if Carey Mulligan constructs Daisy with a suffered and contained voice, Isla Fisher transforms Myrtle almost into a version of Miss Hannigan from Annie, which indicates a certain lack of definition on the part of the director with regard to the narrative. This, however, is more than compensated for by the inventiveness of Luhrmann, who does not bother to show reverence for the original text and, thus, repaints ""The Great Gatsby"" with his characteristic palette, going so far as to surrender himself completely to the Moulin Rouge mode in the sequences depicting the title character's megalomaniac parties.For someone like Baz Luhrmann, bringing yet another adaptation of Fitzgerald's short story would be the opportunity to not only bring the tragic love story between Jay Gatsby and Daisy to the attention of the modern world, but also to give Luhrmann his own unique style to a story which, by itself, already required a more stripped vision to portray the spirit of Fitzgerald's work and his criticism of consumerism and social unrest that masked empty and superficial lives. In parts, Luhrmann was successful. Its exotic look makes ""The Great Gatsby"" a visually appealing experience, marked by grandiose sets, impressive special effects, luxurious costumes and beautifully dressed actors. As required, Luhrmann manages to portray how intoxicating the eyes were the parties given by Gatsby, who under all that luxury, hid a human personality, with its own ambitions and frustrations. The pop soundtrack, a device already seen in the aforementioned Moulin Rouge, is again well used here, inserting songs by artists such as Beyoncé, Jack White, Florence & The Machine, Jay-Z and Lana Del Rey, which perfectly match the proposal of portray the grandeur of the festivities. Aesthetically, ""The Great Gatsby"" is a film full of attractions.Baz Luhrmann, however, fails to portray the opposite side. Perhaps, being fascinated by his own visual conceptions and letting himself be carried away by his extravagant taste, the director ends up neglecting to develop the more human side of the story, which he asked for a more restrained look at his characters. In fact, Luhrmann lets himself be carried away by the didacticism and speed of his narrative (which does not prevent the film from being absurdly long) which distracts the director from essential details for understanding the story. Contrary to what he claimed to want, Luhrmann fails to capture the spirit of the book and its time in its entirety. His heavy hand contributes to this not happening. Excessively concerned with the context, the filmmaker misses the opportunity to portray, in a vivid way, the obsessions of human beings who seemed to have everything, but whose main need was the desire to have the person they loved by their side. The film evokes echoes of ""Moulin Rouge"" and ""Romeo and Juliet"", but without the same effectiveness of both.The graphics that convert passages from Fitzgerald's text into elements that float across the screen manage to curiously highlight the strength of the author's words - which, at other times, end up finding equally powerful representations through impressive images such as the aerial shot that contrasts the areas green and elegant from the mansions of the millionaires to a world taken by the gray and inhabited by those miserable that make possible the way of life of the super-rich. In this way, the excess soon runs out of steam, the use of 3D, previously adequate, becomes expendable, and what remains is an experience that, despite attempts, goes nowhere. If the film manages to portray, however minimally, the characteristics of Fitzgerald's classic, it is due to its cast in great shape.Effective in creating immense suspense for Gatsby's entry into the scene, the feature still benefits from a stupendous performance by Leonardo DiCaprio, who leaves Alan Ladd and Robert Redford, previous interpreters of the character, in the absolute shadow by managing to embody the subject as a man. That maintains the aura of mystery even allowing that, here and there, we perceive a certain insecurity and his uncontainable desire to be understood and loved by those around him - which opposes Tom's dry and arrogant posture and even the comfort that Nick, even without money, feel when around your peers. Carey Mulligan, on the other hand, dodges Daisy Buchanan's annoying silliness so present in the book and gives us a composition that oscillates perfectly between sweetness and mysterious fascination, in addition to the actress being always a sight for sore eyes. And even the always questioned Tobey Maguire manages to insert a natural naivety to Nick Carraway, the one who enters and discovers the mysteries and desires that surround Gatsby's life behind his luxurious parties.In this regard, ""The Great Gatsby"" achieves its greatest narrative victory by allowing us to see how Daisy is, at heart, an idealization of Gatsby - who, in turn, is seen in the same way by Nick. And if this adaptation by Luhrmann works dramatically better than previous attempts, it is also due to its ability to humanize the title character without completely revealing him, making it clear that, despite being strong in his own way, the poor guy has committed the wrong. Basic error of devoting the purest feelings to the wrong person and building them up through filth and crime, failing to realize that by doing so you only ensured the certainty of your own suffering. As the credits roll, the feeling upon leaving the session is that ""The Great Gatsby"" fulfills its task as an audiovisual work. It is visually beautiful, accompanies a soundtrack that has everything to be a success in itself and has a well-sewn story, including some suspense. But it goes far, that is to say, from belonging to the top of lists of great cinematographic adaptations. Especially for the duality between the first and the other acts, for not assuming a constant line of narrative development.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Lush Delicious Thumping,"Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) recalls his time with Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio). It's 1922 on Long Island. Nick rents a small house next to Jay's mansion.

The music is perfect. The movie has the grandiose vision that it so desperately needs. Leonardo DiCaprio is perfect for this role. In many ways, he brings his real life and breathes it into this character. His real life models-filled-partying ways make it so realistic. Carey Mulligan brings a more sweet sensibility.

I, for sure, LOVED this movie and highly recommend it. it annoys me that critics always have to comment negatively; on course a book isn't a movie, so it will NEVER be the same. baz lurhman's movie The Great Gatsby, was once again breathtaking and fabulous! it's definitely a movie to see!!",,Anonymous,Romance
So Much Better Than I Expected!,"I refused to see this movie when it came out, because I'm still having nightmares from seeing the Robert Redford version ""in my younger and more vulnerable years."" I also saw MOULIN ROUGE and I could imagine only too clearly what Baz Luhrmann was going to do -- two hours of kaleidoscopic madness in day-glo color.Much to my surprise, this new version of THE GREAT GATSBY, while not great, is far from terrible. Oh, there were a few horrible slips that made me grind my teeth. Like when a cheerful flapper says ""Gatsby's cousin to the Kaiser -- you know, the evil German king."" Thanks for the history lesson, Hollywood! Or when Klipspringer is changed from a poor, hungry boarder who plays the piano to a glam-rock version of The Phantom Of The Opera. That was horrible! And it was exactly what I was expecting from Baz Luhrmann.But there was so much that I didn't expect. I never thought Leonardo DiCaprio would nail Gatsby so completely. He didn't get stuck on the handsome war hero stuff, like Robert Redford. He went deeper. He got the nervousness, the restlessness, the sense that this guy knows he's a fake and is scrambling to keep up with a dream that's getting farther away from him by the second. I thought Carey Mulligan was wonderful as Daisy, too. Every time she seems too shallow and silly to be interesting there's this flash of terrible sadness in her beautiful brown eyes that shows us that this Daisy knows she can never have Gatsby. And that she doesn't deserve him. Oh, and when Daisy delivers her famous line about crying over Gatsby's shirts, Carey makes that work too. It's not her fault idiot-boy Baz has Nick rush in to explain that she's sad over ""five lost years."" Thanks for clearing that one up too, people! I also want to mention that Joel Edgerton was an amazing Tom Buchanan, if anything maybe a little too sympathetic and likable. The fact that he breaks Myrtle's nose is given much too little attention in this version. But Tom's racism is handled with grim frankness and is totally authentic. Newcomer Elizabeth Dabecki is perfect as Jordan Baker -- the moment when she tells Nick ""but it wasn't a coincidence at all,"" is really heartwarming and hopeful, just like in the novel. I wish we'd seen more of this Jordan. It's interesting that Baz changes the ending so that Nick ends up babbling in an asylum like a refugee from the works of H.P. Lovecraft, but he can't rustle up a happy ending for Nick and Jordan.That would have offended me a lot less than having Nick explain what Daisy means by saying ""it makes me sad because I've never seen such beautiful shirts."" I got what she meant just fine.Oh, and why does Klipspringer have to play Bach on the organ instead of ""Ain't We Got Fun"" on the piano? Because it's cooler? Please!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The greatest 'Gatsby',"Often when a classic novel is adapted into a film, a director leaves their personal tics outside the door in an effort to make an adaptation undying in its reverence to the source material. Appropriately, Jack Clayton's overly inert 1974 version of 'Gatsby' is an example, because it was simply a direct translation of the book on screen with no surprises or filmmaking flourishes. As its star, Robert Redford commented, ""If a film is just totally loyal to the book, then why make the film?"" Unsurprisingly, the same cannot be said for Baz Luhrmann's adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's sublime novel, as this is clearly a Baz Luhrmann film in the same way that his take on 'Romeo and Juliet' was. For those unfamiliar with the Aussie director's filmography, what does this mean for the movie? The answer can be pinpointed to Gatsby's introduction in the film and how it contrasts with the same moment in Clayton's version. In the latter, Gatsby quietly approaches Nick and they engage in a gentle conversation; however in the former, the bombast of Rhapsody in Blue plays and a smiling Gatsby turns to Nick raising a glass of champagne as fireworks explode in the background and guests dance about wildly.'The Great Gatsby' is set over one summer in 1922, as fresh-faced stock- broker Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) moves to New York from the Midwest, living in a small cottage across a bay from his beautiful cousin Daisy (Carey Mulligan) and her blue-blooded husband Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton). Nick is slowly drawn to his mysterious millionaire neighbour by the name of ""Gatsby"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) and becomes increasingly intrigued by his past.Many of this film's detractors have complained that it is a prime example of style over substance, which although not the case in my opinion, it is undeniable that it does carry a significant amount of style. The party scenes are so dazzling on initial viewing that they are almost dizzying; every frame appears as though Baz Luhrmann meticulously thought-it-over, which works effectively in portraying the inflating excess of the period. This 'Gatsby' is a real visual spectacle in the way that no previous adaptation of the novel ever was. Immensely detailed, the beautiful depiction of twenties-era New York feels very alive and vibrant, helping to keep the viewer consistently engaged in the period lifestyle . The movie's visual side is expertly complemented by an anachronistic Jay-Z produced soundtrack that works surprisingly well.One of the biggest flaws of the 1974 adap of Gatsby was Robert Redford's poor performance as the titular character. Thankfully, in reuniting with his 'Romeo + Juliet' director, Leonardo DiCaprio has become the greatest Gatsby. He perfectly inhabits Gatsby, understanding the depths and nuances of Fitzgerald's creation, delivering a performance that is by turns, assured, insecure, passionate and tormented. DiCaprio is supported by excellent cast who also manage to bring their characters to life, whether it be Tobey Maguire's effortless turn as narrator Nick, Carey Mulligan's great portrayal of Daisy (a considerably difficult role to nail) or Joel Edgerton's pitch-perfect grasp of Tom, holding his own brilliantly with DiCaprio in a hotel room scene.'The Great Gatsby' is, as far as I'm concerned, one of the greatest novels ever written and thankfully, it is safe to say that while Luhrmann has made a recognisably 'Baz Luhrmann' movie, he has also made a film that is pleasingly loyal to the book, grasping the subtleties in the text. This adaptation of the Roaring Twenties' definitive novel really does roar into life, much like Gatsby's yellow behemoth of a car. This is a lively, inventive and immersive piece of work with visual spectacle, emotion, impressive direction and superb performances. Finally, we have a great 'Gatsby'.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Alright Gatsby,"There is something about this movie I always enjoy. I'm not sure if it's the anachronistic touches, the cinematography and stylization, the over-the-top and yet incredible soundtrack, the period appropriate ham ups done by the actors.

Baz Luhrman's style restrains the true drama and meaning,"The Goods The visuals were nice, the party being a highlight of course. The wonderful Carey Mulligan was superb at the best of times, the highlight for me being her garden. Some of the music touched on parallels between modern day and the past, and worked on occasion.The Bad The obscure vision kept an uncomfortable distance between the audience and the true potential of the film, grinding down to a shallow 'Virginia Woolf' style train-wreck, which has it's merits, but pales in contrast to the true point of the story. For me, what the film should have been trying to do was put more emphasis on 'decent men in an indecent time' and vice-versa.Nick Carroway's perspective carried little weight from the opening scene, being almost nothing more than an empty spectator/ a device of storytelling. And the distance between the characters and any real definition created a domino effect, making attempts at intimacy bizarre, and every 'old sport' pathetic. From the point of Tom Buchanan's house, things were clearly not going to change - making a large novelty-esque sketch of life in that period, rather than approaching the characters in a noire gritty style, with Gatsby's fascade as the relief.The musical ideas brought some interest, but were ultimately poorly conceived, and simply added to the chaos. Luhrman's Moulin Rouge was evidently perfect for his style, but trying to apply the same 'lense' to a dramatic piece like this simply distorts what could have been a much better connection to the true themes of the original story. Reading the book will give you a much more refined sense of the personalities which were to a large degree lost and jaded in the film.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
a visual feast,"Leonardo DiCaprio is ""The Great Gatsby"" in this 2013 version of the F. Scott Fitzgerald novel, where the rich are different from you and me. The film also stars Toby Maguire, Carey Mulligan, Joel Edgerton, Elizabeth DiBicki, and Isla Fisher.Directed by Baz Luhrmann, with costume design by his wife, Catherine Martin, the production is an absolute feast for the eyes, brilliantly beautiful, exaggerated, over the top, and spectacular. The big screen is the only place to see it. The lavishness represents the '20s atmosphere, and I noticed that some of the female party performers were cast according to the look back then - bigger legs, curvier, which is correct for the time period. There was the flat flapper look back then as well which was also represented. Luhrmann again uses the conceit of anachronistic music. It didn't bother me in Moulin Rouge, and it didn't bother me here.I'm an old timer, so I saw the 1974 version on the screen not once, but twice, because a friend of mine returned from Europe and hadn't seen it. Since it was extremely heavily publicized, he wanted to, so I went again.I'm unclear as far as what people's memories of it are -- some people on IMDb seem to think it was a great classic. That isn't how I remember it, either seeing it or in the reviews. Robert Redford was terrible, too cerebral, and Mia Farrow was worse. It was a beautiful looking film, and it had Sam Waterston as Nick, who got the only good reviews. His performance completely stomps on the miscast Toby Maguire's here. Luhrmann's instinct, to cast both Daisy and Jay as very youthful and fresh, flopped when it came to casting Nick. As the narrator, he needs to be more mature and less homespun.Both Mulligan and DiCaprio had an innocence in their performances, with DiCaprio giving a real powerhouse performance, embodying the idea of hopefulness, passion, illusion, and desperation. And he looks spectacular.I haven't yet seen my perfect Daisy. It's not Mulligan, though she's a good actress and gave Daisy a naiveté and a frailty. Mia Farrow captured the airhead part, which was emphasized in that film, and she had the beauty. I guess I never felt that either one was portraying a southern girl during that period. I thought Joel Edgerton made an effective Tom.Baz Luhrmann is a visual genius, and I love his films, going back to Strictly Ballroom. I felt here he was fairly reverent when it came to the material and if it was a touch over the top, it certainly makes for a theater-going experience. The emphasis here is on the mystery of who Gatsby is, but he doesn't neglect the poignancy and the message of the piece. The rich are different from you and me.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

A missed opportunity!,"You can see a potential in this movie. Sadly, the premise was used to make a fancy and fast blockbuster without much soul, heavily relying on colors, CGI, and Leonardo DiCaprio to make it appeal to the masses. The later starts acting only in the second part of the movie, the whole plot is faster and you can see why everyone is complaining to the soundtrack. Yeah, it's made to fit by the great use of scenography, but, still, where's jazz in the movie about the time of jazz?! Instead we get rap and pop... We hear foxtrot once, and it's the best piece of music in the whole movie. The last 30 minutes of movie are the best and alone make watching feel great, which is good, because if it was to be judged by the rest of the movie, it would be very bad. Casting is good for the most part, though I would prefer someone else for the role of Daisy and Jordan, but it is what it is. It is a good movie, but not a good adaptation of the book. Joel and Toby do a good job though. I am giving it 6.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

The Roaring Twenties old sport,"Yes this movie wasn't really a surprise to me, more of a oh it's another Baz Lurman film. One that seems to take all the kinetic energy and throw it in your face with a cannon. It's a movie like Speed racer that is full of high octane energy and cg on over drive. What makes this movie so well done and so interesting is it's take on the source material. The Story is well known and has been read by more people than seem to live on this planet. If you don't know well it's the story of one mans obsession to get back the woman he left behind and still longs for and the effects on the world around both of them. Now I haven't read the book, luckily it wasn't a required reading for me but I can see why this book is so well revered. It takes a topic like long lost lovers and throws in the roaring 20's and all that jazz. It makes you realize that even though the world around us changes, we all yearn for that someone and cling onto that perfect on the outside high culture figure. Whether it be Justin Bieber or Elvis or the Beatles or Hugh Hefner or Great Gatsby, all were loved and all were adored or still adored. It's in this fashion that I think Gatsby works well enough, it takes people that we can idolize and turns them against one another in glorious fashion. Now this isn't a perfect film and is extremely long for what is only a 160 page novel. It drags in spots, so much so that I was checking my phone. Some of the characters are great Dicaprio and Edgerton some are not (I'm looking at you Maguire). It doesn't mean there not good, just all not well cooked in the oven. With that though and with any Baz Lurman film, your going to get razzle dazzle and this movie does it well. It's fun to watch the drunken debauchery on the parties Gatsby throws and even fun to see New York Before a hell broke loose with the stock market crash. I think it would be fun to spend a day in this era of time. In the end The Great Gatsby is fun but not perfect. It's a movie that I enjoyed but won't see again.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Modern Reincarnation of a Literary Classic!,"This modern retelling of the Great Gatsby is actually a lot better than people give it credit for. It's a film that goes a long way in successfully adapting the themes based on the abundance of wealth and love into the final product. It is visually enhancing and the visuals make the film borderline magical. It's vintage 1920's New York thanks to the strong production design and the costumes are realistic, thus giving the overall film a realistic tone. However the one thing that annoyed me was the music. The score itself was fine, but there shouldn't have been any rap music in a film that takes place during the 1920's.Baz Luhrmann's film has Luhrmann's trademark flair for visuals so the movie was certainly pretty. But this film is about a poor man named Nick Carraway who moves in next door to his mysterious neighbor, Jay Gatsby. The two men get to know each other slowly but surely, but when Nick finds out that Gatsby is in love with his cousin, Daisy, things will surely get complicated.Leonardo DiCaprio made an excellent Gatsby and he really captured the essence of the character. He really showed how Gatsby doesn't fare well in public and all his fake smiles, but he really showed the love that he had for the married Daisy. Leo had a scene here that really reminded me of a scene of his in Django Unchained and both involved tempers. Tobey Maguire does an excellent job as the narrator of the story who is drawn into the mysteriousness of his neighbor. Joel Edgerton does a great job as Daisy's suspicious husband, Tom. Carey Mulligan certainly makes an elegant Daisy.Overall, this is a fine adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's beloved novel. With all the main characters here, each one of them has their faults and we hate them for that, but we are drawn into each character wondering what will happen next. I was absorbed into the film, and I even forgot at times what will happen (I read the novel, so I know), because I was so absorbed. If it wasn't for that blasted hip-hop music, this film would have been near perfection. But alas, a very good film anyhow. I rate this film 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

The Glossy Gatsby,"Viewing with no knowledge of the storyline nor expectations, the Great Gatsby was an interesting and enjoyable watch and delivers visual delights that gloss over its flaws, but flaws it does have.Firstly, if unfamiliar with the now 93 year old original novel, this vivid and slightly surreal adaptation presents a vision of 1920s New York that can lead you down a false path of wondering whether the tale is one big dream and if Gatsby is a figment of Nick's (our narrator and main protagonist) imagination or even whether Gatsby is perhaps some kind of conjurer magically manifesting his fantasy mansion and its entourage of characters into reality; notably as we first meet him flitting around his party sporting some kind of sorcerer's ring, which though the camera pans in on it on numerous times it receives no explanation other than latterly seeming to reflect with his obsession for the green light of the pier at Tom and Daisy's shoreline home. However, we should really take cue simply from Nick's first colourful experiences of New York City to understand that everything in the story is portrayed as larger than life and in the extreme. It is of course to be expected if (but only 'if') you know that Baz Lurhmann is at the directorial helm, with Moulin Rouge helping to explain the hallucinogenic hues of Gatsby's world, although this can be bewildering at times to the uninitiated viewer, especially when suddenly presented with Gatsby's yellow car darting around impossibly from West Egg to Manhattan like some cartoon car from Roger Rabbit (as others have suitably compared the scene).Layered on top of the cotton candy dream-world is a modern soundtrack with notable use of Jay Z, Beyoncé and the XX. It's a bold move and challenge to established formats of period dramas being married to contemporaneous compositions. It's a fun rule to break, but the result is patchy in its application and the cynic within may wonder whether the score has been sold out to music execs pushing for that attractive soundtrack spin-off extra revenue. These things can be overlooked, as the ethereal feel of the film also somehow manages to mask a fairly substandard script (at worst when forced to listed to Gatsby's catchphrase of 'Old Sport' seemingly stuck on repeat, critical character underdevelopment (most notably with Elizabeth Debicki's intriguing but unexplored character of Jordan) and mediocre or hammy acting, of which nearly all the actors seem to be guilty of at some stage. When all is said done though, this is still a fun ride of a film and its imperfections are hidden with aesthetic distraction and its quick pace, despite clocking in at 143 minutes run time (although shorter if you deduct the soundtrack credit roll at the end).",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Great F. Scott! Gatsby remains Gatsby, after all.","F. Scott Fitzgerald certainly was one of America's famous writers. He knew the world of ""The Jazz Age"". Alcohol was illegal, morals were looser, women had their hair and skirts shorter and there was the haves (Rich) and the have-nots (Poor). It was all good for a moment and then just like that...it was all gone. So, strictly speaking, if you got yourself into the world of Fitzgerald with his third book that came out in 1925, ""The Great Gatsby"" (I know I have), then you wait and see what Gatsby has in store for you. By Gatsby, I do mean Baz Luhrmann, that visionary wild genius who brought us ""William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet"", ""Strictly Ballroom"" and ""Moulin Rouge"", brings us ""The Great Gatsby"", but in a way you haven't even visualized it before with the use of mind-blowing 3D. Teaming up with his frequent collaborators, co-writer Craig Pearce and Luhrmann's wife Catherine Martin (who does the film's wonderful production design and lavish costumes), he gives us a ""Gatsby"" that may not be in your head, but it's everything that we wanted to see and more. Also, he frames the story differently but remains true to the spirit and the words of what Fitzgerald was writing about in the book. (They literally leap off the page and into the screen.) The narrator/observer of the story is Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire), a 29-year-old man who buys a house on West Egg, Long Island, New York (which was actually shot in Australia) while working as a bondsman on Wall Street. Set in the summer of 1922 during ""The Jazz Age"", Nick gets himself caught up in this whole new world where booze, partying and sex were not prohibited. One day, he gets invited to a party run by his next-door neighbor Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio). Turns out that this Gatsby has a lot of secrets. Are the rumors (German spy, war hero, killer) even true about him? Nick warms up to him a little bit, as Gatsby wants something special to complete his perfect world. Meet Nick's second cousin Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan). Gatsby has a strong connection to her, as he wants to continue with their relationship that happened five years ago, when she was a rich blossom and he was a poor soldier. Turns out though, she's married to Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton), a racist and sleazy snob who cheats on her with a mistress named Myrtle Wilson (Isla Fisher) whose husband George (Jason Clarke from ""Zero Dark Thirty"" and TV's ""Brotherhood"") is an auto mechanic. Once Gatsby and Daisy's relationship starts to bloom, it's all starts to go downhill, which leads to events and secrets that are...quite unexpected. ""The Great Gatsby"" has something to ask us: Does it look and feel modern, while remaining true to the time period? The answer is yes. Absolutely, yes. What Luhrmann does, amazingly in my opinion, is to combine the world of jazz into the world of hip-hop with help from rap star Jay-Z (who is one of the executive producers of this movie as well as contributing 4 songs to the soundtrack). It all connects somehow, purely anachronistically weird to put modern music in during the summer of 1922, but it works. The brilliant soundtrack also gets help from Beyonce, Andre 3000, Fergie, Sia, will.i.am, Florence + The Machine, Lana Del Rey, the xx, Bryan Ferry, Emeli Sande, Nero, Gotye and the perfect use of Jack White's cover of U2's ""Love Is Blindness"". As a fan of Luhrmann, I loved that he uses the images that were in the book and turned them into something magical. Images like the green light, Gatsby's yellow Rolls-Royce and the blue sign with the eyes of Doctor T.J. Eckleburg will stay with you forever. Plus, the cast is phenomenal. DiCaprio makes a great Gatsby, for sure. He keeps it cool and calm, and there's a fantastic scene in which this Gatsby ultimately snaps at Tom while trying to defend Daisy's honor. Mulligan is a great Daisy, she's a sweet girl on the inside without a doubt, on the outside she's emotionally fragile. Maguire still keeps his boyish charm and gives such a terrific performance as Nick. Edgerton is appropriately sleazy as Tom, Isla Fisher carries some emotions and high spirits in her small role as Myrtle and Clarke has some moments that will ultimately break your heart as George. Also, a wonderful newcomer from Austraila, Elizabeth Debicki is beautifully gorgeous as Jordan Baker and Bollywood legend Amitabh Bachchan is a solid Meyer Wolfsheim, breaking through the walls of typecasting. ""The Great Gatsby"" is another golden experience from Luhrmann, a endearingly tragic love story at the core of it, but at the same time, there is also some social commentary going on there too. It's the perfect summer escape from all the superhero movies and action films that are coming out at the movies throughout the summer. It's a wild, enthralling and captivating romantic drama that glows with moments of sheer enchantment. See it in 3D, as Jordan Baker would say: ""It kinda takes your breath away."" Fitzgerald would've been proud for sure.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Just never sold on it,"So I decided to watch this on a complete whim. I have never read the book so this quick review is from a entertainment, one off watch viewpoint. And as the title suggests I just never got fully sucked into the plot.So I think this is one of the rare occurrences where I think you actually do need to read the book prior to watching this, to get a good sense of what's actually going on. First 45 mins or so I felt completely lost and I just feel like it was made with the intention of the audience knowing about the book. So if you haven't read it, I would give this a miss.So having said that, it's hard to really write a proper review when it was meant for an audience that isn't me. The plot itself was okay, like I said it was one where I never really got sucked into it. I wouldn't say there was anything really wrong with it, I think it just lacked that cutting edge, That ""wow"" factor almost, to keep me occupied and interested. The characters were again just okay. The acting from everyone was outstanding and they were performed amazingly. But it just lacked that something.I was a huge fan of how the film was shot though. Some amazing cinematography and colours were used throughout and that was definitely something that was above par and noticeable throughout.But yeah, overall I found it just be just okay. Quite average. If I had read the book would I think it's better? Quite possibly yeah. At best it would have 100% helped out, especially in the beginning stages. So I'll go 6/10.

Mr Gatsby is portrayed to be a man with manners and charm, but almost no one knows about him. This adds to the mystique of this character, driving viewers to want more.The opulent settings and the extravagant parties are very astounding.

"Visually Dazzling, albeit lacking in Engaging Storytelling,","The Great Gatsby is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a terrific cast. It's a visually dazzling film that is very appealing to the eyes, Baz Luhrmann's flamboyant directing style is visible throughout, and the fantastic cast manage to blend it to this universe perfectly, with their stunning outfits and terrific characterisation. The highlight has to be Leonardo DiCaprio and Carey Mulligan, their chemistry is stellar and very sweet, the scenes they share together saved this movie from being a six. While the style is truly beautiful, I felt the director was far too focused on it, and much less on story, no matter how great a movie can look, we will notice if the story is lacking. Nick and Gatsby's journey is a slow moving process and it never feels like they truly emphasise the weight of their dilemma, as a matter of fact I never felt truly concerned for these characters, they are never in a position that could make me feel this way, Luhrmann's style will not be able to distract you from this for two and a half hours. The soundtrack was one of my biggest problems, they should have kept it like a fun, campy 50's style movie, but they simply had to be modern, throwing in songs for the likes of Kanye West and Lana Del Rey that feel out of place and somewhat disturbing, I was not one bit impressed to hear them, they should have stuck with the classics that suited the overall tone perfectly. It is jam packed with flaws, but The Great Gatsby is still very enjoyable because of a charming performance from DiCaprio and beautiful cinematography, it's worth the watch if you ever see it on television or Netflix, but do not go out of your way to watch it.A young trader soon finds himself tied up in the life of an eccentric millionaire.Best Performance: Leonardo DiCaprio",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The roaring twenties,"Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby is an extravagant anachronistic stage bound spectacle that is glorious in 3D. It is loud, noisy and brash just like one of Jay Gatsby's weekend parties.F Scott Fitzgerald's great American novel is given a modernist twist but the moral centre remains as represented by Nick Carraway's (Tobey McGuire) narration whom unfolds the story of the vile people around him with only Gatsby having some decency left.The tale is of the mysterious Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio) who have moved to be near his old flame Daisy (Carey Mulligan) in 1920s New York. Jay was once a poor boy who went off to fight in the Great War. He is now wealthy and made up tales about himself. Is he from a wealthy family, an Oxford man or a bootlegger? He throws parties to get near to Daisy, rekindle his lost love and he brings Nick to the fold because he is Daisy's cousin.Daisy is married to Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton) a vile man who cheats on his wife, he brags, he lies and has crackpot theories of the superiority of the white man. He also has money of the old kind, inherited.There is an interesting cameo from Bollywood legend Amitabh Bachchan as Meyer Wolfsheim, Gatsby's ally who has human molars as a tie pin and who never accurately gives the impression that Gatsby could be a gentleman.Maybe DiCaprio overdoes the 'Old Sport' line and is in some ways is less aloof than Robert Redford from the 1974 version.

"Fitzgerald Meets Jim Henson's ""Labyrinth""","The husband and wife team who made this film worked hard to get all of the historical details correct, but anything that is good about the film gets lost in the unrelenting use of overpowering ""Hollywood"" film techniques.It looks like an overproduced Disney-Jim Henson-George Lucas-Wes Anderson computer-generated fairy tale. F. Scott Fitzgerald meets Jim Henson's ""Labyrinth."" I have nothing against ""Labyrinth,"" Henson, Disney, George Lucas or Anderson. In fact, they are all genius filmmakers, and I've loved many of their films, but ""Gatsby"" is not a fairy tale story. It is a story meant to be about real people in an actual place and time, in this case, New York and its environs during the pre-Crash Roaring 20's.I'm sure many will defend the film by saying that it is trying to capture and express the quality Roaring 20's with its lavish, decadent, no holes barred orgiastic parties, boozing, gangsters, money lending and trading. But this picture is all psychedelic party with no pathos.In ""Steel Magnolias"" the character Shelby describes her wedding colors as ""blush and bashful."" Her mother clarifies that she means ""pink"" and it looks like somebody vomited Pepto Bismol all over the church. That's what happened here. The film makers don't know when to stop. They are so enamored of CGI, 3-D, and any other eye-popping technique at their disposal that they use every crayon in the box — over and over and over again. They ruined this the same way George Lucas ruined the nearly unwatchable ""Star Wars"" prequels: by stuffing and cramming the movie with technical production magic.As a result, nearly everything else is lost amidst the mess: the characters, the zeitgeist, the time and place, and the story, not to mention any subtlety — from a novel which is essentially one long lyrical poem.The movie is also overwrought from beginning to end with ridiculous over-stylized tropes, like choreographed scenes of footmen throwing open doors in unison and swooping in and out of scenes like a Broadway cast of chorus boys.With one grand exception the acting is quite good. In fact, the depiction of Tom Buchanan is probably the best I've seen. He is the best portrayal of the boorish, bigoted, entitled, old money American blue blood I've seen. Leonardo DiCaprio's Gatsby is also a very good portrayal of the character. (Gatsby remains a chimera to the end of the book, so any reasonable portrayal is open to interpretation.)Toby Maguire's portrayal of Nick Carraway, the story's narrator, is just awful, though. I've liked Tobey McGuire in everything I've seen him in, but whether it was his acting or the direction, his portrayal of Nick Carraway is ham-fisted, awkward, and silly — even embarrassing.Rather than portraying a detached young, upper crust (the character of Nick is from a ""good family,"" monied and well-off though nothing on the scale of Jay Gatsby or Tom and Daisy Buchanan's riches) war veteran who is just four years removed from the horrors of mechanized mass killing, Toby Maguire's Nick Carraway looks and sounds like an adolescent on junior high summer break in a world of adults. That's a shame because I suspect Maguire has the acting talent to actually get the part right.Lots of folks criticize the film's use of rap and hip hop music. Even though I don't like hip hop personally, I understand its use here. Hip hop is the jazz of our day. After a hundred years, jazz has become too historic and canonized to capture and signify the original edgy, and sinful character of the counter-culture of that era. The idea, for me, worked — for a little while. Just like everything else in the film, though, it is overused and overwhelms. It becomes as distracting and annoying as someone pushing his way past your seat while you are trying to watch the film.The basic story of Gatsby is there, even if not the romance, poetry and lyricism of the novel, but despite its best efforts, and sadly because of them, the story and certainly much of what makes ""The Great Gatsby"" great is nearly lost amidst too much, far too much, overproduction. Less is more.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Fitzgerald as rap video,"The jury has been out on Baz Luhrmann for a long time. A lot of people were won over by the quirky combination of Claire Danes + Leonardo DiCaprio in 'Romeo + Juliet'. Others (myself included) were taken in by the sheer over-the-topness of 'Moulin Rouge'. I recently saw that again and found that it has aged badly. But, I decided to give 'The Great Gatsby' a chance, anyway. I figured, why not? What have I got to lose? Well, apart from the admission price and a few hours of my life, I find that my good memories of the book and of the 1974 version (Robert Redford, Mia Farrow) have been permanently compromised by this piece of rubbish. Let's start with the casting: Tobey Maguire was a mistake, Carey Mulligan was a big mistake, Leo is good. On to the special effects: atrocious! You'd think with this kind of budget, they could do a decent chroma key. Finally, the so-called production design: oh my god, how could they do this to Fitzgerald?!?!?! The whole picture is like an extended hip-hop video, complete with extras and music from more than one specimen of the genre. If someone had only told me that the executive producer is Jay Z, I might have had a chance of saving my time, money and self-respect. Fitzgerald did not deserve to be so rudely travestied.

The best story of obsessed love done by Baz Luhrmann,"Director Baz Luhrmann stuns by telling the story of The Great Gatsby actually, quite well. Although Luhrmann's previous work includes the unfortunate Mulin Rouge; fear not - there's no over the top musical here - only a truly respectable representation of Fitzgerald's most famous novel. Now over 88 years old - its themes of greed, celebrity and power are still strongly relevant and affirms The Great Gatsby as one of America's great classic stories.There are four main characters including: air-headed Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan) and husband Tom (Joel Edgerton), docile and innocent Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) and the ever-intriguing Jay Gatsby. Nick finds himself in a quaint little cottage surrounded by New York's lavish millionares when the story begins. He visits his silly cousin Daisy and brutish Tom while peering dreamily at his neighbor's huge and expensive parties. The party scenes are just as they should be - glitzy, wild and impressive. Gatsby is of course the neighbor, and by way of a unique invitation Nick finds himself wrapped up in Gatsby's world of excess and riches. The man is shrouded in mystery that only Nick is privy to exploring - including his history with Daisy. Gatsby is a determined and hopeful man whose polished manners and wealth were hard won. Viewers will admire Gatsby and pity him at the same time. With Leo blazing the way, all three male leads play their parts well throughout the film.The casting of the female characters is where the film truly suffered. Despite the exquisite costumes and hair-do's - plain and sweet Carey Mulligan just cannot be the enchanting Daisy Buchanan and Isla Fisher is definitely no Myrtle Wilson (Tom's lover). Allowing this critique, Luhrmann did make some interesting choices with this film - including story-book visuals that work well with this piece. He also stayed true to the original novel and honored particular details readers of the story will appreciate. Watch (or read) The Great Gatsby if only to take a short glimpse at the shiny and tragic world of the 1920's.",,Anonymous,Romance
The next-to-best Gatsby,"First, I want to say that I did not see the 3D version of this movie, so my review is only for the 2D version.I read the book years ago. I saw the 1974 movie the year it came out. I am a fan of both. But I am also a fan of Baz Luhrman. One could tell this new movie was a Baz Luhrman product within 3 seconds. And the remainder of the film has his signature all over it. Even though I might criticize this 2013 version, I want to say that I liked it.I preferred the music in the 1974 version, but I did not find the modern music of this version annoying at all. The 1974 film was slightly more faithful to the book--which is a good thing--but this version was fairly faithful. The main difference was the invention of a back story concerning Nick's health. I found it distracting and, more importantly, an invalidation of Nick's reliability as narrator (and our guide to the world of Gatsby and environs).I also preferred the actors in the 1974 version. Redford is more reserved--a man in control, a man of mystery who does not wear his heart on his sleeve. Mia Farrow's Daisy was much more fleshed out and more believable, not to mention a sadder victim of her society. In similar ways, I preferred all of the acting choices from 1974.Some have called The Great Gatsby a love story. From Gatsby's point of view, that is true. But from the reader's point of view, TGG is a mystery. As we read the book, we are trying to understand the man, and solve the mysteries of his past.As others have said, the quick cuts that drive the narrative of the 2013 version are annoying and, worse yet, impair the viewer's ability to immerse himself in the lavish richness of the visuals.One reviewer said she really enjoyed the ""beautiful shirts"" scene in the 2013 version. For me there was no comparison. I would use that scene as an example of where the 1974 film was much superior. When Redford tosses the shirts, the viewer feels he is in a rich, colorful, extravagant shower. And Farrow's Daisy is positively overcome by the experience.In closing, I recommend this film, but I recommend that viewers first read the book and see the 1974 Gatsby. May you be lured to West Egg as surely as the jazz-age celebrants were drawn to the flame of Gatsby's determination.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Too Much Noise about Nothing,"Is it a beautiful movie? Yes. Is it a sad movie? Yes. Is it a must see masterpiece? No.That's pretty much sums it up. It is a movie that does not make you think pretty much at all and it for sure does not even try to make you wonder about anything. It's like one of those big and generously decorated boxes that has layers and layers of beautifully folded and crumpled papers & for which you have very high expectations and a load of excitement, but once you open it, you realize that it is absolutely empty inside. Solid actors, stunning decorations, original soundtrack, sort of touching story, which was very poorly executed. Left me with the feeling that I had just watched one of Fergie's or The Black Eyed Peas' videos.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
On balance...better than I'd expected,"I was happy to consider this movie because of DiCaprio and the source material; but I had some nervousness too, because I'm not a great fan of Baz Luhrmann's previous fare. Indeed, there are times when the counter-contemporary music takes away from the experience, but it's not constant and didn't leave me with lasting disappointment. It is all a bit 'Busby Berkley' at times with some of the set pieces looking a little too staged and unbelievable for my liking. I get the creativity and splendour of what was in Luhrmann's vision, but with a period like the 20's - I don't think we need too much more glitter than was the case anyway. The positives outweigh these concerns though - DiCaprio is mysterious and enigmatic throughout and the supporting cast perform perfectly and compliment the visuals to create an eye-catching experience. Toby McGuire plays a cautious character, but grows in stature as the plot progresses - eventually standing as the only principled individual of the piece. So Baz - I'm not convinced that everything you do adds to the plot in a positive way, but on balance the experience of watching The Great Gatsby is one worth having.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The movie brings out the book's one great insight,"I saw The Great Gatsby on the weekend, and I'm quite excited about it. I was glad to hear the director say that living to repeat the past is quite impossible, but I have to admit that Fitzgerald's suggestion is quite fascinating, even if it seems wrong-headed. Since time points forward for us except when indexing thoughts and media, we never look into the past, even relativity doesn't permit that in any direct sense. The past is read-only. Our minds can survey the times that already happened, and we commonly assume that it is unhealthy to dwell in the past excessively.That's what the novel is about, at least. It is a fascinating attempt by a character to live out his own religion not so much in a quest for spirituality, but in a quest for something he feels a need for in his life. Since life is very much about needs, this opens the question of in what contexts it becomes important or relevant to recreate the past.One recreates the past whenever one tries to preserve love. Love only happens in an instant, and the spectacle of couples trying to preserve their custom of alliance with each other is clearly one in which reproduction of the past plays a big part. That is ""Great"" Gatsby's great insight: That the moment of memorializing love, in essence attempting to make it eternal, is the reproduction of, and return to the past through repetition.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The 'Good' Gatsby,"Well, after a much awaited and anticipated release of the adaptation of the classic F.Scott Fitzgerald novel, The Great Gatsby was finally released into cinemas after being delayed for a number of months. The Great Gatsby is-in novel form- considered one of the all time American classics, and Baz Luhrmann's movie had a lot of hype and build up about it's own interpretation of the novel, and how it would compare to previous versions such as the one in 1974 which featured the in-actor of the time, Robert Redford.Baz Luhrmann's Gatsby is in many ways faithful to the novel, and different from the 1974 movie. Luhrmann is not one of my favourite directors, but he pulls of a visually stunning aesthetic look to Gatsby's parties and the setting of New York and even with the Valley of Ashes. The cast all played their roles particularly well, but the outstanding actor was the one in the titular role of Jay Gatsby, Leonardo DiCaprio, who is the best actor to have played Gatsby. Tobey Maguire has good on screen chemistry with DiCaprio and this helps to convey the friendship between Gatsby and Nick Carraway. Carey Mulligan plays an excellent Daisy and suits the part from the description of her in the book.However, many enthusiasts of the Fitzgerald novel, such as myself, will feel as though Luhrmann overdoes some of the subtlety of the book. The novel is a classic as I have said before, but the movie fails to hit at some of the key themes such as the corruption of the American Dream. The symbolism of the book such as the Green Light and the eyes of Dr. T.J Eckleburg are manifested brilliantly on screen but they are supposed to be subtle, yet Luhrmann overuses camera techniques which make the audience feel nauseous, like they are watching a first person movie.This adaptation of The Great Gatsby is the best one by far, but for those who love the novel they may feel disappointed as they walk out of the cinema. However, those who haven't read the book, will probably enjoy the movie, despite it's imperfections. So we beat on, boats against the current, still waiting for a 'Great Gatsby'.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Perfection,This may be the most perfectly casted movie ever. Watch it and you'll realize that there is not a person on Earth who could play Jay Gatsby more perfect than Leo. This film was dead-on accurate to the book and the Baz aspect was magical. A masterpiece!I was a bit worried about the modern soundtrack but it may have been info my favorite things in the movie. Having Jay-Z produce ensured to have many titles of his in the film. They fit so perfectly that it was like they were made for the Roarin' 20s.Overall I give this film a 10/10. It is a masterpiece and DiCaprio's finest work.,10.0,Anonymous,Romance
My rating: 7,"The Great Getsby. The embodied ideal, incapable to carry away the current in its waters. A man as a man, modest but with the great ability to believe and to hope that the balance of the world will bring back to him all that he personally gave. But he fails.About the ability to make ideas real, to wait the exact moment, to be large-hearted, a gentleman. About the instinct to follow ideas, to count on old success, to be trivial, to forget.Innovative staging, beautiful faces. This movie is successful and strong. It has his two hours and more. But we have seen his older version which was not aiming to modernize the story, to reach you with sound or with picture. It trusted on the true gentleman and his words which (specially for the people who love to seek and find) I have written somewhere else. It is interesting to make this parallel between this two movies(I can mention only one thing - Francis Ford Coppola). But only if you are inspired enough.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A completely uninformed, non-historical, ridiculous, laughable farce and a disgrace.","After reading it my first year in college and being completely mesmerized, I wasn't completely thrilled with the 1974 version (critics agreed). Mia Farrow's performance was a bit over the top, but the movie, as a whole, captured the magic, sadness and despair of the book. (Karen Black & Sam Waterston were the standout performances.)But this? I could barely watch it all in one sitting, it was that bad. Poorly acted. Poorly representative of the book, and rap and modern music? It is just pure, disrespectful garbage. DiCaprio's performance was a joke and totally unbelievable. He obviously never read the book, or he was completely unable to glean any of the emotion or meaning of his character from it. I actually laughed hysterically at how poor his performance was at times.The only saving grace of this movie (or the reason for the single star) was Carey Mulligan's performance. While I don't think she portrayed Daisy correctly in any way (not fragile enough), she is always a joy to watch.And to IMDB, if you are worried about ""spoilers"" with regard to The Great Gatsby? I realize it's on every title, but if you don't know the story by now, that's a very sad testament to this great piece of literature. It certainly was greatly disrespected by this director and TPTB who made this travesty. Fitzgerald is spinning in his grave.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
IT WAS OKAY,"I was very pleased with the casting choice, Leonardo and Carey made a great Gatsby and Daisy. The cinematography was great ,the music was beautiful. I love Lana Del Rey and when Young and Beautiful played it was heartbreaking and magical. However I wish the directors would've added more of Fitzgerald and one of my favourite scene where Nick talks to Wolfsheim in the end. Nevertheless it was beautiful.",,Anonymous,Romance
Excellent,"I was a big fan of the first version of this movie and wasn't sure I would like this version of the movie and the soundtrack. But it was amazing! Be sure to see it in 3D. The music was absolutely perfect for the movie, the set was just beautiful as were all of the fashions. The story line was faithful and told through wonderful acting. It was perfect until they added a GD--and that is why I am dropping a star. So totally unnecessary. Still...young and old will love this movie. The reviews had said that this movie wasn't very good. That is so absolutely NOT TRUE. Leonardo DiCaprio was wonderful and his interpretation of Gatsby is really interesting and I think well thought out. Carey Mulligan as Daisy is PERFECT! If you thought about it all day, you wouldn't be able to think of a better casting choice. I have just now become a Toby McGuire fan because of this movie and he too was perfect for the part. And the actor who played Tom will probably get an award or two for his performance. Go see this movie!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Well... the Second and Third act was good.,"Soon after I read the novel I knew it was among my favorites. The depth of a 200 page novel was quite impressive. The film does it best to capture this depth, but generally falls short.However, that doesn't mean I didn't like the film, overall did, I felt the director generally was able to nail the atmosphere of the novel, and effectively integrate the symbols and motifs that are in the novel. Sometimes it was a little too much, with harsh camera movements and ridiculous color schemes, nevertheless, I think Luhrmann was the right for man for the film.Now, the first Act. Very close to dreadful and made it seem the film was going to continue down this path and make this a very disappointing film. This has to be the most shocking and inappropriate use of music in a film to date. Understand that the bulk of your audience isn't going to be teenagers, rather middle-age and up. You are making a period piece and at many times it felt like a rap or dubstep music video. Not to mention they beat Lana Del Rey song Young and Beautiful into the ground. Which doesn't even make any sense, it didn't even reflect the action of the film in any way. The lyrics really have no coloration with the characters situation. Another major issue in the first act was the pacing. It was way to rushed, things happened in split seconds, if you hadn't read the novel it would have been difficult keeping things straight. Thus the first act had very little things going for it.Now the second and third act were able to pretty much make up for first act. It was paced very well, the story finally became compelling, and no more majorly out of placed music. Aside from a few times Tobey Maguire Character came off dry, and the fact Jordan character was very insignificant, the final two acts were very good. DiCaprio's acting was quite impressive, wouldn't be in his top 5 performances or anything, but as always he gives a very great performance.In conclusion, if you can get passed the first act, then any Gatsby fan should generally be satisfied with the film. It is a fairly faithful adaptation, and the visuals at times are very stunning. Thus I would hesitantly recommend the film, despite its glaring flaws, it still is a fairly solid film.6.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Beautiful adaptation that goes down like champagne,"Although I've only read The Great Gatsby twice, both in school, I connected with it instantly, and it's stuck in my mind ever since, which is something a lot of stories don't get to do. One of the most striking things about it, in my opinion, is how mercurial it is: the ecstasy of a party at Gatsby's mansion lit by fireworks is always measured by a profound sense of loneliness and despair. This is a world where happiness is fleeting and sincerity and truth are rare commodities.So, with that being my impression of the book, I was thrilled to hear that Baz Luhrman was directing a new film version. Just as predicted, he lets the words of the book literally shine through everything else (as in, they're right there on the screen), and his decadent, hectic style is ideal for the world being depicted. The intro of the film is classic Luhrman, beginning in grainy black and white, before exploding shortly thereafter into tinted newsreels on fast forward, with Jay-Z's rhymes over the images. The party scenes are somewhat reminiscent of his opus, Moulin Rouge, complete with anachronistic music rearranged for a jazz orchestra. One favorite moment was the soundtrack fading from an anachronistic hip-hop/electronic jam, to Gershwin's ""Rhapsody in Blue"" to accompany a fireworks display. Lana Del Rey is also a perfect fit for the movie's soundtrack, with her bluesy voice and lyrics about sadness in the midst of excess. The fast cuts that Luhrman is so fond of almost have the flickering effect of an old film reel on fast forward in here, and the over-saturation of colors is reminiscent of a black and white photograph with bright pigment added in. More importantly, the novel's visuals carry over much better in film; anybody sick of hearing about the green light while reading may appreciate it better when it's in front of their eyes.As for the way the source material is treated, the only criticism I can honestly come up with is that, when it comes to past adaptations, i.e. Romeo+ Juliet, while the director kept the source material the same, he tweaked the setting and context of them in a way that made them interesting and new. With his version of Gatsby, he is faithful almost to a fault. Dialogue and narration are borrowed almost word for word, and the voice overs from Tobey Maguire's Nick, while an effective display of Fitzgerald's poetic language, become overbearing, and often redundant. When the audience can see the look in an angered Gatsby's eyes, they can interpret for themselves that he ""looked like he just killed a man.""While there are some striking visuals in this film, it only feels like a Baz Luhrman picture for the first ten minutes or so. Our introduction to the Buchanans, Myrtle Wilson and her social circle, and to Nick himself play in that fast-paced, cartoonish style that the first half of Moulin Rouge had, which can give you a headache. Not that such a style is advisable for any film's whole running time, but as the story progresses, the film's pace slows down, and it starts to feel more like a mainstream movie than an art film.In a certain sense there's not a bad thing, if the purpose is to focus on character development or story. But the story, while heavy with themes, is empty of much plot, and the whole point of characters like Daisy, Tom and Jordan is precisely that they ultimately don't have a lot of depth. The film solves this somewhat by imbuing Daisy with more warmth than in the book, and focusing on her relationship with Gatsby. In a strange way, at least for me, it almost became the story of her loss as well. Just as Gatsby is too stuck in the past to move forward, she doesn't see a way to go backward, and the audience sees her fear and uncertainty in everything she does. While ultimately still a shallow, careless person, Carey Mulligan's performance creates such a sweet persona that it's not hard to imagine how men could believe that they're in love with her. What I expected to be the weakest part of the film- the love story and relationships between characters- turned out to be the emotional core of the whole thing.In addition to the visuals and script, the cast of The Great Gatsby is incredibly strong, embodying iconic characters on a spectrum of competent to amazing. Leonardo DiCaprio's Jay Gatsby conveys both the charismatic showman (complete with an affected New England accent) and the nervous, awkward youth, delusional in his obsession over his lost love. I didn't find anything wrong with Tobey Maguire, except that Nick comes off much more snarky and self-aware in the novel, and here he seems much more naive and swept up in it all, which is supposed to make his eventual depressive state more poignant. As a framing device, it's highly effective, drawing a parallel between F. Scott Fitzgerald's life and the fictional life of his author avatar, which creates a synergy between source and adaptation. The title of the film/book even appears superimposed on the green-lit fog at the end. As a fan of the book and the director, I loved watching it, but I understand why it's so polarizing, since most people tend to dislike one, the other, or both.The phrase that best sums up The Great Gatsby for me is the old chestnut, ""Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans."" It's a poignant and melancholy story about lost opportunities, and reaching for the moon before realizing how lonely it is at the top. Finally, an eclectic adapter of well-known stories has found a perfect match, in a gilded star-crossed love story with a hollow center that stays in your mind long after it's ended, like a forgotten dream.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Leonardo delivers once again, Toby is great, Baz Luhrman success","Once again Leo is flawless in his acting, words simply fail when trying to describe how well he performed his role. Toby was definitely keeping up with Leo's speed in the film.. he pulled of Nick Carraway perfectly. I'd say the casting was pretty spot on except for Daisy, Carey Mulligan just does not have the potential to pull off Daisy's vivacity or ""angel like good looks"".Cinematography was amazing, Baz Luhrman certainly pulled out all the stops however, I do feel that he got a bit lost trying to make the film a visual spectacle and lost the importance of the plot along in doing so. I feel like he could have pulled it more tightly together rather than having the setting, special effects and scenery overwhelm and overshadow the story line of Fitzgeralds classic.Also having rap music rather than a classic jazz age soundtrack.. a total fail on his part.But all in all, it is worth the money and time to see it in theatres. But it did have more potential as a film.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The 'Good' Gatsby,"Review on The Great Gatsby: The other day when I went to see this film I had high expectations. Past couple of months they have built such a hype that I fell for it. Well it was visually dazzling as one might expect. Once again no need for the 3-D experience as i saw none. The film did move at a fast paced and at times could lose the audience at what is happening, not to mention didn't really give that time to connect with the characters which is crazy as its a 2 1/2 hour movie. The characters though were interesting to watch as the film did catch that essence the book did when reading. Leonardo Dicaprio did a great job and stole the show (which he always seem to do) but in my opinion it was more Carey mulligan who shine more then everyone else. Overall great film for the summer, did give me that same thrill from when i saw moulin rouge ( same directer for both films) years back.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Brilliant Insanity with a Explosion of Colour and Sound,"Having never read the book myself I cannot really compare the two. I went into this film though not having any inclination as to the storyline and the film instantly gripped me. The visuals in this film are absolutely phenomenal and just add so much to the film, most notably for me where the parties, what a feast for you eyes, you really feel transported back to New York in the 1920's. Accompanied by the soundtrack this film is a real winner, and that is without even mentioning The Great Gatsby himself. Leonardo DiCaprio puts in a stunning performance for perhaps one of the most interesting characters I have ever come across, every scene is transformer by his presence and perhaps if it weren't for the absolutely gorgeous Carey Mulligan ,playing Daisy Daisy Buchanan, then my eyes would not have left Mr J Gatsby.

It is as bad as some says,"I did not read the novel, nor saw the 1974 movie (or rather, I forgot about it, because I found it boring). Also, I liked a lot both ""Strictly Ballroom"" and ""Romeo+Juliet"", so I was definitely not awed by the novel or prejudiced against the director.Unfortunately, my open-minded approach did not help. This movie is a mighty mess, for two basic reasons that have nothing do with the source material or Luhrmann notorious bombastic style. These reasons are: 1) awful acting and 2) lack of chemistry, and they make the film collapse.Maguire is awful. I never noticed how bad an actor he is until I saw him playing Carraway. All he does is stare with his beady eyes and make grimaces. Being in almost every scene, he positively destroyed the movie.Di Caprio e Mulligan have zero chemistry. Impossible to believe in any passionate feeling between those two.Besides, spoiled, coward and selfish Daisy Buchanan is one of the most repulsive fictional characters. It was weird to see two men fighting for the affection of such an obnoxious woman, whose only saving grace is a pretty face. Not unusual, but I just could not buy into the ""tragedy"" of mystery man Gatsby pining for shallow Daisy. I wanted to tell him to get a grip and find a better woman.Then comes the horrid music, the overblown party scenes and materialism trumping ""feelings"" in every scene (what was that throwing shirts at Daisy? Was Gatsby employed by a luxury garment store?)If I have to save something, I'd go for the Lana Del Rey song and the final minute of the movie, both because I liked the typing on screen and because it brought this mess to a much awaited closure.

Scott Fitzgerald's story a chance but the soundtrack is one of the best I have heard it years! At first I really wasn't happy with Carey Mulligan getting the part but when I saw her in the movie I thought she did a lot better job than any of the other Daisy's that's been portrayed (especially Mia Farrow's Daisy). There is really only two of Leo's character's that I've ever had massive sympathy for and one of them is J. Gatsby (the other is Teddy Daniels). He plays Gatsby in a heartbreaking way.

An extravaganza - a very detailed update with some miscasting,"This is a modern re-imagining of the Great Gatsby. It works and doesn't in some ways. The most modern aspect of this movie is the over the top cgi mansions and parties with 21st century music. Gatsby's mansion was a bit hideous looking. While the scenery is quite magical in it's own way, the music was a mistake. It would have been better to use 20s music with a modern interpretation instead of the rock rap style music.The screenplay takes great pains to clearly lay out the whole story very explicitly both in background of the characters and the plot events. That is one of the strong points. The dramatic Plaza scene is well done.The casting consisted of some good choices and some bad choices. Carey Mulligan is much prettier here than in other movies like Wall Street 2 - she looks good in the period costumes and acts movingly vulnerable and weak enough for the role. Tobey is a boyish but quite suited. Leonardo is earnest but his face is a bit puffy. He isn't 100% convincing but it's a difficult role - none of his predecessors was perfect either - Robert Redford was wooden, Toby Stephens scowling. The main miscasting was Joel Edgerton who looked more like a thug than a blue blooded moneyed scion. He could have been Myrtle's husband instead. Doesn't look like he could have swept Daisy off her feet. Some one more preppy looking would have been better. Casting the Bollywood actor as Meyer the Jewish businessman was another distracting mistake.For a more realistic version, the Mia Farrow Robert Redford movie is a ""grown up"" version compared with Baz's update. The scenery on location in Newport feels more authentic.Overall it's worth a watch for the spectacle.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great adaptation,"This is a film that really captures the spirit of the source material. If Gatsby is a novel celebrated for above all else the way it's written, this movie is remarkable primarily for the way it's filmed. Like Fitzgerald's intoxicating prose, it's intense, lavish, and vibrant. The aesthetic of almost every shot embodies the glitz of 'the jazz age.' Clever use of music, digital effects and extravagant sets give you all the excitement of the mythical, roaring 20s while managing to avoid giving the impression of seeming 'old fashioned.'The character of Jay Gatsby is somewhat like Shakespeare's Hamlet - people love to analyse the psychology, background and motivations of the character. There's plenty of mystery and ambiguity for critics to sink their teeth into. The movie intelligently portrays the character and plot, picking up on many of the subtle undertones and ambiguities, even suggesting something cohesive but resisting the temptation to boil it all down to a simple romantic love story. It also captures the overall light-hearted feel of the novel.There are many details to relish here, like the aerial views of 1920s Manhattan, Carraway's narration (ie. Fitzgerald's prose) woven into the screenplay, beautiful costumes and vintage cars, the performance of the actor who played Tom Buchannan. Probably what I liked most was that many of the striking images from the original novel were preserved where they could so easily have been ignored/discarded - for instance the green light at the end of Daisy's peer, or the TJ Eckleberg billboard overlooking the TS Eliot-esque wasteland. It seems like the screenplay was prepared by someone who genuinely appreciated the novel.My only real complaint about this film was that they omitted one of my all time favourite sentences from the closing statements of Carraway's narration. ""He did not know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night.""",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very Good Movie,"I don't usually write reviews, but because of all the bashing this movie has gotten, I thought it would be a fresh perspective. I didn't study the book in school, but I did listen to the audiobook a couple of days before I saw the movie. The movie follows the story very well. Some have said that you don't feel for the characters in the movie. While I didn't cry or anything, I was touched by Gatsby's desperation to relive the past through his obsession with Daisy. Nick's character was well demonstrated. I thought McGuire did a great job. How his naivety was crushed and his admiration for Gatsby and his idyllic dream. Daisy was flighty and shallow, as she should have been. Captivating made be too strong a word for it, but I did get some sense of her allure in the movie. Although, the book does a better job of this. I liked the book, but found it a bit short. The movie flew by, which is always good. As others have said, the cinematic part of the movie is terrific and while the music is a bit odd, for the most part it worked.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not for the common viewer.but likely to bag some Oscars,"With a stunning cast and whole lot of work on storytelling, the great Gatsby is likely to be the next visually appealing extravaganza. The director Baz Luhrmann did a decent job bringing the ever so famous novel written by American author F. Scott Fitzgerald to silver screen and portraying what can undoubtedly be regarded as the most visually appealing film of 2013 so far. Although, an average user would expect more drama and thrill out of the movie.probably as a consideration for sitting through a two and a half hour long movie. The actors and actress were implacable in their respective roles and were able to do justice to the characters of the original novel. For me, the individual who stole the show was Australian actor Joel Edgerton who gave one hell of a performance and should be considered for an Oscar in the best supporting role category. In addition, it would be an absolute crime not to include the movie in the best costume and best cinematography category in the Oscars. Overall, although an average user may feel disappointed with the ending, but the movie, being based on one classic piece of writing, turned out to be decent and intriguing piece of art .",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Excessive extravagance hits home,"Baz Luhrmann's excessive all-out retelling of the great American novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald, where the essence of the 1920s lavish parties is juxtaposed with hip-hop and dub-step music channelling the excess, is a surprisingly satisfying feature. Equally shocking is how the outdated story fits so seamlessly with the current Wall Street culture of greed and obnoxiousness. When a youthful writer Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) decides on a stock exchange career he rents a small beach-side place, hence becoming the unknowing neighbour of Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio). Soon the duo become comrades with Carraway being pulled into the nouveau riche lifestyle of glitz and cascades of cash. However Gatsby has an ulterior motive to reclaim the love of his life: Daisy (Carey Mulligan), a high-life dame married to local class royalty Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton). For her this small town boy has amassed wealth in the hope that one day Daisy's heart will be reconquered.For once Baz Luhrmann's liking to the extravagant feels wholly at home with luscious expansive setting and mass choreography making the spectacle seem suitably epic for the story. A far cry from the autoparodic ""Australia"" Luhrman's style seems to mesh perfectly with the sensibility of the story and his decision to introduce contemporary black music works brilliantly - symbolically drawing similarities as the current culture associated with the overblown excess of rappers so aptly fits to the fatuitous societal bliss of 1920s wealth. Despite the screenplay being as faithful as possible to the source material, the outlook on America as a culture of mindless wealth seems ever so timely.Leanardo DiCaprio is a tour de force in his own right, now fully formed as an adult actor drawing away from his youthful appearance, which made him once seem like the eternal boy-actor. Tobey Maguire seems the weakest point of the movie, as he fails to serve any sense of credibility to his character, overly reclusive and grey, not bringing a background impact as the narrator of Gatsby downfall. Given that this is essentially Nick's story to tell I couldn't help but feel that Maguire struggles with making himself a key figure in the proceedings, instead molding into the background of the deluxe surroundings, struggling as a first person perspective narrator. This does make the movie a bit more ineffectual in its impact, but mostly it just underpins DiCaprio's command of his role and diverts all attention to the Great Gatsby!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
shameful,"Unwatchable due to the overused special effects, cringing acting and detestable zero-dimensional characters. Are we really supposed to believe that this supernaturally great man harbours these intense feelings that form his every action for an irritating vacuous fairy who is young enough to be his daughter? There is nothing great about this Gatsby(hey director, you can't just list a load of unbelievable facts to make someone appear great, you have to show it through their behaviour and develop their personality)and the couple display no attraction towards one another. I've seen more passion in 2 pieces of cardboard. DiCaprio has been in some decent films since casting off his titanic scar. This performance will put him back years. That first scene where he appears flashing his teeth like some kind of demigod made me physically retch, which kept happening each time that he was on-screen. Surely his worst ever film, in fact the worst film of all, with or without him, that I can remember, and I've seen some bad ones. This has no redeeming qualities whatsoever.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

Underwhelming Great Gatsby,"The excellent cast, stunning visuals & a brilliant but missed opportunity for somber social commentary combined are not enough to save save the much anticipated Great Gatsby from being anything more than mediocre. The screenplay itself lacked substance something that Fitzgerald's iconic and intricately detailed first hand accounts of the notorious excesses of the day did not. It is a shame that too many people submitting reviews obviously have never read The Great Gatsby, much less anything by Fitzgerald. Luhrman's shallow adaptation is not a creative expression of the period that parallels exactly what we are as a society again. The lack of depth mostly squanders the talents of the superb cast (the one exception being Toby McGuire). This is a movie with such tremendous possibility that what was done well is hopelessly overshadowed by all that it overlooked.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Well I thought it was good..,"Well I just don't know why this movie hasn't been as greatly loved by all as it has by me. One thing is a certain, Leonardo Di Caprio have a stunning performance. Starring as J Gatsby, Leonardo really helped me to get lost in the film.One of the major dividing points was the soundtrack. An audience may have felt that the music was distasteful and out of place. I have a different view. I feel that although the movie was based in the era of jazz and the majority expected the music to follow the same ilk, the movie had to be different to the original, and the music although modern it did have aspects of jazz littered throughout and I liked that. You may think that the music was a weak attempt to relate to youths. I believe otherwise it is such a generalisation that teens would go to watch a movie because Jay-Z is rapping in it. The music in the film is so much more than that it has had a lot of thought put into it and it is full of different styles all with jazz elements.The acting was generally good but Leonardo was clearly the stand out performer. You could really get lost in the story because he played the eccentric gentleman in the way that any great actor could. The story generally kept with the novel and that was a good thing as it doesn't disappoint those of us who have read the book as most of the time it is very hard to make a film as good as the novel. Baz Lurhmann has done a fantastic job in directing such a great film he never fails to impress and and most of all be original. It upsets me that he hasn't go the recognition he deserves.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Overall a strong flick.,"This movie was good. The way you view it probably has something to do with whether or not you've read the book; I have, and for the most part it followed the book well. The acting was good, but not superb. Leonardo Dicaprio was pretty good, but kinda boring, as was Joel Edgerton. Carey mulligan was alright, and I found Nick Carraway to be perfectly casted (Tobey Maguire).The soundtrack was pretty bad. The rap music just...didn't fit. I know what they were trying to do, create a party atmosphere and what not, but it Didn't work.Some parts were a little overdone, but strangely, I actually didn't mind that. It was kind of nice; I really don't know why but some of the melodrama seemed okay, and I usually despise melodrama.TL;DR -- Leo's not getting an Oscar this time either. F Scott Fitzgerald would probably be mildly proud. The rap sucks.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Great Gatsby - Best film of 2013,"I don't think I've ever read The Great Gatsby. I know it is required reading in a lot of High School English Lit classes, but I'm fairly certain, surprisingly enough, that I didn't take English Lit - not even in College (I took French and Spanish instead). Always the practical one, who knew that I'd end up being ""forced"" to read all the classics anyway?After a string of misfires (I hated Shutter Island and Inception) Leonardo DiCaprio returns to form. He is perfect as Gatsby. He deserves an Oscar nomination for this performance. Gatsby is a complicated, yet simple man. His entire existence is his desire to get the girl, Daisy (Carey Mulligan) that he foolishly let go of.This is a role that was tailor made for DiCaprio. If DiCaprio wasn't already an A list mega star, this movie would have made him one. He just oozes off the screen and is simply radiant here (can I use the word radiant to talk about a guy?).In any other hands, Daisy could easily be hated and come across as shallow, naive, and as someone just going through life, but Mulligan brings a lot of hidden layers to Daisy. You can see the inner conflict through her expressive eyes.As wild and over the top as Moulin Rouge Director Baz Luhrmann usually is; The Great Gatsby is his most assured, straightforward, gimmick free (not counting 3D) film to date. From a pure story telling and directing standpoint it is by the numbers. There are very few scenes that made me feel like I took a bad acid trip. Even the party scenes are beautifully shot and framed here.Much has been written about the modern mixing of Hip Hop with 20's era Jazz and how it wouldn't work. Luhrmann actually did an amazing job of not overdoing the gimmick. Yes, it is noticeable, but he uses it very sparingly, so it never took me out of the movie.There was one scene when they were on the bridge and they passed a car that had rich black people in and they were playing Jay-Z's Izzo (HOVA). It was odd and random just to have rich black people appear out of nowhere. I loved Luhrmann use of various versions Lana Del Rey's song Young and Beautiful in the love scenes. It really added texture and emotion to the romance.One of the most beautiful moments in the movie comes when Gatsby is lamenting everything that he's lost, and Tobey Maguire (Nick Carraway) says, ""You can't repeat the past"" and Gatsby responds with an earnest ""Of course you can old sport,"" such a simple but impactful moment.Generally, I'm not a fan of narration, but Maguire does an amazing job with the lyrical prose used in this movie. Maguire gives a mature, nuanced performance here where you can really see his love and infatuation for Gatsby grow while his distaste for his friend Tom Buchannan (a wonderfully evil Joel Edgerton) increases. At times it almost seemed as if Nick wanted to jump Gatsby's bones.This is my favorite film of 2013. It hit all my buttons – beautifully shot, very hopeful (but with an ultimately sad end), and had some flashes of brilliant prose.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""Gatsby"" dazzles but never truly resonates","It should surprise no one to learn that Baz Luhrmann's ""The Great Gatsby"" is a towering achievement in art production, costume design, cinematography and music. Luhrmann proved himself capable of as much with ""Moulin Rouge!"" and first glimpses of ""Gatsby"" suggested he found ideal source material to match his style in F. Scott Fitzgerald's ""The Great Gatsby.""But for all the technical achievements and the emotion-filled performances from a spot-on cast including Leonardo DiCaprio as Gatsby, Carrie Mulligan as Daisy and Tobey Maguire as Nick Carraway (who better to narrate your film? OK, other than Morgan Freeman ...), a definite emotional resonance is missing from Luhrmann's interpretation.""Gatsby"" is the classic American story of hope, dreams, wealth, excess and love that defined the country in the Roaring '20s. Luhrmann unmistakably celebrates this era with his patented (and mostly tasteful, depending who you ask) exaggeration, and doesn't shy back on the fairy tale qualities of the story either. Nick Carraway is most intrigued by his neighbor, Jay Gatsby, known for his lavish parties that last into the wee hours of the morning. Gatsby soon befriends Carraway, who learns that behind the wealthy facade is a man badly wounded and driven by love and obsession.DiCaprio in presence alone has the chops for Gatsby, and he uses it to his advantage as the shadowy figure in the early parts of the film. As we become more acquainted with Gatsby (and learn to tolerate his excessive use of the term ""old sport"" when referring to Nick), he becomes a bit more two-faced. Rather than peeling back Gatsby's soul, we get an timid, emotional side that doesn't quick click. Perhaps its the film's use of narration as a crutch for explanation rather than scene work that more visually demonstrates Gatsby's feelings for Daisy.Maguire fits perfectly into the mix, but we don't truly get to access Nick as a character until the end of the film. Mulligan aces the tragic heroine, as you'd expect form Luhrmann. She has a certain strength to her despite of her character's inherent weaknesses from a feminist's perspective. Even Joel Edgerton as Daisy's unfaithful but prideful husband, Tom, excels in his role. It's surprising then, that the film renders us indifferent to them. It can only be ascribed to Luhrmann's style getting in the way of substance.Luhrmann and frequent collaborator Craig Pearce identify beautiful and moving excerpts from the novel to provide Maguire with some excellent narrative work, but the stylistic choices don't gel especially well with Fitzgerald's reflective and much more serious prose. One can envision a film in which ""Gatsby's"" themes and story can coexist with such grandiose visual context, but for some reason, this film is not it. It engages it audience, captures our attention and scratches at the surface of what makes ""Gatsby"" a classic, but somehow it never takes the next step. in spite of performances that tell our brains to pay attention because the actors know what they're doing, the characters seem hollow, and as though all that happens to them is a matter of artistic choice rather than necessity.Strangely enough, Luhrmann's ""The Great Gatsby"" looks and performs like the best possible adaptation of the novel, but the feeling just doesn't cut deep enough.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Visually spectacular.,"If I had to describe this movie in one word, it would be ""beautiful"". I was never really a big fan of the original. It was just a movie you got forced to watch in English class. Baz Luhrmann's adaptation on the other hand drew me in and held my interest for the entire film. The dancing, the music, the costumes... this movie was a performance piece and it shinned.I am aware that the film is quite unrealistic but I would like to think that would be how the billionaires of today would behave. It's about romance, fantasy and dreams. If you had all the money in the world how realistic would your life be. Besides; the cast were so incredible that you forgot about this fact.While I truly enjoyed The Great Gatsby, I still don't really love the original story. But that would be my one and only negative. It's still a fantastic movie and I applaud Baz Luhrmann for creating beautiful films that are timeless.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Did I hear rap?,"I promise... I was watching the movie really seriously until I heard rap... yes, that's correct, rap!! It was like cruising down the highway and a lightning bolt just hit you... jolting you awake. I loved the vivid colors and the very amusing music. I haven't read the book so it was nice not having to compare notes every single scene, it can get pretty annoying at some point. I wonder how Disney's Cinderella would be like with this soundtrack. I would love to hear Lana Del Ray's ""young and beautiful"" when Cinderella makes the entrance to the ball, and ""crazy in love"" during the dance. I can't quite digest it yet, its like trying to fry ice-cream in hot oil... you wonder if you can get away with doing something like that... but, this movie and its adorable soundtrack just did",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

The cinematography is all over the place and the movie is like watching a cartoon with living characters. To add insult to injury they added Rap music to a movie that takes place in the 1920s. I think the producers were on drugs when they release this piece of garbage. If you are among the twenty somethings that liked Moulin Rouge, or enjoy the annoying Quentin Tarantino movies you may like this. If you enjoy good movies this is not for you. Put it like this, watching the laundry turn in a dryer is more interesting than this movie, and the acting is just as good.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Great Gatsby review,"Once again F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic The Great Gatsby is brought to life on the big screen, but this time with much more flare and pizazz. This movie has definitely made its way into my top 10 favorite movies. It flawlessly brings the 1920's to the 21st century. The music, costumes, and casting play a huge part in making The Great Gatsby one of the best movie renditions of a book I've seen in a long time.Director Baz Luhrmann transports famous artists such as Jay Z, Beyoncé, Lana Del Ray, and Fergie into the 1920's. These dynamic performers add a modern day twist to the common jazz music of the twenties. Their up-beat bass line combines with the brass instrumentation to create some sort of musical magic. The song ""Crazy in Love"" (originally by Beyoncé) remade by Emeli Sande and the Bryan Ferry Orchestra was one of the songs I though was remade very well. I almost like 1920's version better than the original. The whole soundtrack was actually really phenomenal, I know I went out and bought it when it came out and I can't possibly be the only one who did. I also can't be the only one who was in love with the costume design.The costume design for Gatsby was phenomenal. I couldn't have pictured a better rendition of the roaring twenties than feathers, fringe and classy suits. The first time we see a party at Gatsby's, we see the costumes in full swing. I have never seen so many fabulous costumes! I was in dance class for 10 years so I've had my fair share of sparkle and fringe. It seemed every woman was either decked out in feathered head-dresses or long scarves tied around their head. Don't even get me started on the short hair, I have never considered chopping off all of my hair until we were exposed to Daisy Buchanan for the first time.The casting of Gatsby was overall pretty well done. First of all we have Carey Mulligan, who plays Daisy Buchanan, Nick's cousin. Mulligan with her short hair creates the spitting image what I imagined Daisy to look like. I couldn't have picked a better actress to portray her. Next we have Tobey Maguire as the main character Nick Carraway. Maguire does a great job of playing an innocent man caught up in the life and luxury of the upper. And finally we have none other than Jay Gatsby. My absolute favorite part of The Great Gatsby is when the host of the party is revealed to Mr. Carraway. Nick is trailing behind an unseen face talking to him about who he thinks Gatsby is when, right at the peak of the music and the fireworks start exploding, (drum roll please) the amazing Leonardo DiCaprio turns around raising a glass, smile spread across his face revealing that he is none other than the mysterious Jay Gatsby. DiCaprio is still a heart throb and his portrayal of Gatsby was spot on. I wouldn't expect anything less from the wonderful Leo. Ultimately the remake of The Great Gatsby was very well done. It was very enjoyable for someone who, like me, loved the book and was skeptical of the movie. Even though some of the parts of the book like Nick and Jordan's romance was barely covered at all, I still give a huge thumbs up to Baz Luhrmann, the old sport, for creating this remake and not completely butchering the novel. Like Jay Gatsby said, ""Can't repeat the past?Why of course you can!""",,Anonymous,Romance
Masterpiece. But seriously... Rap and house soundtrack?,"This movie is a visually astounding achievement. Glorious scenes with a ""pumped-up"" 20's theme. And the acting is very good. DiCaprio's role of Gatsby himself is of course the flagship that you are eager to see. And he nails it!You remember that tingling sensation of your first big love. DiCaprio takes you back there!I loved it!I have one thing to remark... What is this music doing in a movie of this caliber? The first half was ruined by a mixed rap/jazz/house noisy soundtrack. Why did they not keep it classy?!This was a nine star movie, but the soundtrack ripped two stars away. Final ruling is; seven stars.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

The best adaptation of the novel to date,"The Great Gatsby is a 2013 film adaptation of the classic 1920s novel written by F. Scott Fitzgerald. It is narrated by Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) as he writes a novel portraying the events that happened in those months he spent in New York City with Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio), Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton), and his cousin, Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan). The movie has an over the top feel which not only fits the novel (which is over the top in itself) but gives the film plenty of energy. The parties are loud and have gorgeous set design as well as costume design that fits the 20s.Although, there's one aspect of the film that was risky but in my opinion pays off. It decides to use a more modern soundtrack filled with artists like Jay-Z, Lana Del Ray, amongst others. It is usually mixed with jazz instrumentals and I think it works perfectly. It gives the film a great flair and style. And if anything, the hip-hop culture reflects the 1920s culture in multiple ways. Gatsby throws these huge parties to get the attention of Daisy and is trying to revive old love from the past. This leads to events that only end badly. But, I won't go any further, although, I'm sure most people have at least read the novel in school (and if you haven't, I recommend reading it before watching the film, because it's a fantastic novel).CGI is excessively used in the film. Normally, I wouldn't enjoy this but it provides for beautiful cinematography and looking at it in a more artistic sense, it represents the disillusionment/fakeness of the 1920s American culture. The movie also pulls multiple direct quotes from the novel and you can definitely tell that sometimes, ""this obviously came from the book,"" but it's also a matter of that you can't leave some of them out. They are too important. The movie also manages to carry over the symbolism of the book very tastefully with the green light and Dr. T.J. Eckleberg used to perfection.The performances in the movie are what really shine in this adaptation. Tobey Maguire is perfect as Nick Carraway. DiCaprio was always meant to play this role and did just as good as I wanted him to be. Edgerton carried the role of Tom and I think emphasized his character even better. Carey Mulligan (who on my first viewing of the film, I was lukewarm about, but on this viewing I feel differently), isn't necessarily perfect but she still does a sufficient enough job to the point were I have little to complain about. I have very little to complain about in general.My only slight complainant is the first 10-15 minutes are edited somewhat strangely, very fast cutting that only seem to appear in that very beginning. It doesn't wholly bother me but it was a bit off, it's quickly fixed though. Regardless, I'm doubtful it'd be possible to get a much better adaptation then this one and I have my doubts that someone could possibly be better than DiCaprio in the role of Gatsby.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Surprisingly Good Adaptation of the Fitzgerald Classic,"Having heard conflicting reports in reviews and through word-of-mouth, I approached Baz Luhrmann's version of THE GREAT GATSBY with mixed feelings. In the first half-hour I have to admit that I thought it was rather over-blown and operatic; the screen was filled with color and light; many scenes, although brilliantly staged and expertly filmed, seemed rather irrelevant to the purpose of the story; while the music - an anachronistic combination of Twenties standards and contemporary rock - jarred on my ears. As the action unfolds, however, so the film radically improves as Luhrmann becomes far more interested in his characters. As Nick Carraway, Tobey Maguire assumes a pivotal role in the action; he is the first person we see on screen as he recalls what happened to his psychiatrist. At once appalled yet attracted to Jay Gatsby's way of life, Nick comes to understand what lies behind it: Gatsby's perpetual desire for recognition in New York high society. Carey Mulligan comes across as rather colorless as Daisy Buchanan; however, in terms of Lurhmann's interpretation, this seems entirely coherent. Gatsby is prepared to go to any lengths to recreate his love- affair with Daisy; Lurhmann shows that Daisy is not really worth it. As Fitzgerald says in the source-text, she is ""careless"" as well as indifferent. Joel Edgerton's Tom Buchanan is quite simply brilliant; someone accustomed to a privileged way of life, who possesses little or no understanding of anyone around him. He believes he can pick up and throw away people at will, just like material things. Leonardo DiCaprio's Gatsby bears a striking facial resemblance to the young Orson Welles. At once confident yet suspicious, his eyes dart around from person to person, as if unable to trust anyone. His final confrontation with Tom in the hotel room is quite stunning - especially when Gatsby loses his civilized veneer and reveals his true nature. At the film's end we are left feeling terribly sad: Gatsby might have been a fraud, but as Nick says, he embodies the kind of perpetual hope that seems quite at odds with the material world around him.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Overdone, overlong and deadly dull",This takes place in the 1920s. Nick Carraway (Toby Maguire) narrates it from a sanitarium. It's about Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio) who is VERY wealthy and his obsession with Daisy (Carey Mulligan). The problem is she's married to someone else.The novel is great but this movie completely trashes it. It makes ill-conceived changes in the story and goes on far too long. Also it's WAY overdone. There are endless parties at Gatsby's mansion and they're shoved in your face nonstop. A few times I had to close my eyes because there was too much going on! I saw it in 2D--in 3D it must be impossible to watch. When it isn't in your face it's deadly dull and moves at a snails pace. To make matters worse Maguire is lousy. Totally blank-faced in his role. Mulligan (who can be good) was even worse! I never got a grasp on her character or motivations. On the other hand DiCaprio was great as Gatsby. He's grown into an amazing actor. Very good-looking too. But this movie is mostly concerned with visuals--not the story. It manages the impossible--it's boring and overdone at the same time!

The Great Gatsby,"To be fair to Baz Luhrmann, this is actually quite a difficult story to adapt for the big screen. On the face of it, there are many contradictions right from the start (not least that our relatively normal narrator - trader ""Nick"" (Tobey Maguire) lives next door to the eponymous and enigmatic millionaire (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his Disney-esque castle). The story is told by way of a retrospective during which the now depressed ""Nick"" regales his psychiatrist with his tales of life in the fast lane that offered him the opportunity to mix with the rich and famous at the very end of the 1920s through his new neighbour. Simultaneously, he must cope with the unhappy marriage between his cousin ""Daisy"" (Carey Mulligan) and her selfish, womanising, husband - of old wealth - ""Tom"" (Joel Edgerton). The film starkly contrasts the wealth and profligacy of the ""Gatsby"" existence with those of the poverty stricken working class reeling, still, from the impact of the Great Depression. The film looks beautiful. The costumes and the dancing, the cars, the jewellery and the houses (fancy and less so) all add richness to the story and the performances - especially from DiCaprio, Edgerton and to a lesser extent Jason Clarke are really quite good. Maguire and Mulligan less so and I found that unlike in many other of his films, the use of a contemporaneous soundtrack whilst all are clad in the Upstate NY finery didn't work so well for me. The book is an interesting character study looking at just about everything from wealth and privilege to prostitution and mental illness - and for the most part this stays on track. Easily the best cinema adaptation of a flawed book - and well worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"The Great Gatsby is a story that is recorded by one Mr. Nick Carraway, of an ambitious boy who makes it large in life except for getting his one true love.","Mr. Jay Gatsby is a mystery; everybody has heard of him from the top bureaucrats and socialites to the whores in a common street brothel, and even fewer has actually set eyes on him. Finally one day Nick gets invited to Mr. Gatsby's party and an acquaintance slowly grows. However he soon realizes that Mr. Gatsby has other motives for forming such a friendship with him rather than for being neighbors. Thereafter we see through the eyes of Nick how an old love is rekindled between Gatsby and Daisy (Nick's married cousin) with a little help by him. However, as minutes pass in the movie, the lovers, Nick, and the audience as well, become more and more aware of their impending and inevitable doom. Finally it does come but not the same way they had feared, but much worse. It is a love story that has to fight the world for its fulfillment; they try and they fail. We understand that this was how Nick had got into the depression which made him start writing the account of the Great Gatsby in his journal.The movie as a whole fails to impress in so many aspects. It does not live up to the expectation even after the outstanding performances by the two great actors- Leonardo Di Caprio and Toby McGuire. Joel Edgerton as Tom Buchanan was outstanding as well. It tries too hard, and still does not manage to squeeze out a teardrop from the audience.It can be looked upon as a nice entertaining piece that can be watched by the gen-x and the coming generation who are just curious enough to get an idea about the society in that early period but don't care enough to spend necessary time to get in depth or to seek the reality. Wrapping up, I would say that its old wine not in a new bottle, rather in just a polished one.

The Great Gatsby...... The Great,"Just saw Baz Luhrmann's ""Great Gatsby"". ((note: for a fun drinking game, take a shot every time I mention Moulin Rouge)) Thought I might just throw out a review for the heck of it. First things first, it isn't perfect--though, if you expected it to be, you were expecting too much of an adaptation of a book. The script came down with a bad case of ""Titanic Syndrome"" ((those with angst about the liberal use of the words ""Rose"" and ""Jack"" in that film will know what I'm talking about)), to the point that if I hear someone called ""Old Sport"" again, someone is going to get punched. For the record, Harry Potter has a lot of the same problem with the script... it's almost like the writer forgot that this was going to be filmed (allowing us to see who is being addressed) and seen in one sitting (so we know that the person called ""old sport"" in shot 4A is the same person in shot 12B). Apart from that small shortcoming in the script, the acting was pretty good and the action was well paced.Now, the real reason for seeing a Baz Luhrmann film... the cinematography. The film strikes a near-perfect blend of not taking itself too seriously and heavy inter-personal drama. Like the three previous full-scale productions Luhrmann has done (Australia, Moulin Rouge, and Romeo + Juliet), the main reason for seeing this film is the impeccably creative way in which the story is told. If you've seen Moulin Rouge, you may get a little distracted in the use of the ""in scene narrator"" and semi-first-person storytelling as it feels all too familiar to the previous project... but the stories are so radically different in both setting and content that that can be pretty quickly tossed aside. There is some pretty sick animation work done too (for example, during a snow storm towards the end of the film, instead of snowflakes, it is falling and rotating letters which forms the words of the narration on the screen) that all is done for great effect to never let the viewer forget that they are hearing a story that is being typed. This is what allows for the already-mentioned similarity to Moulin Rouge... and the rockstar persona that comes with it.For some reason, when you make clear that the story you are seeing is taking place in context to a story being told within the film (ie, the ""main character"" of the actual film is telling the story you are watching to other people), it allows for a lot more bending of the rules of reality. Moulin Rouge and 300 would be the clearest examples of this--though there are certainly others. Because the rules of the road can be ignored somewhat, Baz Luhrmann feels quite comfortable setting a party scene in the 1920's Empire architecture with 2012 hip hop and then dares the audience to question it (like Moulin Rouge). The weird part is that it works. I don't know if it is the combination of the bombastic characters, the semi-over-colored sets or the core animation/camera work, but for some reason the blend of JayZ production capabilities with the ""flapper/speakeasy/gangster"" vibe fits in the 1920's atmosphere almost seamlessly... probably because this is the kind of music you would expect to hear there if they had it.For the real crowning moment, however, we find another of Luhrmann's recent favorites... a film with no good guys. Like Moulin Rouge, Gatsby centers on a protagonist who isn't the main character--yet whose main role is to narrate the film and hold all the various story elements together. Also, like Moulin Rouge, the narrator is a washed up writer that the world has chewed up and spit back out that is writing/narrating the story as a way to get it off their chest. Because of this, like in Moulin Rouge, pretty much everybody involved turns out to be a shmuck. There's the girl that makes you groan, the guy you want to deck at every opportunity, the love story with a bad ending and a couple rowdy and colorful party scenes in the middle. Though, I will say, watching this movie did make me wish I was a bond salesman in New York during the 1920's...... I wish I could get paid for doing that little work in a week.Final thought: Lots of eyecandy, sterling camera work, underpaid animators, good actors, good-but-not-great script. They told the story of Great Gatsby mostly as I remember it from the book.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Bountiful visual flair and stylish ambition, but ultimately just bombastic style over substance.","Though it has bountiful visual flair and is stylishly ambitious, The Great Gatsby's story gets lost amidst it's dazzling, yet overproduced spectacle and ultimately ends up being a prime example of style over substance.The story, if you haven't been through 11th grade English, is based upon the iconic novel, The Great Gatsby, written by F. Scott Fitzgerald in 1925, and over-analyzed and dissected to smithereens by confused teens ever since. It tells the tragic tale of a writer, his complex influence, his pouty lover, her snarky husband, and of course, a green light. No but we follow the story from the eyes of Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) in the Roaring Twenties as he moves to Long Island and begins the follow and befriend a rich and mysterious man named Jay Gatsby (Leo DiCaprio), who 1. Throws parties and 2. falls in the middle of a deadly love triangle which may or may not have tragic results. The novel offers up a plethora of social commentary on the American Dream and young pride, but do the story and allegories translate to the big screen? That's a loaded question old sport.The Great Gatsby rockets off with as a visually spectacular, sometimes overwhelmingly energetic, and stylishly entertaining piece of eye-candy. We start off with a bang, and the pacing is quick and exciting. The visual design is glossily crafted and everything, most notably the parties, are just a pleasure to watch. The cinematography is always lively, and seems to allow the viewer to enter the film's exuberant setting by gliding and sometimes whimsically traveling around the set pieces. The costumes are fantastic; each's color is saturated to their greatest, and the flashy intricacies of each look fantastic and add an important element of art deco style to the film. The sets range from marvelously detailed to the almost cartoony looking, obviously green screened, but for some reason it does fit with the style of the rest of the film. The 3D effects don't add as much depth as they should and become dizzying in some tightly edited, ecstatically shot scenes, but it still is passable. And now for the soundtrack; many are conflicted about the soundtrack due to its juxtaposition between, let's say, Gershwin and...um...Jay Z. I personally didn't mind it and thought that they oddly fit well with Luhrmann's style even if many were underused throughout. The acting is a bit of a mixed bag, but no one is terrible. Leo isn't captivating, but he still manages to add a level of like-ability to Gatsby, even if he doesn't seem completely invested in the role. Maguire is just fine as Carraway but just kind of blandly follows and narrates. The best is Edgerton who nicely creates both a slimy and intriguing character to counter Gatsby. Honorable mention goes to Elizabeth DeBicki who doesn't have much to do, but puts forth her best effort. And now for Daisy, Carey Mulligan isn't served the best justice due to the supposedly purposefully annoying nature of her character, but still she ends up just helplessly pouting and moping around the sets like a hormonally 16 year old. Also to be fair, this isn't an actors movie, but rather a directors movie, so it makes sense that some of the actors may seem only decent. Speaking of directors, Luhrmann altogether creates an interesting experiment. It's admirably ambitious and daring, and I partially admire him for his choices, however per usual, he does overproduce A lot of the film and almost seems to become too distracted with himself and the film's giddy style. By doing this he adds more color, but also takes away the vibrancy of the story. He tries to adapt much of the symbolism and themes form the book, but after a while they become too repetitive, and don't have anything to say about themselves. The films second half does have a deflated sense of energy, and also becomes tonally and narratively inconsistent. Some scenes and character interactions don't mix very well with others and there are slower sequences that feed sharply into fast-paced ones and the result isn't always entirely cohesive. Even while I haven't read the book, I still understand the importance and significance of the story, but feel like the film was aiming for recreating more of a mood that the book and characters evoke rather then focusing more of the narrative. I also disliked the ending, and thought that it was too uncompromising because in the book, it may have had a much more literary significant representation, but many of those words become lost in translation to the silver screen and the result is mixed. Also the overproduced sequences and pizazz of the film do become a tad bit annoying and hard to fully absorb.So, no matter what you think, it is safe to say that this film will be and is very polarizing. I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it either. The style didn't completely win me over, but it did keep my attention through it's long running time, and I was slightly invested in some of the characters, especially in one earlier sequence in the film between Gatsby and Daisy which I did adore.DISCLAIMER: I have not read The Great Gatsby, but will soon old sport.",,Anonymous,Romance
One of the best three movies in 2013 so far! 9!,"I did not expect ""The great Gatsby"" to be so good. I expected it would be another good movie with a great cast, but no so deep and entertaining. I had not seen the version released in 1974 and did not read the novel it is based on. The day after seeing the new version at a cinema, I saw the version released in 1974 starred by Robert Redford. I will begin to read the novel with the same title when I finish the novel I currently read. I already saw the most known movies directed by the Australian Baz Luhrmann. I particularly enjoyed ""Australia"", liked ""Romeo and Juliet"", hated ""Moulin Rouge"" and loved ""The great Gatsby"" in all aspects, except its lenght (it has to have some defect). This director has a personal characteristics present in all these films. The pace is excellent for a intriguing realistic romantic drama. As I explained, it would be better if it lasted 10 mins. less, but not important at all. The movie kept me amused during its entire duration, partially thanks to the amazing performances and backgrounds. The scenography is very colorful and beautiful. It is set in New York during the twenties. They took care with every detail: clothing, automobiles, architecture, vocabulary, etc. The soundtrack is very nice, too, with very well-known songs. This is one of the best points in the movie. The 1974 version is colorful and nice, too, but this is one is fascinating (partially thanks to technology and special effects). The cast is another strenght: Leonardo Dicaprio, Tobey Maguire, Carey Mulligan and Joel Edgerton are the main components. They are all excellent. I particularly liked Dicaprio as Gatsby, who is always so believable and changeling (special attention to his voice). In my humble opinion, with Robert Deniro and Jonhy Depp, he is objectively the best actor nowadays (I did not mean he was my favorite). Maguire is not as expressive as other actors, but he is very good anyway. He did an excellent job as the coprotagonist and narrator. Carey Mulligan, who is not that veteran, plays the part of the girl. She is very believable, too, and promising... Joel Edgerton, who acted even better in the movie ""Warrior"", is the antagonist in this case: Buchanan. He delivered a solid performance, the second best I have seen in him. The rest of the cast has done a more than correct job. The movie is intriguing and dramatic at the same time. The intrigue is focused on the character of Gatsby. The movie presents profound characters and deep performances, so we know what moves each one. At the same time, the movie is critical with the U.S. society of those years. The character development is another advantage of this movie. In conclusion, the movie is fascinating in nearly everything. I cannot say if the fans of the novel can enjoy or not because I have not read it yet, but surely those who like good-quality-dramas and Leo's fans will enjoy it. 9.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
An overstuffed armchair of a movie,"Leonardo DiCaprio and Casey Mulligan look terrific, but DiCaprio's performance is a bit puppet-like, though this may be Baz Luhrmann's direction, and Mulligan doesn't quite capture the shallow brittleness of Daisy the way Farrow did. Tobey Maguire is outstandingly good as Daisy's narrator cousin Nick, a character who may have inspired L.P Hartley to create the boy Leo in THE GO-BETWEEN.The big fault with the movie - and it will always be there - is Scott Fitzgerald's fault: not enough happens. Will Daisy and Gatsby recapture their lost love? What's the truth about his past? These are the only two elements to the story. An already slim plot gets thinner with such an extended adaptation. And repeated overcrowded parties and long tracking shots soon begin to look like the padding is coming out of this overstuffed armchair of a movie.It's visually glorious (and I only saw the 2D version) but it's a bit like a sweet with a hollow centre.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A Great Movie, But Built Around a Trailer","I'm a big fan of Baz, I'm a big fan of Jay-Z and I'm big fan of DiCaprio and Tobey in this movie, but something doesn't sit right when I watch this.It's not a secret that this movie is visually captivating. The costumes, atmospheres and soundtrack all work together to make an alive, pastel delight. Simply put, it is fun.To me it felt like all the elements were there. Obviously the plot line is solid, the acting is great and of course the visuals. Somewhere in the process of making this movie though, it feels like the overall direction was lost. There was a certain incongruity underneath it all.For example the parties in the movie, as most will agree, are extravagant, but the emphasis put on them, and the general bravado of the film almost seem like the centre-piece with the storyline, and character development tacked on top. I didn't feel engaged on a human level. It seemed to me that every line from the trailer was over pronounced in the actual film, which not only made me think that the trailer was over hyping, but also that the film was made with the trailer in mind, which makes sense considering the lack of focus and direction.Overall this movie was fun and had a certain wow-factor that makes it worth seeing in 3D, but there was an overpowering sense of the whole thing being stitched together, without having someone smooth out the overall shape to something that made sense through and through.But of course, this is just my opinion. Many of my friends loved this film, and I'm sure many more will too.Enjoy!",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"The Great Gatsby is better than great, it's amazing.","When I first saw the trailer for The Great Gatsby, I don't know what got me so excited, but it did. I haven't read the book, and really didn't know what the movie was about, but the previews got me excited. Again, I went into the movie not sure what to expect, but I came out knowing full well what it was, and how good it was.This movie is defined by a few things, one of the big ones being the story, and the artistic direction of the film. The story, told through the eyes of writer Nick Carraway, is a tragic love tale full of conspiracy, lies, and drama. The plot is very engaging to say the least, and the initial mystery behind the plot is entertaining. But what adds to the story is the film's wonderfully executed artistic design, portraying a captivating 1920's New York which is full of beautiful locations, colorful scenery, and an overall immersing atmosphere. High- energy parties filled with celebration and dancing, beautiful cars, and more. The movie displays a city in it's hay-day, and it is wonderful. The film's soundtrack also went in a different direction, opting for a modern day sound with modern day music instead of going 1920's with the music. And in turn, the soundtrack helps the movie more than hurts it, only adding to the sense of artistic beauty this movie provides. In an artistic sense, the movie is very captivating.The other large reason for this film's success is because of the extraordinary talents of the cast. The best actor that has never won an Oscar, Leonardo DiCaprio, plays the lead role as Jay Gatsby, and boy did it seem like another Oscar-winning performance to me. DiCaprio's acting wonders are on full display here, portraying a truly phenomenal character. Gatsby is a complicated, mysterious, lovable, colorful, emotional, and powerful character, and Leo nails the role to near perfection. This is some of the best work I've seen DiCaprio do, and that's pretty good going up against heavy hitters like Inception, The Departed, and Titanic among others. The supporting cast is equally as wonderful as well. The aforementioned Nick Carraway is played by Tobey Maguire, and his importance is more than just telling the story. He is a great character supporting player to DiCaprio's stellar performance, providing some laughs, emotion, and being the middle man in the overall story. Carey Mulligan plays the love interest to two characters, and also displays a complicated and emotional character, providing a depth to the story that makes you want to care. All said, the acting was pure gold, and brought the movie to life.I at times felt that the movie rushed a tad too fast, not giving viewers quite enough time to digest what was going on, but for the majority of the 143 minute run time, the pacing was solid.The movie finishes with a shocking conclusion (for people who haven't read the book) that really ended in a much different fashion than I expected. It was refreshing to be able to not have the movie figured out within the fist 30 or so minutes, keeping me interested in the story and how everything was going to play out.For me personally, I love nothing more than being immersed in a movie. I love it when I feel like I'm part of the story a movie is telling and I want to feel the emotions running through the film, no matter what they are. The Great Gatsby gives me my wish by displaying a fantastically beautiful and artistic setting, that has my eyes just wanting to see more and more of what's on the screen. The acting is sensational, the story is mysterious and interesting, the score is fun and powerful, and to reiterate again, the movie is simply captivating.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Misses on subtlety, scores on lead","Let me start off by saying I have an automatic bias: I've read the original novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald, so this review is coming from the standpoint of someone who knows and enjoys the story.Now let's talk about some good things in this movie. I thought Leonardo DiCaprio did a wonderful job as Gatsby, he was perfect for such a complex role. He never overdid it or underplayed Gatsby which I appreciated. He played the character very well and you could feel his hopefulness and blindly romantic personality radiate from the screen. Carey Mulligan wasn't too bad either. I've heard complaints about Tobey Macguire's performance, but I honestly didn't mind. None of the actors were awful, most were either OK or did really well. I also loved the costumes and the actual parties of the movies. I don't know how accurate any of it is (although I suspect some of the party scenes were a little too modernized, but we'll get to that in a minute), but it was visually pleasing. The changes to the story were obvious but didn't distract.Now on to some of my complaints. I think a million people have said this already but I want to say it again: the symbolism. Fitzgerald was a master at weaving in subtle symbols and parallel metaphors with each of his stories. In the book, the green light is talked about maybe once and then at the end. Here, it's every five minutes. I know the director must have wanted everyone to understand it, but shoving it in our faces is not the way to go. The audience can think for themselves, so it's up to them to draw their own conclusions. The end result of Gatsby's blind ambition is detracted somewhat because the green light isn't as powerful as in the book. Some of the music choices I completely disagreed with: Kanye West, Jay Z, and some form of Dubstep in a movie set in 1920's? I understand the need to connect with a modern audience, and it worked in Romeo and Juliet. But it only worked because Romeo and Juliet is a story that can be told at any time (seriously, does anyone actually know off the top of their head what year it's set in?). The Great Gatsby is suppose to be set in the 1920's and can only be set in that time period because that decade created these characters and those circumstances. There had to be a stock market boom, there had to be a war, there had to be a shift in the way people lived their life. So to try and modernize it with 2013 rapping is kind of an insult to the book.My final major complaint is the editing. I don't know how many times the focus switched sporadically between Daisy and Nick in that one conversation at the beginning of the movie, but it was distracting. It felt like the movie was going much too quickly, it kept jumping here, there and everywhere.My final review? Other then the subtlety, the editing and the music, it's a pretty good movie. The atmosphere is solid and you get drawn into this world quite easily. I say check it out, if not for the sole reason of DiCaprio's performance, because he is indeed, the Great Gatsby.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Greatest Gatsby,"I watched this film following all the reception it received both mixed and positive.I had never read the book nor watched the version of the movie released in the 1970's, but in the end i watched it for my favorite actor Leonardo DiCaprio.I was thoroughly delighted about how wonderful the movie was.The ending nearly left me in tears.The story was superb and the acting was top notch. DiCaprio led the cast with an exceptional performance as Gatsby.He was able to still retain some of his old charm, thereby making it his own role.I was pleasantly surprised with MaGuire's performance, conveying the character of Nick Caraway he was solid.Carey Mulligan and Joel Edgerton do justice to their roles.Eventually its the production design and music that is the hero of this movie. Such a lavish production is definitely a treat for the eye, even better if you watch it in 3D.In the end its Leonardo DiCaprio's performance and the screenplay courtesy of the great novel by F.Scott Fitzgerald that makes this movie really great",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
The typical Hollywood version of the 20's - 6/10,"Nope, I have not read the novel, but I hope that is a good thing compared to what I saw. Jay Gatsby, played by Leonardo DiCaprio who I've had some problems with in his past movies; I always thought that the movies he's been in are better than what he brings to the table as an actor. I couldn't see the character he was playing, I always saw DiCaprio doing the same thing but with different clothes and different names, and believe me when I say this, a lot of people patronize me for not liking him as an actor even though I do think that he has given us somewhat good performances (not great and Oscar worthy). But in this case, it was actually the other way around, the movie was actually a lot worse than what he was (not saying that he was bad), or let me put it like this, every actor in this film was much better at acting than the director Baz Luhrmann, at directing.The reason for that is one reason, and one reason only; F. Scott Fitzgerald. I think it is an actors dream to play one of his well written characters, therefore, all the actors could do their best and get lost in their characters. Whenever I found myself liking the movie it was thanks to the actors and their performances that felt real. There is a scene in it where Buchanan reveals Gatsbys real identity in the hotel room and Gatsby just goes mental at him, not only did it feel as if Buchanan was pushing Gatsby to his limit, but it felt as if Edgerton was pushing DiCaprio to his limit and that's what made this movie work for me, the chemistry between the actors.If things were a bit more physical and ""real"", I would've liked this movie somewhat more (I'm very happy that I did not see it in 3D), but if it was his intention not to do so then I guess he got the vision he wanted. I loved all the characters in this movie, but the movie itself was at times very annoying to watch with all its special effects and 2012's music (which by the way didn't fit in at all). The movie also had this typical Hollywood version of the 20's which I absolutely hate, where everything looks fancy, dreamy and colorful and makes people wish they had lived back then, when the reality is that it's all just the other way around. All the special effects changed the whole tone of the movie and made it into a fairytale, and there I was, who actually found the story quite depressing and sort of dark. This, in the end left me a bit annoyed because I know that had the movie been a bit dark as the story itself, it would have left me a lot more troubled - instead, Gatsby became that guy that no one cared about, not even me.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Flawed casting.,"Redford and Farrow was ultimately a much more satisfactory combination than the two leads in this remake.DiCaprio is quite good as the driven Gatsby but Mulligan does not have the charisma or incredible beauty of Farrow. This means that the obsession of Gatsby for Mulligan's character seems rather unlikely to say the least.The party scenes while undoubtedly visually impressive are ultimately far too overblown and again add a sense of unreality to the story. Tobey Maguire was unremarkable and not particularly sympathetic which again did not help.It isn't a bad film, the essential storyline still holds some interest and the plot is excellent (as it should be given the source material) but the above flaws prevented the film from being anything special.This version suggests that certain films are better left alone. The Redford Gatsby was already superb and there was no need to do it again.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Better than I expected,"1. I don't like the director or his previous work. 2. I have never liked Leonardo DiCaprio. That being said I went in with very low expectations, and was pleasantly surprised. I enjoyed the book when I first read it, and to me this movie captured it perfectly. Everyone was perfectly cast, and it followed the book almost completely, something some movie adaptations of books refuse to do. I thought the rap soundtrack would throw me off, but the decadence of the modern culture matches up well with the decadence of the roaring twenties.In fact, a lot of parallel's could be drawn between the 1920's and the more decadent elements of the modern world, Gatsby's house is something you would see shamelessly displayed on cribs, though Mr. Gatsby has far more class and humanity than any modern imitators. It is also a wonderful condemnation of the party lifestyle that is omnipresent in our modern world.

Great adaptation of a great novel,"I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed this adaptation of the classic American novel. Lurhmann makes his mark on this without diminishing the central themes of the novel. Instead he brings forth a modern dimension to the near century old novel. He manages to deftly bring to the screen the major accomplishment of the novel which is the presentation of the Jazz Era. While Fitzgerald brings this forth through words, Lurhmann uses supreme cinematography. I saw this in real 3D and it was thoroughly worth it. The casting was excellent with Maguire and DiCaprio playing very well opposite each other. Maguire's Carraway was aptly mesmerized with DiCaprio 's Gatsby. Dicaprio pulls off Gatsby with his slightly smarmy deliverance of some of the lines, which I found to be true to the novel.I was most surprised at Mulligans portrayal of Daisy. I didn't see her as rightly cast put she is more than able to share the screen with DiCaprio and shows Daisy to be the smart but submission female that she is.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
1920's Period Piece Ruined by Modernist Director,"Most everything about this Great Gatsby retelling is fine entertainment, from actor's performances down to the set design (mostly digital composites). What is most troubling here though is usually something that most people just forget about because it typically blends in so well, we are talking about the film score. Unfortunately, the director made a very risky choice to score the film with a hybrid of Hip Hop and Jazz (leaning very heavily on Jay-Z lyrics and rap style). When it happens, it completely confuses the viewer out of the 1920's and into modern day and the whole experience feels disjointed, almost completely breaking down illusion.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Just enjoy a great film.,"I have read too many reviews about how this movie isn't as good as the book or this movie isn't as good as previous versions. Well to those people I say why not just rate the movie on what it is intended for; a couple of hours enjoyment and even to maybe ask yourself what's possible with a bit of hope.Now I have never read the book or seen any of the other adaptations but I can gather that maybe Luhrmann strays a little from the details in the book. But does that really matter if the film is genuinely entertaining to watch. I found myself eager to find out who Gatsby really was. And I think this was down in no small part to Leonardo Di Caprio. He played the character brilliantly oozing confidence and really stealing the show. In fact it wouldn't surprise me to see the term ""old sport"" making its way back to popular culture thanks to Leo.Another area which has took a lot of criticism is the soundtrack. However I have to say I loved the contrast of 1920's New York and the recent music of jay z among others. I really felt this worked in emphasising the grandness and showmanship of who and what Gatsby was portraying. The scale of the movie was also really impressive and I'm sure that anyone who sees it would love to have attended any of the parties that were brilliantly shot during the film.However the movie isn't perfect. Tobey Maguire's character comes across as a little bit too much of a lap dog. I found myself getting frustrated at his lack of grit to make his own decisions whether this be with Gatsby or Joel Edgerton's Tom Buchanan.All in all though this is a really great film. Di Caprio is at his brilliant best ( but to be honest when is he not) and the grandness of the event just has to be enjoyed. Luhrmann s imagery really does make you appreciate what the cinema can offer as opposed( or along with) the novel.",,Anonymous,Romance
"If you really want to grasp the notion of Gatsby, 2013's adaptation is not the one to watch – somehow by and between all the glamor they've missed what it was all about","My first watch of The Great Gatsby of 2013 did really raised some doubts but the general impression was not bad. Unfortunately it lasted only until I recollected the book as well as Clayton's adaptation as of 1974 (initially read and watched more than 15 years ago). The intro and the storytelling approach in general were simply devastation - whoever thought of such ""improvement"" to the story has desperately and hopelessly mistaken. About the directing – usually I tend to fall for some extravagant and bold directing but in this case such ""fast and furious"" and ""we are so over the boring old retro"" approach is definitely ruining the story – obviously it has its followers but I find it quite inappropriate. Also, the 3D format, whatever its purpose was, didn't upgrade the movie to a masterpiece.During the whole time while watching the new version I was wondering what was so wrong with the contemporary Daisy and finally it hit me- the point about Daisy was not like being blond and mediocre but in the emanation of the whole notion of ""rich girls do not marry poor guys"" on which Mia Farrow actually got an amazing grip. Our new Daisy was innocent and almost naive like a sweet little girl and one is never sure until the end what her choice would actually be. She's gaining spectator's compassion, making everyone dubious whether she is the good girl or the bad girl instead of leaving the firm impression that she's just not the right girl – said in other words, Farrow's Daisy is vulgar to the bones and never misleading whilst Mulligan's is almost a victim. And now to J Gatsby- is there anyone even slightly convinced that DiCaprio could successfully challenge Robert Redford with this part?! Don't think so. Really, the older he gets, the better he plays but what he generally lacks is this aura of nobleness and the distinguished appearance which one Gatsby should possess; instead, while playing Gatsby our Leo looks like he has not developed much since we had him as the adventurous tricky boy from Titanic. Finally about Nick –who on earth thought to represent this reflective wise spectator as a boyish ""I'm such a freshman and so surprised with everything"" folk?! Truth be told, there were actually some good points - the costumes and the decors demand for applause – the designers have performed an awesome job and deserve all due respect. Also, the new Jordan truly excels the old one. But honestly, between the whole glamor, luxury and pompousness turning into grotesque, somehow they've lost what the story was all about.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Some people who want to see a fast pace story with music and party's will love it. But it doesn't get any deeper than that.

Great Gatsby? Great God it's a masterpiece!,"Baz Luhrmann has successfully created (along with his crew) the most exquisite portrayal of Gatsby I believe possible. His use of costumes and set for starters is show-stopping, going all out and dripping every inch of the film in the sparkling champagne of the roaring twenties.The music is inspiring. Jay-Z has managed to create a modern edge on traditional Jazz and bent and twisted it to give the effect of either the rough, dirty and crowded city of New York or the dazzling, priceless spectacle of the rich on Long Island. Finally the actors are spot on when it comes to the carefree (or careless in some cases) attitude of the new generation in the 1920's where life is one big party and money is essential to have (in large quantities). I was blown away and I hope the rest of the audience are too.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"The Great Gatsby may be flashy and full of grandeur, but ultimately it falls short when it comes to heart and substance.","he Great Gatsby. Directed by Baz Luhrmann. Based on the novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald. Starring Leonardo Dicaprio, Carey Mulligan, and Tobey Maguire. Rated PG-13 with a running time of 143 Minutes. Given a 7.5/10 on IMDb.com and certified 48% Rotten on Rottentomatoes.com""A Midwestern war veteran finds himself drawn to the past and lifestyle of his millionaire neighbor.""So I've read ""The Great Gatsby"" in my current English class and I've found that I thoroughly enjoy the story but I don't really like the book or the 1974 movie. However, I attempted to watch this film with an open mind, from the point of view of an average movie goer, with no prior knowledge of Gatsby and here's what I took from the film overall.Luhrmann delivers as always with a dreamlike beauty on the side of cinematography. Each scene is beautifully sculpted, flashy, and absolutely magnificent. However, the vast amounts of green screen used to create these scenes tends to be too ""in your face"" for my taste and I eventually got so tired of it to the point that I was getting a headache. I can't imagine the pain that anyone watching in 3D was feeling. That being said, the visuals on this film are definitely worth the $10 I dropped to watch it.The cast did a phenomenal job with their characters. Carey Mulligan who plays Daisy Buchanan gave just enough flair and melancholia to her character to be admired. Tobey Maguire sadly fell short in a role that's absolutely important to the plot but ultimately so simple that anyone could've pulled it off, which is what saddens me considering Maguire is a capable actor but it seems he just missed it on this role. Leonardo Dicaprio's Jay Gatsby is honestly the best part of this film. He truly embodies all of the complexities of Gatsby is a way that's never been done before and I'd argue that this is, if not one of, his greatest performances of his entire career. However, try as they might, the phenomenal acting just isn't enough to the film out of the water.The first half of the film is full of grandeur and tantalizing imagery, but the Kanye West soundtrack and lack of any 'real' plot development left me bored and disappointed. Sadly, I wanted to leave the theater in within the first thirty minutes. About midway, when Daisy and Gatsby meet, the film does get better but at this point it just isn't enough. There's an immense amount of overacting, weird shots, and a level of silliness that just can't be shaken. Nick Carraway's constant narration becomes annoying. I found myself on the edge of my seat as the film spiraled into it's climactic conclusion, spinning a beautiful end, but it was too difficult for me not to laugh at how hard they were trying to pick something up after it had dropped and shattered upon the floor. I had to check my watch multiple times in the cinema and I was relieved by the time the credits finally began to roll.Overall, The Great Gatsby had entirely too much potential to be absolutely incredible and a spectacular rendition of it's source material, but it fails to capture the true heart and meaning of the book. It weaves a carnival of wonder and I really wanted to love this film. It's not a disaster, but by the time it decides what it's doing, it's already too late. I suggest it's better to ""beat on"" then to waste your time. Sorry, Old Sport.I'll see you at the movies!~Tyler Skye Gordon",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
the most realistic love story I've ever seen,"What a fantastic novel, what a fantastic movie.

"""DiCaprio is a joy to watch...""","This year's adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby has been long awaited. Aside from being one of the most famous novels of all time, it is directed by the glitzy and visual director Baz Luhrmann, and with Leonardo DiCaprio starring, it certainly had a lot of hype to live up to.DiCaprio steals the show and, like Gatsby, keeps the film afloat when other elements seem doomed for the seabed. He is a joy to watch from his intriguing and captivating introduction to his desperate and destructive finale. Seemingly appearing out of thin air, with a past shrouded in mist and with, on the surface at least, an enviable demeanor and lifestyle, he pleasantly evokes Fight Club's Tyler Durden. Luhrmann has said his casting of Gatsby had to be a great actor and a star, and in a world where the star persona is regrettably being overshadowed by overnight celebrityism, DiCaprio is one of the last good guys standing, and the perfect choice for the role.Carey Mulligan as Daisy Buchanan is also worth noting, in a role that really allows to her to use her innocence and natural beauty to great value, but unfortunately Joel Edgerton's performance wavers, while Tobey Maguire, hazy-eyed and naïve as Nick Carraway, seems to have unfortunately not yet grown out of his red and blue spandex from a decade ago. His voice-over becomes tiring very quickly, which unfortunately devalues scenes and takes centre stage when the audience would much rather be allowed the luxury of seeing a scene play out rather than have Maguire paraphrase for them. A strange and incomprehensible decision to bookend the film with a vignette of Carraway writing the story from a sanitarium distances the audience and adds another unnecessary layer to keep cutting back to.We know Luhrmann is a fan of mixing contemporary music with period pieces- remember the rendition of Smells Like Teen Spirit in his 2001 film Moulin Rouge!, but despite the great use of a Jay-Z soundtrack, in conjunction with the depiction of drinking and partying, it sometimes feels like Project X has gone back in time, and this cheapens an expensive, lavish piece. Gatsby's own parties are full of the grandiose extravagance we are expecting, but if only we hadn't been in the 1920s frat-style party ten minutes before, the effect would have been so much greater.With pushbacks and a marketing budget bigger than Gatsby's annual spending allowance, there was obviously a lot of hype and anticipation surrounding the film. Unfortunately I'm not sure it has succeeded in fulfilling this expectation.As I left the theatre, I was unable to put my finger on how I felt about it. Did it tell me the story of Gatsby? Yes. Did I enjoy it? Yes, partly. Did it make me feel anything? No, not really. And therein lies the problem. There is enough flamboyancy and large-scale magnificence for any Luhrmann fan to be fulfilled, but in a story of character and depth, this is not enough. The special moments in the film were burdened with a wearisome voice-over, and as much style as Luhrmann brought to the table with this offering, it seems he sacrificed substance. DiCaprio is certainly The Great Gatsby, but the film is simply The Gatsby.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Huge hit with our teen critics. Loved the plot, visuals, music, cast and crew.","""The Great Gatsby"" tells the story of Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio), a secretive millionaire who is in love with a wealthy woman named Daisy Buchanan, played by Carey Mulligan. When Daisy's cousin, Nick Carraway, played by Tobey Maguire, moves in next to Gatsby, he doesn't hesitate to use Nick to get close to his lost love. With the publicity constantly involved in his life, Gatsby finds it hard keeping his love for Daisy hidden from her husband. When Daisy's Husband, Tom Buchanan. Played by Joel Edgerton, discovers his wife's affection for Gatsby, he is quick to make sure it doesn't last. When Jay Gatsby's past is revealed, his entire life begins to unravel. Can Gatsby and Daisy make a life for themselves or will the past control the future?I am in love with this movie! Words can't describe how incredible the entire film is, but I'll do my best. This film is in 3D, which makes the incredible set and costume design come to life. The visuals in this film could have been a movie of its own because they are so breathtakingly beautiful. The rich colors and textures make the cinematography pop. This film is set in the 20s, where life for the wealthy was lavish and over the top 24-7 and the wardrobe really shows that off. The entire look of this movie is so rich and lavish that it sucks you in and you feel as if you can grasp the fabrics and streamers of Jay Gatsby's parties because everything is so full-bodied with color. I feel like you could take a screenshot of every frame in this film and then send it off to a photography museum because it is just so striking.The soundtrack is another thing of wonder in this film. It features modern songs such as Jay-Z and Kanye West's ""No Church in the Wild"" as well as Lana Del Rey's ""Young and Beautiful"" and other artist such as Florence + the Machine, Beyonce, Will.Iam and even a few dubstep mixes, however all these modern hits are meshed with 20s rag time, giving it an authentic feel with a modern edge. It took me a few scenes to get used to because when I first heard modern artist Frank Ocean singing while a 20s-themed trumpet tune played, I was a little shocked. Once I warmed up to it, I fell in love with the unique sound. I actually think it is a very clever way to make the younger generation become more enthralled with the movie because the music we are used to at parties is the more modern sound. I think it is a clever way to make the festivities of this movie more appealing to a younger crowd.My favorite scene would have to be when Nick goes to one of Gatsby's massive parties. People from all over New York and from all walks of life would flock to Gatsby's house weekend after weekend to indulge in his lavish lifestyle, even though none of them knew Gatsby or had ever met him. In the very first party scene you really become engorged in the luxurious accommodations of Gatsby's palace. His house is filled with streamers, dancers, outrageously dressed guests and vivid decor. The entire scene is so visually pleasing. I also really enjoyed the scene where Gatsby plans for Daisy to visit Nick at his house and then ""coincidentally"" stop by so he can see her again after 5 years. I like this scene because Gatsby always seems like such a confident man who is on top of the world but, when he is faced with seeing his true love after so many years apart, he gets the demeanor of a squeamish school boy. It is so cute how he obsesses over Daisy in the beginning of the scene and it is touching how nervous he gets before she comes over. Leonardo's acting in this scene is truly astounding and his subtle display of emotions accents the fact that he is frantically trying to conceal his emotions.My favorite character is Jay Gatsby because he is such a complex man. He builds his entire dream life to impress Daisy. He builds his home across the lake from her house so he can see her, throws parties hoping she'll attend, and does everything in his power to be near to her which is very humbling considering he could do virtually anything with his riches. Leonardo's performance in this film deserves an award because of how realistically he portrayed Gatsby. I truly respect Leonardo as an actor because no matter what role he is playing I never see it as Leo playing so and so, but I see him as the actual character. He full-heartedly embodies Jay Gatsby and shows the depths of the character in such a remarkable way. I loved every second of his performance.Overall I give this film 5 out of 5 stars, I would give it more if I could! ""The Great Gatsby"" has everything I look for in a film - well executed plot, excellent visuals, unique music, and a brilliant cast and crew. I recommend this film for ages 13 and up for excessive drinking and mature situations. I can't wait to see this film again.Video review available at kidsfirst.org.",,Anonymous,Romance
Greatest Gatsby ever?,"Didn't have great expectations, but became surprised. Suddenly I think I understand what Fitzgerald's novel is about.What Gatsby does is having a hope so extreme, that he even thinks he can not only stop time, but bring it back. That's reality to him. The green light far away but so near is the symbol, but God watches it all through the eyes of a dirty poster.Not that Di Caprio is good, but he is the engine of the Plaza Hotel scene, which puts everything on the edge. Existentialism shines through all the flapper luxury. And the green light is still there, even after the party is over.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Chaotic, frantic, and emotional with heavy handed imagery.  Exactly how Gatsby should be.","I hadn't read any critic's reviews on this piece before seeing this movie, I finally did the right thing and saw a movie for myself without letting pretense, opinion or bias of another individual interfere with my experience. But going into the movie I did understand that many critics' reviews were not favorable. After seeing this movie I am absolutely baffled at how this could be so.First off, this movie is a fairly accurate representation of the novel. All of the key moments of the book are left nearly intact and if changed they are simply subject of stylistic interpretation. Which brings me to my next point: stylistic choices. I can only assume this is where this film lost favor with the critics. The style of this film is gaudy, hectic and downright blurred with chaos at some points. I found this to be a wonderful choice for the film as it compliments the tone of much of the film perfectly. The editing shows great attention to pace as the film dazzles with decadent splendor, taking care with appropriate segues of narration, and drawing out pace as the film's mood takes a dive into desperation. At times the film nearly bludgeons the audience with emotion and it attempts to brainwash you with the novel's famous symbolic images, but this was something I expected, however, as this was the experience I recalled from when I first experienced the novel.The performances are not without their notability either. The charming yet tortured character of Gatsby could not be portrayed by anyone better than Leonardo Dicaprio. As for Tobey McGuire, he conveys Nick Carraway's self conscious journey amongst the nihilistic American bourgeois in a careful and precise manner. I cannot imagine any two pair of actors playing these parts better than these two.In the end I believe that anyone who is a fan of the novel will be a fan of this movie. This movie does not suffer from any fundamental film making short comings. If one finds fault with this movie its most likely because they are at a disagreement with some of the director's stylistic choices. Heck, it may upset people to hear hip hop so often interjected into a period piece, but as it cross-fades with many interesting jazz tunes it must be recognized as yet another stylistic choice. I sincerely appreciated the entertainment value as well as the artistic endeavors of this film. It conveyed a unique interpretation of the novel that I found emotionally poignant and thought provoking. The film maybe a gaudy blur, but in the end it accentuated the most memorable images and lines from the original novel and it reminded me why the Great Gatsby is an American classic.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Style over substance, but what style!","Probably the most lavish film production since Gone with the Wind. Wow, I could not stop thinking about how much this film had to cost, it was that outrageously extravagant(Liberace would have loved it!)Style trumped substance so greatly that the story was secondary to the production, and it resulted in a story that appeared to be more fairy tale than real life, which was just the way Gatsby wanted it to be in his attempt to be publicly accepted as a great party host and man of distinction, especially as he made his great wealth through hidden criminal enterprises that he painfully tried to keep very secret.DeCaprio was more or less effective as Gatsby, as his strangely nervous and angry moods and behavior reflected more a mental case than they did a fabulously successful businessman. I thought he should have been, as he was in the book, much more of a mystery man and less personally exposed in his great flaws for the story to be as engaging as the F. Scott Fitzgerald book. I did enjoy Toby Maguire's character Nick's story narration done later from a mental hospital, as he appeared at the time of the story to be the one normal person in a roomful of damaged people who could say what really happened. Carey Mulligan as Daisy was cute but didn't add enough presence for the role.Films change original stories a little or a lot to match what the writer and director want as entertainment, which is always more important in and to Hollywood than is adherence to source material, so this film result was not fully faithful to Fitzgerald's book as it was more a Broadway musical/drama hybrid extravaganza that was as over the top as it was an unrewarding story about the Great Man. If you love lavish productions and costuming, see it for that and forget about the flawed story relating to the book. It was as grand a show as they get but not much more than that.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Sensational and lively showcase based on Fitzgerald's novel,"Based on F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic novel that many of you were probably required to read in your English class in high school, The Great Gatsby tells the story of Nick Carraway (played by Tobey Maguire), a World War I veteran who resides in the fictional town of West Egg in Long Island during the 1920s Prohibition era, New York, who is introduced the astonishing lifestyle of his neighbor Jay Gatsby (played by Leonardo Dicaprio), a millionaire who owns an expensive mansion on the coast of Long Island and hosts parties of hundreds of attendees. While Gatsby is the most heard-of person in town, the man is full of mysterious of where he is from, where he obtains on his wealth, and what kind of person he truly is. What Nick learns is that Gatsby trying to win the heart of his (Nick's) cousin Daisy (played by Carey Mulligan), his former sweetheart who he abandoned years ago when he was deployed to fight overseas during World War I. Unfortunately, she is now married to her unfaithful husband Tom (played by Joel Edgerton). From there on, everyone is driven in a life of complication and unexpected tragedy.Leonardo Dicaprio reunites with Director Baz Luhrmann after their first collaboration in the modernized adaption to William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet in 1996. Luhrmann blesses his film with such an incredible script and a captivating direction. The story is so elegantly written and is full of energy and cleverness. Leonardo Dicaprio once again leaves an everlasting impression with an ingenious performance as the film's titular character, and Tobey Maguire does a quite phenomenal job as Nick Carraway, arguably his best role of his career. The chemistry between the two feels so real and engaging and really keeps their characters alive. Gatsby is pretty captivating character throughout the movie. There are some things we never learn about him like he became so wealthy, but neither does Nick Carraway and that is the main mystery of the story and what makes his character so intriguing. Secondly, the production design is quite an eye-catcher as well. The beautiful construction and design of the sets such as Gatbsy's mansion are very gorgeous and give the film such an authentic representation of the 1920s. The same thing can be said about Nick's house and the design of the front yard. The set designs are very moody to where the audience will feel like they are not looking at the film sets, but actual images of the 1920s environment.The Great Gatsby is what I considered to be one of the sensational and most faithful film adaptions made, although there are a few changes from the novel. The performances are great, the storytelling is incredible, and the direction and screenplay is quite solid. Regardless of if you read the novel or not, the film is highly recommendable.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

The Problem with Gatsby,"After searching for the greatest books of all time, I encountered this book ranking in top ten in multiple lists. In one of them it ranks number one where Dostoevsky ranks only 15, while in some others there is no Dostoevsky at all. I wondered how good it could be. And I was not wrong. It is the most overrated book I have ever read. The story is meaningless, scattered and aimless. The author most probably made up disjointed stories inspired from his own life and then combined them to make a book. I was bored reading it. The representation of places are unrealistic. Characters are all shallow, undeveloped and unrelatable. With all these downsides how good can a film adaptation be even if there is Leonardo DiCaprio in it? For this film, the problem is not about acting or directing but about the book it is based on.There are also some issues with the filmmaking. They strangely blended Jazz music with techno and pop. Moreover, the film involves excessive usage of CGI leading to an unattractive photography.As for comparison with previous film adaptations, this one is slightly better than the 1949 version because the latter involves the most plot modifications. For me, 2013 version is the second good adaptation. The best one is the 1974 version which is almost perfectly loyal to the book.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Visually great but ruined by the soundtrack,"I started watching this movie back in 2014 and was turned off by the hip hop. I hadn't read any reviews at the time and it came as a surprise to me. It struck me as ridiculous and offensive. I just watched it all the way through and my opinion hasn't changed.The cinematography is excellentx It very effectively captures the era and creates the spectacle true to the novel. But all that is wasted by the soundtrack. I'll admit I'm not a hip hop fan, but I'd be just as put off if it was rock & roll music. Not that I'm a jazz fan either, but with this story, Jazz is what I want to hear, and as similar as possible to the original.Most movies that I consider great classics capture my imagination so I'm absorbed in the story. Using hiphop against that backdrop is just wrong. If you want a hip hop soundtrack bring Gatsby into the 21st Century. We have the wars, the bull markets and crashes required by the plot.

"A Surprisingly ""Great"" Gatsby","It's been almost a week since I saw this film, and it's been on my mind since I left the theatre. I went in with quite low expectations; I hated Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet adaptation, and to make it worse, most critics aren't exactly predicting this film to make a splash at the Oscars. With both of those things in mind, I was pretty much ready to have one of my favourite books be torn apart by incompetency.But that didn't happen.The movie starts with Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) giving a brief introduction to the setting of Fitzgerald's classic. Even this early in the film, there are some alterations that will drive many fans of the book crazy. As the first act continues, we are introduced to the Roaring Twenties, and wow, Luhrmann makes them roar. During these opening sequences, we hear the now infamous Jay-Z soundtrack very frequently, and although I initially hated the idea of it, I actually found myself enjoying it during the film. I'm not really sure why, looking back, but it just seemed to fit really well.As we are introduced to some of the main characters, a few of the actors really stood out. Joel Edgerton as Tom Buchanan seemingly walks off the page; he IS Tom. I also really enjoyed Carey Mulligan, who seems to have divided critics. Now, as far as Tobey Maguire is concerned, I thought he was okay. It should be noted that I thought he got better as the movie went on, and I think this is because he's a better supporting actor than a lead actor.As the first act closes with the same over-the-top crazy partying it began with, we finally meet the namesake of the novel. Up to this point, I had been quite entertained, but there wasn't anything that really snatched my attention. When Leonardo DiCaprio enters, he does just that. As someone who was actually quite skeptical about Leo in this role, I couldn't have been more wrong. While he's on screen, you see the person that Fitzgerald and Carraway describe, and he is exactly as they describe him. Wow. That's all that came to mind.As the second act begins, DiCaprio takes over the lead role and Maguire moves to a more supporting role, and this is where Fitzgerald's story really begins. From here on, the movie is fantastic. Many people will be alienated by the alterations, the in-your-face special effects, the soundtrack, or whatever else people are complaining about during the first act, but if you stick through it, you will not be disappointed. I know some people haven't read the book, so I went get into details about this part, but if you have read the book, I really do think you will be impressed by the second half of the movie.When the film reached its concluding moments, I was completely satisfied. For me, it really did justice to the book, and unlike Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet, I felt this film showed a real respect for its source material, and told an accurate and thoroughly entertaining version of Fitzgerald's masterpiece. Looking once again at the reviews I've read, I have to wonder how many people just watched the first half, or maybe were so alienated by the time it was over they just completely tuned out the second half. For me, that's really the only explanation for the negative reviews.Ultimately, this is a great movie. It's a beautiful film (with or without 3D), it's well acted, and it really does a great job with Fitzgerald's work.So, I was wrong, and I'm really happy I was. Mark me down as a Luhrmann fan, and I'm looking forward to his next efforts.RATING: 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
I have never read The Great Gatsby,"I know of the story but nothing more then that, so I was totally oblivion to what to expect and what the story was about. I figured that this was going to be a long drama with romantic episodes and a story that would be interesting but not filled with any surprises as such.The settings of this story is very good, it is very extravagant and fancy at the big mansions, very lively, jazzy and vulgar in New York City and down to earth, dirty and different in the coal production between them.The Jazz music is great, new songs that you know but in a jazz setting and sound, it works very well for the big mansion settings, the parties and the the smaller New York City apartments and really give the movie extra life.The movie is moving slow, not that nothing is happening and parts of the movie is certainly happening and screaming and shouting, but the story behind it all is a slow one and in my opinion a bit boring.All-in-all the film is entertaining, but it becomes a bit long and tedious, I liked most parts of it, but it didn't capture me as other big dramas have done before, it is mostly an okay movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Getting it Right,"I was somewhat put off by the over-the-top trailers that made this version of ""Gatsby"" look as if it were in the style of a Busby Berkeley musical. Having recently reread the book it was difficult for me to envision the narrative with singers and chorus lines. I'd had mixed reactions to Baz Luhrmann's previous films, really enjoying his ""Romeo and Juliet"" while ""Moulin Rouge"" pretty much left me in the cold.Finally I got around to watching it over HBO on a big screen television and I was more than pleasantly surprised. Of the various versions I've seen, including the 1949 version with Alan Ladd and the 2000 version with Robert Redford, I think this one captures the true spirit of the novel. Ironically the very qualities that had initially put me off are what made it work for me.Essentially, Fitzgerald's novel embodies the Great American Fairytale. Instead of following the conventions of a period drama Luhrmann, by making use of over-the-top digital technology and a highly exaggerated color palate catapults us into a world of dreams that echoes the overblown expectations of the period that Scott Fitzgerald was portraying. One can readily see the imprint of the Gold Diggers movies of the 30's, the heightened criminality of the prohibition years and the hopeful delusions of a boom that preceded the great crash. Every frame of the movie virtually explodes with the tensions of an intoxicated dream, and this is exactly what Fitzgerald intended to convey in his tale of 'the most hopeful man' his narrator Nick Carroway ever met.DiCaprio, Mulligan and Maguire are perfect fits for the characters of Gatsby, Daisy and Carroway, able to convey the romantic earnestness of people who are somewhat lost and bewildered by the world in which they find themselves. The most important characters are those of time and place, the vision of a city living in extremes, evoked by the bright furies of Time Square, the devastated wastelands of a Brooklyn slum and the feudal glories of Long Island.Best of all, there are the most beautiful passages from the book itself, flashed across the screen like the letters on a Wall Street teletype.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Visual spectacle!,"'The Great Gatsby' is an epic, tragic love story disguised as a glitzy, glamorous film displaying wealth and opulence.Firstly, WOW, the visuals are stunning. This film looks good on screen. It is a colorful, vibrant, and lively visual spectacle. The production design is also incredible! I'm such a fan of visionary director Baz Luhrmann, whose films never cease to amaze me. 'The Great Gatsby' is another perfect example.Leonardi DiCaprio stars as Jay Gatsby, a man who would go to any lengths for the love of a woman, Daisy. He hosts extravagant parties, inviting everyone, in the hopes of seeing her. Daisy, however, is married to Tom, but their marriage leaves little to be desired. As a result we root for Jay, although his methods are unconventional. Daisy's cousin is Jay's neighbor, Nick (Tobey Maguire). When Jay makes friends with Nick, he asks him to arrange to see Daisy.What follows, is a snowball effect of action, drama, deceit, love, lust, and tragedy. Set in the 20's, the film has a modern hip-hop soundtrack. So unusual, and yet it works so well. 'The Great Gatsby' is a visual treat and an emotional journey. I so enjoyed it.

A Lavish and Evocative Adaptation of a Literary Classic,"Baz Luhrmann's 2013 adaptation of ""The Great Gatsby"" is a visually stunning and emotionally resonant take on F. Scott Fitzgerald's beloved novel. The film is a dazzling spectacle that captures the excess, glamour, and melancholy of the Jazz Age, while also delivering a poignant commentary on the American Dream.Leonardo DiCaprio shines as Jay Gatsby, embodying the character's charisma, mystery, and tragic optimism with a performance that is both nuanced and powerful. DiCaprio's Gatsby is an enigmatic figure, driven by love and haunted by his past, and he brings a depth to the role that is both captivating and heartbreaking.Tobey Maguire is well-cast as Nick Carraway, the film's narrator and Gatsby's confidant. Maguire delivers a restrained performance that effectively contrasts with the extravagance of the world around him. His perspective as an outsider looking in adds a layer of introspection and morality to the narrative.Carey Mulligan's portrayal of Daisy Buchanan is delicate and complex, capturing the character's allure and fragility. Daisy is both a symbol of Gatsby's aspirations and a deeply flawed individual, and Mulligan navigates this duality with grace.Luhrmann's direction is characteristic of his style, with lavish sets, extravagant costumes, and a contemporary soundtrack that somehow fits seamlessly into the 1920s setting. The film's visual aesthetic is breathtaking, with a use of color and imagery that brings Fitzgerald's world to life in a way that is both opulent and symbolic.The screenplay, co-written by Luhrmann and Craig Pearce, stays true to the spirit of the novel while making it accessible to a modern audience. The dialogue retains much of Fitzgerald's poetic prose, and the themes of love, greed, and disillusionment are as relevant as ever.One of the film's most remarkable achievements is its ability to capture the essence of the Roaring Twenties, with its sense of boundless possibility and its undercurrent of emptiness and despair. The party scenes are a whirlwind of color and energy, contrasting sharply with the more intimate, emotional moments.However, the film is not without its flaws. At times, the style can feel overwhelming, and the pacing is uneven. The reliance on visual spectacle can sometimes overshadow the subtler aspects of the story and characters.The film's soundtrack, featuring a blend of jazz and contemporary music, is both bold and fitting. It underscores the film's themes of timelessness and the cyclical nature of history and human ambition.In conclusion, ""The Great Gatsby"" is a visually arresting and emotionally engaging adaptation of a literary classic. It captures the spirit of Fitzgerald's novel while presenting it in a visually unique and captivating way. The performances are strong, the direction is inventive, and the production values are exceptional. Despite some over-the-top elements, the film earns a solid 8 out of 10 for its ambition, style, and its poignant exploration of the American Dream.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not quite there,"The cast for 'The Great Gatsby' has been beautifully picker and I feel that the actors capture Fitzgerald's portrayal of the characters accurately. As always, DiCaprio hadn't failed to entertain. However, the soundtrack is very questionable - I feel torn as to whether the abstract choice is smart or just an idea that failed terribly. In addition, I noticed that the backgrounds in some scenes looked cheap and low quality, yet I'm sure they were used with the aim to make the movie seem fairytale like. Overall, I give the movie a 7/10 mostly based on the performance of the actors.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Surprisingly good,"Having read the book in HS (requirement), I was always intrigued by the main character, was his love for Daisy as much of a facade as his life? Having seen the '74 version and found it didn't answer my question, I feel this one gave me the answer. I liked Macquire and DiCaprio's portrayal. The acting overall was good. But the role of Daisy could not have been more erroneously cast. I do not feel the actress is nearly as beautiful as is required for the ethereal character. Horrific music really brought this down.

The only thing I noticed was that the music soundtrack may have been slightly out but this is forgivable when trying to create a contemporary version of a story.I am not a Baz fan at all. Every movie before this, for whatever reason, I did not like. They just didn't come together for me and I can't help but view Lurhmann as an uber-narcissist who's subconscious creative will is to let his ego completely displace anything an audience may require from a film.

Not so Great Gatsby,"The style is there, the 1920's costumes and period feel, and its acted well, but something seems to be missing ?The music was not great, which included some rapping ? not a 1920's music so I don't know why it was added to the music score, there was plenty of CGI in it which made it look too perfect, too much like fantasy, and the grimy sections, too grimy, and it did not flow as it should, it seemed a little stilted with too much voice over.I watched it until the end, but it went on too long, it is timed at 2hrs 22 mins but with about 15 mins of titles, not good.The original film although looking much cheaper seemed better, and that was not one of the best itself.I gave it a 6 for the style and acting.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Aesthetically beautiful film with extravagance and tragedy,"The Great Gatsby as a tragic-mystery romantic comedy. Meaning, it's a love story that ends in fatality, similar to Romeo and Juliet. The central character, Jay Gatsby is a man who seemingly had it all- his extravagant parties, an abundance of money, clothes, and cars, and extreme societal influence. He was different from other men with money. Jay didn't want to be seen, but for his new life of luxury to be presentable enough for Daisy. Daisy is a beautiful and sensual heart breaker. There's nothing she touches that doesn't get harmed. Instead of waiting for Jay, she marries the wealthiest bachelor in the world, Tom Buchanan. Nick Carraway, the most amiable character in the film is cousin's with Daisy. So, Jay enlists him as his excuse for him and Daisy to be together. It's clear as the film progresses, and due to it's fatale end, Nick was Jay's only friend. With plot alone, this film is worth a watch- and perhaps a rewatch or two. The plot flows and you're sure to be engaged throughout its entirety. Focusing more on the craft elements in the film, there truly won't be disappointed. The color palette is vibrant, but also appropriate for a film set in the late 1920s. The film presents a European flair with a modern feel to it. The soundtrack/ film score was produced by musical mavens Jay-Z and The Bullitts. The soundtrack produced sensual, and haunting sounds that moved you through the feelings of pure joy to empty despair. Additionally, the music is largely in the foreground, helping carry the story along. If you enjoy Lana Del Rey, Beyonce, Bryan Ferry, or even Jack White, you'll be sure to enjoy the flow of the film. The film provided constant and extravagant editing techniques. There was a presentation of flashbacks, subdued camera movements, and excessive cuts. As a well known novel, the film brings F. Scott Fitzgerald's words to life. You'll be on an emotional ride, but will be able to appreciate the more modern takes on social divides and customs. If you haven't seen the Great Gatsby, I sincerely recommend it! It provides a creative romantic plot, and leaves you wondering ""what next."" Additionally, the narration from Nick brings the elegance of the film to greater depth. In all, this is an aesthetically beautiful film.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
F. Scott Fitzgerald would have approved,"F. Scott Fitzgerald would have loved this film. Baz Luhrmann stays true to the spirit of the book whilst preserving his directorial integrity. In some ways it's a perfect marriage. Both are men of style and lyricism, of romance and passion.I read the book only a few days before my screening – the first time I have ever done so. I was expecting a tawdry adaptation but Luhrmann has actually made the best film of his career. I needed his imagination to fill the blanks in mine.I quickly realised, as I followed every single detail with childlike awe, that this adaptation is piously faithful to the book. Perhaps it's better described as a literal translation. Words and precise sensory details – not just scenes – are lifted from page and pasted to screen, as when Nick Carraway first sees Daisy in her East Egg mansion. The 'coloured' references are appropriately kept in, and the party scenes are faultless.The players are sensational. Carey Mulligan simply IS Daisy. Waiflike, elegant, beautiful, innocent – which man wouldn't devote his life to her? Amitabh Bachchan does much to bring Bollywood closer to Hollywood with his brief but key turn as shady 'businessman', Meyer Wolfshiem (a bold but brilliant casting decision).Joel Edgerton also perfectly embodies his role as the macho philanderer Tom Buchanan. He's never been better really. Tobey Maguire is likewise excellent as Nick Carraway, the narrator from whose perspective the story is told. To be truthful it's a thankless role because he has only to look awestruck every time he sees Gatsby. Fortunately, Maguire and DiCaprio are real life friends, so the awe does not have to be feigned.Highest praise is reserved for DiCaprio, one of the few great actors yet to receive an Oscar. His take on Gatsby wouldn't have been out of place in the time of Bogart, Cagney and Lancaster. Indeed his entrance is as memorable as the quick pan upwards to Bogie's face in Casablanca, or Welles's chair spin in Citizen Kane. When reading the book I struggled to see who could play Gatsby. Two seconds of DiCaprio's movements made it obvious.Some question if the book is indeed a classic. Whatever the merits of the book (I think there are many) I believe the story of a boy who dreams of greatness, then pursues it to validate the love of a woman, only to die vainly, pitifully, should resonate with anyone with a heart.Lana Del Ray's angelic vocals help to evoke pathos, particularly her moving track whose lyrics 'Will you still love me when I'm no longer yours' encapsulate the story beautifully. On the other hand, Jay Z's music, presumably only used because he's oddly an Executive Producer, is an awkward juxtaposition, but luckily it is too brief to be a major distraction.In some places there is a bluntness to the storytelling which undermines the power of the book. The beginning feels very rushed as the camera darts from one shot to the next. But these are mere peccadilloes in what is otherwise a glorious film, which masterfully captures the wild hedonism of that enviable era.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Great Gatsby,"De Caprio stars as Gatsby, with the story told through the words of his friend Nick, played by Tobey Maguire. It's an intriguing tale of a strange rich man whose past and how he came to be so wealthy are a mystery. Through Gatsby's liaisons with Nick we slowly learn that his life is entirely driven by his love for Daisy (Carey Mulligan) who lives across the bay with equally rich husband played by Joel Edgerton.Being a Baz Luhrman film, this has as much to do with how it is presented as much as the story and indeed it looks sensational, particularly the dazzling party when we first meet Gatsby. Oddly, as the mystery unfolds, the film story weakens and the drama of the last quarter doesn't come over as strongly as it should. De Caprio looks the part well enough, Maguire is good as the poor, simple, honest friend, but still seems the same as Peter Parker. Carey Mulligan is pretty dull as Daisy and it's left to Edgerton to impress with his performance.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Roaring 20's with Subtle Hope & Optimism,"Watched The Great Gatsby Featuring Tobey Maguire(Spider-Man 2) as Nick Caraway The Narrator/main Character whom we go on this journey with, Leonardo DiCaprio(Inception) as Jay Gatsby A Wealthy Millionaire, Joel Edgarton(Warrior) as Tom Buchanan, Elizabeth Debicki(A Few Best Men) as Jordan Baker, Isla Fisher(Hot Rod) as Myrtle Wilson , Jason Clarke(Lawless) as George Wilson and Carey Mulligan(Doctor Who) as Daisy Buchanan. The film was brilliant showcasing the Roaring 20's as it was when Liquor was cheaper during the era of probation and Gatsby's parties showed why it was roaring. The one aspect of the film i enjoyed was Nick Caraway's interpretation of the events that would unfold it gave us as an audience to help understand the mysterious Gatsby. Also Another Incredible performance By Leonardo DiCaprio as The Mysterious Jay Gatsby. it was really cool to see the Dynamic between Caraway and Gatsby how they both perceived each other and it was interesting to see how there relationship would unfold in the film and great performance by newcomer Elizabeth Debicki as Jordan Baker the scary Siren according to Nick Caraway. The film was great but it did suffer from pacing issues and not establishing certain plot points when they needed to be but Caraways Narration kept in check.

The passions of Gatsby, the narrative impulse of Nick and Daisy!The plot for those who aren't familiar - A millionaire tries to befriend certain people to get close to his love interest. How is does that and whether he manages to get close to her is just one part of the movie. The more sensitive part is the third person narration of the entire event by Nick Carraway (Tobey). That adds the flavour into the movie and asks a larger question on the legitimateness of the actions undertaken by the characters and their subsequent impact on perceptions about them.For all these projections which blend the need to make a visual effect simple yet layered, I give it a 7 on 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Such a disappointment,"I was excited to see this version of The Great Gatsby, especially after reading the mostly glowing reviews. I was expecting a film that would bring me back to that unique period in American culture.After about 45 minutes, it reminded me of Moulin Rouge, which I hated. I hadn't made the connection that both films were made by the same director. Overblown, ridiculous party scenes, no real structure nor story, basically just a mess. After realizing this and watching one party scene after another with emphasis on the fireworks, etc. I found myself,losing interest in the film. I felt the characters weren't developed and the whole structure of the film was off. I kept asking my wife if she liked the film, hoping I could use her lack of interest as an excuse to turn it off. We both eventually fell asleep not even halfway through and I hope she doesn't want to finish it. How this got such glowing reviews is beyond me. This interpretation of one of the great American novels was a disgrace and making it almost 3 hours long doesn't help either.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

Unexpected,"I just want to make it short and all I think is that the movie was totally unexpected. I knew it was a little romantic movie but it turned out not to be a little romantic but very romantic movie. I as a person is not much of a fan of romance, so it hit me quite a bit to see something unwanted and unexpected. The best part that I personally liked was the integration of all the rap music with the 20th century environment, it really worked. Through out the movie I was waiting for something interesting to happen, and I really thought that there was something more coming later, but unfortunately it didn't happen. The role of Leo was a little out of the place, he really does not suit this kind of roles. He is better off with some kind of con roles or some secret agent kind of roles. The best performance I think was given by Tobey, he really had the control over his character. Overall the movie was good but looking at all the commotion it created among the people, it wasn't worth it. so if you are a romance lover you will surely love this movie. thanks for reading",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"The film is not quite as great as its Gatsby, but it's worth a watch for its design, soundtrack and - most importantly - central performance.","Baz Luhrmann does not make movies to be understated or subtle - his best-loved films, from Romeo & Juliet to Moulin Rouge!, are deceptively colourful baubles, bright and sparkly and feather-light on the surface, cracking apart to reveal the dark, tragic side of being alive. The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1920s-set novel about the darker desires hidden within the glittering decadence of the Jazz Age, would seem to be right up Luhrmann's alley.Critical reception to the final film has been divided, however, veering between rapturous proclamations that it's the finest cinematic version of Fitzgerald's novel yet; and bitter condemnations of his miserable failure at effectively capturing the essence of the book on screen. I've not read Fitzgerald's novel, so am ill-equipped to pronounce one way or another my opinion as to whether Luhrmann has whipped up a fantastic or terrible adaptation of the book. As a purely cinematic experience, however, it's safe to say that there's much to enjoy in Luhrmann's starburst of a film - even though it's hard to shake the feeling that he's traded much depth and character for a hypnotic aesthetic and soundtrack.The tale of the titular Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio) is told by his neighbour Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire), an observer - almost a voyeur - of the huge, hedonistic parties thrown every night at the glamorous mansion up the way. Gatsby comes from 'new money': a self-made millionaire whose wealth and whims are causing ripples of curiosity throughout high society in 1920s New York. As Carraway finds himself drawn ever more into Gatsby's excesses, he discovers a secret in his friend's past that explains his behaviour in the present, one that is inextricably tied up with socialite Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan) and, by extension, her aggressive philanderer of a husband Tom (Joel Edgerton).Luhrmann's film is a treat to watch and listen to. Every frame drips with style and excess, as flappers Charleston their way across the screen and Jay-Z's jazz-influenced hip-hop beats spill over the audience. Gatsby's parties are draped in an air of smoky energy that effectively conveys the sort of lazy, frantic decadence in which the moneyed classes lost themselves before the Great Depression reared its sobering head.Scratch beneath the glittery surface, and The Great Gatsby is pulsing with themes and ideas about love, obsession and the American Dream - all of which, as I understand it, underpin Fitzgerald's novel. Much of this depth is due to DiCaprio's fascinating, subtle central performance. (It's the most subtle thing on display in Luhrmann's entire glitterball of a film.) Jay ought to be a hugely complex creation - he's not merely great or admirable for having dragged himself bodily out of poverty for the sake of a dream (or obsession) that's kept him going for years; he's also to be pitied and, occasionally, feared. Gatsby as a character also embodies the hollow promise of the American Dream - he can reinvent himself as much as he likes, but it doesn't mean he'll achieve the success, love or happiness for which he's so earnestly striving.As Gatsby, DiCaprio manages to be man, metaphor and menace all at once, a feat that again proves he's one of the finest actors of his generation. He plays all the shades of that complexity wonderfully well, swinging from desperate to unhinged to naive - oftentimes in the same scene. He makes Gatsby's tireless, misguided devotion believable and sympathetic, even in the character's more deluded moments. If your heart breaks while watching this movie, it will be for him.The rest of The Great Gatsby is hit-and-miss. When DiCaprio is off the screen, the film sags and its weighty themes seem to evaporate into thin air. Mulligan is halfway entrancing - while not quite a completely opaque presence, it's nevertheless tough to really relate to the little cracks and moments of heartbreak that Mulligan layers into her performance. Maguire, meanwhile, seems uncomfortably out-of-place - and not necessarily in a good way. His Nick Carraway has little colour and fire of his own, instead basking in the glow thrown off by Gatsby and Daisy - which is no doubt part of the point of his character. But, as Maguire plays it, that impression feels less like an organic part of his performance and more an unfortunate side-effect.Luhrmann's film sings, shines and sparkles just as brightly and earnestly as many of his earlier works. Whether all that charm, verve and brightness is deployed to good effect is more debatable. Gatsby's great tragedy is that his monumental efforts to spin a new fairy tale for himself never quite achieve the result he's clearly hoping for. The same, unfortunately, goes for DiCaprio and the movie surrounding him.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Greatest Gatsby -- Ever!,"The movie is never as good as the book. ""Remakes"" are always retrograde. Those movies with anachronistic soundtracks are more distracting than interesting for ""serious"" films. Baz Lurhmann has proved all these truisms (to which I had more or less subscribed) wrong with this film. It may be my love of the source material, or the fact that I rather like Jay-Z and Frank Church, even when they're scoring a screenplay that references the Jazz Age with every page. But the music respects the Jazz Age even if it is not particularly constrained by it, the same way Gatsby is not constrained by the social pecking order in which he was expected to live & love, even if the film-maker was not constrained by FSG-era interpretations and projections of the author's vision.As a native East Coaster I find this film nostalgic. As an ex- Californian I find it bursting with optimism and energy. As a transplant to the Midwest I sympathize with nearly *all* the characters. This is a superlative adaptation for the screen of the Great American Novel of the 20th Century. I love it, and look forward to sharing it with others so that I may enjoy it over and over again.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Great? Nope, but still good.","Glitz, glamour, greed, girls, guns; that's Gatsby alright. But is it great? Good would be closer to the mark, despite Baz Luhrmann's trademark zest and extravagance. The Aussie director throws everything including the kitchen sink at his retelling of F. Scott Fitzgerald's tale of decadence and romance; some of it sticks, some of it distracts. With help from cinematographer Simon Duggan, Luhrmann creates a glorious rose-tinted look for his hyper- real 1920's, but alas it's hampered by the excessive and often obvious CGI, which simply isn't needed. The decision to mix modern music with a period score - which has worked for Luhrmann before - is a successful gambit and injects an extra level of fun into the proceedings, especially in the first act. The film's core strength though, is Leonardo DiCaprio's engaging portrayal of the eponymous millionaire, who is initially shrouded in mystery but slowly unravels into an all-too-human protagonist driven solely by love. In support, Carey Mulligan is exceptional as the beautiful but emotionally-damaged object of Gatsby's desires and Joel Edgerton is commanding as her philandering, pig-headed husband, however Tobey Maguire fails to impress as the innocent pawn who gets sucked into their lavish lives and struggles to keep his hands clean. Lasting nearly two and a half hours, this adaptation is at times too repetitive and self-indulgent to garner Luhrmann any new admirers, yet those who are already fans of his unapologetic over-the-top style will undoubtedly find plenty to enjoy, especially on the big screen.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Gatsby was a grand Tour De Force,"It wasn't just a movie, it was an experience. All 50 of us movie goers were entrenched, immersed even in this 3D experience for 2.5 hours. Ignore the supercilious reviews and watch this cinematic masterpiece for yourself and decide. Great Gatsby WAS great! It was wistful, poignant, visually stunning, superbly executed, had amazing actors, florid detail which was mesmerizing at times, had a beautiful story line and allowed you (even if for a brief while) to get into Gatsby's head and feel what it is like to love someone so much that it's almost an obsession which rules your life. admittedly I have never read the book, however, I could definitely relate to his sheer devotion to Daisy which encapsulated half a decade of his life. Leonardo Di Caprio was the PERFECT fit for the role. I might be partial because I have loved him since BasketBall Diaries and think that he is an amazing actor. When you can convey words and emotion with your eyes THAT is when you know its good acting. There was a lot of silent cues like that in this movie which kind of tugged at your heartstrings. I really don't understand the negative reviews, it is based on a fictional book and yes there is flamboyance in some parts however that was also true of the excess of the time period.

A nearly avoided disaster.,"First off, I haven't read the book. The movie started off horribly. Very boring, melodramatic and hollow. Even the acting didn't feel up to the mark. There was a demand to emotionally connect without any basis to establish that connection. It wasn't a total nightmare thanks to the good visuals and a better than average 3-D but it was pretty dull.Something changed halfway through, everything became a notch better, the plot quickened, acting suddenly seemed not melodramatic but skillful and due to the droll first half there was now enough substance to immerse oneself into the story.On the whole its an over the top romantic drama, with a not so happy but entirely predictable ending but a strong performance by DiCaprio and Maguire.

The (not so) Great Gatsby,"Let me start by saying this film was shot so beautifully - it really is a masterpiece to the eye.I haven't read the book, and understand that it is quite a quirky story, with the great man himself being particularly odd. However, as a watcher of the movie alone, I found it a little bit out there and lacking some stronger ties in the story line to hold it together. The motivations of many of the characters were quite confusing and it felt like toward the end the story went from endearingly kooky to outright insanity - which would be fine if I could understand the characters a bit better.Overall, the best way to sum up my opinion of this movie, was that it left me unengaged throughout (you know when you think 'wow, this is a long movie' and you look at the time but it's only been 90 mins - then you can't help but keep checking the time til its over) and unsatisfied afterwards.Story over cinematography - any day!",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Yet another marvel from Decaprio,"You cannot look away from this movie. You really can't, and at the end of the movie you would want to party, party and party hard.I have been watching Leo's movies for sometime now and every movie i wonder if he could pull the rabbit out of the hat, and he never disappoints, he does. Starting from the premise the movie looks promising and never fades at any part.Characters have been chosen with precision and every artist does their best at the places where they need to. The finesse with which Leonardo carries his character and the way he expresses his love to his lady is completely breath-taking and it was quite refreshing to see romance devoid of sexual intention.Towards the end of the movie you really feel sorry for the young chap who did nothing wrong but to love. It is a enactment of a novel and thats how a novel should end. Tobey Maguire has aced himself as an actor and it clearly is evident in this movie.All in all, exhilarating performance from the team and Oscar-winning performance by Leonardo Dicaprio, has won millions of hearts sans the ever-eluding Oscar",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Flawed masterpiece,"Watch this film, but try to keep an open mind through the opening 30 mins - it paints a false impression of what this movie is going to be like. As many other reviewers have said it begins with far too much visual and auditory punch, but the real flaw is the use of modern music. At times in the first 5 mins this is cleverly done with the clear sense that the movie characters are hearing one style, while we are hearing another, but as the movie continues the distinction becomes quite blurred. This culminates in the party scene, which as a portrayal of the 20's is so far off the mark that I had to wonder if the producers were smoking something when they decided to take that slant. You are left with the feeling that Baz rejected a 20's setting and decided to set the story in a fantastical parallel universe.Get past this and the rest of the movie is sublime with a great leading performance by DiCaprio - perhaps the best I've seen from him. It perfectly captures the sentiments of Fitzgerald's classic - the dark side of the American Dream.So make time for this masterpiece, just get through that first 30 mins.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
too loud,"The movie is colorful, fun to watch, and fun to listen to. To be a really good movie, however, the actors are not satisfying enough. DiCaprio/Gatsby looks like his face is swollen after too much tanning. Daisy misses out on the big emotions, and it's hard to understand why Gatsby is so focused on her. And Maguire/Nick is ... just there, somehow. Also, as a literary adaptation, the movie has a few shortcomings. The idealism of Gatsby, catalyzed by how Nick sees him, is one of the main themes of the book. In the movie, this idealism and optimism is mentioned often enough, but it is not put into scene in a credible manner. DiCaprio/Gatsby comes across as an odd and slightly crazy guy who is at the brink of losing control, and not as someone who, day after day, year after year, lives for the love he once owned.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

I prefer the older version because it is closer to the book and shows better the vibe of the 20s.

Revives the jazz age from a fresh and bold perspective,"Baz Lurman's Great Gatsby seems a too bold move for its classic literature source: modern music, tons of special effects and computer graphic wrapped up in the magical atmosphere of the USA from the beginning of the previous century. All of this creates a very surreal world - rather a parody to the historical period the movie depicts or even an outright dystopia. This fact is likely to distress those who are acquainted with the original novel. On the other hand, it gives a fresh contemporary air to something used to be forgotten.To begin with, there appears to be no intention to follow the historical realism at all: colourful dresses and costumes and posh cars similar to the depicted jazz age are here just to hint at those times. However, these details fit into this lavish fantasy image quite well. To make it all lively, believable and emotional, there are of course talented and recognizable actors, though the main male characters - those of Leonardo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire and Joel Edgerton - leave rather stronger impressions. Whereas there seems to be no certain focus on the heroines since they appear as a necessary background for the heroes so that they could figure out whose principles are more righteous or who is more successful.In any event, even though the work is quite controversial, especially among devoted fans of the classic story, it has already managed to popularize the book source among those who haven't been familiar with it. Moreover, the film has followed its own motto and returned the entire cultural layer back from the past reviving it as a peculiar mixture of the American jazz period and modern pop-culture, thus appealing to younger audience quite successfully.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A True Friend,"The movie started with a young boy who went to New York to pursue his carrier as a stock broker. His shack was built alongside a villa owned by Mr. Gatsby. During the initial part of the movie it was portrayed that no one has seen Mr. Gatsby as his reputation is preceded as he is a ghost or he is a murder or he is sort of some kind of a spy. Later part of the movie reveals that he is poor man who by using his mind and energy at the right time and right place made him a millionaire in a very short span of time. He was a war veteran and before leaving for war he was in love with a girl named Daisy. But after the war ends he didn't reach back and his lover got married to another rich guy who happens to be a relative of Mr. Nick Carraway. Now m. Gatsby want to restart his long lost love and uses her relative who by chance lives right beside him. Mr. Nick Carraway, being a decent, loving and a respectful person by heart tried his level best to make thing moves in favor of Mr. Gatsby, by help him as he desires. The ending of the movie is quite dramatic and Mr. Gatsby was shot in the back by a person whose wife was killed by Ms. Daisy. In the end Mr. Nick Carraway tried his level best to make sure Ms. Daisy attends the funeral of Mr. Gatsby by failed miserably. Overall the movie was excellent and it really touches the heart. A good pastime for your money; the entire cast played their part pretty well.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Style Over Substance Only Goes So Far,"Like Baz Luhrmann's previous works, Romeo + Julie and Moulin Rouge!, The Great Gatsby is given a contemporary spin while attempting to maintain the the source material's roots.Right from the start, Lurhmann strays away from the text where we find our narrator, Nick Carrawaay (Tobey Maguire), a self-administered patient in a sanatorium. Carraway is seeking a psychiatrist's aid to rid himself of alcoholism and depression – neither of which is ever shown into detail throughout the film.Nick hints at his troubled past and the summer he spent in 1922 where he meets Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio), but has difficulty expressing his inner-feelings. He is told that he should write down his thoughts to better collect himself; a completely unrelenting and unnecessary bookend approach to tackle this literary titan. And thus begins the story of how we meet the Great Gatsby.What The Great Gatsby attempts to convey in this adaptation only scratches at the surface of many of the themes it tries to take away from the book. Luhrmann's main focus seems to be solely on the unrequited love that Gatsby latches on to so desperately. It's all fun and games as the film builds rapport with its audience to understand Gatsby's desires, but it takes way too long to establish any sort of interesting conflict or tension to keep my attention.Visually, this movie is a spectacle to behold. Surprisingly, the 3D is well done, given a great amount of depth, and is bright enough to see what's going on at night. With beautiful sweeping shots of New York and the incredible attention to detail with the production design, The Great Gatsby has set itself up for Oscar gold – something Luhrmann is quite familiar with. But where the grand scale visuals succeed, Luhrmann fails to create any sort of depth within the characters or build any immediacy to this tragic tale. The whole movie feels very linear and most of the time uninteresting.Don't bother giving much attention to the secondary characters such as Jordan Baker, Meyer Wolfsheim (Amitabh Bachchan), Myrtle Wilson (Isla Fisher), and George B. Wilson (Jason Clarke) because Luhrmann doesn't deem it necessary to expand their roles past the five minutes of screen time he offers for each them, no matter how important they are to the plot or how they relate to the main characters.Leonardo DiCaprio can make any character he embodies fascinating to watch, and gives it all with what is written for him. The funny thing about Gatsby though is that his lifestyle bears similar resemblance to that of Alien from Spring Breakers where he cannot help but show off his s%#t to impress the ladies. I don't think this will be Leo's chance at Oscar once again. He is way overdue though.Carey Mulligan and Joel Edgerton who plays Tom Buchanan both do a remarkable job at what they are given too, but these three characters are so bare bones it's hard to care about any of them. Edgerton fills the shoes of Tom wonderfully as the skeezy, rich snob that he is, while Mulligan works innocence and naivety like clockwork.Tobey Maguire performs well, but again it's within the writing that we cannot grasp any of the emotions or feelings toward the situations he is put in. This makes him an unreliable person to tell the story. Sometimes it is best to show rather than tell; especially when they scroll written words across the screen as if we are unable to understand the importance of what is being said by Carraway.The 142 minute run time does not help the cause either. Because nothing ever seems important, the movie feels like it goes on forever. Even the main climax of the movie is very underwhelming and I felt absolutely nothing. If you want to save yourself over two hours of your time, you can watch the final trailer for The Great Gatsby because it practically reveals the entire story in one neat little package.Aside from the decent amount of acting from three quarters of the main cast, the only other thing that earned my attention was the soundtrack. My body was unprepared as to how well I would take the jazz infused hip-hop music. At first I wasn't too fond of the sounds of Jay-Z blaring while 1920's flappers danced to the beat, but it worked and grew on me. Because everything felt so clean with the digital photography and Baz Luhrmann's style, it felt right.While The Great Gatsby has many issues trying to establish any sort of intrigue, it isn't a failure or completely boring. It could have been far worse if not for the incredible cast of actors and stunning visual flare that Luhrmann chooses to shove in our faces.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Almost an insult to Fitzgerald,"One of the most beautiful masterpieces of American literature has been unfairly mistreated here, one more time, as Hollywood and literature don't match often. Jesus Christ, whose idea was to cast Tobey Maguire for the role of Nick Carraway? I was just looking to Spiderman all the time, a funny character, childish, and sometimes plain idiotic. It only takes to read one page of the Fitzgerald's book to realize that Nick was a very serious man, almost depressed (as it was Gatsby, being both of them Fitzgerald's alter egos). This is a book about sadness, about the depression that plagued that period in American history. Fitzgerald was one of the most prominent exponents of the Lost Generation, and that's the feeling that the book conveys in a masterful way. This movie, however, looks for the most part (especially the first half of the movie) just like another fancy Hollywood movie, made with the intention to be a blockbuster and nothing else.The entrance of Gatsby was vague and plain, diminished in front of the background paraphernalia. I can even tolerate the modern electronic music, but all those computer generated scenarios with the fancy camera movements a la Disney are just ridiculous. And of course, you have the speed, the very short shots that don't allow for a meaningful grasp of the situations and the characters.There are some achievements, however, like some of the acting (I don't think De Caprio is that terrible, is just the entire thing what makes him look not convincing at times) and the girls are OK, as well as Buchanan and other minor characters. The visuals are sometimes pretty good and interesting, if you take off the Disney like stuffs. I understand that the director wanted to do something different, something ironic and postmodern, in the line of Moulin Rouge, but I think that it is just a failure to go that way with this literary masterpiece. It just falls very short, and does not make any justice to the stature of Fitzgerald.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
I came to Scoff,"I came prepared to scoff. I expected an over-the-top razzle dazzle Gatsby story after the previews I saw-in 3D yet. In fact, this was as good a filming of this classic book as has yet been done, and I believe, as good as can possible be done. There is a line in ""The Last Tycoon"" which says ""you can't film great prose"", but it is actually and literally done here.This film starts out with a tongue in cheek style. The performers are doing comic book versions of their characters, but the plot continues and the movie gets quite serious and eventually even somber. This follows the emotional tone of the novel. As course there are differences between the novel and the film, primarily with the more subtle nuances of the novel, but this is a movie and subtlety doesn't work too well in big screen 3D spectacularsBTW, Elizabeth Debicki as Jordan Baker steals every scene she is in, even when she has no lines.Go see it.

Good Movie,"Baz Luhrmann produces an amazing film with his production of the novel, ""The Great Gatsby."" From the vibrant sets, the platonic chemistry of the characters, and a soundtrack to fit the scene, Luhrmann nails this one right on the head. This film redefines the possibilities of the ""classic novel movie.""This film is about the irresistible love story of Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan). The once lovers are reunited and that is where the real story begins. Gatsby's neighbor, Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire), just so happens to be Daisy's cousin and that is Gatsby's connection back to her. But the biggest obstacle of all throughout the movie? Daisy is not a single woman, she is married to the wealthy and powerful Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton). This film portrays the story of Gatsby and Daisy and how it their love was destructive to everyone involved.One epic scene was the extravagant party scene thrown by Gatsby at his palace of a home. Thousands of extras and thousands of costumes were sewn just for this one scene. Not to mention, Luhrmann won two Academy Awards in costume design and production design. The chaotic feeling of it all makes you feel as if you are part of the party. With all the dancing, streamers, add fireworks, you are left in awe from Luhrmann's amazing visuals, which sets a spectacular precedent for the rest of the film.Leonardo DiCaprio's performance as Jay Gatsby is absolutely captivating. DiCaprio can pull off the mixture of pathetic vulnerability and confident charisma that is known as the Gatsby character. With urgency in his voice and an ever-so charming smirk, DiCaprio steals your heart in this film. He commands the audience with every presence and keeps you on edge of your seat with his dazzling performance.Carey Mulligan could not have been a better fit for the role of Daisy Buchanan. She floats throughout the film with this type of innocence that leaves you questioning how innocent she really is. Mulligan takes on the sad-eyed role of the narcissistic Daisy, and plays it perfectly. Every scene she appears in, Mulligan light voice leaves you wanting more. She is more than any Dais Buchanan, she is the Daisy that F. Scott Fitzgerald would have wanted to play the role. Mulligan plays his role to a tee.Tobey Maguire's on screen performance as Nick Carraway was also utterly inspiring. The way he is pulled into Gatsby's world and then back to his own leaves you asking yourself if anyone else could have pulled off a better performance. The answer to that is no, Maguire's performance was one of a kind. His facial expressions help describe more than any other actor's words could. Overall, Maguire makes you feel the emotion of the truly devastating tale.The soundtrack of the film is the cherry on top. The anachronistic soundtrack will leave you hypnotized with amazement. Jay-Z, the producer of the soundtrack, pulls together the hectic-ness of the party scenes with jazz with a beat along with the having the lustfully beautiful Lana Del Rey and Beyonce to depict the romantic urgency between Gatsby and Daisy. The music is a mix between yesterday's Jazz and the modern world of pop; and it most definitely works. The contemporary approach was a huge hit.Baz Luhrmann pulls through with this one, making this novel into an epic love story. It is a terrific adaption that succeeds as a great film. In this jazz-inspired film, you will get a glimpse of the frenzied life in the 1920's. Between the Grammy-nominated soundtrack produced by Jay-Z, a cast that captures your attention on-screen, and a director that makes you feel a part of the extravagant party scenes, you will fall hopelessly in love with the story of Jay Gatsby's and Daisy Buchanan's love story. Baz Luhrmann treats this novel with a modern playfulness and his approach definitely works.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Spoiler-Free Review,"You know, I've never been the biggest fan of both F. Scott Fitzgerald and director Baz Luhrman, so when Luhrman announced he was adapting Fitzgerald's classic, The Great Gatsby for the big-screen, I had very low expectations, and in those regards I was surprised by the film, but it still does not make me a fan of Luhrman or Fitzgerald. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio as the titular Gatsby, and he's charming and does his usual Leonardo DiCaprio thing here, but it's a fairly safe performance by an actor who is capable of far more reaching material, however, part of the reasoning for that is that this film never really takes flight. This is an emotionally cold story, and it's hard to relate to rich people lavishing in their own extravagance when very few people are actually that wealthy. Not to mention the fact that all of the melodrama comes across as trite and soap opera-like in our more modern time where we've seen just about every genre cliché this films features hundreds of times before. Even still, this is a visually sumptuous film that is vibrant and energetic in its style, with some solid performances from the cast. It's just one of those films that if you aren't already a fan of the book or the director's previous works, you will find very little to latch onto here and enjoy.I give The Great Gatsby a 6 out of 10!",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Master Piece In All Aspects,"The Great Gatsby is a mind-blowing movie with all its glamour, its visual effects, and some great soundtracks. What I liked about the Great Gatsby is the fact that the whole movie has been narrated out as though one were reading the book. The narrator uses such vivid descriptions to describe something as trivial as a sunrise. It is as though someone were reading the book but the magic here is that the vivid narration is coupled with the most extraordinary visual affects thereby beautifully creating a master piece that can be appreciated by all.The movie is set in the 1920's in New York. This adds to the whole beauty of the movie. New York has been very well portrayed. The direction of this movie deserve an A+, there is so much to be portrayed so much to show and the director does it all without you realizing that he has shown you almost each and every aspect of that time (1920).This movie has a very touching theme of Romance, a must see for all romantics. If not for the Romance and drama leonardo Dicaprio's acting as Gatsby should be able to compel people to watch this movie. He has very well portrayed the character of a rich man living lavishly with all the comforts anyone could dream of but at the same time of a modest and charming man.Over all this is how I would rate the movie:Theme- 8/10 (though a clichéd theme-romance, its not just any ordinary romantic movie) Direction-9/10 Visual effects-9/10 Soundtracks-8/10 Acting-9/10 The End of the movie-9/10(to me the end of a movie has a big impact on the impression it makes on me)Over all- 8.7/10 ☺ Have a good day!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
We've seen greater Gatsby's,"First of all I think Luhrman did a good job until the end of the movie. However I do agree that this story is worn out. We've seen greater Gatsby's, we've seen greater love stories, I don't think the book it's relevance that it had back when its written. So to expect more from a production is, if I've to quote the movie, 'asking too much'.My only criticisms are the ending and CGI's of the movie. CGI'S are too obvious that they are not real, we don't believe them to be real for a second. As far as the ending, Luhrman should've think a better way to end the movie, it seemed like he just gave up. That maybe the biggest reason that this movie gets this many negative feedback.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Baz Luhrmann takes a tragically beautiful novel and adds visual drama. The result is delightful.,"Two years ago, I heard that Leonardo DiCaprio would be cast as Jay Gatsby in Fitzgerald's 'The Great Gatsby', I rushed to the nearest bookstore and obsessively pored over the book several times. As a die hard fan of F. Scott Fitzgerald, DiCaprio and Baz Luhrmann, you cannot imagine my excitement at the prospect of these three beautiful fellas coming together. However, I had my doubts. Fitzgerald's signature brooding style, which centered around the tragic hero, was in essence straightforward and without frills. This is what makes his work so special, so different from the dramatic 'Shakespearean' retelling of tragedy, which, to me, brings to mind Luhrmann's love for drama, both visual and in terms of storytelling. It was my hope that my dearest DiCaprio would be able to bring together both these sentiments. Early in 2013, when I watched the trailer, I have to say I was enormously disappointed. The Great Gatsby in 3-d!!! (I think I might have wept right after.) It just seemed to be so at odds with the original book. It seemed to have none of the ingenious subtlety of performance that I had come to expect, nor did I feel any of the authors' quiet desperation. Instead I was bombarded by kaleidoscopic, golden, flying images of revelry, their version of the roaring 20's. I immediately decided that watching this movie would only put me off, and so i didn't, until recently. I must admit that the horrible misleading trailer is my only major critique of the film. I was not disappointed, far from it. The film opens with Nick Carraway (Maguire) a young New Yorker narrating the traumatic events that have lead him to this juncture. Through his narration we are led through the wildly exciting streets of 1920's New York. The lavish lifestyles of the young and rich, the unimaginable extravagance and the futility of the prohibition. Arriving in the city to further his writing, he is swept away by the roaring lifestyle, and the booze fueled revelry, and here we are introduced to the mysterious Mr. Gatsby, an amazingly rich gentleman, who has very recently achieved notoriety in New York society as an affluent businessman, famous for his extreme extravagance. Nobody seems to know who he is or where he is from, consequently several conspiracies emerge. As the story unfolds we truly appreciate Luhrmann's cinematic skill. The lavish sets and incredible color palette compliment the silent drama of the actual storytelling, which remains appropriately understated. In this sense he deserves praise for staying true to the book, and yet managing to infuse the experience with his own signature style. DiCaprio is completely instrumental in bringing this production together and does a breathtaking job of portraying the love-stuck, desperately ambitious Jay Gatsby. He is full of silent hope and conviction, but at the same time is riddled with insecurities. Carey Mulligan plays the role of Daisy Buchanan beautifully. Her approach to the role is not what i would have expected, but is refreshingly unique. We love to hate Joel Edgerton as Tom Buchanan, and he delivers another great performance. Isla Fischer is unexpectedly great in a challenging role, she has it down to a tee. To me, the only weak performance was Tobey Maguire. Although he plays the role of the Daisy's meek cousin, he is not as convincing as i would have liked. Although, I will say, he wins points for playing the part of the narrator beautifully. Luhrmann has once again done a wonderful job on the cinematography, although making it a 3-d movie was completely unwanted, and was too over-the-top. Watching the movie brought back fond memories of Moulin Rouge. Although they were each very different in terms themes and story lines, they both won me over with outrageously wonderful sets, which added to the urgency in the plot, and the heart breaking, beautifully captured romance. All in all, I would highly recommend a watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Tempts me to give the book another chance,"I put off watching this movie for a long time. The flashy yet dull Moulin Rouge toned down my early enthusiasm for Baz Luhrmann, and the descriptions I heard from friends suggested this might be more substanceless flash. Many of my friends are also 1920s aficionados who complained about the music.But when I finally watched the movie, I really, really liked it.The movie is quite flashy, especially in the early parts, but it's not substanceless flash. Gatsby is in large part about ostentatious, unthinking wealth, and the flashy camera-work and frenetic cutting and R&B soundtrack all emphasize that this isn't a period piece about attitudes of the 20s but rather is about wealth and the desire for wealth that permeates our culture. The flashiness is also very well done, and the film is often visually stunning, whether it's showing a crazy party, a gorgeous vista, or a gritty slum.The movie is also notable for its low-key but insistent underscoring of racism. Black people are continually seen in the background as servants and entertainers while the white folks' dramas play out. It's nice to see a movie about rich people that offers that sort of context.The casting is interesting, in that I felt unsure about a lot of it at first but warmed up to pretty much everyone. None of this was based on the book, which I barely recall, but simply on my impression of what each character should be.The one character who seemed perfect from the beginning was Joel Edgerton as Tom Buchanan. He felt exactly right for the part. Tobey Macguire seemed odd and out of keeping with his world, but I eventually thought that was appropriate. Carey Mulligan seemed a bit less likable than I would have expected, but it made perfect sense as the movie progressed. The casting only felt odd at first because I didn't really know who these people were or understand the complexity of the story.Leonardo DiCaprio is the perfect example of someone who seemed slightly off in a way that turned out to be perfect. There was an odd mix of charm and falseness to him when he first appeared, but it turns out that's pretty much exactly what the part needs. And DiCaprio does a wonderful job of showing you what's going on under the facade, most notably in the lead-up to tea at Nick's, where he is funny and vulnerable.I read The Great Gatsby a million years ago - I was probably in high school - and I was really underwhelmed, unable to see why it was considered a classic. But the movie, which pulls a lot of great lines from the book, makes me think I should really re-read it. And I think any movie that makes viewers curious about the book is worthwhile.The one thing I didn't care for at all was the framing scenes involving a psychiatrist and the writing of a book, which for me felt extraneous and slightly distracting.I wasn't expecting to like this movie.

A Vivid Re-Imagined Film Full of Life and Mystery!,"The party only really ends when the woman of your dreams becomes your reality. ""The Great Gatsby"" centers on the mysterious Jay Gatsby, a wealthy and illustrious man who throws extravagant parties and who has a sort of mystique set to his name - nobody really knowing his past nor where his fame and wealth truly came from. It is the mysterious past of Jay Gatsby that drives the film forward and what keeps the audience in dazed wonderment as the story unfolds.In Fitzgerald's own words from the novel, ""So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."" The film ""The Great Gatsby"" has been one of many representations of the novel, each one having different feels and imagery, but in my humble opinion this has been the best. The depiction of society gave me the impression of an exciting lifestyle marked by a rapidly growing market and degradation through cheap alcohol. Society, at the time, couldn't have seemed more alive and booming. It is through this period that the story of the great Gatsby is revealed.The novel, The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, was written in the year 1925 and soon became a legacy, an inspiration, a novel of great value. It centers on idealism, resistance to change, change being an enemy unto mankind, as well as the American dream that ""we can have it all."" It paints a vivid picture of the 'roaring 20s' and the beautiful jazz age in the great Big Apple. This picturesque period is the subject of many novels and films, having no shortage of unique stories and myths.Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire, Joel Edgerton, and the beautiful Carey Mulligan, ""The Great Gatsby"" is a colorful and intriguing take on the novel. The film was directed by Baz Luhrmann (Moulin Rouge, Australia), who is well known for his use of bright colors and fast-paced editing. He created a visual symphony to represent this thrilling story of love and riches, but, unfortunately, Luhrmann's distinctive taste has made the film subject to some negative reviews as well as low numbers in theaters.But can I say the same as those film critics who claim that the film is too flashy or too contemporary for a fictional story based in the 1920s? No. To me, the story was told as it should have been told to audiences of today. The actors generated personalities similar to that which is found in the novel, the story was gripping and told by the character named Nick Carraway as it is also done in the novel, and the imagery and symbolism was portrayed just as it was to be imagined. A novel of such caliber deserves to be visually told excitedly and thoroughly and should not suffer from lack of imagination.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good film with inappropriate music,"I enjoyed the film except for the horrible music. Rap/Hip Hop music had no business being in a 20s story. It was distracting, horrible, and was plain wrong for the film. With all the jazz greats who were performing during the time period of the story.This was an opportunity to select from and highlight the music of the time. It is really unfortunate and just about ruined the movie for me. The director, producers, and those responsible for the music should be ashamed of themselves.I would have given the film a score of 9 or 10 if the proper music had been used.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
An excellent rendition of an amazing story.,"I'm unfamiliar with the great Gatsby but from what I am seeing in others reviews, Is a biased and an unfair view point, people are approaching this with a closed mindset and comparing it to the past renditions of this compelling story. This movie isn't trying to be anything else and I am frankly disappointed in people's reviews.I thought the soundtrack was interesting and enjoyable, it offered an interesting connection between past and present music culture.The cinematography was excellent and I found myself picking out some of my favourite shots and scenes.The casting was exceptional.And the story was gripping and extraordinarily unique I can only applaud Scott Fitzgerald on this masterpiece of writing.It's safe to say this amazing movie will not be leaving my top five for quite some time.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Such a disappointment, still enjoyed it, but talk about swing and miss from the Director Lur","When this movie came out I was beyond excited to see it. This is one of my all time favorite modern American classical stories. With that being said, from the very beginning I could tell the director had botched it. He chose to do a modern spin on the story instead of keeping it authentic. I read that, Director Baz Lurhmann decided to choose modern music for the movie because he wanted the audience to get a feeling of what Gatby's parties would be like nowadays. Huge mistake, in my opinion. It came of cheesy and a bit of a sell out to younger audiences. Also, gives us, the audience, zero credit and must think we have no imagination. Instead, the movie screams anachronisms. Gatsby's party was also a little over the top, and again, cheesy. Could have been great, but the director fell short unfortunately. Hopefully one day someone does the story justice.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Travesty Beyond Description,"DiCaprio? Really? This entire film is an abomination and a blasphemous corruption of one of the greatest works of American literature. Putting an actor like DiCaprio in it just adds insult to injury. There is barely any connection between this rock video style film and F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel. The movie is trash and shouldn't share the title of that masterpiece. Of course, does anyone read anymore or do they rely upon no- talent actors and sensationalist directors to interpret literature so they may spare those precious hours required to actually enjoy a book for video games, cell phones, and reality television? One thing is certain. Fitzgerald isn't rolling over in his grave in response to this garbage. He's nodding knowingly.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Complete Failure !!!,"What can I say about a version of Gatsby that has rap music? There is literally nothing to recommend the latest version of Fitzgerald's novel. With the exception of Toby McGuire, who does a passable Nick Carraway, the acting is uniformly poor. The 1974 version is far superior. Perfectly cast, beautifully directed by Jack Clayton, and with great period music, that version beautifully captures the tragedy of Gatsby. The closing scenes with Gatsby's father are especially moving and heart wrenching. As with so many of today's movies, the digital tricks and the over-the-top production values overwhelm the film. The new version of Gatsby is a shallow mess that is an insult to the book !!",,Anonymous,Romance
The Vidiot Reviews,"The Great GatsbyThe hardest part of returning from war is not being allowed to shoot whomever you wish, and call it Friendly Fire.The vet in this drama, however, finds it even harder adjusting to his love life.Nick (Tobey Maguire) is a salesman with authorship aspirations who retreats to a Long Island cottage to write.Adjacent to him is the enigmatic Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio), a self-made millionaire who hosts opulent parties.On the old money side of the lake resides Nick's cousin Daisy (Carey Mulligan).Eventually, Gatsby confides in Nick his covetousness towards Daisy, and how her husband (Joel Edgerton) cannot keep them apart.Based on F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel of 1920s overindulgence, director Baz Luhrmann emphasizes the intemperance with unique cinematography, but at the expense of the story's impact.Incidentally, GI's returning from war in the roarin' twenties could always use their army bugles to become jazz musicians.Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Probably my FAVOURITE film from Luhrman,"With director Baz Luhrmann comes a great deal of flamboyance and embellishment, something I usually dislike with his work, but with The Great Gatsby not only does he have a requirement to mellow out, it actually benefits from his gaudy cinematography.Unlike the 1974 version, the film is from Nick Carraway (Toby Maguire)'s perspective after the book's events as he speaks to a psychiatrist after his experiences. This feels inconsistent with the book as there was no real suggestion Carraway was so badly traumatised, and feels like an excuse to differentiate from the previous film. Like it or hate it, this does lift Carraway out of the rut of audience surrogate; I did feel as though I were watching a character and not a story device.Admittedly all of the characters in Luhrmann's version feel more lively than in the Clayton film. Coupled with the cinematography the actors burst and beam with all the encouragement and shallowness that the book suggested. While Carey Mulligan's Daisy doesn't have the same clingy ignorance that Mia Farrow gave the character, the portrayal of both her husband Tom and Gatsby himself feel more genuine. A lot of the conflict is between these two characters, and Joel Edgerton and Leonardo DiCaprio carry this off with great ferocity! A lot of time is given to Gatsby and his mystery. This is an improvement on the original film as we see a lot more of the gossip and chatter about him before we meet him (his reveal is also exact to the novel this time, very well underplayed) and there a lot more to understand about his recluse nature and about his need to put Daisy on the proverbial plinth and how shallow and misguided he really is. But, with all the time dedicated to this, some elements are missed out. Possibly the worst scene missing is Gatsby's discovery that Tom and Daisy were with child. Its omission (until an offhanded reference later) makes Gatsby seem more forgivable in his actions overall. This and the relationship between Tom and Wilson is lacking; indeed Wilson and Myrtle are pushed to one side, as secondary as they are, they are still critical to the conclusion to the main characters! Jay Gatsby ultimately comes out of this film lighter still than the 1974 film, despite Luhrmann's excellent attempt at showing every character's weakness.Lurhmann's desire to have popular music mixed through the scores of his films feels even more out of place here. This is the 1920s, Baz, they didn't have beat boxing and rap or modern songs. It isn't overriding by any stretch, in fact for Luhrmann it is positively made as undertones, but simply removing it would have improved my immersion greatly! I can partly forgive this though, as Luhrmann's cinematography and lavish colour palette does give the story so much life and creativity to the proceedings.I was impressed by the portrayal of the characters in this interpretation; they all have their moments to shine and to be dragged through the gutter, despite a couple of strange oversights. If you can see past Luhrmann's excess, you should find something here that even the 1974 version didn't cover.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
I wanted to get up and slap Baz Luhrmann on the back.,"For giving us an almost perfect adaptation of The Great Gatsby while being a very fine film on its own, and yet people still complain and the critics keep being too hard on him.For those who say Luhrmann's Gatsby is ""style over substance"", did we even watch the same movie? Luhrmann certainly has matured since his Romeo+Juliet days. This is something else. Somehow the music works really well. I have never seen music being used this effectively in a movie before, it really sets the mood and it actually helps the storytelling. I'm ready to call Baz a genius for the choice of music alone. The camera work is stunning. The visual is, no question, beautiful and breathtaking and everything. But most importantly, the script is neat. The pacing is tight. I personally love the decision to put Nick in a sanitarium and make him tell the story from there. You see, it's not easy to translate the book The Great Gatsby into a movie. Just look at how disappointing the previous attempts had been. When it's trying to be faithful following the structure of the book, it came out dull and boring (the 1974 version and the 2000 TV movie version belong to this category). And when it succeeded to be somewhat entertaining, it had to transform itself into a gangster film and basically alter almost everything that's in the book (the 1949 version).I saw The Great Gatsby because I was anticipating Tobey Maguire's big come back to the big screen (beside the fact that I love the book) but ended up giving all the credit to Baz Luhrmann. You must know, I can't stand any Luhrmann's work before. So when the light was dimmed and the Warner Bros logo appeared on screen I fully realized I was in for something different. This time, though, it is different in a very good way. It is one of those rare movies that have the charm and grandness that you have never found in any other movies and which it is not likely you will ever find again. Kinda like Gatsby himself.Well done, Baz.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Give Fitzgerald a break and try not to think of him when you watch this,"This movie is DOA, a victim of the colossal misjudgment of whoever thought The Great Gatsby would be a suitable vehicle for 3-D special effects and tried to turn it into a showcase for them. At best they add nothing to this subtle and complex classic and at worst they distract the viewer from the novelist's intent, masking every other theme of the novel behind a garish attempt to overwhelm the viewer with with a stylized vision of the roaring twenties. The actors struggling to compete with this distraction and bring Fitzgerald's characters and themes to life are at a serious disadvantage before they even appear, and Leonardo DiCaprio simply isn't up to the task. His seems to be alternately trying to channel Robert Redford and Marlon Brando, the former being an improvement and the later a particularly inappropriate source of confusion about the character. Gatsby is supposed to be an enigma, but this is ridiculous. And when those resources seem unable to sustain him, he drifts off into something more reminiscent of Orson Wells, an impersonation that is way out beyond his ability, though in harmony with his bloated and dissipated appearance. The silly device of scattering bits of text into the snow or rain and then assembling them to float in front in front of the screen is no competition for Sam Waters sensitive reading of the same texts. The interjection of a psychoanalytical frame story to explicate Nick's character would be totally unnecessary if a more suitable and capable actor than Tobey Maguire had been cast. I went home and watched the 1974 version, which I had underestimated. In contrast Sam Waters, Robert Redford and Karen Black were nothing less than brilliant. Poor Fitzgerald. What a disservice. But the novel is pretty much indestructible and will live to fight another day, even if it lost this battle.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Great Flop 6/10,"""The Great Gatsby"" is a good movie based on the novel by the same name. Maybe the book was a big success but bringing the story to the big screen is a challenge. Most movies that are based on a book face criticism for not being as good as the book. ""The Great Gatsby"" is not special in these cases. The story follows a successful and young man named Jay Gatsby who is determined to retrieve his love interest back to his life after not seeing her for 5 years. The whole story is told by the point of view of Nick Carraway, a man who fortunately finds himself in the middle of the conflict. The costume design and production design are what attracts the viewers the most while watching the film, it is incredibly impressive. So as the acting: Leo DiCaprio and Tobby Maguire are great and fun actors. Although where I feel this movie fails is within the dialogue and the runtime of the film. I easily could have lose interest within 20 minutes if I hadn't forced myself to watch till the very end. The soundtrack was quite an interesting choice for the movie: the plot happens in the 20's while most of the soundtrack is modern rap and hip hop, Kanye west and Jay Z just to give example. Overall I don't think this was a necessary movie to make based on a book, you have to ask yourself who in the world asked for an adaptation of the novel ""The Great Gatsby"" might as well keep him dead.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
'GATSBY' good but not great!,"'THE GREAT GATSBY': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Director Baz Luhrmann's lavish adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic 1925 novel about a bond salesman who finds himself captivated by the life of his millionaire neighbor during the 'Roaring Twenties'. Leonardo DiCaprio (who also starred in Luhrmann's 'ROMEO + JULIET') and Tobey Maguire star in the film and it's their first time appearing in a movie together since 2001's 'DON'S PLUM' (despite being longtime friends since childhood). Carey Mulligan also stars in the movie as the millionaire's love interest, caught in a love triangle with another millionaire (played by Joel Edgerton). The film is a visually breathtaking epic period piece (like all of Luhrmann's films). It's also a tragedy (like most of Luhrmann's films as well). I enjoyed almost every aspect of the film except it's conclusion (having never read the book or known the story), which is just too dark and depressing for me.Maguire plays Nick Carraway, an alcoholic (as the film opens) telling a man in a sanatorium his story about his times with a millionaire named Jay Gatsby (DiCaprio). Nick met Gatsby when he moved into a house next door to his mansion in New York in 1922. A Yale University graduate and World War 1 veteran, Nick was moving from the Midwest to New York to take a job as a bond salesman. He met the mysterious millionaire when he was invited to one of his huge parties, despite the fact that no one else was ever invited to his parties (they would just show up) and no one seemed to know what Gatsby really looked like. Nick soon discovered that the millionaire wanted to get to know him so he could arrange a meeting with his cousin, Daisy Buchanan (Mulligan), who Gatsby had a romantic affair with five years earlier. Daisy was (at the time, in 1922) married to another millionaire though, Tom (Edgerton), who was an old college buddy of Nick's. This of course caused lots of complications as Gatsby wanted to steal Daisy away from Tom, who she had fallen out of love with anyway due to his constant cheating ways.I'm a huge Baz Luhrmann fan. I've enjoyed all of his films, especially 'MOULIN ROUGE!' (which is my all time favorite musical and one of my all time favorite films). That's a tragedy, like almost all of Luhrmann's movies, but it's still a beautifully moving story that's end feels justified. Like I said I haven't read the source material for 'GATSBY' (so I don't know how well the story played out in the book) but here I was disappointed with the overall feel of the film (by it's conclusion). I loved all of the performances (especially DiCaprio, who's amazing in it), the look of the film, the music and the first two acts. I really did like the story of this mentally ill millionaire who built his fortune from nothing and is now willing to throw almost everything away for his love (and obsession) with this untrustworthy girl. Like I said I just didn't like it's conclusion. Luhrmann did write the screenplay (with his usual partner in crime Craig Pearce) so he's to blame for it's shortcomings as much as it's success. It is a visual masterpiece that's a good film but not a great one.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOSZyJXrwyw",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

The 20s and rap music,"Just recently, I had read F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic novel ""The Great Gatsby"" in preparation for Baz Luhrmann's new film that bears the same name. ""The Great Gatsby"" stars Tobey Maguire as Nick Carraway, an aspiring writer and war veteran who is struggling to make a profit after entering the bonds business. He moves into a small cottage on Long Island, where just over on the other side of the bay lives his cousin Daisy Buchanan, played by Carey Mulligan and her snobbish husband Tom, played by Joel Edgerton. Next to his humble cottage stands a massive palace owned by a wealthy businessman shrouded in mystery named Jay Gatsby. New York inhabitants flock to his home every weekend where he holds grand parties. In this case invitations are not necessary, though Nick seems to be the only one invited. Upon his arrival, Nick is bedazzled by the shear scale of the party. He bumps into a woman named Jordan Baker, a famous sportswoman who he had met earlier whilst visiting his cousin's house. They decide to search for the party's host, Mr. Gatsby. Purely by accident, Nick seems to come face to face with the man himself. As the story progresses we discover more about Gatsby and his somewhat unusual past.The film has been constantly advertised as a thrilling and energetic adaptation of the novel, but after seeing it i'm not sure that's a good thing. Where the novel was subtle and elegant, the film is outlandish and at times even a bit obnoxious. As with such films as ""Moulin Rouge"" and ""Romeo + Juliet"", Luhrmann seems to focus more on the style of the film and undermines the story. Though, I can't deny that the film looks beautiful, even if the style feels overbearing. People have criticized the use of modern day music, I personally thought this was a bold choice that played out very well on screen. The music helped set the scene for the parties and added a certain charm to the classic setting. Surprisingly, the 3D was unusually well done. I'm really not a fan of this so whenever I go see a 3D movie it tends to feel like a chore. In this case it really helped to immerse me in the story, as well as create beautiful visuals. On an acting level everyone delivered solid performances. Leonardo DiCaprio, Carey Mulligan, Tobey Maguire and Joel Edgerton were all fine. The supporting actors were also just as good. Isla Fisher and Elisabeth Debicki did a great job at showing the contrast between different types of people in the society of the late 20′s. Whilst Fisher's character was vulgar and provocative Debicki's was sleek and classy.In hindsight, Luhrmann's adaptation of Fitzgerald's classic novel can be obnoxious due to the overbearing style of the film, but it also provides the viewer with beautiful visuals, well acted performances and a well paced story. It establishes itself as a faithful and energetic imagining of the book. It certainly is not as great as it has been advertised to be, but it still is pretty good.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good film,"Good film. Visually the movie is impressive. The costumes, sets and special effects are dazzling, and since the soundtrack is modernized it was a smart move by Luhrmann and production/costume designer Catherine Martin to keep the rest of the film period-accurate. The 3D-effects however are pretty but forgettable and add nothing to the movie. Just like everybody else I was skeptical when I heard that Luhrmann had hired Jay-Z to helm the soundtrack and meant to include hip-hop and rap music. My suspicions turned out to be completely unnecessary. The modern music works very well (especially during the party scenes) and doesn't even include many hip-hop tracks. Variations of Lana del Rey's ""Young and Beautiful"" is used as a ""love theme"" for Gatsby and Daisy and I wouldn't be surprised if the stunning track get an Oscar nomination for ""Best Original Song"". The soundtrack is actually one of the main reasons that the movie feels current and inspiring in contrast to the at times dated novel.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

We are slowly dragging in to those era with loneliness, desperation and sometimes with a depressive feeling.The emphasis given by those soundtrack are fantastic.

"Some Great, Some Awful","This movie...I wanted to like it. Honest. There is much that is good, such as the costumes and attention to visual detail in background props. Also, it's fair to say performances are solid. No award winners here, but the actors didn't cause any issues. Music, however... I'm sorry. It sucked. The music was 80% modern rap and hip-hop, with 20% period instrumentation and style. Hip-hop sung as 20's jazz is still hip-hop. And it does NOT belong in a period piece. So not only did I hate the music now, but in just a few short years, this movie will have no relevance because the music will sound like it came from the 'teens. People watching this for the first time in 2022 (only 8 years from today) will feel how 2012-ish this music is. If you're doing a period piece, then use period music! Perhaps you have the Hot Young Stars of Today perform the music, but if you have a period piece, use period music! Please! Also, there were a series of car driving and car chase scenes that helped to blow the movie for me. The image doesn't sync up with the conversation at ALL. And in every driving scene the cars seem to be driving 100 mph (that's 161 kph for my friends in the rest of the world). The car scenes were so unrealistic, I would rather they didn't even show them at all. A block of text saying ""car driving"" and the dialogue voiced over would have been a great improvement.

I give it a C+,"I saw ""The Great Gatsby"" last Friday night (May 17, 2013). While I enjoyed the storyline (I have not read the book), and the characterizations by the actors, I was hugely disappointed in the musical selections for the film. Hip-hop and rap music did not exist in the 1920's, and were jarringly inaccurate in this film. It spoiled, for me, what could have been an extraordinary film.Also, I felt that some of the transition scenes, jumping back and forth across the bay through the green dock light, for instance, were unnecessary. While I understand the significance of the light, I felt it was smacking me in the face. The party scenes in particular were also jarring. I get that it was a wild time, but coupled with non-period music just made it all seem out of place.I'm sorry, I can only give this movie a C+.

The OK Gatsby,"If you've never read the novel, you'll have a much better chance of liking this film. That's because the film basically focuses on the Gatsby-Daisy love affair and avoids going too deeply into any philosophical/psychological areas that the novel tries to bring to light. Yes, it is a lavish production that would continue to be so even if the 3D glasses were eliminated, which they should have been. Before seeing the film, I had doubts about the sound track which included compositions by Jay Z. Oddly enough, the sound track worked and was not distracting. However, I wonder why director, Baz Luhrmann, decided to add modern music to a film obsessed with recreating the atmosphere of the 1920s. Perhaps financial reasons were behind it, or maybe he just wanted to lure in the younger audience.The acting was good enough. DiCaprio played a kind of Gatsby but failed to bring out that sense of melancholy and longing that you find in most Fitzgerald characters. His Gatsby was interesting if lacking in depth. I had trouble with Carey Mulligan as Daisy. She was a little too ""girl next doorish"" to make us believe that she was Gatsby's obsession. She simply lacked the psychotic proclivities that the novel's Daisy possesses and which underpin the somewhat confusing psychological attraction between the two main characters. Nick (Tobey Maguire) was more simple-minded than in the novel.But the people I saw the movie with, and who were not familiar with the novel, thought the movie was quite good. I can see their point and almost wish I hadn't read the novel a number of times. So I would recommend this movie for those not familiar with the novel and would warn those who know the novel about coming away from it with a sense of being unfulfilled.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Not my cup of tea,"I think this movie will suit anyone who loved Moulin Rouge. Unfortunately I didn't and this movie suffered from the same drawbacks for me. It was too garish, loud and modern in it's soundtrack. I love the era of the 1920s and love the music as well, so I would have preferred some suitable music. Baz Luhrmann's flair is well known and he is very talented. The cast are very good and the story (as far as I know) was shown well. But it didn't suit me and so I can't rate it highly. I love Carey Mulligan and Tobey Maguire, and I liked most of the other cast members. Leonardo DiCaprio is now an established mature actor and having recently seen The Aviator, his Gatsby reminded me of Howard Hughes in terms of his excesses (although not in his paranoia). Just a cautionary note that the visuals are very hectic and this is not your typical costume drama, but the anyone who know Luhrmann's style should know that.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

The movie's lavish set design, colorful costumes, and attention to detail transport the viewer to the Roaring Twenties, an era of decadence and excess.However, at times, the film feels forced, as if Luhrmann is trying too hard to capture the essence of the era. The soundtrack, which features contemporary artists such as Jay-Z and Lana Del Rey, seems out of place, and the constant barrage of CGI effects can be overwhelming.Nevertheless, the film's themes of love, wealth, and the American Dream are still relevant today, and DiCaprio's performance as Gatsby is nuanced and compelling. The movie's supporting cast, including Carey Mulligan as Daisy Buchanan and Tobey Maguire as narrator Nick Carraway, also deliver strong performances.Overall, The Great Gatsby is a mixed bag. While the film's visuals and performances are impressive, the movie's occasional lack of subtlety and tonal inconsistencies prevent it from being a truly great adaptation of the novel.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
More than amazing movie,"The Great Gatsby (2013) is a visually stunning and engaging adaptation that earns an 8/10 for its vibrant execution and strong performances. Leonardo DiCaprio shines as Jay Gatsby, bringing charisma and depth to the enigmatic character, while Carey Mulligan delivers a compelling portrayal of Daisy Buchanan. The cinematography is dazzling, with Baz Luhrmann's signature style creating a lavish and immersive depiction of the Roaring Twenties. The story, though faithful to F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel, occasionally feels overshadowed by its opulent presentation. The soundtrack, featuring contemporary hits, adds an energetic and modern touch to the film's atmosphere. Overall, it's a great film with memorable visuals and performances, though it could have explored the narrative with more subtlety.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Great cinematography, quaint drama","The Great Gatsby is a feast for the eyes in its vivid and loving recreation of the 1920s New York bubble society. Unfortunately, the retelling of the Gatsby story did not work nearly as well as the cinematography if for no other reason than the central theme which drove the novel seems curiously out of date in contemporary America. Surely no present day Gatsby would've responded with violence to Tom Buchanan's suggestion that a self-made man like Gatsby could never be the equal of men who inherit their wealth. To the contrary, today, it goes without saying that a person who earned his billions is more admirable than one who inherits. Further, it is hard to picture a person as stiff as DiCaprio's Gatsby as a great confidence artist. Finally, the shrinking violet delicacy of Daisy Miller compares unfavorably by today's standards with the uninhibited sexuality of Tom Buchanan's whores. In short, this is a fabulous work of cinematography and reimagination of 1920s New York party culture. But as a drama it seems stiff and quaint.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the worst casting jobs in movie history,"to put aside of the badly scripted screenplay, the over-the-top directing, the exaggerated acting, the dizzy and fuzzy camera handling, the not-too-good editing, the pretentious costumes and so on, the casting, in my opinion, was one of the worst casting jobs since movie was invented. none of the actors and the actresses in this film looked appropriately enough to justify the vivid characters in the novel. three actors, Tobey Maguire, Joel Edgerton and Adelaide Clemens, were just so obviously all wrong cast. among these three, Tobey Maguire was the worst of the worst, because his facial feature, especially his thin lips, his funny mouth shape and his physical compositions; too short limbs and small boyish size, simply impossible to match the Nick Carraway role in the least. Joel Edgerton squeezed together features simply couldn't reflect tom buchanan's filthy rich and cunning role. and Adelaide Clemens, just alike Tobey Maguire, just like a childish, not mature enough actor to match Catherine in the novelette. of course they are all good even great actors, but just not good enough and appropriate enough to play these three roles. they should have declined to sign on for these three roles in the first place, because they just looked out of the place in this movie and made me feel sorry and embarrassed for them.",,Anonymous,Romance
Fantastic adaptation,"I absolutely loved this film. I studied the book in school a few years ago and loved it then, and Luhrmann really does it justice.The cinematography is spectacular, as you'd expect if you've seen Moulin Rouge and Romeo and Juliet, and the first stages of the film really immerse you in the fantastical illusion that Gatbsy has conjured up through his parties and lavish lifestyle.As the story moves on, the stellar cast comes into its own. DiCaprio is, unsurprisingly, immaculate, giving the perfect mix of optimistic hope and downright naivety and delusion. Each of the other main actors manages to generate just enough sympathy for his or her character that you remain torn between who the good and bad people are. Edgerton is a prime example; an unpleasant character for sure, but somehow Edgerton made him human enough for me to not despise him. Tobey Maguire is a revelation. I had my doubts about him going into this film, but he suits the role down to the ground, and actually manages to be pretty funny, acting as the source for most of the film's humour.All in all, I think the film does a great job of portraying the central message of Fitzgerald's novel. There are no out and out villains, merely a host of ""careless people, who smash things and people and then retreat into their money."" And one man who dared to dream, one Gatsby.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Green Light,"This film comes under the section of ""not sure why they made the it"". Lovely looking in 3D it is, but in a ridiculous toontown way. Indeed this would have made a more convincing animated film.The Idee fixe of the green light may have supreme importance in the book, but in this film I began to think I was a mysterious alien signal. In fact it was more fascinating than most of the dialogue and storyline.DiCaprio is quite good at the suggestion of something not quite right. And yet he doesn't seem to occupy the space the others are in. Toby Macguire seems more interested in the era, but insists on the wide eyed Marvel character still.Ultimately there is not enough to fill 2 hours of film. The movie is set in a cartoon world that without having the purity of a cartoon. The basic story doesn't deserve the screen time, or it needs to be told by someone with something to say.And yet - there is a little film called Metropolitan from decades ago that this razzmatazzfest could have learnt from. A film about another class and outsiders. I recommend you watch that instead.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Just watch it and make your own mind up about this film.,"I for one, thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The stand out for me, like for most people, is the cinematography, it is simply breathtaking. From the incredible lavish, beautiful, completely over the top scenes, to the cold, stark and heart wrenching scenes... also the soundtrack, a blend of atmospheric 1920's style music and jarringly modern which fits so unexpectedly well with the story. In some the camera angles become a bit dizzying, but other scenes are stylishly laid back and mesmerizing like a painting. Leonardo Di Caprio is absolutely superb as Gatsby and as far as I remember his character stays true to the one in the original story. Clearly the purists here disagree, I must read it again to see what the fuss is about!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Needless modernized remake of a classic,"The one in question was preceded by 4 adaptations of the novel - I have not seen them, but I remember vaguely the book I read 20+ years ago. Regretfully, the movie was apparently ""refurbished"" to widen the audience, but stylish 1920ies do not go with electronic music, club dancing movements, and Disney-like colors... Dramas and tragedies accentuated by kitsch - not for me, if the topics and appearance are meant to be serious and not like Tarantino's creations. The cast is uneven as well, Leonardo DiCaprio as Jay Gatsby is great, but the others such as Tobey Maguire, Carey Mulligan, Joel Edgerton have had far more stronger performances. Less supporting actors are quite uninviting and forgotten before long.Thus, just an above-average creation, improved by the presence of good/known actors. I have the feeling that the one with Robert Redford and Mia Farrow from 1974 would stay more true to the novel and include more even cast.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Oppulent Over the Top Portrayal of the Times,"True to Fitzgerald, and I think one of DiCaprio's best performances, this luscious, lavish production of The Great Gatsby is by far better than others and a must see. Not only great entertainment and acting, it is an in depth exploration of the man Gatsby as we get to know him as never before in breadth and depth, what really made him tick. The complex interplay of relationships and desires of the four characters are depicted through the eyes of Nick, who is writing about this in hindsight, and works as a vehicle for telling the story of Gatsby, with whom he has a fascination. My one complaint is in the music chosen at times that brings in contemporary rhythms in a period piece which is out of character to me. It's minimal, but jarring. Overall this is worth the price of admission.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"This was a good movie, but...","My wife and I really enjoyed this movie. It's definitely worth watching. Don't get me wrong.But...I hated the obnoxious over use of ""Old Sport"" and the out of time soundtrack. Gatsby had Rap, Hip Hop, and Techno music playing at his parties in the 1920s. A really stupid thing to do if you ask me. It helped ruin the overall mood of the movie.The scenery/style was accurate and breathtaking. As with all new movies far too much CGI was used to the point of some scenes looking more the Roger Rabbit than reality. Most of the scenes when he was driving his car looked like a cartoon.At the end I felt like I just watched a really great movie, but it could have been even better with music from the correct time period and less CGI. I would have given this movie a 9 instead of a 7 if it hadn't been for that.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Surprisingly really liked it,"It's no secret that while I always wanted this film to be good, I never had high expectations. Those expectations were lowered with each new trailer, each new released clip, because it seemed totally opposite from what Fitzgerald intended in the novel. The film was pretty much what I expected in its complete theatricality, but what I didn't expect was to like it as much as I did.I don't think this is a great adaptation of the novel, or even a great film, but it sure is a highly entertaining one. As shallow as the film looked in the trailers, I thought it would all only work on the surface but have no actual understanding of the novel. Despite the style and it being as subtle as a hammer to the head, it doesn't completely feel misguided in its execution. That's because the novel's criticism of this same style the film has can be seen as some sort of underlying satire or even parody when it comes to the more over-the-top scenes. Whatever it is, it kinda works. The only other Baz film I've ever seen is Moulin Rouge and I thought that film lost a lot of steam as it went on, even though it does calm down. This one does too, but the source material is so much more interesting that I can't imagine someone making it completely boring. Quite a few scenes are ridiculous in their overbearingness, but they still manage to be a lot of fun.A huge reason why this works is because of the cast, and I actually didn't have a big problem with any of them. Maguire is the biggest mixed result here, but even then I expected him to be awful so I was pleasantly surprised. I also expected Dicaprio to completely butcher this character by the clips and trailers I'd seen, and that's the biggest surprise here. He gives Gatsby a lot of the original intrigue that carries us through the novel, and his presence always remains grounded, sometimes even contrary to how the film is. My problem with Dicaprio here, and with him in other films, is his inconsistent accent that does get in the way of his performance, and so many of his ""Old Sport"" deliveries are cringe-worthy. But besides that, I think he did a really good job. The same with Edgerton and Mulligan, both who do the most justice to how I envisioned the characters in the novel. Mulligan's known for playing quietly sophisticated characters with hidden vulnerability, but she subtly gets to the root of Daisy and by the end of it I had the same feelings towards her here that I've always had towards her in the novel- contempt. She does a great job of exposing her for who she really is as the film goes on, but never as obvious as the film around her.So to everyone's surprise, I quite liked this film. As an adaptation, it's actually worthy because of the acting, and as a stand-alone film it's even more worthy for how entertaining and intriguing it remains, either in spite or because of all of the absurdity on screen.",,Anonymous,Romance
Great first act. The rest... not so much.,"The reinterpretation and re-imagining of the 20s in a modern salsa is stylish and often astonishing, making the first act a really enjoyable experience. The second and third acts however (once the tone is set) become something else, something closer to a theatrical play rather than the extravagant movie it presented itself as. I'm not a big fan of ""Moulin Rouge"", and this film uses the exact same style, trying to captivate the audience as the 2001 Oscar Winner did. All the actors involved did a fairly good job, and considering the exaggerated tone the director chose to follow, a bit of over-acting here and there is almost expected. I wouldn't recommend it for the drastic decrease of excitement and visual stimulation, but it deserves being mentioned for loudly bringing back the experience of the 1920s era.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

An adaptation of a book that wasn't bad in the movies.,"This film adapts the greatest novel of Scott Fitzgerald, which explores the dark past and love affairs of a wealthy American millionaire in the twenties. Directed by Baz Luhrmann, which ensures the screenplay with Craig Pearce, has Leonardo DiCaprio in the lead role.The film has a good script, faithful to the novel. Unfortunately, the dramatization soften the symbolism of certain elements. The optician signal, for example, is no more than a piece of scenario. Leo DiCaprio was at the height of his role and, although isn't a particularly inspired interpretation, sought to incorporate his character's personality. Tobey Maguire didn't convinced me, his character looks like a jerk, who drooled over the things of his rich neighbor. The sets and costumes are excellent and show eloquently the ostentation of the nouveau-riche and the madness of the twenties. The soundtrack, which ranges from the strong rhythms of Charleston and the deep melancholy of blues, captures the dichotomy of feelings, experiences and personalities of the characters.This film is interesting in several aspects and, in my opinion, captures the essential of Fitzgerald's book. Of course, some things implicit in the novel were not portrayed in the film, but that's not makes this film a bad adaptation. Nothing replaces the book and, when we go to the movies, we have to understand that first. This is a very reasonable film. It could be better, but isn't bad at all.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Fitzgerald Can't Be Ruined,"It's hard to give a numerical rating to this film, because Fitzgerald deserves a 10 and everything else about the film is almost irrelevant. The screenplay preserves much of the dialogue. I haven't read the book in decades, but I did read it twice, and it all came back to me while watching this film.The movie is not ""over-the-top"" as some have claimed. The party scenes are extravagant, but they provide an effective contrast to the later scenes that are dark and scathing in their social criticism. The costumes were meticulous, beautiful and seemed period-authentic. I didn't like the hip-hop songs, but they were brief. Most of the music is supplied by the Bryan Ferry Orchestra.I have two complaints about the film: The painted backgrounds are a bit too obvious (as they are in most movies) and the acting was a bit of a letdown. DiCaprio is brilliant in some scenes and seems a bit confused in others. Maguire overdoes his facial expressions. Mulligan is convincing in her sad scenes, but it's hard to believe her as a woman who inspires desperate love. I couldn't understand why the Jewish gangster is portrayed by someone South Asian. In the end though, I didn't care about these quibbles.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Neatly made,"The grand and filmy American drama that sets on around 1920's that has some mysterious man by the name Gatsby who throws grand parties to the new yorkers, and his love story, this is the slice from the 2013's movie ''The Great Gatsby"".The story is in the narrative form where Nick narrates the story about Gatsby who happened to be his friend and begins the story saying that Gatsby is the man of hope and was very optimist, Gatsby was Nick's neighbour who always hold the parties that everyone would attend once, Nick gets the personal invitation from Gatsby to attend his party only after going there he comes to know that he was the only person who got invitation and the rest of all came without it, no one there knew who was Gatsby all had their own things to say about him but later Gatsby himself comes to Nick and introduces himself and there after he becomes close to him and calls for all the gathering he holds on, initially Nick is confused why Gatsby shows such concern towards him later he comes to know that Gatsby loved his cousin Daisy and the reason why he was arranging such huge party was with hope that someday or the other he could find Daisy coming there, Gatsby re approaches Daisy through Nick but now she is married to the rich sport enthusiastic Tom, though Gatsby never loses his hope and try to reunite her, how does he try? Does Daisy love him even now?

Seductively entertaining and visually magnificent.,"Watching this film requires a few concessions.First, you must imagine the elegantly beautiful 1974 classic version does not exist. Trust me. It's painful otherwise, and I will avoid any reference or comparison for that reason. Second, you must also imagine that, notwithstanding Fitzgerald's masterpiece, the setting is not the Roaring Twenties but, rather, some over amped time warp netherworld where Jay-Z and Beyonce' get to be avant garde again because they're rather incongruously and anachronistically foisted on a film in which they really have no place.If you make it that far, you're almost ready to watch The Great Gatsby 2013. Now brace yourself for Baz Lurhrmann's jarring postmodern deconstructivism that was thrilling a decade ago in Moulin Rouge, but has become by now almost as grotesque as Julie Taymor's murderous affront to Beatle music – Across the Universe.Thus prepared, you can now enjoy what is undeniably an entertaining, if uninspiring, film.Tobey Maquire, of whom I am usually a fan, is somewhat flaccid as Nick Carroway, despite the fact that the story depends utterly upon him to drive it forward. He does, however, bring a decidedly literary dimension to the film by framing the main story within his own attempt at recovery. Joel Edgerton is a perfectly delightful Tom Buchanan. He embodies all the machismo brutishness with which Fitzgerald envisioned the character. He also has enough personal charisma to help anchor the otherwise riotous staging. And, of course, there is DiCaprio as Gatsby. I didn't hate him, although I was predisposed to, but I wanted to love this movie, and Leo was one of the main reasons I couldn't.As far as casting, however, the jewel of this film is the deliriously sensuous and beautiful Carey Mulligan as Daisy Buchanan. She makes it easy to believe that Daisy broke hearts with just a smile back in Louisville and inspired Gatsby to bring the world to her dock for her sake.This film mines Fitzgerald's novel for more complex themes than predecessors have explored. Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't. Ironically, it also strips all the novel's major themes of any subtlety whatsoever and reduces them to stage settings for an unrelenting onslaught of elaborate music videos.But if I reel in my disappointment for a moment, I can only conclude that this is a well-made movie that is seductively entertaining and visually magnificent. Maybe it isn't fair to expect more.",,Anonymous,Romance
not too bad,"First I have seen the adverts about a month ago. Bilboards placarded across the capital were meant to advertise Baz Luhrmans new costume drama, so I decided to go to movies as soon as the film arrives. And so I did.I haven't known anything about the story itself, so I haven't got any expectations, and it was better that way. It is based on an L. Scott Fitzgerald novel, one that he became famous and worldwide known author with. And it is good. The story. I wish I could say the same about the film. It is shiny, rich in colors , and the costumes are incredibly well done – all you need for a blockbuster. But the pictures are too plastic, everything is too beautiful like you are watching a fairytale – and even though there is a drama behind, you can't take it too seriously. The director God knows why, but likes close snits, and that does not do good to anyone. It is pushing it too much to realize their feelings, to see surprise, sadness or anger on their face. Just too much. The same goes, when he want to emphasize certain things – like the spectacles on the poster, that see everything happening. He returns to them several times, and it does remind me certain cuts from Moulin Rouge.I don't say it is a bad movie, it is an OK one, that is nice to see after a long day. You don't have to think about it too much, and it pleases your senses.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Jay Z soundtrack,"Incredible movie from start to finish. Great directing, acting, and cinematography, but the Jay Z soundtrack almost ruined a few scenes. Jay Z is an amazing artist and I have great respect for him as a musician, but the flow and mood was completely disrupted at times. This idea may have worked for Rome & Juliet... but it did not work this time. Despite the NYC connection, the Roaring Twenties and Jay Z just don't mix. Other than that... phenomenal movie... but proper music would have made it that much better.This is not a shot at Jay Z... I've been listening to him for the last 15 years.

Slick,"Imagine if one day Michael Bay, famous for the high action epic movie, decided to remake the Ingmar Bergman trilogy. It would be full of cuts and grand scenes and instead of muted verbal clashes there would be fist fights. Of course the camera would be so restless as to give a sense of vertigo and the scene transitions would be rapid.Clearly a mismatch of talent and purpose,It's the same thing here with a shallow meaningless idiotic version that only shows how little the writing team and the director understood the material. The defense would be that it works for the current generation. And that may be true if weren't such a meretricious irrelevant argument. It is a travesty to update something out of recognition, as perhaps a Bay version of any Ingmar Bergman film would be.In a way it has to be slick; that is to be a massive sleight of hand, in order to conceal any genuine working or interpretation with the material. This is shock and awe but once the deceit is recognized it's clear that it is really just junk - expensive enough to erase reason for a minute or two, but junk all the same.A real director would have made something of the very simple material; it is a very slight piece of prose after all, but that requires maturity and expertise to interpret, and in its place, are the grandiose visions of a music video director from 1984.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not that bad at all,"Any movie by Australian director Baz Luhrmann is worth seeing because he has such a distinctive and exuberant style and you have to admire his willingness to be different, even if he is - as the ""Guardian"" film critic Peter Bradshaw put it - ""a man who can't see a nuance without calling security for it to be thrown off his set"". In different ways, I enjoyed ""Moulin Rouge"" and ""Australia"" and I was prepared to give ""The Great Gatsby"" a go, in spite of some harsh reviews.The F Scott Fitzgerald novel of 1925 has been filmed no less than four times before, notably in 1974 when Robert Redford played the plutocrat Jay Gatsby and Mia Farrow was his great love Daisy Buchanan in a restrained interpretation. Of course, Luhrmann does not do restraint and, in this movie, as well as his trademark grandiose sets and extensive CGI, he has shot the work in 3D, but I can only take so much Bazz and for this jazz I chose to see a 2D version, although even then it is very obvious where the 3D was intended to hit you in the eyes.It is, of course, over the top (most obviously in those huge party scenes in the Gatsby mansion), the framing device of Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) in a sanatorium is unnecessary, and the use of non- contemporary music by the likes of Jay-Z often jars. But there are some lavish sets and some gorgeous costumes and the whole thing has undeniable energy. Leonardo di Caprio has both the charm and the menace of Gatsby, while Cary Mulligan as Daisy continues to grown as an international star. Not so much ""All that Bazz"" as ""Not that bad"".",,Anonymous,Romance

Make it through the first 30 minutes and then enjoy a great film,"I read The Great Gatsby and could not wait for this film to come out. I went and saw it last night and, I must say, I really enjoyed it. However, the first thirty minutes were almost unwatchable. The parties were ridiculous with the modern music (I enjoyed the music later on in the film), and I almost walked out of the theater. I decided to stay, hoping it would get better, and I'm glad I did, because it truly was a good film and I liked it a lot by the end. Now that I can reflect on the beginning, I think that the director possibly wanted the start of the film to be ridiculous and obnoxious to show how crazy and vulgar the roaring twenties were... Stay through the beginning, and you will be glad you did. The acting gets better and more intense, the storyline comes more into play, and it's a really good watch. Leonardo DiCaprio is excellent as always, and Tobey Maguire is great in his role (once you come to accept his droning narrative). It's a great movie and I recommend it!

"Hollow, But Fancy Enough For The Eyes.","Nick Carraway moves next to an eccentric millionaire, Mr. Jay Gatsby, who throws lavish parties every single night. One night he receives an invitation to the party, the only invitation Gatsby has ever given to anyone to attend his gathering. Who is this Mr. Gatsby, why does he throw lavish parties every night and what are his real intentions?I read the book in preparation for this film, something I rarely do. I was left underwhelmed by the book and overexposed by the film. While the Baz Luhrmann does stay faithful to the words on the page, the overall tone and feel of the picture seems to be in the wrong place. When the truth about the book is about the falseness of these rich people and their empty lives while using the pedestal of a love story to get through it, Luhrmann seems more interested, or maybe the studio was, at making the love story front and centre, almost ignoring the more interesting aspects of the tale. What is left is an hollow film, that is fancy for the eyes and not much more.I chose to see the in 2D and judging by what I saw, I don't think I would have missed the confetti and floating typewriter words coming at me very much. Luhrmann's films always look like the prettiest girl at the ball. Gatsby is probably the prettiest of them all and with good reason too. Those parties Gatsby throws is wonderful, full of energy, vibrant colours and dance numbers. It's at one of these parties that we are introduced to Gatsby, in one of the most over the top and perfect character introductions I've seen on film. DiCaprio captures the essence of Gatsby, a lonely insecure man who hides behind his riches and puts on this mysterious front. He looks the part, acts the part and is one of the highlights of the picture. No one else seems to be on the same page as him though.Joel Edgerton is Tom Buchanan, a brutish fellow who is having an affair. Edgerton chomps on his cigars, kisses his woman and loves to poke the fire when it is hot. His wife, Daisy, played by the timid as a mouse Carey Mulligan is the picturesque woman that Gatsby is pining for. She doesn't seem to have a real identity. She is torn between two men, but nothing else of her character wants to come though. Her cousin, Nick Carraway is played by Peter Parker himself, Tobey Maguire. Much like the book, he is give nothing to do but walk around in the background with a drink in his hand. Maguire takes this thankless role and adds no flare, no emotion, no sense of tragedy to it. Aside from Pleasantville, I've yet to see a good Tobey Maguire performance.The story is a tragic one and even if Luhrmann didn't want to focus on the rich and famous and just centre on this love story, he should have added more stakes into it. Character with little to no screen time early on in the film, play major roles later on. It's an odd balance, made even odder by the Luhrmann flare he puts in it. The film feels like Moulin Rouge, with the over exaggerated expressions and acting from the background characters. The choice of modern music in an old time era, Luhrmann even uses the same plot device with a man telling the story at a typewriter.But like I said, the film look gorgeous, sounds great and is very eccentric, much like the characters that inhabit this story. This is probably the closest adaptation of The Great Gatsby we'll get, even if it didn't get it right.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great Gatsby Review,"I think that Baz Lurhmann's The Great Gatsby is getting mixed thoughts because as Baz himself said in an interview ""everyone has their own version of The Great Gatsby"" which is probably why people love it or hate it. I am currently reading the book and I think the critics and the people who don't like movie are people with a different vision of how The Great Gatsby is than Baz sees it. I think that Baz wanted to show the film as a tragic love and he then surrounds it in his vision of the roaring twenties or the jazz age ( I personally like the roaring twenties ). But really the novel is showing how the 20s corrupted the American dream, also the change in lifestyle during the twenties because the economy was better and the war had ended. Really the novel The Great Gatsby was more than just parties and a love story, but Baz wanted to capture the crazy parties and the eccentric lifestyle people had then with the parties and such. That is how Baz saw the story and it is not wrong it is what he saw. He also didn't really show how the old money did not approve of the new money with the whole west and east egg situation.As I see it Baz wanted to tell a story that would please audiences not make them think of the deeper meaning which is okay I mean it was advertised as one of the first big summer blockbusters with good new music and amazing visuals. Really the visuals are great but nothing to waste money on the 3D version of the movie. I am assuming that the critics wanted a movie that would show us the deeper meaning of Gatsby but they got a summer blockbuster that they were not expecting so they judged it harshly which in my opinion is unfair. I mean it's a Baz Lurhmann movie he is known for cool visuals and outrageous costumes I assume critics would remember from Moulin Rouge ( it was better than Gatsby ).I was a bit disappointed in how Baz showed the 1920s I mean I watch his movies that take us back in time in history I don't feel as if I have gone back in time but gone to Baz's alternate universe, a mix of history and modern day which is cool but not for movie like Gatsby where it is centred in the real past 1920s not some mix of the future and the past. I felt the same way when watching Moulin Rouge but less so because in Gatsby the 20s is such a pivotal point to get right.Overall if you want to go to Gatsby to see an interesting romantic, fun love story then you're going to get what you want but if you want to see a fantastic remake of a classic novel that is intelligent and shows the life of a person in the 1920s maybe you will not totally get what you want. I think Gatsby deserves a pat on the back for making an enjoyable love story of a novel. Do I see any awards for the movie, not the music..... Well no but it is still a great movie I definitely say it is a must see even if you're just going to see it so you don't have to read the book for class.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
An interesting way to know Gatsby,I love the way the movie was directed and we can know better Gatsby and his dramatic ending about all the rich problem and the social condition. I enjoyed also a lot the interpretation of Leonardo Di Caprio and his rage moments was really well done.

My review for The Great Gatsby,This is one of the best films I've ever seen in my hole life and this film best describes what happens in the book. My classmates really enjoyed reading it and they loved the film too.,10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Easy Watch,"I was very hesitant to watch this movie because; I did not really enjoy the book. But, I was very pleased while watching the movie. The first thing that caught my eye was the costumes and scenery. These two areas of the movie were spot on when it comes to the era of the movie. Another great aspect of the movie was the characters. Tobey Maguire did a fantastic job and portrayed the quiet character he was supposed to be well. Leonardo DiCaprio was also a great contribution to this movie. Gatsby was intended to be a mysterious man who was read by others as well off. Carey Mulligan fulfilled her role with a lot of promise. She was able to play her position as the middle women well and her acting as secret mistress was great. Overall, this was a good movie it had a good story line, and as the movie plays you become more and more interested with what will happy next. Although I do have one complaint about this movie, time. The movie is over two hours long and can feel that way at times. Even with this small issue, I would watch this movie again.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A Visually Stunning ,Dazzling masterpiece","Some people hate 3-D.I'm one of them,but Baz Luhrmann tells me otherwise.I do not know about the older Gatsby movies.I have not read the book.I wished to but never did. Went to watch it because of Leo and came out with a great admiration for Baz's view of the story about a wonderful man who truly loved a woman and was willing to do anything for her. Tobey Macguire delivers what is one of his best performances and Leo as usual ends up dead and does not get the girl.I guess he was just asked to put on a bunch of clothes and look good and apart from that for Leo it must have been just another day at the office. Amitabh Bachchan has a small and handy role.The visual effects are stunning. Sets,Props,cinematography,costumes and the whole lot is beautiful. Simply put Baz Luhrmann's Epic masterpiece yet!!!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

The Great Gatsby (2013),"Importantly, in order for a piece of cinema to be successful it must have a great plot. The Great Gatsby uses different aspects to showcase the unique story by using symbolism and vibrant imagery. For example, the film showcases a town called The Valley of Ashes, and the town is filled with rubble and ash which makes the town look dark and desolate. Looming over this town is a great big sign that has two big eyes wearing round glasses, the eyes symbolizes the eyes of god because in the movie Nick who is also played by Tobey Maguire says ""Over the ash heaps the giant eyes of Doctor T.J. Eckleberg kept their vigil but I perceived, after a moment, that other eyes were regarding us with peculiar intensity from less than twenty feet away. "" In the film we are told that there are two different cities one is East Egg, where people of ""old money"" live and West Egg is the place where people of ""new money"" live Gatsby lives in West Egg and so does Nick. Nick is intrigued by Gatsby because Gatsby lives in a ginormous mansion that holds the biggest and the craziest parties. Nick finally gets to meet the mysterious Gatsby by getting an invitation to one of his parties. Nick finally meets Gatsby who is played brilliantly by Leonardo Dicaprio, Gatsby asks Nick an important favor, which is for Nick to invite his cousin Daisy who is played by Carey Mulligan, to a tea party. We then learn that Gatsby and Daisy used to be in a relationship until Gatsby had to go back to fight in the war. In consequence, Gatsby has achieved many things, he's a war hero, he's wealthy, and he is popular among his peers, but he still yearns for the ultimate American Dream, which is for him to marry Daisy and live a happy life together.  For this quest Gatsby has to go through tantalizing and even deadly obstacles for him to finally grasp his ultimate goal.     The Great Gatsby uses an extremely amazing selection of music that directly relates to the film. ""100 dollar bill"" is a modern day song, recorded by rap-star Jay-Z, that talks about owning a surplus of money. This song was used to represent the amount of money being recklessly used at a gentlemen's club, as well as in the rest of the movie. Another song that relates to the film is ""A Little Party Never Killed Nobody"". There are multiple reasons as to why this song is related to this movie, the major reason being that there are a numerous amount of parties. ""Young And Beautiful"" is a song that has a great and epic meaning behind it. Gatsby is in love with another character in the movie, and he has oriented his life around hers. He is so wildly in love with her, and she to him. This song did an excellent job at depicting their love on screen, into words. Possibly the best relative song in the movie is ""Where The Wind Blows"", because it is a song of finding yourself. The entire movie is about how the characters are applying themselves to the world and how they use what they are given. The music plays a huge role in making this movie the great film that it is. Another aspect that makes The Great Gatsby such a great movie is its complex characters.  Arguably the most complex character in the movie was Jay Gatsby himself.  The initial mystery surrounding Gatsby's character serves to draw the audience to want to learn more about how Gatsby came to be.  The movie first presents Gatsby as a looming figure next door to the narrator.  This detail creates intrigue for the audience.  Then, when Nick first attends one of Gatsby's parties and meets him, the audience begins to see that Gatsby is a welcoming and friendly person.  He and Nick become friends, which helps urge the viewers to take a liking to Gatsby.  As more details of his life are revealed, the viewer begins to feel sorry for Gatsby.  For example, learning of his failed romance with Daisy five years ago causes the audience to feel sorry for him, and it helps to explain why he is taking so many extreme measures to get her back.  However, when it is revealed that he grew up dirt poor, it creates suspicion about how he became so rich, yet this mystery is never fully revealed in the movie, only hinted at.       The Great Gatsby is truly a thrilling movie that should be viewed by the world because of its epic plot, thoughtful choice of music, and very complex characters.  Every movie has a plot that follows the strict guidelines for making a movie but the difference between a good movie and a bad movie is how well it applies the scene to this guideline. In The Great Gatsby did an amazing job at keeping the viewers interested the entire plot by using vivid imagery and other forms of entertainment. This movie also implicates emotions through beautiful symphony of music. The use of different genres of music conveyed a wonderful feeling of involvement with the characters. The characters in this movie were simply a perfect fit for the scene. They allow viewers to relate to them and in turn develop a connections with them, and the movie. Overall this movie was beautifully crafted and definitely must be viewed by the world.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Beautiful story, ruined by Anton Musted.","Always challenging to put a classic into a successful picture with similar status, but unfortunately this production failed to reach its intended goal. The approach indicates reaching grandeur, great as Gatsby, but the result fails to live up to that. While most aspects are better than average and hours of work with a clear vision were put in costume design, casting, special effects.. there is one gigantic dealbreaker on the horizon, which casts a shadow over the entire project: the musicThe story is set in the 20s, but the contemporary and mediocre party music just ruined the entire undertaking. So much potential for a must-see movie, but so brutally ruined. As close as Gatsby gets to grasping his dream, so far away Anton Musted (executive producer music) got from putting in an acceptable work shift: he missed it by a few thousand light years. Clearly delusional his risky choice of music was going to be received well, maybe even more about his artistic talent.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Astounding and Magnificent,"Yesterday I saw a film that will be nominated for about a dozen Oscars come Jan.'14. Some of the nominations will be Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor and Best Film. Leo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire in ""The Great Gatsby."" This in not just a great film but spellbinding from start to go.A Magnificent adaptation of Fitzgerald's book about a poor but very savvy young midwesterner who became a zillionaire thru shady dealings, living in a palace on Long Island and the effect he has on a totally innocent, naive and bashful neighbor whose recollections of events take place as a result of being in a mental institution. The cinematography is as good if not better than any film I've ever seen. The brilliance of lights, color and music set to a gripping passionate love story leaves one speechless. The viewer is riveted to his/her seat. It's because all of us are swept up into the imagery of opulence and life styles none of us can ever hope to attain. Good God, if each of had a friend like Jay Gatsby, what super-exciting lives they would be. Don't miss this film. It's breathtaking.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not Gatsby...but So What?,"Believe it or not, F. Scott Fitzgerald was not universally adored by his contemporaries; hardly any ""great"" writer is. When ""The Great Gatsby"" was published in 1925, critics accused it of being light, unconvincing and celebrating the same decadence modern readers now see as the target of the novel's satire. It's ironic to think that the same insults lobbed at the book a little less than a century ago were used almost verbatim by modern film critics about the movie.The film starts with our narrator Nick Carraway (Maguire) receiving treatment for alcoholism. He recalls from his past the story of Jay Gatsby (DiCaprio) a mysterious millionaire and neighbor who threw some of the most lavish parties the North Shore of Long Island has ever seen. Nick's cousin Daisy (Mulligan) lives across the bay in a loveless marriage with old-money magnate Tom Buchanan (Edgerton). Seems years ago she and Gatsby had had a brief but fruitful courtship, interrupted by the events of WWI. After meeting and getting to know Gatsby, Nick agrees to reunite the two thus unraveling a complex tapestry of corruption, infidelity, power and tragedy.In fairness to director Baz Luhrmann, Warner Bros. and Leonardo DiCaprio, making a film based on a universally acclaimed literary classic like this was always going to be a losing proposition. If you thought Harry Potter and Stephen King fans were annoying nitpicks, imagine having a movie be ripped to shreds by supposed centuries of ""good taste"" who have had nearly a century to analyze the source material. Yet as stated earlier, those same bastions of good taste dismissed the same story nary a generation ago. Are we to believe the film is worthy of the same critical reevaluation?While the film does have some resplendent moments of visual intricacy, and some metaphorical complexity, The Great Gatsby at times feels emotionally un-engaging and unconvincing. Fixating strictly on the visual, we get the same emphasis on style over substance that plagued Luhrmann's other work Moulin Rouge! (2001), only this time we get to see the art direction without seizure inducing editing. I call this an improvement, even if the outstanding Jim Broadbent is completely absent from this film.Still, when Luhrmann's superficial approach is warranted the film really flies. The Gatsby parties as well as the fun-loving moments at the Plaza Hotel are infectious. You want to be amid the bacchanalia, dancing the night away, leering at lavish mansion set- pieces and basking in all that insanity. It's inviting, it's seductive and for all involved in the story, it proves a perversion of the American Dream.I would also like to point out the film's bold choice in soundtrack. While many critics poo-poo the idea of an anachronistic soundtrack, I for one found it inspired and felt it enhanced the story. For the sake of historical accuracy, they could have gone with Cole Porter all the way but by injecting liberal doses of Amy Winehouse, will.i.am and Lana Del Rey, the audience is lulled into a state of comfort. Thus when the story reaches its zenith, even the most libertine of us will feel a sense of moral indignation.The biggest complaint most every naysayer has about this film is it's ""not Gatsby"". I agree; it really isn't Fitzgerald's vision and since we are talking about a literary classic, that should count for something. But if the book never existed, if this movie was an original idea, would we still hold it with such disdain? Probably not; we'd probably just brush it off as an entertaining, light and decadent film whose story suffers from its visual opulence. Such backhanded praise isn't exactly an endorsement but it's also not the worst thing said about a Baz Luhrmann film.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Rich and Rewarding.,"""The most hopeful man I ever knew."" Nick Caraway (Tobey Maguire)I refuse to enter into the fray about the comparison between F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby and any film adaptation. Both are different ways of telling the story and should be discussed on their own merits. Baz Luhrmann's film version, The Great Gatsby, is sumptuous, just as you would expect from the visionary director of the eccentric Moulin Rouge and Romeo and Juliet, and it successfully translates the great disparity between hope and despair, the have's and have not's, memory and reality, love and longing, and the American dream.Luhrmann's personal evocation of the roaring 1922 twenties is art deco and sin ramped up to full speed. The mise en scene is loaded with careening cameras, wild colors, flappers, jazz performers, and luscious automobiles. Luhrmann wildly imagines that time between the Great War and the Great Depression when no apparent consideration arose about the poor or the danger of Stock Market catastrophe. The shots are beautiful while the people often foolish.The greatest fool is Jay Gatsby (Leo DiCaprio), newly rich yet old in love, longing for Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan), yet her old money will not let him have her, notwithstanding she's married anyway. DiCaprio plays him like he's a movie star (come think of it, Leo is Gatsby in a movie star life), distant and dreamy with tons of money and no one to give it to but revelers who give nothing back. DiCaprio seems instinctively to know the seductions of wealth and fame, and the dark pit of loneliness that accompanies the futile grab for the one thing he can't buy.Carey Mulligan's Daisy makes little impression except for her memorable smile, or at least the actress doesn't show why her character is worth Gatsby's sacrifice. However, that may have been the purpose with her thin characterization all along: She embodies the carelessness of the rich, barely able to sacrifice for love, unattached to anything but things.Luhrmann's choice for Nick's framing the story from the sanitarium compromises his credibility for narrating the story. Although Maguire brings the right wide-eyed naiveté to the role, he doesn't have the weariness of Joseph Cotten's institutionalized narrator, Jed Leland, in Citizen Kane. By the way, that film has a lost dreamer as its protagonist as well.Although Nick knows you can't remake the past, Gatsby keeps hoping to return to it with Daisy. The film gives that melancholy theme its due, and Fitzgerald can be heard and felt at the end:""Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther. . . . And then one fine morning— So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."" Nick",,Anonymous,Romance
Better than the 1974 version,"Good adaptation of the F Scott Fitzgerald book, and better than the 1974 adaptation. Not great though: too much style instead of substance (which has always been an issue with Baz Luhrmann's movies). The first half was mostly just Luhrmann showing off what he can do with special effects, light, colour and movement. The 21st-century soundtrack in a 1920s setting was particularly irritating.However, the substance kicks-in in the second half, and then the movie becomes interesting. Much less special effects, much more drama. The last few scenes are very emotional, and brilliant.I know this is supposed to be Leonardo DiCaprio's best shot at a Best Leading Actor Oscar, after being snubbed many times, but I don't see him getting it. I wouldn't even have him among the nominees. His performance is OK, but not brilliant. In fact, it is debatable whether he even deserves top billing in the movie. Yes, he plays the character after whom the movie is named, but Tobey Maguire has much more screen time.Maguire puts in a solid performance, in a role which requires him to be solid but not spectacular. He is the narrator, and our eyes into the life of Gatsby and friends, not a man of action.Carey Mulligan shines as Daisy. She is perfect for the role.Good performances from an all-Australian supporting cast: Joel Edgerton, Isla Fisher, Jason Clarke, Jack Thompson and Elizabeth Debicki.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Phenomenal movie! Absolutely brilliant!,"I've read the book and loved it. This a story with a lot of depth and I believe the symbolism is essential to one's overall comprehension of the story. This movie truly depicts these symbols accurately as well as the setting, case in point, the Valley of Ashes, West Egg, the green light etc. I think it can really aid a person in gasping the true concept of the story. Needless to say, it's visually stunning.The music was a major concern for most people but I have to say, although I'm no Jay Z/Beyonce fan, it works extremely well. The lyrics reflect what is happening and is in sync with the pace and circumstances. The pacing of the film is great and the music adds to the excitement of the roaring 20s so it never feels boring. Luhrmann and the cast/crew made this movie feel contemporary while simultaneously staying faithful to the historical and classical context.Furthermore, while it highly stylized, the actors put a lot of thought and emotion into their performances. I can tell that a lot of research was done because the cast seemed to really understand the people they were portraying from the inside out. Leonardo DiCaprio was spectacular as was Carey Mulligan (who was a concern for so many people). Mulligan gave insight into Daisy's motivations rather than just portraying her as a flat, weak, shallow woman. She really let us in on what was going on in Daisy's mind and Nick's narration assisted in those revelations. The rest of the cast did brilliantly with their material as well. I have no complaints.I had goosebumps for the very start to the end of this movie. It was simply that amazing. It has the best of both worlds in terms of style and substance and contemporary and classic. A must see movie. I will say that it is important to keep an open mind and really take some time to think about the issues addressed in this film. I also would not take any negative reviews too seriously. See it or yourself and then be your own judge. It baffles me that some people dislike this masterpiece but to each his own. I think a lot of it had to do with expectations as some people were throw off by Luhrmann's past work. Multiple viewings may help as it contains so much detail. This is a pure and faithful adaptation to timeless novel and I believe that Fitgerald, who was a modern man, would have been proud to see his work of art come to life in a way that's never been done before.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Luhrmann's Best Work Yet,"A Midwestern war veteran finds himself drawn to the past and lifestyle of his millionaire neighbor.The reviews on this film seem to be mixed, or maybe even negative. Some people really disliked the musical choices (though I felt them better suited than Luhrmann's ""Moulin Rouge"" choices, which varied from great to terrible). Some disliked Tobey McGuire, either for his acting or for the ""lapdog"" take on Nick Carraway. That seems more fair.I loved it. While ""Romeo + Juliet"" may go down as Luhrmann's masterpiece, this is really quite a trip, with plenty of opulence without ever making that the point. He wanted a love story -- if this can be called that -- and not a morality tale on money, Wall Street, or anything else.There seems a need to compare Jay Gatsby to the ""Wolf of Wall Street"" merely because DiCaprio appeared in both films in the same year, and both are excessively wealthy. There is no need for that, because again, it is not about the money. The money was merely a means to an end for Gatsby, not the goal in itself.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

I love the Great Gatsby book and normally I do not think that movies are even close to as good as their book counter part. This movie however, blew me away and was if good if not better then the book. The director gave you a looking glass into the past and showed you a world of partying and excitement that could not be explained on a page of a book. The cars were fast and flashy, the homes were large and extravagant, the the dress of the time was very interesting. If you did not see this movie in theaters, find a friend with a home theater and watch it there because it must be viewed in a theater type setting.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Stays with you,"I have to admit, when I watched the movie I didn't feel as attracted by it as I do now. But it grew on me, because I kept thinking about it and how it was done. And it's the first movie that Baz Luhrman did that really achieved that with me. It's only the 4th I've seen, but still something to cherish upon. The music would also be something you could cherish upon.Though I'm not sure if that also could be something that takes you out of it completely. While this is a period piece, the music is very modern indeed. It takes a bit to get used to that. Though the dance moves are clearly from that time, which goes to show you, that dance styles may differ, but the music could be different too and the styles would still be intact.But while music is always a big part of a Luhrman movie (as are the sets they are shot on, impressive as always), it is the story that is compelling. Almost as compelling as the main female character is to Gatsby himself. There are quite a few character flaws but also a depth to them, that might be rare to other Luhrman movies. I really liked where this was going and the movie is really good too.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
More Visual Less Impactful,"Although I enjoyed the movie thoroughly, I wouldn't call it a great one. It was a nice movie set up in old times with modern actors doing a good job pulling everything together. Leonardo did a good job but I was not impressed by his acting at all. He is one of my favorite actors and maybe that's why i was expecting more from him. Having said that, I liked Tobey's acting and role more than anyone else's in the movie. He was, sort of, in the background in the entire movie - moving the story forward. Connecting the dotes and being there to help and be right was what he did well.Visually the movie was spectacular. Cinematography was awesome and sets were worth watching. But somehow, intensity and depth was missing. It is like you're watching it and enjoying it but you're not in it. On the other hand - I liked the story, of course it is one of the great literature jewels, in general but not it's end. It was tragic love story which didn't end well.You might like it or you might hate it...but overall worth a one time watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Leonardo did his best but even he could not save this total flop of a movie.The lack of direction, the number of bloopers, the poor acting & casting, the weak script, ridiculous music and comic like cinematography all blended to aid in the demise of this venture.A worthwhile project, poorly executed and badly edited.Save your money, do not go and see this movie, you will regret every cent you spend on it.

Not one to rest on his laurels after making Moulin Rouge!, he has outdone himself with his latest masterpiece, The Great Gatsby! Everyone must see this movie! Forge the book. Forget Robert Redfort's Gatsby, Leonardo DiCaprio IS the Big G! What a script by Baz Luhrmann! What makes Francis Ford Coppola think he knows how to write a screenplay for The Great Gatsby? Sure, he's famous, and he lived and grew up in West Egg, or rather, Great Neck, or more precisely, Kings Point, where Daisy lived, but that doesn't mean he can channel F. Scott Fitzgerald, who also lived in Great Neck (actually, Great Neck Estates, the slum part of town). To really, really understand The American Dream these days, you have to grow up in Australia. The American Dream is dead in America. Australia is what America once was.And just because Jack Clayton also made a movie named Moulin Rouge doesn't mean he can make a movie named The Great Gatsby, too. Luhrmann's isn't just Gatsby, it's The Great Gatsby!!! This Gatsby is hip! This Gatsby is happnin! This is a modern Gatsby for the modern world of 2013 in 3D!

Not great Gatsby,"Almost 40 years on from the last Hollywood adaptation of F Scott Fitzgerald's modern classic comes Baz Lurrmann's take on the tale. To my eyes, the movie stays close to the novel as indeed did Robert Wise's 1974 version which starred Robert Redford and Mia Farrow, making me subconsciously compare actors as well as scenes which were similar in both movies.I have to say, I prefer the 70's version. It would be easy to chide Luhrmann's use of modern music for so much of the background music, so chide I will, I certainly don't want to be thinking of Beyonce Knowles in a too obvious stab at a younger audience, when watching a film that tries so hard in many other ways to capture the hedonistic ""Jazz Age"" era of post-War, Prohibition-bound.Thus the director goes to town in the party scenes at Gatsby's home, but a lot of it seems like window-dressing. I have casting issues too with Tobey McGuire's simpering goofiness at odds with his character's crucial part as a detached witness. I also felt that Carey Mulligan failed to convince as the impressionable Daisy Buchanan and that as her husband likewise struggled to adequately counterpoint Leonardo DiCaprio's title role.Much will be made, no doubt of his pivotal portrayal of the doomed Gatsby. For me he acted naturally and with some style but failed to cast off an air of boyishness which for me was at odds with the deeper demands of his character. Nobody else leapt out at me either from the supporting cast, leaving me with the overall impression that the film, though pretty on-the-eye is let down by its actors who steadfastly refuse to leap off the printed page and imbed themselves in the memory.The shifting narrative view-point didn't help much either so that in the end I was forced to the admittedly obvious conclusion about the film serving the eye better than the brain.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good but could have been great,I quite enjoyed the Great Gatsby but felt it had all the ingredients to be a classic and these ingredients were not all used. Leonardo gives a great performance as Gatsby and so does the rest of the cast. The cinematography was outstanding and made the film alluring and graceful. However better direction could have made the film more dramatic. Perhaps the film could have been arranged differently with the use of voice overs or other techniques to heighten some parts and not others. The Great Gatsby is a classic novel but bringing it to life in a different medium is a different story altogether. Still a great watch and entertaining.,7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"I LOVED it, You won't enjoy it too much if you just go there to compare it with the book and the old film!","9.5/10 I went to see The Great Gatsby because Leonardo DiCaprio was there and he is a great actor who appears in many great films and it was MORE than worth it! The music, the New York 20's look scenes which left me wanting to live in those times, the parties they showed, the ACTING. I loved it all and I was completely engrossed in it, as also the people in the theater since everybody was quiet when the whole theater was absolutely FULL of people! Not a sound from the audience was heard! I could feel everybody entertained as I was and I cried like a little baby in the end because I was that into the movie and it was so tragic.I just loved it, DiCaprio was an incredible Gatsby and the movie I found it so emotional and meaningful, it made me regret so much not paying attention when I was reading the book of The Great Gatsby in high school.I would only think why a person would criticize this movie is because they are going there with a goal set in their mind to compare it with the book and the old film and criticize it when it doesn't have an SPECIFIC detail that the book or old film had. If you do that, you sadly won't appreciate it as much as I did or fully enjoy it, my advice is go to the theater and don't expect anything from the book or old film, if you do that, be ready to be OVERWHELMED by how beautiful the film is! My boyfriend and I went there knowing the full story but not the details completely of the book and old film so we didn't compare the movie to anything, we just went there to enjoy it, and for us it was an amazing work of art!

only,just only the starting & the ending process of this movie deserve 7.2 in my points of view.How the director entering us in one of the most entering style in this movie just out of this world.Finishing is another beauty of movies history.
Then the plot,story,screenplay,acting,background music....omg what can i describe this masterpiece. Actually i can't bcoz I'm not great like the director & Leonardo. I can't compare anything with me between them. i m just an audience as like as others.

Flaws Ruin What Should Have Been Truly Spectacular,"To begin, I find it annoying that all anyone complains about is the music not fitting the times. I think that's one of the strong points of the film. I really don't like all the artists involved in the film (besides Jack White) but the music worked well. It shouldn't be a problem unless you believe that a movie needs to be 100% true to the source material.I liked the visuals, too. It was all very cool, and it wasn't overdone to the point where it distracted from the story.THE PROBLEM IS THE STORY ITSELFLet's get something clear: if this movie would have been handed over to a great director... let's say David Fincher... in post-production it would have been movie of the year hands down.The only thing that ruined the film was the editing. And yes, it RUINED it. It killed this film. The most aggravating part of it all is we all know by now this is just ""a certain director"" trying to pretentiously assert to us that he is ""arty"" and ""edgy.""Which is fine, unless you destroy all sense of pace that the film has!The pacing was just awful... especially in the first half.It was edited so literally every thirty seconds the location changes. Meanwhile our narrator, Tobey Maguire, speed reads what seems like too much dialogue. It hurts to watch these scenes.Everyone says the second half is better: and while it is, it's only because the acting was so strong it occasionally broke through the bad editing. Especially DiCaprio. This film could have been the highlight of his recent career. I honestly didn't feel as invested in the characters as I should have been. There were a few really well done scenes, and they only made me more angry at he bad one's.Tobey Maguire is another problem. I don't think it's his fault. I think it's just the approach he decided to take or the director (sorry Baz but it has to be said) instructed him to take. He just wasn't that interesting or notable, with the exception of a few scenes where he works to his strong points. It's not good that the movie is centred and narrated by such a weak character.While the acting and sets/animation are truly AMAZING, the flaws just kill the film. It's not the must-see movie of the year like it should have been, it's just a decent film.Bottom line: Baz Luhrmann should not be allowed to work on post-production with the exception of special effects. He's a great director, visionary, and writer... but man he does not get pace. If you're doubting the importance of pace, go see this movie. Maybe then you'll understand.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Totally Overrated,"Leonardo by now, agreed by most is an exceptional actor. This movie is carried primarily on his shoulders and without him this film would not be watchable. Mr Bachchan as Wolfsheim remains on your mind even after the movie has ended. Superb acting. Other actors could easily be replaced and it would not matter in this film. Carrey Mulligan as Daisy is an awful choice of lead actress. The movie could have been so much more exiting had a better actress been cast as Daisy. Wearing different head accessories and same expressions does not necessarily mean the lady can act.The choice of music is hurtful in most of the movie. In certain scenes the music overpowers the dialog. The direction is mostly alright in the 1st half and lags/stretches towards the end. Better editing would have helped. The story is interesting, but that should be obvious as it is ranked among the greatest works of American literature. All in all its a romance movie and if you are going to watch it in the cinema, see it with your better half.",,Anonymous,Romance
A film that is OK but which is essentially a disappointment,"""The Great Gatsby"" is a novel of style and substance. This film version of the book is a triumph of the former over the latter. It's not a bad movie. It's visually stunning; it's well-acted; and the soundtrack is (perhaps unsurprisingly) very good. But the plot and the characterisation seem to play second fiddle to the director's insistence on giving greater emphasis to the costumes, to the cinematography and to an overall sense of spectacle. The result is an enjoyable but ultimately shallow film that fails to interact sufficiently with the viewer. A disappointment. Read the novel instead (if you haven't already done so). 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
You could hear a pin drop in the theater after the movie ended.,"Wow, amazing. When the movie ended, you could hear a pin drop. We were all stunned and speechless because it was so good. As an English teacher who teaches this book year after year, the new movie is faithful to the story (even more than the Robert Redford version, which is incredible too). It reveals Gatsby's emotions more than that version so it's easier for readers to understand where he's coming from. Go see it! Leonardo is a perfect fit for Gatsby, BTW. Great soundtrack that works with the style of the movie. I loved Baz Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet because it was unconventional and I especially loved the soundtrack!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Roles and actors not properly balanced, A good effort though..","Well, 'The Great Gatsby' by F. Scott Fitzgerald is one story that has been given too many trials on the screen. Chronologically in 1926, 1949, 1974(won 2 Oscars & screenplay by Francis Ford Coppola) and now in 2013 by different directors. What I mean to say is, Baz Luhrmann(Director) had a lot to learn from screenplay, cast and direction of the movies previously made on this very novel. But what I saw, the choice for the actors for the roles was way weak except for Leonardo DiCaprio and Carey Mulligan.Tobey Maguire is not a narrator kind of an actor, so his role's requirement was not amply coped. It seemed like a real character is missing from the screen.However getting to the positive aspects, music of the movie had its modern touch. The way it made its place in a story plot of 1922, it is really a thing to praise. The compatibility of music with dialogs and screenplay was very accurate and carefully tailored.The Great DiCaprio (Gatsby)'s character was very strong, beautifully handled and fulfilled.Finally, the movie is a worthy effort as all of its versions before. Lets see how many Oscars nominations does it call for.My Rating : 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Scintillating Adaptation That Has Everything Right Except One! ♦ 92%,"It is a fine piece of art which cannot be replicated nor modified. It is in itself a perfect bag of glamor, magic, splendor & wonder.Leonardo DiCaprio is perfect and the only guy presently who can portray Gatsby's role as far as I can say. Supporting cast is very strong and special mention to Tobey Maguire's seamless narration & Joel Edgerton's demeanor. The women are cute & dramatic in here.The beauty of the film lies in its editing, CGI, VFX & SFX. The soundtrack, although inappropriate, supports as a good rendition. Direction & screenplay keeps you hooked, as well. Cinematography is almost perfect with fantastic rendering with the camera. I am spellbound by the writing. As far as the story is concerned, the suspense created in the initial half crosses its peak and fools around throwing it to the audience sans punch. Now I haven't read the book, so I don't know who's to blame here. That is the only thing that fell short of me rating it a perfect 10. It is 9.2, instead and most of it is because of the cast, camera work & score.So the question about Oscar - no Leo won't grab it this time either. He has performed much more well in his previous films.BOTTOM LINE: A wonderful experience as Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby delivers what it promises - a painful melodrama that is extreme.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

Overall an entertaining film,"First of all, I want to say that I have not read the book or seen the original movie for The Great Gatsby. I am writing strictly from a movie- goer's perspective.This is not one of the best films I have seen, but it is definitely not a bad film. The film immerses you into the plot and character relationships, all revolving around the same person: Jay Gatsby. I think the best casting decision in this film was having Leonardo DiCaprio as Jay Gatsby. He did an excellent job conveying Gatsby's hope, passion, and borderline desperation as he plasters on fake smiles and hosts extravagant parties to attract the attention of the woman he is in love with, and the whole film basically rides on his performance. Of course, Carey Mulligan, Joel Edgerton, and Tobey Maguire were great as well.The visuals and soundtrack are amazing. Even if you don't find this movie very good, you can't deny that it's beautiful to look at. It really pops out at you.I will say that I enjoyed the middle and end more than the beginning. There was something about the beginning that I didn't quite like. I found it strange and a little slow. Luckily, it really improved as the movie went on.Overall, this is a great film and certainly an entertaining one. Please don't go in to the theater ready to compare this film to the book, and just look at it as a film. My friend, who watched the movie with me, has read the book but pushed the book out of her mind as she watched the film, and enjoyed the film very much. This one is definitely worth a watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
