Great Concept for a Horror Film,"I just recently rewatched this film and really enjoyed it. I had forgotten how well made it is. I love the way it makes you feel tense and unsettled, but does it in a way that feels like the old school classic horror films. It's got a good pace, believable characters and feels very real. Like this could happen to you, which is why I think it works so well. It definitely is thought-provoking, and has the same kind of feeling as a John Carpenter movie. On second viewing, you start to see all the creative elements going on that all work well together. (score, choice of locations, production value, props) Some have said the idea of having a curse put on you through having sex is a little silly, but I think it's a fresh approach and like that the writer was thinking outside the box. Too many people like to bash on filmmakers, but I am here to praise people for their creativity and their hard work. It's not easy to get a film made, and I commend anybody for getting it from script to screen.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Creepy,"This is a creepy movie. It doesn't have a ton of jump scares, it isn't bloody or gory. What is has is enough creep factor to make you start looking around the room while you're watching it. Great music to help set the tone of a sense of dread. The acting is pretty good and it isn't too long. Overall a really good creepy movie that doesn't overdo it with the ""sex"" theme. There is plenty of tension and it starts at minute one and doesn't stop. There were no surprises and it was done ""right"". Definitely should be watched in a dark room at nighttime. Oh yeah, the females in the movie are really easy on the eyes. Just sayin. Worth the watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Tag, You're it","Greetings again from the darkness. Known for an endless stream of copycats and re-treads, the horror genre periodically surprises us with a dose of originality. Heck, we don't even ask horror filmmakers for anything too revolutionary  just give us something we haven't seen a few dozen times before. Writer/director David Robert Mitchell ""gets it"" and delivers a game of psycho-sexual-tag-you're-it featuring the most sinister STD ever.A definite departure from the all-too-common teen slasher films, the slow-drip terror of this one has more in common with dread and eventuality than scream-inducing terror and ""made you jump"" scares. When we first meet Jay (Maika Monroe), she is a typical pushing-twenty student who enjoys leisurely swims in her suburban backyard pool, hanging out with friends, and a healthy dating scene. Well, healthy until one evening of back seat passion with Hugh (Jake Weary) sets off the above-mentioned sinistry. See Jake has purposefully ""passed on"" some kind of affliction that attracts a death-seeking entity who slowly, but purposefully pursues its target. Supposedly the only options are to be killed or pass it on through more passion  the worst kind of ""pay it forward"".Jay is supported in her ongoing attempts to avoid the entity by her sister Kelly (Lili Sepe), her neighbor and classmate Greg (Daniel Zovatto), and Paul (Keir Gilchrist) her not-so-secret admirer who would do anything to protect her. The big catch is that only Jay can see the entity  making heroism quite elusive for her support group.Lest there be any doubt of the dire situation, director Mitchell begins the movie with a very vivid example of the likely result in being ""caught"" by the entity, and adds the score from composer Disasterpeace  an ominous throwback techno-sound that would be distracting if not so fitting. This has all the makings of a breakout role for Maika Monroe, with similarities to Jamie Lee Curtis in the original Halloween movie (1978).The low budget caused some obvious production limitations – in particular an awkward bounce from day to night and back again, and some iffy effects. However, the suburban Detroit setting provides a nice backdrop, and of special note are the Redford Theatre (est 1928) replete with its beautiful pipe organ, and the indoor swimming pool put to spectacular use in the film's climax. As long as the audience is not expecting the typical teen slasher, this creative horror film should gain an audience while putting director David Robert Mitchell on the fast track to bigger budget films.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Lets talk impact-to-budget (I/B) ratio,"That is the only way to review this film.The goal of every journeyman film-maker from the beginning of the medium to the present, is to produce something that has the most impact per dollar spent.Think of the first Night of the Living Dead. Shot on location with unknowns and local residents as extras. And the local butcher donated the entrails.Think Ginger Snaps, which started as an obscure Canadian horror flick but found an audience because of the great writing and the charisma of its stars.What we have here is another attempt to strike film gold by going for a high I/B ratio.A small cast. Minimal special effects. No special sets or backgrounds.A really clever idea, sort of a take off on the Ring which itself was a riff off a Japanese horror classic.So what's the bottom line? Well done for what you get. Writer/Director Mitchell has a heck of a career ahead of him. Several ""jump out of your seat"" moments. And also a plot riff which you just know was contributed by some of the frat boys who crowd-sourced the film -- ""you can get rid of the curse if you just sleep with someone, fast!""The bad news? It is not in the same class as Living Dead or Ginger. There are lulls. There are gaps. There are times you start to wish you have purchased the extra large popcorn and coke.Great career launch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Should Have Been A Short Film,"Does anyone else wish this had been a short film? The mood and atmosphere are so thick for the first half hour or 45 minutes and then it just trucks along for the rest of the movie without a lot of energy. Fantastic cinematography and music, but the characters are pretty limp and it's hard to care what happens to them. Once they go into the investigation part of the film, everything falls apart and it becomes a chore.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Unique Plot, Poor Execution, BUT Has Charm","The plot I found amusing at first, as I had no idea what to think of a curse passed by intercourse. After giving it a try, It was a good concept. However, there were quite a few parts that I didn't care for, which I find common in horror/suspense movies. Characters make decisions that are just unlikely, in my opinion. Unfortunately, it seems this genre often requires people to make silly choices, or some nonsensical things to happen, to build suspense? or just because? Nonetheless, I call it poor execution.I did love the cinematography, the fact that it does have an 80s horror feel (especially the music/soundtrack)and the acting was pretty good.I like the fact that this movie is thought provoking, and doesn't spell everything out. So, you have to pay attention to catch or understand some of the story line. Yet, there are some things that are just unexplained, and maybe I just need to watch it again....but it wasn't that good that I would probably do that anytime soon.I have seen a lot of reviews that speak very highly of this movie, but I kinda feel its overrated. Much like the Babadook. It is deserving of a descent score but definitely does not come close to a nearly 7/10 stars. Perhaps, its somewhat obscure plot, and/or story line? Nonetheless, its definitely worth a watch whether it leaves you frustrated, or intrigued, I think that's kinda the charm of this flick.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
return of the real horror,"Finally a real horror in a long time! No more bloody, slasher crap. This is how the really scary movies were made. Suspense and fear are created by great cinematography and music.The pace of the movie is slow and almost no to few special effects are present. I surely hope that this movie hails the return of the great horror genre: we are scared of the unknown and not violence for the sake of it.All the young actors are promising, they really pulled it off. Kudos to the director who also wrote the script, I am looking forward to his next movie.Go see it, you won't regret it!",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Modern Horror Classic,"Inspired by 70's and 80's horror, it follows is a refreshing psychological horror film with a simple premise and a chilling concept. The cinematography is electrifying, every shot is beautiful and the score holds brilliance, it carries a very obvious John Carpenter vibe to it. The tension is raw, avoiding cheap jump scares and relies on music. Its eerie atmosphere is extremely effective keeping you inches above your seat for the majority of the runtime. The characters are interesting, providing depth and emotional attachment, most modern horror films seem to forget the importance of character development, its nice to see the genre hasn't completely lost it yet. There are several jumps scares, but they work, as they are not carried with unnecessary piecing music jolts but with the use of disturbing and sudden imagery.The only errors I could detect were the unconventional editing style, the transitions were a little dodgy lacking fluency, this left the film to appear choppy at times but this flaw can be easily forgiven. Its outstanding cinematography and soundtrack make up for this. The film leaves a daunting stain of disturbing after effects that follow you for a long while, with a constant reminder to always check behind your back. An exceptional low budget indie horror film, strongly recommend.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Another Hugely Over-Hyped ""Clever"" Film","I was looking forward to seeing this film since I saw the trailers for it as it looked to be a very creepy, tense, clever, and atmospheric horror (which is what I enjoy watching). I was actually eager to watch it and there's not been many films recently I can say that about. Unfortunately, I was hugely disappointed after watching it as It Follows is a MASSIVE let down, and I can't actually believe that it has been rated so highly.Now, people will probably say ""Oh, you don't get it"" or ""you don't like it because there was no blood & guts""...you know, the typical childish responses you get when you criticise a ""clever"" film. Well, I'm not thick, and a horror doesn't have to have a ton of gore for me to enjoy, but this was just a very poor telling of what could - and should - have been a much, much creepier film.It Follows started off well enough, setting up what I thought would be a good tone & atmosphere for the rest of the movie. It didn't pan out that way because while the tone & atmosphere were decent enough (in part), it was severely lacking in a lot of other areas such as...1) Acting: this was VERY poor, and after the scenes with Annie at the start of the movie, some of the acting was less than convincing. Almost B-movie esk at times.2) Thrills: a complete minimal amount of this and it was more boring than thrilling.3) Scare/creep factor: definitely NOT a scary film and only two or three moments from throughout were creepy and gave off an uneasy feel.4) Pace: absolutely none. The film just crawled along at snail's pace from start to end.Oh, and speaking of the ending - what a huge disappointment that also was. I detest movies that end the way It Follows ended, but in a way it was spot on for this film as it capped off a perfectly over-hyped, slow, boring, and disappointing ""horror"".Honestly, don't be taken in by the hype surrounding this film, but if you decide to watch it then good luck. I just hope you enjoy it more than what I did.",3.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Really?,How is this scary? The only thing that scared me was how long this trash was!,1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"It may be slow, but it is not dumb","It Follows is like a breath of fresh air in the horror genre. First of all the premise is quite unorthodox and interesting. Secondly it provides a fine blend of psychological horror along with a few jump scares as well. The somewhat ambiguous approach of the film though may face a divided response. The horror element here is something which is referred to only as ""it"" and ""it"" follows only one target person at a time. A person becomes a target through sexual encounter with a person who is currently a target. Thus one can pass the curse of ""it"" to a person by having sex with that person. Interesting right? There isn't much light shed into the origin of ""it"" but as the film goes on we learn slowly about the functioning of ""it"" but never its origin. The ending is ambiguous and didn't work so well for me this time but considering most of the film relies on ambiguity(ie.how the audience interprets) the ending is fine.It Follows is a slow burning film, so have patience and let the plot and suspense build up. The best aspect I felt was the haunting soundtrack and the strong cinematography. It totally establishes the gloomy atmosphere. The script could have revealed a bit more about ""it"" but some open ends are fine for me (might not be for all). There were many loose ends I felt. There may not be any popular faces still the acting was quite believable for an horror film.Another similar recent horror movie comes to mind is ""The Babadook"". Both of these are thought provoking Psychological horror films unlike the rehashed, unoriginal, jumpy and predictably bland horror films we are getting these days. If you liked ""The Babadook"" I suggest you don't miss this one. It has its flaws but I would appreciate it for its originality. If you were totally sucked into the film's atmosphere and story then for days you will feel like checking around if someone is following when you are alone. This low budget indie film I believe will be a cult horror classic.Rating: [3.5/5]",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A simple but unique idea that takes audiences back to the classics,"From the music to the wardrobe to the set pieces to the in-camera zooms, this horror film takes us back to the 1970s and 1980s.But that isn't the only thing that takes us back to the classics - it's also the way the story is told. We are not expected to be scared only by a barrage of jump scares or expensive CGI ghosts. Instead, we are constantly filled with the fear and dread that something is out there, lurking, slowly but inevitably approaching...This is the way that classic horror films were presented, and it is what makes it actually good. The premise is simple, but it is interesting enough to catch your attention and hold it throughout. It stays with you after the credits roll, and you will likely talk about it in the days after you see it.Although the supporting characters could have been developed more, I have few complaints about this movie. If you want to see a simple - but unique and stylistic - horror movie, this is for you.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
It Follows (2014),"It Follows is a horror film made for horror fans, and it's about time one of those came around again.This is a movie that was light on the jump scares, which is a delightful change of pace. In the past few years more and more horrors have relied on jump scares to make up for the true scariest part of any horror film, the sense of dread. Dread is felt in this movie almost immediately because it combines so well with the tone, another forgotten about ingredient in horrors.There is no real way to explain the plot of this film without it coming across like a more twisted game of ""tag,"" which played a part in exactly how many people I could talk into seeing it after the mixed feelings from the trailer. That being said, the film breaks a lot of the norms set by today's ""scary"" films. This is a movie that knows what it's doing, and its main concern is to make the audience feel as if they are a part of the experience with the sense of realism. With the enemy being as far-fetched as it may come across in conversation, it's easy to get caught up in the surroundings of the characters looking for ""it."" Having to watch over the characters' shoulders throughout the movie makes it all the more frightening when something IS seen, and there's never a sense of safety.It Follows takes a good deal from the greats in the horror genre, namely Halloween. I recall a great deal of times thinking ""wait, that was in Halloween,"" where the background is scarier than what could pop up out of the shadows with some loud sound surrounding it. The score in this movie is simply unnerving and remarkable. It adds to the tone and creates an even more frightening and uncomfortable feeling when ""it"" has appeared. It was as if I were watching a great Carpenter movie in the theater, and it's been a great while since such a possessing and haunting score has come along. It truly is like another character in the movie, but used so well it adds to already-present uneasy feeling that one has while watching.It Follows delivers where other recent horrors have failed, it creates memorable moments and characters which the audience feels for. Also unlike recent films, there is no way to predict what direction the movie will take, and there is finally not a completely predictable ending. Horror movies have taken easy ways out and desensitized the audience throughout by having things jump on screen which make the ""big moments"" feel insignificant and forgettable because audiences have been jumped at so much they just don't care anymore and they're ready to see ""the monster die"" (I'm oversimplifying of course, but the intent is clear). Meanwhile, this film has (quietly) some of the most memorable terrifying sequences of the decade thus far.Of course, I'd have a useless review if I didn't address the performances of It Follows. All of the other elements I've brought up in the review were almost created by, and greatly assisted by, the acting. If the acting is bad (which is a common thing in horrors), then it's hard to make anything else believable, which distances the audiences and takes away a lot of the sense of terror. The acting is so real by the cast that they make this plot seem genuine. They're not the usual teens that the audience can scream ""why did they not think of.."" or ""I would've.."" at. They address the horrifying situations as real people would, they're not magically filled with some convenient insight and they're not face-palmingly idiotic, either.In a year filled with soon-to-be many blockbusters and money makers, It Follows will be remembered by many as one of the best of the year. It is a film that embodies all things horror, and pays great homage to what made people adore the genre. Like a good brand of medication, without the side-effects, It Follows is what the genre needed and is, to me, one of the best horror films of the decade to this point. With all of the key ingredients in place, we've got a great film here. 9/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A film which you can't leave behind,"A simple but clever premise which draws upon horror traditions, especially the work of John Carpenter, is sustained throughout the movie to produce a memorable and tense 100 minutes.The subject of sex, sexuality, disease, the transition into adulthood (you sense the director believes too early transition) and relationships between friends and family are played out against the backdrop of a once great Detroit. The films opening scenes summarise the movie perfectly and convey the central themes of the movie expertly.Essentially a horror movie with a strong idea and 'conservative' message its strength lies in the realistic portrayal of teenagers, their relationships and what they think is the right thing to do faced with the horror that faces them and to an extent cannot escape.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
scary afff,"It Follows is one of the most unique and unsettling horror films of the last decade. The premise is simple yet chilling-after a sexual encounter, the protagonist Jay is cursed with a mysterious entity that relentlessly follows her. This creature, which can take the form of anyone, walks slowly but constantly toward its target. There's no way to outrun it forever, and if it catches up to you, it kills you. What makes the movie so terrifying is the ever-present threat that never rests. It's a brilliant concept because it taps into a deep, primal fear of being pursued.What stands out about It Follows is how it builds tension. There are no cheap jump scares; instead, it relies on creating an atmosphere of dread. You'll often find yourself scanning the background, looking for figures slowly creeping toward the camera, which keeps you on edge the entire time. The 80s-inspired synth soundtrack amplifies the eerie vibe, making the whole experience feel dreamlike and nightmarish at the same time. By the end of the movie, you'll be left with a lingering sense of paranoia, questioning if someone-or something-is slowly walking toward you.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
It Follows Through,"Where can I start with this? Where is the jump-off point as not to devolve into nitpicking and a clever play on words with the title to conclude? How can I not over-analyze this one? It Follows is thoroughly disturbing and fairly well-done, but has some flaws on the more technical side of things.I was excited to see this movie because the lone TV-spot I saw gave so little information, while hinting at insane scares. The description I found online just said that ""after a strange sexual encounter, a girl feels she's being stalked."" Is there really more to know before going in? No, and I recommend knowing nothing more. The trailers at the start of the movie had Insidious 3 and the Poltergeist remake and something else about a family in a house and things happen to the kid. I can't help but be bored by a trailer that lets you know all the scares in the movie will rely upon a demon hand's ability to come out of any object. Or an otherwise inanimate object moving at someone. Those movies tell us exactly what's happening. It's not scary. It Follows tells us little enough to understand what's going on, but still be creeped the hell out.There's an 80's synth in the soundtrack. The era of the film is indeterminable. This movie is stylized, as more movies should be. For all the style and scare, there are some technical issues. I noticed that fades were excessively used in the editing. Sometimes even with transitional shots that weren't related to each other. The soundtrack had some awkward, sudden starts and stops, too. This is really nitpicky of me and most people won't mind, but you can't deny that it is distracting.I don't scare easily with movies. My third parent was the television. I'm desensitized enough to be bored by horror. This movie didn't make me defecate or anything, but it was unsettling enough to fight off the disappointment I often expect with a movie that advertises itself as horror. It then went even further with me by having some really horrific visuals in a couple scenes.Despite technical problems, It Follows is a cleverly done horror movie. If I can't see a 10/10 Oscar winner, I want to see stuff like this. They moved right along once ""It"" appears and didn't let up. 7.5/10 to this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
It's not that original,"Everybody claims this film is so orginal. It's really just The Ring but with sex instead of a video tape. And The Ring was just a chain letter made into a horror film. Not orginal, not scary, and a major step back for the horror movie genre.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Even through shortcomings and mixed ideas, the film's heart is always evident","Right before I saw David Robert Mitchell's ""It Follows"" at my local theater, I was greeted with previews for forthcoming supernatural horror films like ""Before I Wake,"" ""Insidious: Chapter 3,"" and the remake of ""Poltergeist,"" all of which could've probably taken clips from one another and I wouldn't have even noticed. This is how basic and thoroughly unimpressive horror has gotten over the last few years and why we need to support films like this one. Is ""It Follows"" worthy of such praise along the lines of ""the best horror film of the decade,"" ""one of the scariest films ever made,"" and so forth? Sadly, no. I sometimes think critics either speak too soon or simply want to see their name stamped before advertisements, claiming such outlandish assertions that could not only be disingenuous to their actual viewpoints but, in turn, set unrealistic expectations up for films that leave the audiences disappointed.Make no mistake however, for ""It Follows"" is definitely worth seeing and is bound to be one of the strongest horror films of the year. Even if we consider its few shortcomings and some instances of serious monotony, I'm more than happy to support this little festival darling and commend it for what it does well. As I stated, just before you settle into watch the film, you'll more than likely see previews for horror films made by people and studios who have simply stopped trying to make good, memorable films and copped out at settling for mediocrity. Here's to a film that went left when most of the pack went right.After an opening sequence that hooks you from how absurd it is, we focus on Jay and Hugh (Maika Monroe and Jake Weary), a couple of twentysomethings out on a movie date. In the theater, Hugh notices a woman in a yellow dress, who apparently cannot be seen by Jay or anyone else, and orders her out of the theater. When the two are alone in their car, following sex, Hugh takes a chloroform rag to Jay, knocking her unconscious and ties her to a wheelchair. It's here when Hugh informs Jay that something has been following him for a long time but only he can see it. It often appears to be a naked woman, but can take the form of anyone, even the people you know and love, and passing it on occurs by having sex with another person. The soul will follow whomever is affected by its curse at walking pace, and if it catches up to Jay, it will kill her, and proceed to go after Hugh.""It Follows"" is an early candidate for one of the most beautifully shot films of the year, and more than likely to be the most beautiful looking horror film of 2015. It has a delightful moodiness to its cinematography, captured crisply by Mike Gioulakis, as it uses a dark purple, gray, and teal color palette to look simultaneously uninviting and immersing. Colors like blood red boom with the feel and visual power that echoes Dario Argento, almost like an homage to ""Suspiria"" in look and feel. The story moves with the kind of slowburn intensity we've seen from horror directors John Carpenter and Wes Craven, or even Ti West, if we're talking more contemporary.The real aesthetic treat here is how Disasterpeace's music combines with the film's cinematography. The use of heavy, bass-rattling synthesizers makes the film look and operate like a horror film of the 1980's to the point where looming tension becomes almost overcompensating in the way it appears to be taking over the entire film. The synths are loud and unsettling, and at times, can really propel the film to a suspenseful climax. Other times, however, they are obnoxious for the sake of being obnoxious and slightly disrupt the tonality Mitchell sets by making the film operate on a low-key playing field.While the plot appears confusing, ""It Follows"" is surprising in how little there really is to it. Teenagers walk around, run from ostensibly nothing, comfort one another through sex and aimless conversations, and assure one another that it will all be okay amongst discussing different ways to combat this force. It's almost like Larry Clark made another horror film, as the tonal shifts feel like they're almost part of a coming of age film in addition to a horror film. These shifts aren't bad, however, as they function nicely to the film's more suspenseful elements by slowing the action down but never coming to a grinding halt. There's an unevenness, but it's not made as apparent as one would presume.I find this is largely because of how well everyone works together here. With Gioulakis evoking consuming cinematography, Disasterpeace emphasizing a score that's alive and intense, Mitchell taking screen writing and directorial risks for his genre (employing long, clean shots that provide for a beautiful sense of location), ""It Follows"" is sound on almost all fronts. The only negatives that arise from the film are occasional structural burdens, or the fact that, towards the end of the film, its idea seems to change to fit the situation and create something unexpected.Nonetheless, ""It Follows"" is a film to see and support, for it's one of those many opportunities we have as consumers that we keep blowing to see quality entertainment. It's almost like voting in elections; vote now and hopefully experience something that will satisfy you in the future. Even if ""It Follows"" isn't the perfect gem some have claimed, I'd rather see a pretty good independent horror film than a mediocre or downright abysmal carbon-copy that's spit into 3,000+ theaters with nothing but money in mind. There's heart in ""It Follows"" and that, at all times, is evident.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
American Gothic ghost story,"There have been a lot of teen horror flicks, enough for a few smarter films to play gently with the genre. Here, death stalks from the middle distance.The film specifically places itself in a strange non time period that appears to mix a post 2007 urban collapse with the 1980s symbolism. The quiet centre lets you anticipate the moments of strange horror, as the teenagers work through their restless angst. While the formula is set in stone, it is kept on such an even pace that you quickly fall under the spell.An engaging study of the impossibility yet inevitability of what follows us all.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A solid film,"While I am not sure this film is as advertised, ""the best horror film in a decade,"" or how one would measure such a thing, my wife and I both enjoyed (I am not sure that is the right word) this film very much.I think too often people confuse horror with slasher. Now, I am all about a nice Friday the 13th marathon, or the original Texas Chainsaw massacre, or even Halloween (1978 version), but these are not so much horror as slasher films. I think the distinction is important before one even begins to determine how they feel about a movie. Same thing with people who conflate a thriller like say, North By Northwest (a little old school, but hopefully you take my point) with a horror film. As my wife and I sat in the car trying to find the right adjective to describe this film, we landed on disturbing. The music was freaky, the concept of being pursed endlessly, any statement of sexual promiscuity the filmmaker might be trying to make, was all disturbing in our minds.I would place this film with movies like Sinister, which my wife and I also ""enjoyed;"" best seen on a big screen with a massive tub of popcorn, holding the wife close.I get that some people hate it; somebody always hates a film, song, TV show, play, book etc, while others think it is a perfect 10.

A chill will run down your spine and you will love it !!!,"It Follows was a different horror movie with unique experience and one of its kind. The movie had limited release in US and was distributed by first time studio Radius-TWC. It grew well thanks to strong word-of- mouth and that made me curious to watch the film.It follows tells the story of a young woman who gets duped by her boyfriend after he passes a supernatural element which makes her followed by dead people in an attempt to kill her.First time director David Robert Mitchell does a fabulous job in creating haunting atmosphere from the beginning which creates tension and suspense. The movement of the film is slow and it takes time to build upon of each character. David succeeds in pumping up the adrenalin with what-will-happen-next surprise coupled with perfect background score and brilliant camera work. The screenplay is crispy but does falter in the 2nd half. The abrupt ending might sway away few audience. Also, it could have been explained what exactly is following and how it began ( may be they will come up with a prequel later). Nevertheless, the applauding camera work , haunting and yet tuneful background music by Rich Vreeland are icing on the cake. The story is definitely interesting with few spooky moments though not very scary but will hold your attention. Performances by new comers are worth-mentioning especially Maika Monroe.This one is sure going to be loved by ones who crave for a good horror movie.

"Hysterically bad, someone slept with the reviewers","Was on cable and came to the IMDb for reviews. Shockingly good rating all around. The story seemed ridiculous and watching just five minutes made me laugh that this ever got funded. The writers came up with yet another dumb derivative of the ""if you do this, the thing will stalk you."" But hey... let's make this happen if you have sex!!! People will want to see the movie for the naked action!!!! Well... get ready for disappointment all the way around.The writers didn't bother to create any story. None. They came up with this concept and basically said ""let's try to keep this crap going for like 90+ minutes"" without bothering to explain what is going on, no reasons, no rules, no boundaries. And that's a good thing because there is no explanation for what goes on because then they'd have to make sense of it all. So why does ""it"" follow in super slow motion to make sure that victims can get away in time to infect another person to keep the story going. Well... except of course if you want to tease with a shocking scene that is enough to induce laughs (you'll know it when you see it.)The only thing this movie is good for is to show young teenagers that premarital sex is bad bad bad.

Snuck up on me,"I went into It Follows completely blind. Thought it was moving a little slow so I paused to check ratings online which encouraged me to continue watching and I'm really glad I did! 3/4 of the way through I had to turn it off and go for a walk because I live alone and was getting really freaked out. I'm still not sure exactly what the end plan was for the characters' pool set up but it was a creative and adrenaline-inducing scene. Technically, it did conclude with an open ending, which I normally can't stand, but it still felt like an acceptable resolution. It was a very minimalistic movie overall, but packed with quality.Also - I live in Michigan. As I'm watching I think, ""that neighborhood looks familiar..."" Yeah, I didn't know it was filmed in the Detroit area prior to watching so that added to the creep factor as well.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Art house horror,"You ejaculate it follows, if you seen the movie you would understand that.The story is about a 19-year-old, should be spending Autumn worrying about school, boys and spending week-ends at the lake. But after a seemingly innocent sexual experience she finds herself unable to shake the feeling that something is stalking her. As strange visions begin to plague her, she turns to her friends to help escape this horror - if she can.It Follows was a horror movie that I've been waiting for a while now. As I'm speaking right now this movie is rated 96% on Rotten Tomatoes and critics have been calling this ""The scariest movie of all time"", says some movie magazine. The movie was getting hyped up and I wanted to see what was all the fuss about and after seeing the movie I can say that It Follows isn't the scariest movie of all time, but it's still a great horror movie with a lot to like from it (even the soundtrack).The director of this movie David Robert Mitchell is unknown directed to me as I haven't seen any of his Previous movies and It Follows is basically the first movie I've seen from him and a great one. David Robert Mitchell directed the movie unsettling and beautiful at the same time adding the art house look and feel to a horror movie which made the tone of the movie creepy and haunting with a throw back of classic horror nostalgic. I will be keeping my eye out for his next movie because David did a excellent job directing and crafting a horror nostalgia, work one David Robert Mitchell.I remembered seeing Maika Monroe in last year's movie The Guest and now she's in It Follows and she delivered a great and stunning performance. In my opinion I think this is the movie that she really stands out from being good to outstanding. Now this isn't a spoiler to the movie but the scene I'm about to talk about involves Maika Monroe acting and why she was brilliant in this movie and that's when she first encounters the first follower and it's a old creepy looking women that start's walking towards her and the scene itself is very terrifying, Maika Monroe looked like she was scared and confused of what's going on and to be honest that's the face I will pull if so one started following me with that creepy look on their faces. Maika Monroe was pure outstanding in this movie and I can't wait to see more of her talent in the late future.The soundtrack to this movie is hands down some of the best horror soundtrack of the year, it's right up there with The Guest and other movies like Drive and Under The Skin. It's got a nostalgia of horror to it and a big tribute to John Carpenter's movies. I listened to the soundtrack more times then I excepted, that's how amazing this masterpiece of horror music should be done.The movie's tone is what made the movie more effective to me as the movie doesn't have loud stupid jump scars or any cliché annoying characters to bring the movie down, no the movie allows on it's setting, it's atmosphere and the performances to make the movie effective or you like to call it frighting. Don't go into this movie expecting a popcorn horror flick with all the clichés you can check off the list in your head, the movie isn't like that has it's different then most horror movies.Now for the problems: I already talked about how amazing Maika Monroe acting was in the movie but the other actors who played her friends wasn't all that good I mean if you have to compare it to Maika Monroe performance to these they didn't do so great. These a scene in the movie were one of them get's shot in the leg by accident and oh my god they reaction to getting shot was freaking dreadful and such bad acting it took me out of the movie a little bit, but luckily Maika Monroe was on screen most of the time in that scene so she pretty much saved it.Don't worry I won't spoil the ending for you but let just say that the movie doesn't end on a good note, it just kind of ends just like that. It was like the season finale to The Sopranos it just ends like that and I'm there all like ""Was that it?"".Overall It Follows is a great horror movie and I like how different and original it is. Is the movie over hyped? well yeah since critics are false advertising it saying it's the best thing that every happened and people are excepting to be scared out of their minds over this movie and leaving disappointed, well the movie didn't scary me but it left me thinking and it did have it's chilling and creepy moments that got under my skin a lot of times. If you haven't seen the movie yet go check it out but please don't go in thinking it's going to be scariest movie every made, just expect a good horror movie that's clever and unsettling.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Avoid this pretentious, godawful abortion of a horror movie.","I went into this movie excited to be scared. My roommate and his girlfriend had gone to see it and told me it was genuinely scary; the critics were raving about its originality, and I was ready for a tense, edgy, chilling experience.What a sloppy, stupid, pretentious mess this movie was. What a waste of my time, my money and my life this movie was. Ignore the people saying that it's getting bad reviews only because it didn't have gore, explosions or jump scares; it's getting bad reviews because it barely qualifies as a movie it's so listless and insipid.I'm sure by now the trailer's gotten around, so saying it's about a girl essentially ""catching"" a ghostly STD doesn't really count as a spoiler; I hope it also doesn't count as a spoiler to announce on here that that's it. That's all it's about. There is not character arc, there is no story, nothing. The characters are given absolutely no background aside from ""sister,"" ""friend,"" ""male friend"" and ""neighbor."" They mumble their dialogue, maybe to try to make it seem more important, or maybe because they're just terrible actors, either way it doesn't matter, this movie could have literally been shot with mannequins for how stiff the acting is.But let me come to the biggest disappointment in a movie that is composed entirely of disappointment and failure: this movie is simply not scary. Not at all. Not in the least. It has the atmosphere of a godawful indie movie, which is too bad, because the premise of a following curse that you can't get rid of could have actually been extremely creepy and unsettling. Instead, I can count the creepy moments on one hand while I light a cigarette.To sum up in tl;dr form: No story Bad acting Bad writing Waste of a great premise Waste of time Waste of money Avoid at all costs",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"An Advanced Teenage Horror Film: Expertly-Crafted, Psycho-Sexual Drama","David Robert Mitchell's It Follows cannily takes the torrential world of the contemporary American teenager and uses it to bring the horror film back to its visceral roots—those dirty little tendrils that obscure the collective fears of our modern society. Today's teenagers live in a bigger, more accessible world — a world in which the idea of the masked bogeyman lurking in the backseat has become clichéd to the point of being used as a Geico commercial. This is a truth that Mitchell understands completely, and his dissection of the paranoia and emotional detachment that plagues our suburbs is the genesis of this fresh interpretation of the horror genre. Following a sexual encounter with an older man, Jay (Maika Monroe) finds that she is being followed by a malevolent entity that will only leave her alone if she sleeps with someone else. This terrifying scenario throws Jay and her friends into a nightmarish game of trying to keep one step ahead of the relentless creature. Cinematographer Michael Gioulakis captures the unyielding dread that permeates the narrative with wide shots that evoke the eerie perspective of a hunter stalking its prey. It Follows feels like a natural progression of the teenage horror film—one that uses the complexity of today's young people as a canvas for some expertly-crafted, psycho-sexual drama.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Not Perfect But One Of The Better Horror Films In Recent Years,"Yea this movie had many inconsistencies and convenient situations, characters taking unrealistic actions and many things that needed explanations, but comparatively to other horror movies that were produced in recent years this film was actually creepy and kinda scary. The acting wasn't the best nor was it the worst I've seen, so I guess it worked just fine. The atmosphere was on point which was a big plus.Overall if you can ignore the logical ""flaws"" you will be entertained, I surely was and it was scary for me. I certainly think this is one of the better horror movies in recent years, give this a shot if you are a horror fan.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The best modern horror I have seen,"I LOVED this movie.
The suspense, the strangely satisfying mish mash of 80s-90s style of soundtrack and set design, mixed with modern tech that the characters have.

A very different ""coming of age tale"" if I have ever seen one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
True horror fans will love it,"It Follows is the most refreshingly terrifying horror movie I've seen in the last year.The movie begins on an exceptionally terrifying note, opening with a teenage girl fleeing from her house. She's running from someone - or something - but what? We have no earthly idea, but her fear infects us with an overwhelming and inexplicable terror. This opening scene sets the bar high for the rest of the movie, and we know that we will receive no mercy.Director David Robert Mitchell knows what he's doing here. He knows what scares you, and executes it perfectly. With camera-work that can only be described as ""surreal"", we feel as if we are in a 100 minute long nightmare. The worst nightmares are the ones you know you can't escape from - you can't move fast enough, no matter how hard you try. At the heart of the horror film lies this simple, terrible truth: You cannot escape death.In this nightmare, an inexplicable terror is following the protagonist. It's not a matter of WHAT is following her - per se - but rather WHEN it arrives. The inevitability of its coming is by far the most terrifying aspect of this movie.These are actors you've never seen before, yet characters you know personally. The music score is one you've never heard before, but one you will never forget. This movie is a nightmare that you can't wake up from, and it is scary as Hell. You might as well be tied to your seat, forced to watch as an unstoppable, grotesque, demon-like entity walks slowly toward you...closer...closer...and closer.This is how horror movies should be made. Fear should ""follow"" you, not ""surprise"" you. It Follows is easily one of the most terrifying horror movies of the decade. I recommend it 100%.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A paranoid slow burner,It Follows was a film that came out the start of the elevated horror movement. It earned a horror film that earned near-universal acclaim on its release. And it was a solid and effective horror film that evoked Ringu because it was about an entity that's transferred to people. In It Follows' case it was about a supernatural STD.It Follows was a slow burn of film and what it did well was the scene of paranoia the main character suffered from. It was eerie constantly and there were some great horror moments when the entity attacked Jay.Disasterpiece's score deserves a lot of praise because it added to the atmosphere.,7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Weird and intense,"Quickie Review:Jay (Maika Monroe) is a high school girl who goes on a date that ends with a seemingly innocent sexual encounter. Soon after she finds herself being followed by a supernatural entity. She must find a way to escape this curse before it leads to her death. It Follows, is not the typical horror movie that depends on jump scares. Instead it uses a combination of atmosphere and soundtrack to deliver some really intense and chilling visuals. This is not a movie for everyone, with a fair share of weirdness that might put off certain viewers. On the other hand, the unique tone, sound design and visuals, caters to people who are aching for an original film in the horror genre.Full Review:One of my favorite genres of film is horror, but I'm not blind to the fact that this genre is filled with movies of poor quality. Just look at last year with horrible releases such as Annabelle and Ouija. Then again when there is a good horror movie like Babadook, it can induce a roller-coaster of emotional reactions. I had high expectations for It Follows and personally it surpassed it.When it comes to these films I prefer to be frightened by the things I can't see, playing off of the psychological terror of the characters. That was very well done by Maika Monroe as the lead. Quite frequently horrors have the dumb blonde who sleeps around, a cheap cliché that easily fits this premise. However, Monroe's character was more than this typical cliché. She's just an average teenage girl who happens to be a victim of unfortunate circumstances. You see how conflicted she is on how to handle this curse, whether to pass it on, involve her friends, or simply give up. Another horror cliché that is turned on its head is the topic of sex. Most of the time sex scenes are just added in scary films to attract a certain type of audience, but in It Follows sex is an integral part of the story. There is something deeply terrifying about being haunted for a very personal act. A supernatural entity infringing upon your most private moments is disturbing to say the least. Suffice to say It Follows is a horrible date movie.Jump scares in scary movies are like shaky cams in action films, I absolutely hate them. The reason why I hate jump scares so much is because it diffuses all the built up tension in a scene, forcing that build up to start all over again. Thankfully I can only remember one time when It Follows used that trick. Rest of the time it was the atmosphere and the soundtrack that sent chills down my spine. Even when there was nothing happening the 80's synth music kept up that level of intensity. I also really liked the cinematography of the movie. From the very first scene with a fixed rotating camera, you know you are in for a very distinctive cinematic look. That distinct look is also there with the setting of the movie. You don't really know in which era this movie takes place. The characters will be watching black and white cheap sci- fi's on a bulky CRT TV while at the same time using an e-book to read off poetry. It's these little things that bring almost a fantastical element to the story, making the supernatural aspect fit perfectly into this world.With all that said the big question is, was it scary? I'd say yes, because I was noticing every person that passed by me on the street while I biked back home in the night at almost 1:30am. I'd only caution that you be aware of the different tone of the movie, because if you are not expecting that (like my friend didn't) it can be jarring at first. In the end even if you happen to not like the movie it'd be hard to deny the originality of the movie. I loved It Follows for being totally weird while still being interesting and intense.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Remember ""Night of the Demon""","The idea of passing a curse from one person to another brings to mind the M. R. James short story, ""Casting the Runes"" which was later made into an excellent horror movie called ""Curse of the Demon."" In it, the cursed had to pass on a piece of paper with archaic runes and it had to be accepted willingly by the new victim. In this take on the theme, one gains the curse by having sex with the cursed. They are then ""followed"" by evil entities that only they can see. The movie starts with a girl leaving her house in her nightie, taking off in her car, and sitting on a beach, making one last call to her parents. We then see her mutilated body. The principle character, a pretty young girl, has a relationship with a strange young man. One night, they have sex, and afterward, he chloroforms her and binds her up. He then warns her that he has passed the curse on to her. This sets all kinds of stuff in motion. It is an enjoyable horror movie, given the premise, but there are some plot holes dealing with oversight for these kids and the craziness that surrounds them. They seem to move through their world freely. Also, an event at a swimming pool and its motivation are a little contrived, considering their lack of knowledge. Still, it does a great job of presenting constant psychological threat as the young woman tries to free herself.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
At last a great horror film that's not from Asia,"First of all, I'm an amateur of the genre: I watch dozens of horror films a year. It is quite a frustrating habit: very rarely you run into something remotely satisfying, and even more rarely into something that actually scares you. But this has been a very good year so far: first I found Lake Mungo, now this extraordinary gem. It's hard to say anything about it without spoiling the experience on some level. First of all: forget about what you've read as taglines or synopsis on IMDb: nothing of that will give you a clue of what this film is about. Sex is the least of the matters -and by no means this is, as I read here, a moralist or anti-sex film. Please, don't look for such direct and basic metaphors, this is not a high school class. Also forget about the possible goofs or contradictions pointed out in other reviews: would you look for coherence in David Lynch? or in a nightmare? Same indulgence should apply here. What matters are the images that this film succeeds to create, and that will linger in your mind much afterwards. The film avoids all the usual clichés that were just around the corner: no dilemma about the protagonist being or not being crazy, no romantic sub-plot, no one screaming at the camera all-of-the-sudden, no blood, no violence, no FX. Fiends are people -only very awkward people. The horror here is of the most subtle kind: nothing that you can't avoid by running away or even by walking fast. Three images kept ringing in my head while I watched it: 1) the twin girls at the end of the corridor in The Shining (the cinematography is almost an homage to Kubrick, with visually stunning symmetric shots and striking music), 2) a scene of the underrated Tsukamoto's Nightmare Detective 2 (the film also draws from the bone of Asian horror, leaving aside the already boring girls with hair on their faces -namely, the reference to a urban myth, and a story that takes place exclusively among youngsters), 3) Robert Aickman's story The Fetch. I cannot reveal here the reasons why, but I will tell you this: the fiend here has that slow, inexorable, despairing way of approaching you that horror has in nightmares. This film will be a classic of the genre, and I definitely will be following David Mitchell's efforts from now on.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Original!,"A very original idea well done!Nothing wrong with the writing, it has some of the most creative camera angles I've seen in a long time which is where this movie has it's originality along with the very clever idea of the ""threat"" in the movie.I personally feel like the movie was a bit too predictable at times and the acting could've been better but this is a must-see for any horror fans who doesn't want the typical half-assed slasher with stupid blondes stumbling over nothing.High quality film but could still have been better",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
This film was very suspenseful and had a great premise.,"It Follows is a small horror and suspense film vaguely about a haunted S.T.D and the young woman that has to avoid the inevitable consequences of a supernatural presence. There is a small set of rules that the horror behind the film follows. There is a being that targets a single person and stalks them at a slow, yet constant pace. This presence never stops, and cannot be killed. It has the ability to change its appearance at will to any person it finds suitable. It is possible to change its target by having its current target have sex with someone else, making the other person the new target. Only the current target and those who have been the target before can see this being. Once the presence reaches the target, stuff will happen and it will then go back down the line and stalk the previous target. The beauty of this concept is that the protagonist is never safe and always on the run. This gives the entire film a natural drive and constant sense of dread. While this is technically a horror film I wouldn't call it scary. It was very suspenseful and I was on the edge of my seat for most of the film, but I didn't have any trouble sleeping after I saw it. The over all structure of the film is built upon small scenes that jump from location to location with a heavy metaphorical overtone and lots of silent and subtle moments. While some might call the film slow and jumbled. I found it's slowness to be an effective building of tension and its many short scenes make predicting when this being would actually show up very difficult. This sense of overwhelming fear is made even more effective by slow, yet long takes and some really good cinematography. I have very few problems with the plot. The first issue is that there is a heavy reliance on metaphor, and so much of the plot is subtly told that the possibility of missing something is incredibly high. I do respect that the creators of the film expect the audience to pay attention, but there needs to be some straightforward foundation to build metaphors on or else they can be interpreted in so may ways that people will get lost at times. On the other hand, not finding these metaphors still leaves a straightforward and simple plot, but there is a complex plot hidden inside that allow of people will miss on the first viewing. This might not even be a flaw to some people. One final nitpick is that the parents in this film are almost never seen and never directly interact with the plot. While this might be a throwback to older horror classics it is a trope that I think needs to go away. I still do recommend watching this movie. I was constantly on edge and the subtle storytelling kept me focused and interested.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
It Follows shines as a unique and fresh horror film that pours on the anxiety and dread with a clever slow burn that will keep its viewers glued to the screen.,"Ok, ok, ok. I know the synopsis of this movie sounds like a lame excuse to focus on the sexual escapades of young college students, as many horror movies do. Instead, It Follows is surprisingly creative, well-done, and fresh that doesn't linger on the sensual but instead almost warns of potential consequences. The premise of a slow but relentless entity endlessly pursuing its cursed target is eerie, tense, and filled with suspense. Typical horror films repeat the same face-paced terror and disturbing gore and images. However, It Follows sets itself apart with a slow-building tension that keeps its audience unsettled but engaged, wondering what will happen next. This movie deserves all its hype with its innovative concept, clever script, and genius directing. While it does have unnecessary random nudity near the end, It Follows is worth fast-forwarding a few seconds to enjoy a creepy masterstroke of slow-burn horror.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

It Doesn't Think. It Doesn't Feel. It Doesn't Give Up. It Follows.,"Retro in style, accomplished in production & very effective in execution, It Follows is an expertly crafted, skilfully narrated & ingeniously composed indie horror which arrives as a refreshing take on its genre that beautifully blends the aesthetics of John Carpenter films with contemporary indie settings to deliver a cinema that's creepy, sinister & downright chilling.It Follows tells the story of Jay; a college student whose life is turned upside down when, after an innocent sexual encounter, she's informed by her date that he passed on a curse to her, the curse being a supernatural entity which will now be pursuing her at all times & the only probable way to get rid of it is to pass the curse along to others before the entity gets to her.Written & directed by David Robert Mitchell, the film manages to create an impending sense of doom within its opening moments & never lets it settle down until the end credits start rolling. The screenplay also deserves a mention because the story, despite its laughable premise, isn't paper-thin but digs much deeper than expected & can be interpreted in more ways than one.Coming to the technical aspects, It Follows makes efficient use of its resources, starting with the 80s vibe it is able to evoke with its detailed set pieces & remote locations. The way its camera uses the stillness, 360-degree pans & slow zooms make the experience all the more unsettling. And Editing is a gem in itself that paces its 100 minutes of runtime in a very controlled manner.But the best thing about It Follows is its magnificent score. Composed by Disasterpeace & comprising of heavily synthesised tracks, the soundtrack contributes greatly in sustaining the film's nail-biting tension & amplifying its suspense. Coming to the performances which isn't really the film's strongest suit, Maika Monroe is possibly the only one who manages to make her mark, even if it happens in bits n pieces.Despite all that, I can't help but feel quite underwhelmed by the whole experience because, considering the universal acclaim it has garnered ever since it made its debut on the silver screen, I expected much more than what it had in store. It's not that what it offers isn't impressive, it's actually pretty amazing to be honest, but that abrupt ending was quite unexpected & certainly leaves behind a feeling of incompleteness.On an overall scale, It Follows is in every way a welcome addition to its genre that never abandons its menacing tone for some cheap thrills and certainly carries more substance than the majority of horror films released in the past few years. Even if this minimalist horror isn't frightening on a visceral scale, the fearsome aura it is able to generate over the course of its runtime is sure to keep the viewers on the edge of their seats. Definitely recommended.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Good Premise - not fully utilised.,"The premise of this film is a good one - a person has sex and a supernatural spirit begins to follow them, with the intention of murdering them. The only way for that person to survive the entity is to have sex with someone and pass the ""curse"" onto them. Should they die then the spirit reverts back to following the last person once again.Unfortunately, the premise is not fully utilised in the story, there are quite a few holes. The main hole in the story is the origin of the ""curse""; we are not told it is a curse, it may be something else; we are not told why the killings are happening; or how it all started. These things deter from the story because at the end of the movie these issues made me feel as though the story was incomplete and lacking.Had these issues been resolved it would have made the story and the movie a lot stronger, and possibly a lot darker and more haunting.Taking that into consideration, what you do get in this movie is a strange surreal feeling, this is due to the direction and the soundtrack. These are very reminiscent of John Carpenter and David Cronenberg. It's as though they had a baby and his name was David Robert Mitchell.The opening scene has John Carpenter's Halloween written all over it. The entire film took me back to my youth in the 80's and I loved it. Sometimes, though, the soundtrack was too jarring, as Cronenberg's electronic soundtrack was apt to be, though here it doesn't work as well.The acting is above average with the mostly unknown cast doing a pretty decent job of adding to the tension and atmosphere of the movie. Even though there's not much gore, it's the palpable tension and atmosphere which make this a spooky supernatural story.So if you like a slow burning taut eerie tale then this could be right up your street.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Underrated indie horror,"Now this is why I love film. I'm not a huge horror movie fan, I usually find them predictable and more played for laughs like freddy or jason. Once in a while you get movies like The Conjuring or Hereditary and it keeps the genre going and It Follows is one of those movies. The premise is so awesome, I guess it was meant to make teens abstain which I found comical. But the villain, an unknown entity, that constantly stalks its victim with such menace is just incredible. Even more so since those being stalked are literally defenseless against such an antagonist. It keeps you guessing as to how they will defeat such a determined and unwavering force. The only aspect that I'm one the fence about was the abundance of nudity in the film. I suppose it was used as a ploy but at times it felt unnecessary.

Will surely scare the daylight out of you // instagram: moviesmaniax,"If The Sixth Sense scared the sh*t out of you when going to toilet at night, or Paranormal Activity made you afraid to stay at home alone, It Follows will definitely creep you out when walking back alone at night. After I saw this film, I would definitely run my ass off if I see anyone walking slowly behind me late at night. This film is a truly modern classic with its original and brilliant concept, all of which is put together nicely with its expertly directing and thought-provoking scares. The SCARES here are effective throughout thanks largely to its excellent soundtrack and intense sound effects that even though you can tell something is coming from its increasing volume of the music, but it will still effectively shock and gives you the chill down your spines when it happens. There are not many GORY scenes here but once it happens, it's definitely a terrifying one to look at. Overall, It Follows is not only the scariest film since The Conjuring but also one of the best ones worth watching before you die for its directing, concept, performance, music, etc, all of which comes together and works perfectly. It may have some funny moments along the way but once the scare comes, it's just expertly done and this film will surely scare the daylight out of you.>>A-<<",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

It is truly a horror film at it's finest, mysterious, terrifying and gripping.Parts of this film, especially the ending reminded me of Kubrick's Shining, sometimes it feels very nostalgic, like you are watching bits of The Sixth Sense again. What makes this film truly great is the nature of the plot, the mystery behind it. 'IT' takes many forms, which at times makes it almost impossible to distinguish it from a normal human being, just like in real life in some way. The monster could be anywhere and anyone.""It doesn't think. It doesn't feel. It doesn't give up.""The soundtrack really stands out; It is perfectly in tune with the scene, surroundings and the plot. It gives you goose bumps even during the scenes where nothing is happening. Dark, classical sounds adds so much emotions, gives you a feeling that 'IT' is somewhere behind you, in the movie theater.Even though all the actors' performances are rock-solid, this movie is really about the maestro. Written and Directed by David Robert Mitchell (his second feature film), this is all about his craft, his story and his ability to turn this story in one of the most refreshing horror films I have seen in years.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Dangers of the human touch,"It Follows is an interesting low budget independent horror film. It has the decency to have mostly nice likeable young characters.Jay Height (Maika Monroe) is a pretty teenager who has sex with her new boyfriend. He then ties her up and in a desolate house tells her that he has passed a curse on to her.Some kind of malevolent entity will now follow her, it can be anyone and it will try to kill her. The only way out for her is to pass the curse along to someone else and hopefully they will transmit it forward.Jay is troubled, soon she has visions of someone following her. Her friends and family are worried about Jay but rally around her. Yet they cannot see what Jay is seeing.The film can be seen as an allegory of the consequences of promiscuous sex and passing on sexually transmitted diseases. The premise of passing on a curse can go back to cult films such as Night of the Demon by Jacque Tourneur.Writer/Director David Robert Mitchell begins the film with a half naked young woman running scared out of her house in heels. Her dead contorted body is found on the beach. Outside of this he has gone for slow burn suspense rather than visceral horror.The use of electronic music and going for jump scares reminded me of the early movies of John Carpenter.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
This has to be the greatest collective prank ever,"The concept of this film can be somewhat innovative considering it doesn't take the ""regular"" things to become ""possessed"" - such as playing board games, running spirit sessions, harvesting corpses or collecting ancient objects from tombs.That being said, the film is a straight down hill after the first scene. The way it started, it got me thinking ""wow, this is interesting.. Let's see what happens"". Oh boy, why? There is half a scene that can be considered scary and it's due to a freaking cat that jumps out on the screen (how original). The movie goes by slowly, most scenes are during the day, which has a significant impact on how scared you feel, plus the ""demon"" or whatever that is, isn't really scary. Also, if you're one of those people such as myself, who like some sort of explanation about things - even if vague ones - forget about it. It doesn't tell you what this is, how it has been generated nor how to get away from it. In addition, the characters are boring and they all pass the idea of being depressed. That doesn't make anything more scary, just weird and boring.BUT, the worst is yet to come!!! The ending. Oh my God. This has to be the worst ending ever! Seriously. My girlfriend is addicted to terror movies and she has a very high tolerance towards terror movies. For some that I consider pure crap, she always finds something positive about, but for this one she looked at me after the last scene and said ""this movie is stupid. What a piece of crap"".When I watched this movie, it was rated 7.2 here. Now it's rated 6.9 but I still think this is one of the biggest pranks ever, where everyone is rating high to make other idiots watch this movie and suffer.

"Intense and psychological, nice change of pace","It Follows is an intense psychological thriller that keeps you uneasy constantly throughout. I've seen several reviews on here claiming they were bored, or the storyline doesn't add up etc. Not every movie has to be dissected to an exact science to see if logic applies to every aspect. As we've learned, horror films rarely incorporate logic but that sometimes adds to the intensity and overall thrill of it. If every character made the right decision or listened to what we were yelling at the screen, movies would be 20 min long!1. The plot of this, although could be picked apart, at the core is a different concept for the most part. Its nice to not have your typical haunted house/ possessed child plot2. People complaining of boredom and poor acting. All of the characters are supposed to be young teenagers so of course they are awkward throughout. Not every movie needs tons of dialogue, especially horror and/or thrillers. Part of the intensity is the lack of dialogue and the buildup of the music. Several times I found myself leaning into the screen to see what was happening or to find something on screen3. Some people may question the ending for various reasons. I sometimes like a movie that ends and leaves you discussing the entirety of what you just watched as well as your interpretations or opinions of what happened or what happened after.All in all, it was pretty good. Makes you very uneasy at times, keeps your attention enough throughout and is worth a watch.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Eerily Disturbing With Terrific Cinematography, But Let Down By A Big Plot-Hole And Pointless Characters","Pros:
1. The cinematography is great. The slow purposeful camera movements give the impression that the characters are constantly being followed, as well as the wide shots giving the feeling that the characters are being watched.
2. The score is used sporadically and minimally used, but it's used to good effect to enhance the tension.
3. The clean and crisp sound design really helps to set the viewer's nerves on end.
4. The monster is utterly terrifying with its seemingly invincibility and indomitable spirit.
5. The movie raises interesting moral quandaries and commentary on loose sexual morals, in addition to the dangers of promiscuity.
6. The jump-scares compliment the horror aspect, furthermore, they're very well-timed.
7. The ending suitably ends on a tense and paranoia-fuelled note, with the implication that the monster will always follow.Cons:
1. A couple of the acting performances are a little stale.
2. The dialogue is rather clunky at times.
3. There is a rather large plot-hole: If Jeff/ Hugh contracted the disease from a one-night-stand via a person he didn't know, how did he work out that it shape-shifted, as well as working out how you pass it on?
4. Most of the characters, especially Kelly Height (Lili Sepe) and Yara (Olivia Luccardi) feel pointless as they're given pretty much nothing to do.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
wow what a stinker,"Films like ""It follows"" better have a decent marketing budget else they will have massive problems finding an audience and thus making some money back, hence all the ""10 out of 10"" reviews here.First of all ""It Follows"" is much like a copy of a bad M. Night Shyamalan film. This film is by no means a horror film. ""It follows"" is not scary in any way. The film is unbearably slow and with almost no story development. You get to see dumb, slow, mostly clothed people having sex. There are a few naked people thrown in and a few weird voyeuristic scenes for no good reason.""It follows"" rather follows the formula of the mystery thriller that forces you to keep watching only to find out that the end is largely open for interpretation since the mystery does not get solved towards the end.

And no real reflection on love. I didn't get the scene on the lake with three men in a boat - did I miss something?On the horror ... The notion of a mysterious, distant figure pursuing with malevolent intent goes back to MR James. Some say the infection element is a metaphor for sexual promiscuity. Meh.

"Wildly entertaining, but not a masterpiece","Considering the sheer volume of filmed material that has been produced over time, it seems rather unlikely that 100% of a new film will ever be wholly 'original' again. Audiences are used to seeing and knowing everything- in fact, the box office tells us that they prefer their films to be familiar and unoriginal. That being said, credit is due David Robert Mitchell for It Follows. Sure, it is a horror film, and on the surface, it appears to be rather typical. Young people, sex, demons, and bad decisions flow freely here, like the many that have come before. Call it an homage, ripoff, remake, or whatever works for you, but I'd rather call it like it is- a good, tense horror film. It owes everything to prior films, yet deserves praise for how well it is made, and how earnest it is whilst presenting a tried and true premise.Allow me to be cynical for a moment, and tell me if you've heard this one before: a young, white female named Jay (Monroe) from suburbia starts to fall for a guy (Weary) who may or may not be dangerous. Well, he wears an earring, and he's brooding, so I suppose he's dangerous. They have yet to consummate their romance, or so the film tells us, but one fateful night, they do. It doesn't turn out well for her. Hugh (if that's really his name) wants to show something to her, so in the middle of an awful, rundown lot of a rundown building in Detroit, he ties her to a wheelchair as something walks towards them. He can see it, but can she? If she can, it is proof that she's now the prime target of a being/monster/demon. It will walk in her direction, no matter how far, until she is dead- unless she passes it on my having intercourse with someone else. Then the being/monster/demon will chase that person, and so on. The film's established rules for this being/monster/demon's powers are hardly concrete, but we'll get to that later.Mitchell gives us some interesting parallels to the trauma these characters experience- whether he meant to or not. Think about the horrific personification of sex in general. How many of us have had the guilt-ridden ""black cloud of sex"" follow us around (nearly like an inescapable demon)? Be it the way we were taught about it, the way our various religions forbid us from thinking about it, or perhaps an awkward or bad first experience- sex, as fantastic as it may be, is quite possibly the scariest monster of them all. This is a film that carries this enormous burden of sex, and we feel the weight of it.Also consider Mitchell's use of the city of Detroit, as the group of friends often passes south of ""8 Mile Road"", encountering all of the urban decay. Consider the clear metaphor for sexually transmitted diseases, specifically AIDS, and how one moment of seeming innocence and bliss can literally haunt you to death. Playing off our existing fears and building tension is what the film does best. The being/monster/demon, whilst occasionally grotesque, is not what turns our stomach- rather, the probing of our mind and the fear it can create seems to be the target.I did have reservations with the script's penchant for changing the being/monster/demon's powers at will. The rules can be difficult to follow; it can change its' visage to resemble anyone, including those known to the victim, which is convenient to throw off the audience. We don't know how it can do this, but only the true anal retentive viewer (like myself) cares why. Also, it can apparently only walk, not run, directly toward its' target, but in one particular scene, it pounces on a victim as if injected with puma blood. In another scene, it can pick up inanimate objects and throw them. If it touches you, you'll die, but apparently it's fine if it only grabs your hair. I care about these only because I want to know why supernatural beings choose to do some things but not others. Just like other horror films before it, why slam doors and stand in corners if you can kill your target? I suppose that wouldn't be nearly as much fun, and ultimately it doesn't keep the viewer from enjoying the film.As I finish this review, I'm now clear that It Follows is one big tense metaphor wrapped in an homage for the modern audience. If the film hadn't been treated with such delicate care, it may have been easy to dismiss. We'd simply throw it on the scrap heap with the latest exorcism film or Hellraiser entry. Instead, Mitchell and the cast have created something that may not be original, but most certainly is memorable. Some critics have gotten a bit out of hand with their praise for the film and its' unconventional yet familiar score by Rich Vreeland (also known as 'Disasterpeace' apparently), calling both ""game-changing"" or ""groundbreaking"". The static-laden bass notes in the score certainly work, but are the closest things to original I heard from it, and the MIDI-inspired crescendos don't call anything other that Carpenter's Halloween score to mind. Hyperbole aside, I can easily recommend the film to anyone interested in more than a simple slash and burn horror experience. It has nothing new to offer, but the method of delivery is certainly different, fun, and worthy of our time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
fresh idea ruined by monotonous panning,"I like the premise of the film, and the start the film seems to have a care for cinematography and overall style. It has some great sound editing to boot.BUT... after 20 minutes I started to ask myself, ""is every shot going to be a slow pan?"", and the answer was unfortunately, YES.We're talking a ridiculous amount. It can't lead into or exit a scene without it. they should have called the film, It Zooms.The film gets a lot right though. It looks great(other than the monotonous panning), and the story-line is definitely interesting and fresh. As I said the sound editing and the creepy music are just fantastic.In the end though, I think the writers and directors had some real problems with how to end the film. Fares average on the scare-meter, but I think the 'style' it gets sooo much credit for is a bit overdone at times. The movie ended and my eyes were slow-panning for a week.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
relentless,"A young women is pursued by a terrifying demonic force, a curse she inherited through the act of sexual intercourse. The only way to buy time for herself seems to be by passing on the curse through sex to someone else. This premise has echoes of 1998's 'Fallen' with Denzel Washington, but the execution is much more lush and laden with deliberate ambiguity. Jay is marked for victimhood by Jeff, who in his own tortured angst sees no alternative than to put Jay between him and IT. He at least gives her a sporting chance, explaining the rules of the game as he understands them. Jeff's explanations underpin the ambiguity: the IT he sees seems far more able to blend in with the common population than Jay's perception of IT, which is almost always dishevelled, if not downright naked. Does IT always take the form of our own nightmares? If so, what exactly is the psychology behind the form IT takes in the climactic encounter with Jay in a swimming pool? The film does a wonderful job of creating a brooding storyworld. The ravages of fiscal and political immorality threaten youth as much as casual sex, as Jay and her cohort drive numbed and hunted through economically ravaged landscapes that seem to belong to a time not of their making. The film plays on dread, self-aware in its evocation of 70s and 80s horror, down to the cars people drive, the incongruous TV sets they watch, and the electronic score. Maika Monroe as Jay is the able conduit for this sense of dread, plausibly unhinged by the fearful and uncanny episodes of IT's ineluctable approach. Keir Gilchrist as the love-struck Paul embodies the frustrations and bitter compromises that his generation have had foisted upon them. There is no American dream here, no bright future, just the day-to-day coping with an unpalatable present. Jay swims to a speedboat, Paul buys time with hookers, and another character seems to use his female classmates as a buffer, but there is a sense here of simply delaying the inevitable, both plot-wise and thematically. The film works to make assets of its limitations, throwing up more questions than answers. The ending is somewhat abrupt, smacking of first installment rather than finality, but that open-ended full stop also sparks conversations. Disturbing, intelligent and lovingly crafted, this film gets under your skin and lingers.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Demonic STD,"One of the most trying questions I always have for my friends whenever they have just seen a horror film that I have yet to see, is whether or not the film was scary. After all, what good is a horror film if it's not horrifying? I saw ""It Follows"" yesterday, and I was disappointed at first, but I slowly changed my mind.Jay Height is a teenage girl who is about to have sex with her boyfriend for the first time. She soon learns that her boyfriend has some kind of demonic STD that causes an evil presence of some sort to follow you until it kills you (hence ""It Follows""). The other way to get rid of this thing is to pass it on by having sex with someone.Jay Height is played fantastically by the up-and-coming star of the movie, Maika Monroe. She shows fear in a very realistic way, and her on going struggle to deal with her fear. One thing this film did that I highly applaud, is that it didn't try to pull the ""you are just crazy, we don't believe you"" cliché. Clearly there was some messed up experiences going on with Jay, her friends realize that, and they try to deal with the situation. No time wasted on trying to convince everyone that she isn't crazy (which way too many horror movies do). The score to the movie was also excellent, and it set a classic 80's horror movie vibe, which was great. And of course, the premise (demonic STD) was very original so I didn't feel like I had seen any of this before, which is a lot to ask for in a modern horror movie unfortunately.One of my few gripes with the movie is that it's not very scary. There are a couple jump scares here and there, and some parts will send a shiver up your spine, but I didn't leave the theater looking over my shoulder or anything like that. I don't feel like the movie tried to be scary, and I was left sitting there though. Instead, I feel like It Follows was trying to be a chilling thriller, and it succeeded. The fact is, when this movie comes out on blu-ray, I am going to buy it.It Follows puts a very unique twist on the thriller/horror genre, and it is a very good movie in that right. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The only horror is realizing how truly awful this is,"It really shouldn't have bothered, and I'm sorry I did. How they can churn out such nonsense with straight faces is beyond me.

I fear for the industry when drivel like this is advertised and sold on mainstream cinema listings as folk really have better things to waste their money on.

What modern horror has always been about!,"Caught 'It Follows' at TIFF Midnight Madness and it was a real treat. Not only is it a creative take on what has become a 'by the book' teen horror genre, but there are some legitimately creepy and tense scenes. But perhaps the most interesting aspect of 'It Follows' is that it is set in a timeless time, and feels closer to a fairy tale than anything else. We find cell phones mingling with black and white TVs, and there isn't a parental figure to be found when the going gets rough. This is a particularly clever move when the 'entity' in the film is also something we know nothing about, and potentially timeless! Most importantly, so much horror, particularly modern horror, is obsessed with sex. 'It Follows' plays on this concept with much success.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Eerie and well acted.,"Not bad modern horror film represents a respectable effort from writer, producer & director David Robert Mitchell. It's been compared to John Carpenters' work, which is appropriate. In the opening shots, we feel as if we're back in Haddonfield, Illinois (this was actually shot in Detroit). Mitchell gives us a very strange and interesting set piece to open his film, and he and his cast try very hard at giving us characters we can care about. ""It Follows"" may pose a challenge to some members of its audience by daring to take its time. Mitchell holds off on increasing the momentum as long as he can, preferring to create a gloomy atmosphere and a constant sense of creeping dread. This he all does without dwelling too long on graphic violence, which some horror fans may appreciate.The premise is fairly interesting. Some sort of supernatural force - which is always changing its appearance - kind of attaches itself to certain individuals and follows them around, terrorizing them. Sometimes it even kills them. Our imperiled heroine Jay (Maika Monroe) is the latest person to attract this ""it"", and her deeply concerned friends agree to help see her through the experience.Folks will dig on the old style synthesizer score by Disasterpeace, and appreciate the widescreen compositions devised by Mitchell and his cinematographer, Mike Gioulakis. They take full advantage of the 2.35:1 aspect ratio.The acting is low key and sincere from the attractive young cast. Monroe is a personable lead, and she's ably supported by Keir Gilchrist (""Dead Silence""), Daniel Zovatto (""Beneath""), Jake Weary (""Zombeavers""), and Olivia Luccardi.The ending fails to be very satisfying, unfortunately. This is too bad, considering how well Mitchell creates his mood and feel for about 80% of the film.This viewer wasn't quite blown away by ""It Follows"" but would consider it good enough to merit a viewing from genre fans.Seven out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
maybe I'm just not part of that intended audience,"Having very much enjoyed the director's later Under the Silver Lake, I was looking forward to this popular success.Unfortunately I had real problems with it. initially I had difficulty catching the dialogue and wondered if I might put the subtitles on and although I eventually managed to tune in to the rather rushed and part whispered and accented exchanges I found I was still rather lost. For all the excellence and horror of the original incident and all the advise to 'pass it on', I got no inkling as to how the poor girl was supposed to do this. I was reminded of Night of the Demon and wondered if there was a piece of paper or something involved. By the time I realise it is sex, I really feeling left out. I now recall there was a hurried exchange between two girls early on where one asks the other if she had done 'it', so maybe I should have been more alert. Or perhaps this is assumed, that within some American religious areas there is an assumed wrongness. Like the old slasher film rule, have sex and die. Really, these days? Or some heavy handed STD warning? Either way having managed to catch up I was perturbed to find that it didn't after all work as simply as that. There was someone called Max and his mother, I saw happen but nobody ever mentions it. In the end I gave up in despair or ever finding any logic or believable narrative. I don't mind puzzling and surreal narratives that leave me bewildered but here there is so much emphasis upon a certain logic in the proceedings that I would have liked to understand it. Sure it looks good with excellent cinematography but there is an onus on the film maker to engage the audience, but then maybe I'm just not part of that intended audience.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A flaw but well executed precursor of bigger things to come,"""It follows"" is the first feature film by the Director of ""Under the silver lake"". Unlike the follow up movie, ""It Follows"" is a much simpler story, with a simple script that relies on both actors and subtle visual details to communicate a 'bigger picture' that's easy to miss.Rather than for going for the age old parable trope, the director takes a novel, albeit slightly confusing approach to 'layer' the film: purposeful plot holes. You read that right.The whole film is consistent in its inconsistence: even on the opening scene, the first half of the pan takes place in the summer, while the second half, 10 short seconds later, happens in autumn. Easy to miss - but oh so effective.Likewise, if you enjoy small details, you'll love this: characters live in a timeless epoch, where 'clamshells' phones are shaped like actual clams, tv broadcast 1950's horror, and the set is clearly placed in various geographical environment at different times of the year. The continuity team must have pulled their hair on this one :)It's well done, but one has to ask themselves: is it enough to elevate the film from teenage slash film to 'art', and the answer is a resounding yes. The movie is filmed like a nightmare would, and the minutiae in the detail is an absolute delight (note the 'evil' takes on very specific forms, and you'll have fun matching the various appearances to the pictures on the wall of the house). And it goes on and on.If on the other hand you do not care about arthouse stuff, you can still enjoy the film as a plain horror script that delivers zero jump scares. Psychological horror basically, with a subtext of teenage promiscuity , naivety and the the dichotomy between the youth feeling of invincibility and the inevitability of death.The movie lands its ending very well, with a spoken quote before the closing scene, that leaves the rather binary outcome open to interpretation (again, on purpose).7/10 - but technically more of a 6.5 compared to the Director's other offerings (under the silver lake rakes in a 10/10)",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

I had never seen camera angles in horror films like this before which really helped build the tension and suspense that this film has so much of. It's extremely hard to believe that this is David Robert Mitchell's (director) first piece of work with horror. I pray this director releases another horror film in the near future.

It's refreshing to see something different in the horror genre!,"I got introduced to David Robert Mitchell through Under the Silver Lake, a film I consider to be a misunderstood gem, but I didn't get round to seeing the film that popularised him. Having seen it now I am really interested in what he makes in the future.It Follows is about a teenager named Jay who finds herself being followed by a supernatural force after a sexual encounter.Horror films nowadays are the same thing over and over again. It's sad to see great horror films like Hereditary, Midsommar and The Lighthouse not earn nearly as much as movies like Annabelle or Ouija. It's refreshing to see another terrific horror film like It Follows come and break the cycle.I can see why general audiences would dislike this film. It keeps jumpscares to a minimum and people may not find it that scary. I remember hearing how many people said it was the scariest film they've seen in years and whilst I wouldn't agree with that statement, I still found It Follows to be very creepy. The concept alone of some random person following you and no else can see them apart from you is really freaky to me and that's where this film got under my skin. I loved Mitchell's focus on atmosphere rather than jumpscares. The opening scene, which is done with an impressive one shot, introduces us to this dark and creepy tone that doesn't leave until the end. On top of that, one of the greatest aspects of this film is its soundtrack. Disasterpeace, who also did the soundtrack for Under the Silver Lake, blends the modern and retro 80s style and creates a fantastic eerie and haunting soundtrack that fits the film perfectly.What I also loved was how David Robert Mitchell respected the audience. Regular horror films tend to spoonfeed them information but there are so many hidden details Mitchell hides within many frames that it requires the audience's full attention. The performances are also great. Maika Monroe does an excellent job and the rest of the cast all give good performances. The film is definitely inspired by old school 80s horror films. You can feel a John Carpenter vibe in the cinematography but at the same time Mitchell sprinkles a few modern elements that create a timeless feeling to the overall film. Where I feel the film falters is the rules of its universe. There are times where I saw some inconsistencies in the rules but I think what this film achieves definitely outweighs its flaws.Once again, David Robert Mitchell has proved to me what a talented director he is. It Follows is a very atmospheric horror film that doesn't resort to all the cheap ways you can scare your audience and I respect Mitchell for bringing us something new.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Future Of Horror....,Saw the Trailer for this film and it looked good... I wasn't disappointed!! From start to finish it had you gripped. A sense of unease permeated throughout the film. You didn't know what shocks and scares were going to come at you and from where.. I loved the film The Babadook (apart from the very disappointing ending) but this film was even scarier! I guarantee you will jump at least once and i dare you to watch this alone at night..... I congratulate this fairly new Director on creating such an excellent film and as an avid horror fan i very much hope he will be bringing us some more scary films. There are too many horror films these days that follow similar themes and ideas so its so refreshing to see something new and different. This film breathes new life into the horror genre.... Go see it. You wont be disappointed.,8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"It takes a special kind of talent to make a movie about a terrifying and malevolent supernatural force boring, but this manages to.","The concept is good - the constant fear and unease of something that's always out to get you, something which can strike at any time, but in this case, it doesn't hold up to any scrutiny or make a very engaging film. It does have an interesting and artistic camera style and setting, which builds up an uneasy atmosphere, but it's never scary or tense.

A nightmare that never stops,"""It Follows"" starts with a very simple and effective idea, uses perfect lighting, unique cinematography, design, and a memorable soundtrack in the suburban setting of Detroit. Twisting these elements into a nightmare that never stops, it's one of the scariest films of the last decade.Think of ""it"" as a sexually transmitted infection. You might get it from someone, it might not show immediately, but when it does, it's the worst thing you've ever seen, but instead of visiting the local practitioner for a fix, the only way to say goodbye is by passing it to someone else, and like a festering infection, it's in your bloodstream and could return at any time.""It follows"" uses a number of conventional horror tropes that really help amplify the terror. There are many moments where you just want to yell, ""look behind you"" and grip the edge of your seat in the hope that the characters can see what you can.Water is used as a recurring motif and really gives a mysterious quality to the imagery. I feel the use of fluid substances is a warning sign and carries meaning that is much deeper than what is prevalent on the surface. Places like the beach, the pool and a lake give a sense of danger and fear of what lies beneath.What is unique about this film is the amazing cinematography, very smart at times. The director of photography makes an intelligent use of constant pans, slowly building tension. There are and a number of inventive camera tricks which give this film its signature style.The synthesized soundtrack along with the production design gives a retro vibe, however it's hard to figure out what era the film is set. The film uses a mash up of 80's and 90's decor but I can't help but wonder if this is the time zone the film is set, or if the kids are just poor and edgy with their outfit choices.I think this film is what all horror fans have been waiting for.

"Fresh Ideas, Old School Horror Theme","Finally a horror film that I can actually watch. It Follows boasts of a unique and fresh premise for a horror, a relatable cast, and a score that enhances the chilling feel of the film.

a Simple yet Engaging Horror Film,"This movie is about a thing that follows people, and there is no escaping it! It is a simple concept but was well executed in this movie. The movies ending however is pretty inconclusive, leaving you with many unanswered questions that ads to the whole mystery of the brilliant movie. A simple story that is different and well executed.For a person only new to the whole horror genera, it was not the scariest movie ever. We don't get too involved in what's going on in the other characters lives. Staying focused on the main story at hand (the follower) and they drag this out as the movie progresses, putting you in more and more suspense. leaving us with the follower to think of and not the stuff that is happening to the other characters.I loved the camera work in this movie, it is different to what is in others and some of it I have never seen on screen. the long turning camera motion featured a couple times throughout. Good way to set the scene and emotion of the characters involved. They do 1 or 2 passes of the environment then focus in on the action. They used the right camera shots at the right time. for example: hand-held; making it seem as though something is about to happen, keeping you on the edge of your seat. the forward shot on road in between scenes, well placed slow- motion and the camera attached to the front of the moving objects.The acting in this movie is average, only a bunch of teenagers in a horror film. The actors that played the Follower did a good job at making the audience forget that they are actually real people on screen.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One of the most disturbing movies I have had the pleasure of watching,"It would be appropriate to open up a review on this film by saying one thing about this film. It's that this film definitely has a.interesting concept behind it. This movie takes the modern day horror and flips it on its head. How does it do this? STDs.not kidding. Parents with teenage children, if you want to convince them not to have sex, feel free to show them this film. Because it is basically a huge metaphor of why STDs are terrifying.Now all jokes aside, despite the strange concept, this movie had some PHENOMENAL execution. I did not feel anything less of creeped out and even grossed out throughout this entire film, which is exactly the type of feeling you're supposed to receive from a film such as this. I felt disturbed, anxious, tense, and many more emotions which were all exceptionally delivered from this film. It draws your attention with its interesting plot, and then keeps you watching with its many different ways of keep you on the edge of your seat. The biggest way they do this is by keeping you and the protagonist aware of the monster, but throws in a characteristic for the monster that keeps it hidden to the other characters. So I kept finding myself see it/or someone else with similar behavior to it in the background and kept saying to myself ""OH S*** OH S*** OH S***!""The atmosphere was incredible, there are is an appropriate number of jumpscares, and most of the scary moments are more of a reveal to something, or the constant tense moments that it keeps throwing at you. Normally, when I have a certain number of tense moments thrown in my face, I tend to be like ""Oh OK I get it just stop."" But for this movie, it actually works because you know that the monster is always following, and that it can come up at any time. It leaves you waiting and on the edge of your seat the entire time because you want to know where it is.I only had a few problems trying to follow of a few things in this movie. There would be some moments where they would imply or hint at something happening, then make it seem later like that ""thing"" didn't happen. So you're left it your seat wondering ""Wait, so did they back off last second, or did it actually happen? I'm confused!"" But that could be my only serious problem that hurt my experience. Because there was no clearance to it.In general though, this movie has some of the most phenomenal and well done execution of an original idea that I have seen in quite a long time. They never strayed or added or bull**** to the original concept, and made it work in a spectacular way. I would definitely watch this movie again if it were put in front of me. Final Review Score: 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The worst kind of STD...,"The plot is simple yet interesting. Someone has sex with someone else and an STD monster stalks them. It walks like a Romero-esque zombie but no matter how far you travel, it keeps coming for you. If it touches you, you're dead. If it kills you, it goes after whoever passed the curse to you. I don't feel like this is a spoiler because they basically explain it in the first twenty minutes of the film.I had heard it was good and although it had its flaws, it was pretty cool. Yeah, the parents seem to be absent (so were mine) and yes, the rules are bent slightly here and there but I mean, were you expecting The Godfather? It's a stupid horror film. If you can believe in an STD monster, your suspension of disbelief should probably allow your brain to fill in the blanks and get passed the glitches of the film. In short, get over it. It's entertaining and it's more thought out than anything Michael Bay has pumped out...ever.I think this is one of the better horror films of the decade (not the best,) considering it's up against the 15th Saw flick (only the 10th since the villain died,) Paranormal Conjuring Nuns that Purge and all its spin offs and various other PG-13 ""scary movies"" as well as a countless barrage of remakes and sequels. At least this film is different and had some balls (it's rated R.) Not great, but worth watching. I still say The Babadook and Get Out are better (along with a few more) but this was better than most recent schlock. Give it a shot.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Dumb movie,"This movie starts pretty strong but doesn't end up giving you what you want. It's very clear this director studied late 70's terror movies. A lingering shot is neat, but can be pretentious, especially if you're not Polanski. Also, it just looks cheap. Plastic cheap digital cheap. This was $2 million to make? I call B.S.I realize this guy was attempting to change the genre a little. Maybe adjust it for modern times, but it seemed like it was just a pale copy of better paranoia run-from-the-monster type of mood piece. Watch any Japanese ghost story to get the better effect. The other thing that cheapens this movie is that there is no explanation as to this phenomenon. Really? Just...it happens...I guess if it follows, it happens. I was truly disappointed at the glowing reviews of this movie. I've lost faith in society if they can't tell this silly piece of garbage which veils itself as art for style sake to something who is studied in the craft of storytelling.

Scary in a Blair Witch Project/Halloween kind of way,"A lonesome girl sitting in a classroom, looks outside on the schoolyard. A moving white shape can be seen far away. The girl doesn't at first notice anything odd about it, but after a while it's clear that the shape is a human being heading straight towards her. In panic, she grabs her things and quickly leaves the classroom.It Follows is written and directed by the relatively unknown David Robert Mitchell. It's about the girl Jay, who after a sexual encounter with a guy, ""gets infected"" by some sort of curse that starts to constantly follow her. It Follows is a low budget film made with only 2 million dollars, a small sum in today's measurements. Interestingly though, Paranormal Activity and Blair Witch Project were made with only about 20 000 dollars. Money isn't everything in the world of horror films.In the beginning of It Follows we follow the story mostly from a distant. The camera never really gets close and we feel more like a spectator, not really involved in the story. Later in the film we get drawn deeper in and our spectator role changes to a subjective perspective. Joy's perspective. This enhances the effect of the curse that's following her. In the beginning we were one in the crowd, watching, but later we turn into the one looking for the stalker in the crowd. The music in It Follows is very electronic and feels like a mix of David Lynch's companion Angelo Badalamenti and Giorgio Moroder. It really enhances the creepy feeling that lies like a cloth throughout the film.It Follows leaves me both impressed and disappointed at the same time. It's well crafted and the for me totally unknown cast does its job acting like typical teenagers in a horror flick. But, I still think the film falters a bit in the middle, and then even more towards the end. Once the story is laid out for us, it's like the film gets stuck. Where should we go next? This in turn seems to lead to more classic horror film clichés being used, which is a pity because the film started rather unconventionally. The ending does save the film, and without saying too much I do like it when a film leaves room for interpretations and personal thinking.David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Will Follow You Around,"It Follows is a unique horror-movie experience. Instead of effects- heavy monsters, computer trickery, and massive amounts of gore, it relies on refreshingly old-fashioned cinematic techniques to effectively overwhelm its audience. It's a suburban teen horror film that has more in common with the likes of The Shining than with Halloween. An impressive little indie thriller that earns its shrieks and squirms in honest ways, equal parts poetic and intensely scary, It deserves to be seen. The setup of the plot is genuinely difficult to find a way out of: what if a seemingly innocent night of sexual intimacy led to a zombie like creature following you around, and the only way to rid yourself of this ominous being is to pass it on to someone else? We all know the horror trope, that having sex will lead to that characters death, but the message here is more pointed than most. More than just a simple warning about STDs, It Follows has a strangely strong anti-promiscuous sex message. It does this through relatively flat performances and almost goofily slow pacing at times, but more often through spine-chilling imagery that is the stuff of nightmares. Young director Mitchell, an alum of FSU, is definitely a guy to watch out for. His script is good, but the sights and sounds, the two physical senses used when experiencing any film, of this thing are a piece of technical perfection. Beautiful long takes and shots, perfect use of sound against silence, and a big, dissonant score that is the best in a long time help create an event that will follow you long after you leave the theatre.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Why is it getting good reviews?!,"The movie just goes downhill after the 1st quarter, and not much before that either. The one thing that's just unforgivable is that there is absolutely no value addition in terms on the story from the 1st to the last sec, you can watch this one finish to start and it will feel the exact same. It's just 100 minutes of want to making it look like horror when all there is is one single line as it's story. What a movie it could have been if it's basic premise was at least a bit worked upon and a lot more evolving as it progressed. Coming to the acting part, a Lot more depth of emotions were required, the lead actress lets down the comparatively better acting supporting cast, leading to the slow pace of camera, film, and the music seem to be boring when movie making wise is not.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
It Fails.,"This movie is terrible. There is no beginning or end, it's like it's just the middle of a story. Of course, I have some theories on the underlying message of the film but who really cares?

Just because it has the MOST annoying music (like seriously, I lived through the 80s and heard enough Casio keyboard beats for one lifetime) doesn't make it a throw back.Reminds them of Wes Craven... holy s**t.

The Creepiest Film I've Seen In A Long Time,It Follows is probably one of the most creepiest movie I've seen in a long time. The movie is not all that scary as people say but it is very creepy. There are only two jump scares in the film which is something different because today most horror films have a ton of jump scares. The film is just very creepy. The acting in this film is very good but Maika Monroe steals the entire film with her acting and I believe she will be the next scream queen in horror films. Her character reminds me of Jamie Lee Curtis character from Halloween. It Follows does remind me of Halloween a little bit. The story of this film just feels new and different. Some people might like the story but some people might not like it. I really enjoyed the story because it kept me hooked and it was very interesting. Also how this film was shot looked amazing. The score for this film was totally awesome because it had an 80's feel to it. And the score kept tension and it was very creepy.

A whole bunch of Nothing,"Honestly I have no idea in hell how this movie got anything higher than a 2 star rating. This is my first review and usually I don't write reviews but I feel it is my duty to save anyone else from wasting their time on this garbage. I am starting to think most of the people who write these higher star reviews are being paid to do so. First of the pace is unbearably slow. Nothing happens at all. And that is probably an understatement. You feel nothing from these characters at all, you almost want them do die halfway through the movie. Horrible acting, horrible writing, highly unbelievable story. I mean I know characters in horror movies are supposed to do the exact opposite of common sense but this just goes beyond that. I usually force myself to finish a movie in its entirety in one sitting just because I like to give everything a fair chance. Maybe there might be an amazing ended or twist that will make it worth the slow pace you know? But not this time, you start with nothing and are left with nothing. I found myself counting the minutes until this ended and almost rejoiced just because it was over. Horror is my favorite genre but I gave up on them about 5 years back just because the truth is they just don't make good horror anymore, and this movie is pretty much the spokesperson to that very point. All in all I cannot think of anything I enjoyed about this movie except for the fact that its over and I feel like I should clean out by blu ray drive for having the garbage in it for the time it was, good God people do not believe the hype at all.

Some sequences are supremely effective, especially the first few viewings of these spectral beings who are terrorizing our heroine.

"""It's Pretty Good""","""It Follows,"" directed by David Robert Mitchell, (who from his IMDb picture looks like he should be a character in his own movie, but I guess that makes sense) starts out as having no purpose other than paying tribute to the original ""Halloween,"" from the seemingly self-composed synth-keyboard soundtrack (which I realized can be injected into any movie to instantly create an ""80s throwback"") right down to the ""Laurie Strode"" AKA ""Jay Heights'"" gaze through the high school class window while the teacher prattles on about a passage from Keats that can loosely be applied to the theme of the movie. Thankfully what ""follows"" is actually pretty thought provoking though at times for the sake of the story.The premise of the movie is this: there is, let's call it an ""affliction,"" that can be passed from person to person. How is this ""affliction"" passed, you might ask? Well, you have to have sex to get rid of it. What is the ""affliction?"" No matter where you are, someone will steadily be walking towards you to kill you.Now, reading this description makes the symbolism of the movie only slightly more apparent than actually viewing it. Still, it's an interesting idea, and ""It Follows"" takes it pretty far. What could have been a run-of-the-mill ""startle-fest"" became one of the first modern horror movies with substance (there have only been maybe, five, in the past twenty years, though I await dispute on that). It's really a shame that the director felt it necessary to include scenes more fit for the cerebrally desert cash-grabs aforementioned than digging further into his own style for the scary stuff. That could have been really good.I think the main issue with ""It Follows"" is that it puts the idea before the enjoyment of the viewer. Philosophically I can't completely disagree with this, I'm actually surprised that a movie like this reached mainstream markets in the era of multi-billion dollar raising superhero movies. It's just that right when it gets good, it seems to sell out with the (for lack of a better term), ""paranormal activity"" scenes.The vigilant viewer will notice the antagonist is not the ""sex zombies"" (i.e. rape victims) but actually the attractive bad-boy friend (a friend that is a boy) of the main character who uses her vulnerability of needing to rid herself of her affliction as an excuse to score, despite the fact that he doesn't even believe her up to that point.This is one of those movies that you probably need to watch more than once or twice to really appreciate.

I think what hits the hardest for the scare factor is that most of us, have at some points in our lives had the same exact type of dream about a terrifying presence stalking us to no end. The film takes many advantages of a slow moving monster by having overwhelmingly good shots hiding the monster out of sight until just the right moment which is only one of the many positives this film has. Another great idea is by placing the film in Detroit (My home town) as it leaves open for many interesting and strange environments. The only negatives with the film I see is the rules of the monster don't make total sense as there are many plot holes surrounding the monster as a whole but I passed over it seeing that you really actually don't know the rules completely and i think the director made sure of that. The talented Director David Robert Mitchell makes a distinct choice by placing the film in a unknown time frame, making you question this reality and making the film just the more unnerving. He makes the film seem like just one big dream you will never wake up from and that may be why i love it so much. To make this film as terrifying and hard hitting as possible, you must know as little as possible to get the full feel for it like I did. If you consider yourself a horror buff or a purist to the art form of horror film making you must see It Follows. A-",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A unique horror film,"It FollowsIn a Detroit suburb, a college student is in the latest line of a deadly curse that is passed on by a sexual encounter. She must either pass on the curse to another or be haunted by a zombie-like form-changing entity.Within its own premise, this unusual horror film is consistent and good in its own right. Compared to other horror films with a sex theme, it can be praised for its avoidance of over-the-top gore as well as sexual exploitation.It may not necessarily advance the genre but it's mildly entertaining. And a subtle moment at the very end provides a tingling ambiguous conclusion.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Avoid,"Sorry, but this movie is quite bad in my opinion.I've read other reviews that compare it to J. Carpenter's work and... well, I guess some people just see what they want to see.The plot is incredibly dull and the acting mediocre. This may be due to bad directing rather than the professionalism of the actors themselves, but there are no believable characters within it (not even the main one whom I thought wasn't too bad by herself).The soundtrack might be the best thing of the movie, but it's not directed well enough, so there is a complete lack of suspense and rhythm to the movie. So much so that I actually fell asleep and missed a scene that I had to rewind to watch again. The photography is not as bad, but is not good enough for me to recommend the movie at all.If you truly like the genre, don't waste your time with this movie regardless of how difficult it is to find a good horror movie these days.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
It Follows Follows the Footsteps of Its Predecessors,"It Follows is a slow burner, lots of build up and all the horror is based almost strictly off tension. The slow, methodical drive of the antagonist is eerily terrifying.My criticisms of the film include the acting. While its not terrible it could have been a lot better. The main actress Maika Monroe did very well but the rest of the cast is rather lacking. I also thought the ""leaving the suburbs"" scene was a rather odd inclusion. It was very preachy and just felt entirely out of place next to the rest of the film. It kind of took me out of it a bit moving forward.What I did love was the anachronistic feel of this, almost as if the viewer is watching someone's dream. This, coupled with a score very reminiscent of John Carpenter, fitted perfectly with the ambiance of the film, makes this a very refreshing horror movie.One question I have is what exactly is the message of this movie? ""Don't have casual sex or it could lead to your demise?"" I suppose it is a warning against STDs and advising safe sex but its not exactly clear what we're meant to learn.The throwbacks and homages of this horror film reminded me a lot of The Guest (also of 2014 and also starring Maika Monroe). We need more horror movies of this tone moving forward. I'm excited to see where this director goes next.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Fantastic score,"The movie was pretty good too, it doesn't rely on a lot of ""startle takes"" where something jumps out at you from the corner of the screen when you sort of already expect it but instead uses more of a ""creep-out"" factor that kind of makes the hair on the back of your neck stick up; it was a refreshing change although I didn't jump out of my seat it was still plenty scary.I mention the music because it really does set the mood for the scenes... Especially ""old maid"" which just drives home the creepiness and unstoppable nature of the thing that ""follows""; not surprisingly there were a few other people that stuck around for the credits to see who was responsible for the music. Band called Disasterpeace in case you are curious.The film has pitfalls such as how the curse or whatever you call it is transferred which I think just gets silly at some point but the horrifying aspect seems to make it worthwhile, the concept of someone just walking towards you has never concerned me and this film makes you at least temporarily question if there should be cause for concern; that's good film-making.... My only question is why was it released wide in essentially every other European country and even South Korea before being released in the U.S.?Are we not savvy enough to appreciate a film of this scope while the ""Furious 7"" release is being played every 30 minutes in 5 different auditoriums at the local Google-plex?... How stupid is the premise for that film and why do we still cater to morons in this country?",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
She has no idea...,"Is it too early to say there is a renaissance of horror movies going on? One thing is for sure: in the last few years we've experienced more than a few smart, well-made spookies coming from the US. And it's such a big relief to see that, apparently, the sh*t-show of endless jump-scares seems to be kind of over. So, alongside the fairly good ""The Conjuring"" and the fairly great ""The Babadook"", we can now add to the list of good American contemporary horror ""It Follows"": as the previous two, in fact, it shows what a good script, creative directing and pretty solid performances can do to the genre. Starting from the script, it has a beautiful simplicity to it: there's a non specified entity that follows the cursed and if ""it"" gets to them, it kills them; only way to get out of it is to pass the curse on to someone else through sexual intercourse. Alongside this thin but solid premise, Mitchell showcases simple, credible dialog and well-rounded characters. The chosen stage for the story is the declined city of Detroit: another spectral aspect that perfectly fits with the ghostly presence of the title. Sure, the group of teens that form the core characters of the movie are nothing short of the classic stereotyped nerds, jocks and so on, but they are enriched with a sort of ambiguity and uncertainty in their actions that's almost never seen in this genre. It's also noticeable how Mitchell leaves some important moments in the narrative out of the viewer's reach, with underlying meanings. It is not easy to work as an artist and not as an exploiter of mindless teenagers looking for a thrill in the horror industry, but Mitchell and his team worked out an unflinching film, that doesn't care to be too innovative, and yet modernizes classic '80s style creeps. It (see what I did there?) may not appeal to more gore or shock oriented moviegoers, but it's their loss. And it is because ""It Follows"" is the smartest horror in years.8/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
An Examination of What Makes This Film Endearing and Interesting.,"Reading the reviews for this film is very interesting indeed, they are all over the place. If this is horror at all, and it is, this would be classified as psychological horror, and a moderately surrealistic one at that. Given that, any thrills it has, are not going to be from some visceral shot of a person being ripped apart, or by a ghouly bursting out of a closet for a jump scare. Why the mild controversy over this film of whether or not it is horror? A more important question is what is horror? When it comes to people who consume it; it is heavily debated what movies are actually horror. There should be some consensus that a horror film can be many different things, and that even though horror has many many sub-genres, a horror film is simply a movie focused on what people might fear, and at times, disgust people. Horror hones in on the fears and/or disgusts that we might have, and makes those the central focus, or a large part of the film; this is why a film can be quite violent or even disturbing, without being a horror film. This is why I don't generally watch horror films anymore, but I know the thought patterns of someone who does watch horror all the time. You are always searching for the next gross and disgusting thing, the most demented characters, the next creepiest movie, and no shock is too shocking(for the most hardcore fans).The term horror is not exclusive to extreme movies like ""Cannibal Holocaust"", ""Salo"", ""A Serbian Film"", or ""Antichrist"", ""Inside"", or any other such movie that is meant nothing more than to make you feel dirty and gross. Horror isn't just movies like ""Amityville Horror"", ""The Entity"", ""The Haunting"", ""Poltergeist"", ""Session 9"", or ""The Changeling"" either. ""Warm Bodies"" and ""Zombieland"" would be considered horror, but they are also not extremely violent or scary and are fairly humorous. The thing is, horror has many many subgenres, and one common thread you will see with horror film reviews is ""It wasn't _______ Enough"". Even the best of them tend to have those who go ""WHY WOULD ANYONE LIKE THIS OR THINK IT IS SCARY!!!!!!!!!!"" Or ""This isn't a horror film because _________!""Why would someone like ""It Follows"" even if it has some plot holes, has things that don't make sense, contains little violence or gore, and is fairly slow-paced? I can't say why all who like it do, but I can explain why I have seen it several times, and I imagine some of what I will say applies to others, even if they don't articulate it that way.I freely admit, this is not a perfect film, and I do not love every bit of it, and it is not puzzling why some hate it. On the whole it is a slow burn, but it has a very deliberate pace, although the film does drag a bit towards the end by design, as the character becomes despondent and gets used to her fate, so do we, and well it may be solid movie making, it does make the final third far less exciting. ""It Follows"" could cut out 5 minutes and be no worse for wear, and it loses some of it's tension the more we see the monster. In spite of that, it does actually deserve it's title as one of the best of the previous decade; one of the reasons it deserves that title, is also one the reasons it will receive derision. It is not going to give you typical or cheap scares, but if you pay attention and are patient it will disorient you and give you a feeling of dread and doom, and you will probably be pretty bummed and irritated by the end of it. It just isn't an extremely terrifying movie, and it doesn't have to be, it does what it does very well, and it is one of the few horror films that has a really unique idea AND near flawless execution.""It Follows"", being a surrealistic psychological horror film, wisely leaves most questions the viewer has unanswered, and this especially(as seen in many reviews) will tick people off who want an answer, but this isn't a movie about solving a mystery or about some grand scheme, it is simply about an entity(of which we do not actually know what it is or where it comes from) that is beyond the character's control and beyond their knowledge and understanding, and what they do with that very limited knowledge. I enjoyed this about the film, and it really does feel like one long nightmare. Who hasn't had a nightmare with someone pursuing them, seemingly for no reason, and they won't die or go away? I have.The cinematography in ""It Follows"" is fantastic, it is one of the best things about it, especially the long panning shot at the beginning. There is a lot of fantastic usage of panning shots, and it adds a lot in terms of atmosphere to this movie. ""It Follows"" also contains a great usage of zooms, something we don't always see used a lot of in films. There are a lot of subtleties as well, such as the camera moving with the waving of the swimming pool, these are not necessarily things you will notice the first go around, but they really do add a lot to this movie and give it a more surreal feeling, you need to closely watch and pay attention. The setting in Royal Oaks/Detroit, MI is an asset, as it gives ample opportunity for dilapidated overgrown abandoned houses, which is a major problem in Detroit, it definitely adds to the atmosphere. The script is relatively sparse in dialog at times, and the characters, while relatable and likeable, are not very fleshed out, but I don't see this as a negative as so many others seem to. Heavier character exposition in this case really would have bogged down the movie, and the characters generally come across as people you might know and are fairly likeable.The music is willfully reminiscent of 80's horror films(there are definitely some bits of John Carpenter in here), but off-kilter, and it does give it an unsettling vibe, it isn't used excessively either, it is fairly sparse, this film is not afraid of silence or the soft rustle of the wind. There is a lot of subtext going on, not just about STD's, but chronic illnesses in general. People seldom believe a ""healthy looking person"" could be very sick, and I see this particularly in the character Jeff, he seems fine, but he's not, even when his ""illness"" is supposed to go away, it is constantly waiting there in the wings, to devour him, like cancer that has gone into remission. This is especially seen when they are in the mezzanine of the theater and he picks a little kid as someone he would like to trade places with.The visual aesthetics, of course, are a huge part of what makes this a very surrealistic film, it is willfully inconsistent and defiant in terms of its time period, and it does not have one. It makes no apologies about this, and I have heard it was done this way to make things more dream-like and to disorient the viewer, and in general, it does succeed. It really does feel like being in a never-ending bad dream.One of the more interesting parts is, while the people's clothes inside and outside the movie theater are fairly modern, once they are inside, yes the theater is old school, but that isn't the interesting part, but rather the aged organ player at the front of the stage. This is interesting because those are a relics of the silent era of films when they had orchestras or organ players play the music for the movies. It is little touches such as this that make this film interesting. Most of the buildings and neighborhoods in this are old, and it gives it a weird vintage feel. Sometimes we have kids dressed in 80's like clothes or 70's style. the teens in this smoke and drink like kids might have 50 years ago. The TV's are all ancient, the movies and shows they watch are ancient. The main character wears granny panties, which in and of itself would be a nightmare for a young woman.... No one seems to have access to the internet, it appears to not exist, and only one cellphone at the opening appears. There are, what look like brand new 1970's Playboy Magazines. There are so many small details and things which only come out in subsequent viewings.I would argue, given it's dream-like qualities, it's plot holes may be forgiven since, in this world, there seem to not be as many concrete rules, or rather, we don't actually know what the rules are at all, even the rules of the monster are only guessed at, the characters haunted by it don't even know what it can or cannot do. Some may call this lazy, but people forgive this in other surrealistic films, say, by David Lynch(this film even has a slight Twin Peaks feel to it), or even many of Cronenberg's outings. I would argue this film is a lot more consistent than most of Cronenberg's outings(particularly Videodrome, which turns into a chaotic mess by the end), it just isn't as gory. ""It Follows"" budget is very low budget for a film that has a wide release, it's budget is about a 3rd less than ""Halloween"" would cost today, when adjusted for inflation, but it doesn't look low-budget at all, especially compared to the look of ""Halloween"".I anticipate because of how this film eschews normal settings and logic, it will actually age a lot better than the vast majority of other horror films and be more widely appreciated in a few more years, but only time will tell.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Very Good, Not Great","This film is listed in a Digital Trends article, ""Time to kill? These are the absolute best movies on Netflix right now"". IMO, this film just misses the list. ""It Follows"" is very good but has flaws. The story is very original. There is plenty of spooky activity, the film has parts that are frightening, and some good jump scares. On the other hand, the film moves slowly and contradicts itself, especially during the last 20 minutes or so. ""It Follows"" is a ""just miss"" but worth a try.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Chilling but Not Terrifying,"Having watched it ten years later, I can appreciate its eerie atmosphere and unique premise, but I'd say it's not quite as terrifying as the internet might have led me to believe.I found it visually striking. The cinematography is haunting, and the choice to set the film in a timeless, somewhat retro world enhances its unease. The minimalistic soundtrack by Rich Vreeland (aka Disasterpeace) also contributes to the film's tension, with its eerie, synth-driven score evoking a sense of dread throughout.However, while the film's premise is intriguing, I found the pacing a bit uneven at times. The tension builds steadily, but there were moments where I felt the slow-moving threat didn't quite hold up as much suspense as I'd expected. The horror is more atmospheric than jump-scare driven, which I can appreciate, but I didn't feel the kind of overwhelming terror that many others seem to rave about.I couldn't help but feel that some of the film's elements, while effective, were somewhat overhyped by its devoted fan base. Perhaps the internet's intense anticipation set an almost impossible bar for what I expected.While it didn't leave me completely terrified, I can see why it has developed such a dedicated following over the years. If you're a fan of atmospheric horror with a creeping sense of dread, it's definitely worth a watch, but perhaps temper your expectations a little, it's creepy, but not quite the nightmare some make it out to be.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
What nightmares are made of...,"This is a wonderfully shot film, an extremely unsettling chiller with a haunting soundtrack and a unique narrative that provides a great vehicle to move the story along.I was hooked from the opening credits right until the end, although the finale was a poor mans 'Let the Right One in' swimming pool purge. That aside, the story for me fueled several discussions. The overarching 'following' story line reminded me of some of my childhood nightmares of being continually stalked by some relentless demonic creature. Beyond that the obvious undertone of the spread of STI's as many have recounted, resonates with the passing of the curse via unprotected sex. For me, whether rightly or wrongly, the real subtext was the symbolism of having sex as the end of adolescence, innocence being lost. The following is something you become aware of with age, as you notice the passing of time. It's like death looming in the distance, you can forget about it, distract yourself, but it will keep returning. The bubble of childhood has been forever burst.Many have said that this film is not a horror or not scary, perhaps on the former they have some argument (although I disagree), but regarding the latter I always base my own views on whether I would watch this one alone at night, and I certainly would not watch this one on my own.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Cold Open to Beautiful Musical Colors,"IT FOLLOWS opens cold & wastes no time showing you the beauty it has in store for the viewers. The concept is simple enough & fresh although it does leave a few questions unanswered in the end allowing fans to discuss the ins & outs of how IT operates. I did truly enjoy this movie but to many situations happen off screen & questionable scenes that seemed to directly contradict the set up or the scene immediately before kept bringing my enjoyment to a halt.The movie holds its own when it comes to cinematography in its amazing color palette & beautiful wide shots. The music is also an absolute stand out. Great old school slasher-esque with pounding bass to drive home the stalking dread. These were my two highest points from this film as a whole. Closely followed by the overall concept & delivery.Maika Monroe's character Jay takes over the curse from Jeff Redman played by Jake Weary early on in the movie & we follow her & her closest friends as they try to simply survive IT. Most of the acting here is well delivered with one or two forgettable roles. Maika Monroe is not only the lead but is the stand out performance. Nobody was overwhelmingly bad in their performance.The Curse can be anywhere & anytime. Watching in the background for the extras brings an easy 2nd viewing. It is consistently building suspense & dread without becoming annoyingly repetitive while bringing you into the groups paranoia filled experiences. When the characters attempt to outsmart IT this sometimes can lead to both great simplistic prevention to completely unexplained set ups with almost no pay off. IT can take MANY forms & on the fly can shift into any desired form to deal with the situation it is facing.PROS:

well-crafted cat-and-mouse horror tail,"this isn't the scariest movie, but it's definitely a creepy and well executed horror flick. the directing and cinematography is top notch (good pacing, fluid editing, great use of wide-angles, and smooth camera movement to create tension and suspense). the soundtrack is also terrific - a blend of standard horror music cues with an 80s synth vibe. The premise is that there's an STD going around whereby when you sleep with someone, you become the target of these slow-moving (they basically just walk. it's a good thing they can't run...)supernatural beings who won't stop until they kill you. To make matters worse, these entities look like regular people and can only be seen by the people who have this curse. They look normal, but most of them are disheveled/disturbed in some way so as to appear unsettling - kudos to the costume department! So what it boils down to is, you feel as if you're being followed by these creepy stalkers, but you can't really tell if it's an actual person or something that's trying to kill you, and you're friends can't see them, so they probably think you're crazy. It's an intriguing and I think refreshingly unique premise.

Creepy!,"After being bugged by everyone and their brother to watch this movie I finally caved. I'm not really big into horror films because I don't like cheap thrills. Thankfully this movie has none of that. It relies souly on tension and fear of the unknown. The camera work in particular really helps build an atmosphere of uncertainty. I know lots of people talk about how this is a good throwback to 80s horror, but honestly I don't see that. The 80s used blood and gore to get the audience scared. This uses silence and pensiveness to create a dark mood and atmosphere. I do see how lots of people think this is an allegory for STDs and I think if you watch it with that deeper meaning in mind you will find it more enjoyable. My big hang up comes at the end of the film. It doesn't really feel like it end. We don't know if they beat the monster or not (probably not if they want a sequel) and that open-endedness just doesn't work for me here. The other big hang up I have is the same with all horror films: if there is a monster why not alert the cops? There's plenty of evidence for it and no doubt you could get some extra help. Overall I don't think their plan to stop ""It"" was a great idea either but now I'm just nitpicking. Great for some good tense scares!",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

You've got to show people up-close so we can see terror on their faces, show the scary things up-close so we get scared or jump out of our seats; focus on people's faces when they're talking rather than show them from a distance as if we were watching a family movie recorded on a handy cam!There were virtually no jump scares and the theme of the movie was beyond ridiculous and even if you find it to be an interesting topic, just by reading about it, you've seen the entire movie! So people have sex and they pass onto each other some kind of curse, which causes them to see ordinary-looking (and not even scary-looking) people ""walk slowly"" towards them ""from miles away"" (damn wide shots!), and then they have sex with others to pass the curse onto them; basically they turn into sluts with people offering to ""help"" them by having sex with them!!!

A curse that slowly and relentlessly gets to you,"David Robert Mitchell had a brilliant idea outlined for a horror film, one that has been commended for its originality leaving other modern films of the genre two steps behind.""It Follows"" revolves around a young girl, Jamie, who spends her time with her boyfriend, Hugh. One night after a date, they get intimate in the car, when suddenly Hugh knocks her out unconscious by using chloroform. She wakes up tied to a chair in an abandoned building where Hugh explains to her that she is now cursed and that no matter when or where, a supernatural entity will slowly follow here until it reaches her and consumes her. It is revealed that the curse can be lifted if she has sexual relations with someone else, therefore passing the curse to the other person. From here on, with the help or her friends, Jamie tries to figure out what to do next.
Maika Monroe gave a great performance as Jamie, having the puzzled appearance of a teenager trapped with her own demons.The idea of an entity following you restlessly until it gets to you is great. The fact that it can appear as anyone at any time, family member or random person on the street, makes it even more scarier. My only concern is that the way it was transmitted, by sexual encounter, and the plot involving teenagers adds up to what's typically a horror movie cliche. Naturally, you will be expected to see a lot of dumb decisions of that nature throughout the film.The film's pace is slow accompanied by eery music and it loses its focus here and there giving the movie a prolonged and jarring feeling. It definitely has some good moments, like the fact that the audience doesn't know if the person that walks towards the cursed one is a normal human being or the supernatural entity. That right there brings out more scares and excitement than the overused jump scares.""It Follows"" does not shape up in to a scary film, in a true ""cover your eyes"" way, instead it gives a feeling of petrifying terror about to hit at any moment.

A 1980's throwback without too many of the drawbacks,"(72%) After last year's brilliant 1980's throwback Cold in July, plus the decent, yet oddly and annoyingly overrated The guest, comes this which fits somewhere in between the two of them. Although it must be said this is the best new horror I've seen since the great Babadook. First of all, and from the very start, this is an almost faultlessly well made production crafted by the young David Robert Mitchell who puts considerably more experienced film makers to shame (Wes Craven I'm looking at you). The perfectly cast Maika Monroe shines twice as much here as she did in The guest simply because this is twice as well written, while her support is given enough weight for me to be invested in the unfolding events proving that making all or most of the cast into jackasses isn't the only way to make a teen based horror (Eli Roth, take notes). On the downside, and with all that's said and done, the plot isn't anything particularly groundbreaking. But I liked how the curse itself is left largely to the audience to figure out how exactly it operates with the somewhat flawed diagnosis of certain characters only going some of the way to explain what this thing actually is, which I thought really works among these young adults with their limited assumptions and rumour based understanding of it all. If you have any fondness for 80's flavoured, John Carpenter inspired horror, or just a good horror flick that are increasingly becoming rare these days, then this is more than good enough for a look.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

One of the Best Horror Movies of the Millennium!,"I just want to get this out of the way, I've been patiently waiting for It Follows since Cannes 2014 and have never been more excited for a single movie in my entire life! My expectations were through the roof, I of course had read to praise from critics all over the world saying 'It Follows is one of the best horror movies of the decade'. Which of course is very high praise (the same was said about last year's The Babadook, which I found to be true, it was also one of my favorite movies of the year), but does this year's It Follows live up to the title of being labeled one of the best horror movies of the millennium? Yes, no question about it!It Follows is the embodiment of tension and anxiety that we so rarely see in movies these days. Mitchell has created a perfect atmosphere full of dread, but more importantly he is able to create a nightmare with a dreamlike quality. The camera work is what helps make this idea flourish, wide angled shots mixed with slow panning shots revealing the monster lurking in the background. It Follows gets points for being terrifyingly original and creating a new nightmare where at all times you are never truly safe.And of course enough cannot be said about the general idea of sex and what it stands for. In the movie sex is used as the tool to pass to curse from one person to another. Obviously symbolizing that sex can kill (literally), but at the same time having sex is also seen as liberating (you free yourself by passing it onto another person). This is what makes It Follows so interesting, interrupting what the monster itself represents and witnessing how different people handle said curse. The females in the film handle the situation completely different from their male counterparts. The males try to pass the curse off as fast as possible and with little remorse, whereas the females seem to feel more guilty about passing it along and struggle with their new found nightmare. Without rambling on about the subtextual layer of the movie, just know that the movie is just as creepy as it sounds.Outside of that, the high point of the film has to be the original score by Disasterpeace, it's one of the best horror soundtracks in decades! The music is what makes the movie tick, it plays over the vast majority of the film and it is played very loudly to help squeeze out the most tension possible from each scene. With a killer soundtrack, fantastic cinematography, and a terrifying premise, It Follows is easily worthy of being labeled a future horror classic!",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Different and Unexpected,"It Follows you is certainly refreshing in this day and age of horror films. Not once does it rely on a jump scare. It doesn't even rely on gore too much. It just is quite unsettling at times. I like the fact that there isn't much back story about this so called ""it"". I think that makes it even more creepier. You don't what it is, where it came from, how to stop it. It's just there...and you can't do anything about it. It's incredibly effective and I wish more writers/directors/producers were taking risks and coming up with more original content like this.Now while I certainly like the idea behind this movie, I wish they maybe had a different cast or more interesting characters. I wasn't that compelled by the lead actress. She certainly was better than the majority of the cast, but there was a number of times where she just seemed flat and emotionless. And I'm talking about BEFORE the attack when her life was normal. The scenes with her hanging out with her friends are boring, her going out on a date was boring. There was nothing really interesting about the characters themselves. And that sucks because I felt like I could have given up on this movie so easily. Sometimes, the direction just seemed like it was trying to hard to be artsy fartsy. Like, oooh lets a close-up of her lining up blades of grass on her leg. Why? Why is that needed? And I didn't care for the score either. Trying to hard to be reminiscent of the 80s.What truly makes this film work, and why I think its worth a watch is because ""IT"" is effective. I honestly had a knot in my stomach during the horror parts. Sometimes what is most scary is that feeling of helplessness. And that is what this movie accomplishes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

cool horror flick,"While aspects of this film are seemingly amateur, it's impossible to say there are not impressive elements. For every shortcoming in the script and average scene of acting, there is a few jaw dropping shots to recover the experience. The set design is both modern and a throwback, creating an oddly familiar but eerie Detroit suburbia. The dynamic of the young adults/fresh out of teen works just fine, but all eyes are on the antagonist, Maika Monroe, who while isn't particularly special from a acting performance standpoint, does just fine in playing the victim of the entity that is passed through literal intercourse, a weird role to ask of a young actress. If one was to tell you that there was a horror film about a STD demon, you wouldn't envision something quite this artsy.

"Great throwback to 70's horror, very clever and a genuinely frightening experience","A horror movie is like a roller coaster. It's scary, but you're having fun because you know that it's perfectly safe. The scarier it gets, the more entertaining it is because it pulls you deeper into the story until you forget entirely that you're in the theatre watching a piece of fiction. I just saw ""The Babadook"" a week ago and I didn't expect to see another great horror film in at least a year but Christmas (or is it Halloween?) has come early because ""It Follows"" is here and it's a truly frightening film. I loved it.The premise is simple and yet so ingenious. After Jay (Meika Monroe) has sex with Hugh (Jake Weary), a boy she has been dating and likes quite a bit, he gives her a grave bit of news. She's now the carrier of a curse. In the distance, invisible to everyone except those who have been afflicted, is something. This thing, whatever it is, is coming for her. It doesn't move quickly, but it's relentless. It won't ever stop until Jay passes the curse onto someone else, or is dead.This picture is going to be interpreted in a lot of different ways. To me, this is a story about the thing that everyone fears the most, death. You can avoid it for a while if you stay smart, you eat well and you exercise regularly... but it's still coming. It's not even as simple as just keeping an eye out for your inevitable demise and moving out of the way at the last second either because no one knows how they're going to die. No one is going to be able to keep an eye out for you (because in this instance, the monster is invisible to everyone else) and you might not know that you're about to die until it's too late.A detail that you need to know about this monster is that if you're cursed, you can see it... but you don't really know what it looks like because it's a shape shifter. It can look like anyone and the only giveaway is that it's always walking in a straight line towards you. This aspect, the fact that you can see it coming is where the cinematography of this movie comes in. This movie will make you insanely paranoid because you will never know for sure if the monster is on-screen. Every time you see someone walking and they're not interacting with anyone else, you will begin to feel a creeping chill up your spine. ""Please don't let it get any closer, please, SOMEONE notice that some stranger is walking towards the camera!"" It's absolutely nerve-wracking because of the fact that it doesn't run, or wield a big butcher knife or anything like that. It just walks. The slow speed brings in an element of hope that evenly spreads the terror throughout the entire film like peanut butter on a slice of toast. It seems like it would be so easy to get away from it, or even to get rid of the curse. I mean look at it, it's so slow! The problem is that it never stops. If you start running through traffic in an attempt to get away and you get hit by a car, it's still coming at the same pace. If you try to steal a bike, you get caught by the police and then thrown in jail, that cell won't protect you because you know this thing is going to gain ground as you wait sentencing. It looks like your only hope is to pray that you figure out a way to take it down, you spot it early enough to keep moving or you damn someone else to this horrible fate to save yourself.A big part of this movie is the cinematography. On the big screen, I found myself constantly looking around trying to see if the creature approaching was approaching somewhere in the distance, or hiding behind some fence or bush. But wait a second, why would I want to see it? Is it because the reassurance that I can identify it makes it less frightening? Not really because that means it's getting closer. Which one is worse then, the fact that I CAN see it, meaning that I know to run, or that I can't see it, which means that either it's only a matter of time before it arrives, or that I've failed to recognize it? There's a whole lot of atmosphere generate by the way the movie is shot, but also by the score. The music here brings me back to some of my favourite horror films. I'm talking about pictures like ""Halloween"" and ""Assault on Precinct 13"" where the score doesn't give you hints of what is about to happen or how you're supposed to feel as much as it reminds you that there is nowhere that is truly safe and that you need to pay attention because any oversight could mean a painful and gruesome death.I loved the story, so simple and to-the-point while still having some fun with its premise and plenty of intelligent developments. I liked the characters because they were intelligent and had at least a theoretical chance of surviving (unlike in so many slasher films where the villain is going to win, or at least be back for the sequel for sure). I loved the music because it perfectly captured and amplified how I felt as I grasped the gravity of the situation. I can't say enough good things about the overall execution, which demonstrates that a horror movie can be more than cheap jump scares and senseless gore thrown left and right. It's the simple, memorable and chilling imagery that still haunts me right now as I type this. I found ""It Follows"" to be immensely frightening and I can't wait to watch it again.

Interesting plot,"It Follows (2014)It Follows is a supernatural psychological horror film directed by David Robert Mitchell.Besides Keir Gilchrist, I don't know the cast or the actors. Keir Gilchrist is pretty famous nowadays, through the Netflix Original series ""Atypical"".This horror film is about a 19-year-old girl, who is pursued by a supernatural entity after a sexual encounter. Now she must continue to have sex to avoid it. The entity is, that people randomly walk straight in here direction. Only she can see and interact with them. Everyone else can't see them.Already in the beginning, the director creates many scenes, which are inspired from Halloween (1978) by John Carpenter. Across the whole film, there are a lot of wide shots, the use of wide-angle lenses is obvious. This gives the film an expansive look. The camera is far away from the main events and follows people walking thru the streets. In the background we still see the ""typical"" American life, people are cleaning there cars or slice there bushes.Furthermore, the music is brilliant. The composer creates a strident, uncomfortable and unpleasant soundtrack. Of course these adjectives doesn't sound convenient, but they fit perfect into this horror movie.In conclusion, this horror movie is pretty good. Basically a 7 out of 10. Especially the plot, which is extraordinary and not basic, is implemented very well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Reliving the eighties terror,"Horror cinema has changed a lot over time and different offers have been made to try to renew or return to past methods. It Follows is a proposal that takes up the eighties style of horror films of that time. It uses a lot of suspense, teenage protagonists and the concept of ""those who have sex end up dead"" taken to another level. It's a pretty fresh film, with a new concept and it feels quite eighties. Of course it is not a movie for everyone because of how soft and slow it is. It has a solid script and the execution is quite clean, although the film itself looks simple and does not generate much expectation. It is understood that they wanted to return to the eighties style, which they do manage to achieve, but it is not something so striking for the current era. It is not easy to adapt the eighties style to the current era due to how cinema has changed and it is a style that has already become outdated or obsolete. Its strongest point is undoubtedly the score, which is heavily inspired by the style of John Carpenter. It is not a very exciting film, since we are talking about an independent product that could have offered much more, but at least it revives a little that eighties air that made horror films shine back then. It Follows is an ordinary film like many, but it probably has what it takes to be a future cult film. My final rating for this movie is a 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The best supernatural horror flick I've seen in 40 years,"Most critics allude to young writer/director David Robert Mitchell's gem as having ""borrowed"" from previous teen slasher movies such as Halloween etc. I beg to differ, I suspect the author marches to the beat of a very different drummer. Perhaps David Rose's 1988 ""Paperhouse"" was an influence, in the way its supernatural happenings follow a rigidly structured contextual logic? But I also wonder if the director ever read works by Dr M.R. James? I see many ideas from the late M.R. James's tales in the plot structure. ""Oh Whistle and I'll Come to You My Lad"": a terrifying ghost comes after a hapless professor through an artifact discovered in the ruins of a templars' preceptory. ""Canon Alberic's Scrap Book"" a sacristan rids himself of a malevolent demon by selling priceless manuscripts to an unsuspecting collector. ""Casting the Runes"": the victim narrowly escapes death by surreptitiously returning the runic manuscript to its perpetrator. ""A warning to the Curious"": the vindictive ghost tricks his victim into following him to his doom by imitating his two companions. Few young authors get it so right so early in their careers; Mitchell has the keen instinct to avoid all the usual plot clichés, gratuitous boo moments and silliness that have ruined 99% of those unwatchable failures of this genre. I enjoyed this movie so much, I'm almost tempted to try my hand at writing a script of my own.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Guard your body,"If you like horror slowly creeping up at you, you might be able to like a lot. You have to suspend your disbelief a lot. The characters seem to live for the movies purpose only.

'It Follows' Doesn't Follow Teen-Horror Rules,"""It Follows"" (2014) is almost the opposite of the typical teen horror flick.It's an indie-style suspense film rather than a slick, studio slasher romp. No himbos or playmates in an exotic locale, just average-looking teens in a blue-collar suburb of Detroit. It has a gritty, low- budget look that fits its setting, without bloody special effects. The cast includes nobody you've ever heard of, though lead actress Maika Monroe appears in this summer's ""Independence Day: Resurgence.""""It Follows"" upends the horror-morality trope in which the sexually active die first and only the pure survive. In this case, the ""haunting"" literally is a sort of STD (sexually transmitted demon). One passes it to another, who then will be stalked by the zombie-like presence.Our heroine, Jay Height, has back-seat sex with her new boyfriend (not on the first date). Afterward, she wakes bound, with the now-panicked boyfriend telling her she needs to pass on the haunting to someone else. She's a chick, he basically says; it should be easy for her to find another guy willing to have sex. He urges her to do it quickly, too, because if she died first, the haunting would revert back to him.The moral dilemma, then, is whether she should do unto others as he did to her – or, with the help of her friends, find some other way to shed the haunting.###Stu Robinson practices writing, editing, media relations and social media through his business, Phoenix-based Lightbulb Communications.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"A welcome return to low budget, minimalist horror","Being followed is more frightening, and prolonged, than any other type of scare, as this weird, wholly original low budgeter proves. A young girl finds a shape-shifting supernatural being following her after a bizarre sexual encounter.Is ""it"" a metaphor for sexual regret?She then attempts to figure what ""it"" is, and how to rid herself of ""it"".Clever film wisely avoids shaky cam, and needlessly cheap jumpscares, instead building feelings of dread and fear and unease. And disorientation: people have cell phones and tablets, but also 1970s television sets (and a lot of them shown throughout the entire film) Does this occur in present day, 2010s, or in the 1970s? And where is the story set? It almost looks like California in some scenes, maybe Detroit slums in others (pool scene takes place in an abandoned Detroit Rec. Centre, though)Subtle, quiet horror also benefits from its intentionally disorienting photography, in which the background action is the focus of some scenes, not the foreground.Story implies that she gives ""it"" to someone else, with the intention of him quickly giving it to a prostitute- but it wouldn't take ""it"" long to stalk and kill them and be right back after her again. The same can be said about implications of her banging one or more of the guys on the boat in the lake.Abrupt, anticlimactic ending, yet it works on several levels.I didn't understand the purpose of the flatulent, constantly chewing character, Yara, who seemed to be nothing more than a pity friend, someone the main characters hung out with only because they felt sorry for her, not because they were really friends, or because she had anything to do with the plot. My interest waned in the penultimate scene, as Yara chewed and read aloud, I found my mind start to wander momentarily.A good double feature can be made with this film and the simultaneously released, Unfriended.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Defining Horror of the Twenty First Century,"In the past decade horror has become a breeding ground for cheap, lousy and poor filmmaking. It mostly comes down to sequels, prequels, remakes, rip-offs and reboots. We have been treated to vile, repulsive and downright disgusting franchises that should have been buried in the dirt a long time ago. Tedious franchises like 'Paranormal Activity' and the 'Nightmare on Elm Street' sequels. They refuse to die. Because who cares about bad reviews when the box office receipts speak volumes.Alas, I am beginning to speak off topic so let me attract your attention to the latest Horror masterpiece that is, 'It Follows'. The premise itself is surprisingly original and frightening of its own accord. The lead woman, Jay is a vulnerable nineteen year old and most importantly an independent character which is refreshing for a horror film. She is like any other girl that is nearing womanhood who just wants to chill out with her friends, be popular and go out on dates with guys.Jay meets up with the new guy in town, Hugh. He strikes her as a confident and caring person. They go out on several dates, but when they go out to the cinema things start to go a bit odd. Hugh tells Jay that someone is watching them, but only Hugh appears to be able to see this person. They promptly leave the cinema and proceed to make love in a car. How romantic! Jay loses focus and realises until it is too late that Hugh is about to knock her out. She wakes up; strapped to a chair by her hands and feet. Hugh points something out that is far off moving slowly towards them. Hugh then tells Jay that he has transmitted a virus onto her. This virus makes a human like being stalk you everywhere you go, until it finds and kills you. The only way to avoid this horrid fate is to pass it onto another host through sex. After this information Jay is understandably traumatised. She confesses to her close friends, yet believes that if she tells her parents they will think that she needs medical treatment.What makes the villain so effective and disturbing is its simplicity with which it dispatches its many victims. We never see the true form of the follower and this approach makes it even scarier. It takes human form and can replicate the look of your best friend. Unless you have one that is constantly drooling and walking slowly I would not panic. Well this is what I thought at first and felt that Jay was in no immediate danger; as the follower stalks its victims with the same immediacy as the zombies in 'Shaun of the Dead', very slowly then. However, it never stops, never shows any mercy and never appears to have any real meaningful motive to speak of. You would believe that the villain at first glance is underdeveloped and weak, that may be the case, but for Horrors it is a godsend. We never properly see it, so what terrifies us the most is left to our imagination and instinct of fear. The fact that it never has a reason for what it does means that you cannot change its mind. It just wishes to kill you. There are several set pieces each one topping the last in terms of creativity and how they all differentiate themselves from the other. The locations may seem bland, but the everyday can make us shiver none the less, because they are places that we can identify with. We feel complacent and relaxed, what 'It Follows' makes us do, is become paralysed by fear when revisiting well known locations like, our home, school, the beach, the cinema and the local swimming pool.I used to think that horrors where limited in terms of the time of day. But this one proves that daylight can in fact be more fear inducing than utter darkness. You can see everyone and everything, but the follower could be the person standing next to you or off in the far distance. Jay begins to realise that she will never be able to keep her guard down for too long if she wishes to survive. The time flies by and when the lights came on, I was as shocked as anyone in the cinema, that this masterwork of fear, art and terror was over. I wish it would never end!Many other factors of 'It Follows' continue to stalk my mind and dreams. The music sounds like it was taken from the seventies and ties in with themes of danger and loss of innocence. The cinematography is low key yet still manages to look as glorious as a paint stroke from Mr Turner. Every shot is calculated and excellent. Expect the Director David Robert Mitchell to become as widely congratulated as Stanley Kubrick and Alfred Hitchcock the acclaimed masters of suspense and horror. I honestly cannot praise this film highly enough! Even the female lead that is fairly unknown, the wickedly talented Maika Monroe shows a surprising amount of skill in front of the camera. This is sure to be the film that catapults her towards stardom and fame. Monroe is ever so convincing as the petrified Jay who finds it harder to lead a normal life. Made all the worse by the follower and the fact that only its victims can see it. She outdoes herself and as an actress is sure to lead a long astonishing set of performances in her wake.'It Follows' is not only the greatest horror to grace our screens in 2014. It is also the best since the original 'Alien'; suspenseful, wicked, cruel, nail biting and harsh. The film always connects us through an immense leading role from Maika Monroe.

"Interesting, but it still fails to deliver its best","The first half of the movie is sort of creepy and atmospheric. The idea that any stranger from the crowd, can be ""it"", is done in simple, and effective way. But the second part of the movie is predictable. One of the problems, especially in the second part is that the characters are not very interesting. ""The first kiss boy"" actor was very cool in ""The united states of Tara"", while here he is totally inadequate, looks like a boring gay younger brother, so its not very likely that he can be some sexual object for girls. Also, the kids mostly look like they are coming from some lower-middle class background. But actually most of the film is filmed in some awkward spaces, where only homeless people and white trash crowd hangs out. So, the concepts are mixed in a weird way, and the atmosphere is in the end quite unconvincing. The ""Johny Depp"" looking guy from the first half of the movie is kind of pathetic cliche.

"It doesnt ""Follow you""....","""It Follows"" (2014) is widely regarded as a refreshing and inventive addition to the horror genre, praised for its unique concept and effective execution. The film, directed by David Robert Mitchell, garnered acclaim for its atmospheric cinematography, evocative score, and its ability to create a pervasive sense of dread.One of the standout features of ""It Follows"" is its innovative premise. The film centers around a supernatural entity that passes from person to person through sexual contact. Once infected, the protagonist, Jay, is pursued by an entity that can take on the appearance of anyone and can only be seen by those who are infected. This premise serves as a metaphor for the consequences of casual sex, adding depth to the film beyond its horror elements.The cinematography by Mike Gioulakis is crucial to the film's success. The deliberate pacing, long takes, and wide shots contribute to the film's eerie and suspenseful atmosphere. The suburban setting, filled with abandoned buildings and a timeless quality, enhances the feeling of isolation and impending danger.Rich in symbolism, ""It Follows"" also explores themes of adolescence, sexuality, and the inevitability of death. The film successfully balances its horror elements with a coming-of-age narrative, creating a unique and layered viewing experience.The electronic score by Disasterpeace is haunting and complements the film's atmosphere perfectly. The music adds an otherworldly quality to the story, enhancing the sense of unease and building tension throughout.The performances, particularly that of Maika Monroe as Jay, are generally well-received. Monroe brings vulnerability and strength to her role, making Jay a relatable and sympathetic protagonist.While some critics may argue that the film's deliberate ambiguity and open-ended conclusion leave unanswered questions, many viewers appreciate the room for interpretation and the sense of lingering unease it creates.In conclusion, ""It Follows"" stands out as a thought-provoking and original horror film that reinvigorated the genre. Its combination of a unique concept, atmospheric cinematography, and thematic depth contributes to its status as a modern horror classic.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Unique Horror Story about the responsibility of Adulthood,I've seen this movie twice now with the second time being an accident after having forgot I watched the movie years before.It follows could mean lots of things but I think it has a lot to do with the idea of being sexually responsible about who you sleep with or your sexual past might come to haunt you. In this movie it literally does.It's hard to pinpoint the ages the kids in the film are supposed to be but the best logic is that they're fresh out of highschool and adapting to the independence of adult hood. They still live at home and they still have the highschool friendship bond going on.I kind of like to think of it that they're at the age of breaking innocence. The main character of the story a young innocent girl looking for a steady boyfriend gets tricked into sleeping with someone who only intended to use her for sex but instead of parting her with an STD he parts her with the burden of some ghastly spirit that can kill her if it catches up to her.The movie plays out with the main character trying to balance both her personal and sexual morals with the idea of surviving.Overall the movie takes you on a pretty suspenseful run. It ties a classic element of horror and that's just genuinely being terrified by being pursued. It's been a while since I've seen a horror movie that's made that fun and exciting again.,7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Back to the Basics....,"Remember the first time you saw Michael Myers spying on Jamie Lee Curtis when she was walking home from school, in the original Halloween? The simplicity of that scene; from the soundtrack to the non-use of gore, was terrifying. He was just standing there, watching her. You knew what was going to happen later, and that scene allowed your mind to run away with the possibilities of terror that would ensue. As I watched ""It Follows"", that's exactly how I felt for the majority of the film. Terrifying simplicity, with a soundtrack/score that is OUT OF THIS WORLD Excellent. I actually believe that the music during this movie contributed more than anything else. So good I've pre-ordered it on vinyl. The cast is fresh and talented, and you won't recognize the villain until it is almost too late. See it, now.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A chilling take on 80s teen horror films,"From the moment the film opens to the last seconds, there is always a sense that something isn't right. The music is hinting at an inevitable threat, the camera is slowly panning or tracking in order to help reveal what is lurking, and the actors interactions with one another make the audience forget that at any moment ""it"" will appear. Director David Robert Mitchell does something that many horror-genre filmmakers have lost sight of: what scares people the most is their imagination. Yes, the film occasionally showcases some terrifying images, but it's the moments when everything seems fine where the fear skyrockets out of the audience. I'm not going to say that this is the scariest film I've ever seen, but when it resembles the thread of ""A Nightmare on Elm Street,"" the tension of ""Alien,"" and the style of ""The Conjuring,"" it comes pretty close to it. It is very original, well executed, and a refreshing film for all cinephiles. But most importantly, it stays with you even after the movie ends and makes you question your actions...and your surroundings.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"A weird , bizarre horror movie with chills , thrills and scary events","In the opening scene, a young woman is fleeing from someone or something .

It is full of thrilling moments that are intended to be surprising, but end up being monotonous when dealing with situations that we have already seen countless times . A sinister and unsettling flick that goes on growing more and more and developing little by little until the predictable conclusion. The movie takes influence from Halloween (1978) and its sequels , getting inspiration several gory horror films of the 70s and 80s. This freaky and thrilling film chronicles fear , desperation, suffering of a young girl who has to make thorny decisions while escalating danger and facing off a completely horrible situation .

As well as night but colorful cinematography by cameraman Mike Gioulakis that was heavily inspired by John Carpenter films. The motion picture was well directed by David Robert Mitchell , though really slow-moving and leisurely paced and taking tropes from the '60s to the '80s , especially from slasher classics . The filming took place mainly with wide-angle lenses to give the film a more expansive, intimidating feel . Michell has cited the works of George A.

Without all the frills...just the fears,"It Follows delves back into the horror genre to a time when subtlety and score can be more terrifying than shock and gore. There are moments when characters simply look up at the sky, watch a squirrel on a telephone wire, or view a vacant yard with nothing but the sound of the wind - a false sense of calm to bring feelings of dread. The film score is synthesized with a mix similar to Charles Bernstein (A Nightmare on Elmstreet) and Vangelis (Blade Runner), and there are nods in style to Halloween (1978) and A Nightmare on Elm street (1984). Much like his first film, The Myth of the American Sleepover, director David Robert Mitchell takes the necessary time to introduce his characters and give them depth before placing them in harms way. It is a horror film as flawless and as terrifying as it can get, without all the frills...just the fears. Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Gorgeously Shot and Full of Atmosphere,"This is probably the closest in visual tone and mood to the horror films of the 70's and 80's without becoming an obnoxious and self-aware throwback. It uses a lot of the trademarks of those films like the colorful widescreen photography, creeping dread, and otherworldly synth score to create tension. The story, while strong at first, does hit a few problem areas midway through, but the experience is still worth it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
You're next. You really are.,"Before he made Under the Silver Lake, writer-director David Robert Mitchell gave us this and its predecessor, The Myth of the American Sleepover, two movies about teenagers living in Detroit suburbs. Detroit, its downtown famously now in a state of near total necrotic decline, has lately been described as a potential or actual donut or ring city, a place with no centre or a dead centre, the life and economic activity occurring only in the periphery. This matters thematically here because the run-down dead centre is a forbidden place - the characters talk about how when they were younger their parents told them not to go beyond the Eight Mile road, the boarder before the dereliction of the middle - and now, twice, they have to go into it to chase down the horror that is pursuing them. Each time, they leave the leafy middle-class security of the 'burbs to enter a realistically frightening landscape of burnt-out, abandoned houses and other buildings, some of them with the crumbling grandeur of haunted mansions and mausoleums. The metaphorical implication might be: the cause of this decay is not staying put; it's coming for you too.

"Misled by ""scary"" reviews & Thoughts on establishing rules","I was thrown off by the time period in which the movie supposedly takes place. It was intentional per the director, but it was distracting. I think the movie needs to tell the viewer when the setting is somehow to let them know the ""rules""- for example a kid can't have a cell phone in a 90s movie, but it's expected for a movie in present day.There isn't a lot of dialogue, a vast majority of the ""sound"" is a very 80s dreamlike synthesizer which adds to the dreamy direction of the movie. It's very prettily filmed, but there are a lot of slowly- turning shots which seem pointless. There are also a few times that the director started a sense of dread with a scene, then messes it up with his choices. Here's what I mean: there is a scene where Jay (the protagonist) is walking through a dark house, the camera follows behind her, closely, so you know something is coming, but you don't know where. Right before the reveal happens, the director switches the shot to film from the monster's perspective in the next room, so when Jay walks into the room and is surprised, we aren't. The movie's ""rules"" for the monster are pretty rigid- it walks slowly in a straight line to its intended target, so by definition, you know that Jay isn't going to be surprised from behind, because it doesn't appear out of thin air. My point is, what could've been a good climax to a build up, ends up being secondhand.The final confrontation with the monster seems to bend the rules already established in the movie, so it falls flat. There are also two scenes in which two characters appear as if they are going to pass it on to random hosts, but nothing is shown (all other sexual encounters are) so it ends up again leading the viewer to question the established rules.Overall, I was extremely disappointed because I had read multiple accounts of this being the scariest movie in a decade, and I loved the concept, but the movie just isn't scary, and there are too many questions to make it a good piece of film. I'm not going to destroy it in the ratings because there is much worse (and the acting was actually good) but I feel like I'm below the average here, so I gave it a 6.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Not good, don't believe the hype or the high rating.","Looks like a slightly above average high school film project. The score is horrible, ""done in three weeks"" yeah we can tell. Reminds me of an old (black and white) Doctor Who episode scoring. Acting is OK, but the plot is sluggish and weak. The pace is glacial though picks up a bit towards the end. The premise is illogical, pointless, and not explained at all. The high IMDb rating fooled me into watching, good job fake reviewers! I'll make sure to check into all the reviews next time a questionable movie pops up. Only good thing about the movie is it being set in Detroit and only because I'm familiar with the Detroit area. Would rate a 2 except for all the 4 and 5 star ratings. Take a pass on this ""film"".",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A retro allegory for the anxieties of adulthood.,"I'm not usually one for horror, but I do appreciate films that use the genre to explore interesting themes. It Follows is hardly scary. A couple disturbing scenes perhaps, but it cushions the threatened protagonist by always keeping her company with her friends. This is not a film that uses isolation to its advantage for suspense. The menace doesn't care. But how the 'it' manifests itself is irrelevant, it's a coming-of-age film using a stalking terror as an allegory for the anxieties of adulthood. Sure, it could also be about sexually transmitted diseases given its teenage cast and the method of the monster, but the beauty of It Follows is that it works for any interpretation. The former is the one that resonated with me the most, hinted in an early scene where the protagonist hangs out with who later becomes the person who gives her 'it.' There's an odd nostalgia about it, conjured by the vibrant cinematography and retro score, but Mitchell keeps it fresh. The only misstep is the misconceived third act where the characters are essentially asking for the trouble they receive but the humanistic approach Maika Monroe takes to her character saves it from feeling too removed.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Solid but unremarkable,"Obviously, this is a tribute to older horror classics like Halloween and Nightmare on Elm St, so to call it unoriginal would be missing the point.

The music is fantastic (very John Carpenter) and I particularly enjoyed the deliberate ambiguity regarding the decade this story is set. Overall, this movie hits all the right notes without really bringing anything new to the table. Younger viewers who are new to horror and have never seen the classics it borrows from will most likely enjoy it immensely.

I wanted to be Blair Witched – to leave the cinema with a deep sense of unease. But that didn't happen. I enjoyed the film, and there were some really good tense, scary moments in it. But for me it took a wrong turn about halfway through and that meant that it didn't really deliver on the 'horror' bit of the deal – it didn't really get under my skin. I reckon, however, that it's a good film, well made, and as such it will work really well as a horror movie for some people.

Hype,"I'm normally, like many people I suspect, underwhelmed by films that get a lot of hype. And I'm glad to say, not this time. Was meaning to watch it for weeks, and it did not disappoint.These are exciting times for independent films. Last year I was blown away by Blue Ruin and The Guest, and now this one. In the latter two, it very likely has something to do with the fact that the film makers are clearly inspired by the awesomeness of John Carpenter's Golden Age.Score: Brilliant and effective.Photography: Great overall. Some shots I didn't quite understand and found slightly amateurish, others, including the now notorious opening shot, are inspired.Acting: Solid enough. Really liking in particular the new girl on the block: Maika Monroe. Very convincing, and beautiful though not in the conventional Hollywood way.You can feel that the film comes from the heart, and it's apparently inspired by a real nightmare. It really comes across, and effectively captures a dream-like atmosphere.What's also very original is the concept that you can, in theory, physically avoid ""it"" for the rest of your life. As we see several times, the infected can just circle around it while thinking about his or her next exit.

Terrifying to the Bone.,"This film is like if slender man were an STD, and it's terrifying. The reason I bring that up is many people, myself included, have been calling for a slender man film. The music helps feed the tone, and it feels like a true homage to 80's horror films (the best time for horror, no doubt.) The film has a way of always making you feel uneasy right up to the final scene, as the villain could be anybody who's walking at an average speed. This leads to everybody being a potential candidate for this creatures form. Despite undeveloped characters and a slight lack of humor the film completely delivers.

Does it really follow,"The movie was quite nice and it contained a lot of twists and spooky moments that would surprise you as most of the horror movies do. However, the events seem to accelerate and some scenes should have been added. By the end of the movie we would still ask the question: what was it?Also,as the characters didn't get the answer of ""why"", the reader is also waiting the cause of this thing that doesn't give up.The plethora of horror movies and with their relative similarity makes it a challenge to come with a disruptive plot that would change that pattern of our deeper fears and thoughts. the frames and scenes try to simulate a the psychotic environment of people who are under some psychological problems that even prevent them from sleeping. Scientists said that if we don't sleep for more than 60 hours, we start to hear sounds. The movie made me wonder whether what we see is what we always get since our imperfect minds may create deceptive illusion that we would believe easily and we would find it hard to dispose of.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
OK but overpraised,"Indie horror film that's actually playing at mainstream cinemas. It's about a teenage girl who has sex with a guy she just met. Then he tells her she's marked for death. She'll see people walking to her and, if they get her, will kill her. The catch is no one else can see them--only her. The only way to get rid of this is to have sex with someone else and it will pass on to them.The premise is certainly original and the film is well-done but some critics are acting like this is a masterpiece. It's good but not THAT good. It was shot on location in Detroit and took advantage of the run-down part of the city. Everything looks grimy and dingy perfectly setting the tone for the movie. Also there's an eerie and impressive music score that really helps. Also there's only one jump scare and not much blood or gore at all. There are also two sequences which scared me silly. The acting is, at best, OK. No one is terrible but no one is really good either.The main problem here is that the movie is too laid-back. These teenagers take everything way too casually--even when they start being attacked or are killed. It sort of mutes the movie. Still it works more often than it doesn't.

"Creepy, but not scary. Atmospheric, no tension. Missed opportunity.","There are many types of horror movies: gore porn, slasher movies with jump scares galore, and the slow paced creepy and eerie atmospheric films. It seems with the success of ""Paranormal Activity"" and ""The Conjuring"", the latter style is becoming more and more popular. ""It Follows"" follows in the same vain.It is slow, but well-paced, has a great accompanying soundtrack which build on overbearing sense of dread. However, what it is not is scary. The problem lies within its premise. It is unique and interesting – an STD that comes with your own personal spirit-thing that tries to kill you. It slowly and unendingly walks towards you, and if it gets you, it kills you. The emphasis here is on the word slow. It doesn't even walk at a normal speed. You could just briskly walk away from it.

A modern horror masterpiece with a hint of the 80's,"It Follows is a brilliant movie. The whole idea of something constantly following you, something you can never escape that can look like anyone, someone you know, someone you don't, is a great idea for a horror movie.And this movie pulls that idea off almost flawlessly.The only thing I don't like about the film is that 'The It' is basically a sexually transmitted infection. When you have sex, you pass the it on to that person. It then begins to follow them. Once that person has been killed, it's believed that it goes back to the previous person and so on and so forth. The rules haven't been made fully clear though and the director states the only rules we get are what we are told in the film and are only what the character knows, therefore they could be incorrect.Other than the whole having sex angle and the film obviously being a giant half metaphor for unsafe sex, it's a funny, horrific, amazing movie which shows what would be truly terrifying in real life.I just love how it tries a more subtle way of scaring you instead of straight forward jump scares. Except for once, which didn't make me jump. Also how it adds depth to the characters and story, making the perfect example of what an out of place horror should be. But with an all new type of suspense and atmosphere, one I can happily say I've never experienced while watching any other film.The actors are great, the writing and directing are great, and the score is beautifully haunting, reminiscent of early John Carpenter. If David Robert Mitchell sticks to the horror genre, he could easily be the next John Carpenter as it isn't only the score where the similarities exist.I'm looking forward to his next film and I'm pretty sure he's stated there's to be a sequel to It Follows, which I'm certain will be just as amazing as the first.A well earned 9/10I wanted to begin the film again as soon as the credits began to roll.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Could have been much better but nice effort.,"Because of the high ratings I expected to be well entertained with this movie, especially because it's a horror movie and horror movies rarely tend to get high ratings.

Much better then the usual stuff we get to see. It could have been way better if they had put some scarier people following because now the followers were just random figures that were not that scary at all.

This is the stuff of nightmares,"It is indie horror films like 'It Follows' that are the reason why i still have much faith in future of the horror genre. Whenever a film like this comes out where it manages to scare you from start to finish without using jump scares and other modern horror movie clichés i get really excited. This film utilised amazing camera techniques and sounds that alone just absolutely scare the crap out of you just like old, classic horror films used to. I found myself constantly trying to hide from the screen because the imagery was just so damn terrifying. Much of the film uses the idea that someone might be following you at all times to get you to always be in fear no matter what is happening. As well as being a device to scare the living daylights out of you it really helps to keep the story moving and adds to some pretty major plot points. Also there are scenes where this mysterious thing actually shows up and that is just the stuff of nightmares. I felt like a little kid looking up and getting the life scared out of me by anything that looked even remotely weird. In terms of the plot, the film does well to stay away from 95% of predictable moments and that really helps in a horror film so you don't have much time to brace for a huge scary moment (not a jump scare).In terms of performances, i thought they were pretty good all round, with the standout being Maika Monroe who i also remember did a great job in The Guest last year. You always bought into her actions and the way she reacted to certain events which made the film a lot more believable. Where the film let me down was towards the end. The ending sequence of the movie was still pretty damn terrifying but not as terrifying as the rest of the movie, it felt a little cheesy or messy and i was just taken out of the film for a little over 10 minutes. Not only did the ending sequence disappoint me but the very very end didn't work for me, there are quite a few films that do this and sometimes it works, but sometimes it doesn't and this time it didn't. So despite a disappointing ending, this directorial debut for David Robert Mitchell will keep you up for days with endless nightmares. - 8.1",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Stylistically beautiful and distinct - It Follows is not quite horrifying,"David Robert Mitchell should be proud of his accomplishments with It Follows - a moody and stylish horror that welcomes him to the film making scene.It Follows has a promising premise and the direction of its screenwriter and director David Robert Mitchell shows a passion and vision for details. As a horror, It Follows fails to scare and is more of a highlight reel for Mitchell's cinematic resume.In It Follows, a young woman named Jay (Maika Monroe) is kidnapped after a sexual encounter with a boy and told that she has now been passed a malevolent entity that will follow her, and if it catches her, kill her. The only way to save herself is to pass it on to someone else. Jay tries elude the force without dooming another soul, imploring her friends to help save her from the thing that predatorily lurks in the shadows.The entire foundation of the film's presence, an evil being that follows you long after a sexual encounter, feels very much sponsored by some uber-Christian organization for abstinence propaganda. This vibe is not necessarily a bad thing in terms of the film's experience upon the viewer, just an observation of the myriad subtext one can take from the movie's plot.Stylistically and cinematically, It Follows is a dream – the influences from which director David Robert Mitchell pulls for this movie are clear and distinct. Burgeoning film makers and photography aficionados will take note of the artistry in the purposeful framing and perspective of certain scenes and the tone of the overall film.David Robert Mitchell still has much to learn in terms of story telling as the horror and terror never truly bubbles to the surface. Slow to a fault, it seem unimaginable that a film this painstakingly paced would resort only to exposition to reveal the plot. Had the viewer also been on a journey to discover the being, rather than a third party spectator, this film would have propelled Mitchell to the A leagues.Regardless, we at Archon Cinema Reviews are very excited for what is next for Mitchell and what is sure to be a promising career.Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Some Flaws But Overall Quite Effective,"It Follows (2014)*** (out of 4)A young woman (Maika Monroe) goes out on a date with a guy she just met and the two have sex. Soon she begins to have strange things follow her.There's a lot more going on with IT FOLLOWS but the plot detail should be kept small so that spoilers won't ruin the movie. This is a hard film to discuss without going into spoilers but I'm going to give it a shot. Is IT FOLLOWS the most terrifying horror film ever made as some are claiming? Not even close. Is it something different than the typical horror film out there? There's certainly no question about that. Writer-director David Robert Mitchell has taken a fairly simple premise and brought all sorts of creepy moments that are certainly entertaining enough to make up for some of the flaws.Again, I'm not going to go into great detail but we basically follow this woman around as she becomes more and more terrified because she keeps being followed by some unknown entity. At first her friends don't believe her but soon they too realize that something weird strange is going on and part of the fun in the film is trying to understand what's going on and why. For the most part I thought the screenplay did a very good job at keeping the viewer guessing as to what these things are following the woman and the entire time you're wondering how it's going to end. The film manages to have some very creepy moments scattered throughout and I especially liked how the movie started as we see what happens if you let these things catch you. I'm not going to spoil some of the bigger scares in the picture but there are times when the director puts you right in the middle of the action and makes you feel as if these things are coming after you.The film features some wonderful cinematography by Mike Gioulakis and some great editing by Julio Perez IV. The film also benefits from some very good performances by the supporting cast but it's the lead, Maika Monroe, who really shines here. We've seen countless actresses play scared throughout the history of horror films but Monroe really leaves an impact. Even if she never appears in another horror film she's probably made herself so memorable here that they will be talking about her for years to come. She's really believable in the part and makes you feel as afraid she is. The sound effects are also a major plus here.There are certainly some problems including it going on a tad bit too long in the final act. I think about ten-minutes less would have made for a tighter movie as things did start to repeat a bit too much. The music score by Rich Vreeland, on its own, is downright terrific and one of the most memorable in recent horror memory. It really reminded me of the scores Dario Argento used during his 80's films. The score was very loud and very much in your face and at times I thought it somewhat took away from what was going on on the screen but at other times it was quite fitting. There also appeared to be a brief nod to John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN theme.IT FOLLOWS is certainly a flawed film but there are enough creepy moments to make it worth viewing.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
It Happened,"I'm starting to think horror just isn't my genre anymore. It Follows has an interesting concept, one I've not seen before, where the monster/killer targets someone through a preternatural STD. After the mark is passed to someone, the killer starts to tirelessly stalk them. It's slow but smart, which feels like a play on so many horror villains of old that would only ever walk menacingly yet still catch their fleeing victims.Production-wise, this seems like it was made relatively cheaply. There's not really any special effects here but that's not to say there aren't effective shots. Given the premise, they don't really need any crazy CGI or a mass of Bay-esque explosions.The acting felt middling to poor, but honestly that's most horror movies to me. Also standard in horror movies, I feel like our main people are pretty stupid at times and if they'd actually thought about things, the killer is probably fairly easy to deal with.Again, the concept for this is interesting and new to me, and I always value new ideas. It's shot well. It's not acted terribly and is on par for the genre. By the end of the movie though when I was asked what I thought my instant reaction was a shrug followed by ""Its alright."" It just didn't grab me how I wanted it to.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Super Duper Spooky,"I loved this movie!I can almost extra appreciate a horror movie that doesn't rely on overstated gore to make an impressionable scare for their audiences. Rather than all that, the movie plays on the basic human feeling of paranoia and fear itself, which to me is scarier than any amount of blood, guts, and human remains. There were several holes in the plot, but I feel like they weren't big enough to make me dislike the movie. (that probably screams volumes about me as a ""movie critic"", but so be it)I don't think there was a single second where I wasn't petrified that something terrible was about to happen. I thought Maika Monroe did an amazing performance, she was very believable. I look forward to seeing more of her work.The soundtrack is also noteworthy. Not only the songs themselves, but the use of dynamics was brilliant. The energy they were creating with the music and the gorgeous cinematography, I was intensely captivated.I'm not even mad at the fact that this movie is just a huge allegory for STDs.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Best new take on genre since Japanese Ringu movie...,"Yes, it's true, it IS as good as most say it is...It borrows more than a little from the original Japanese Ringu series, and builds on that base, but introduces some new refreshing things in the process. It's kinda like ""one step back, two steps forward"" for American horror movies, in that way that it goes back to the 70's horror movies, involving teenagers, the tingling feel of the world being new and exciting (dating and sex in particular), and all the worries that comes with that too.It is different in the way that the moments in between the horror scenes is not just a transport lane with sex scenes, drugs and bad acting, it actually feels like a well made take on teen life, good trade craft in camera-work and acting, and not just another ""teen horror movie"". Those components sure exists (not the bad acting), but the feel of it is genuine, quality.I have to admit I was skeptical reading about it, thinking it was just another one of those bad horror movies which we are bombarded with. Someone has actually thought this one through, and made a new take on it, keeping the ""old feel"" of 70-80's films and built something quite new.It has some very unnerving and disturbing moments, that's what horror is all about, and will keep you interested and on the edge of your seat.I have to mention the great soundtrack as well, with a quite different feel to it, introducing a composer who's greatest work so far was making the music for an old school independent computer game released in 2013, also flirting with the 80's video game generation, very nice!It should be as entertaining for the young crowd as well as more seasoned horror fans, so do yourself a favor and see this one, you won't want to miss it!One of the best films of its kind in maybe 15 years or so!",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Left open for interpretation...,"To the extent of making very little sense. The editing is choppy and disjointed, making it really hard to get into and follow. It feels like there are important scenes that were intentionally excluded specifically to make the progression of events and actions more confusing. The rules were outlined but then it fails to follow them which makes the lack of explanation for the first victim and their place in the spread of the curse even more annoying. The characters are just as much cliche for moronic decisions as any other stupid teen in any other horror movie. The origin of the supernatural presence is brought up but never explored and no motives are ever even hinted at (this is honestly the most ridiculous aspect of the movie, why would a supernatural entity care at all about promiscuity to the extent that it would waste its time and energy stalking these people). There are a lot of inconsistencies and contradictions throughout and that isn't indicative of something so well written that it keeps you thinking and guessing when it's actually so poorly written that it requires the viewer to reach to make sense of it, to draw their own conclusions to fill in everything that was lacking.",3.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Nearly Perfect Teen Horror,"The acting is cheesy at the start, but the kid actors in this learn quickly.Yes, adults would not make the same mistakes in horror situations like this, but kids do.

Teens today also don't care much about the results of their actions in physically, real life.

Does for Sex What The Ring Did for Videotapes,"It Follows is one of those movies that relies on atmosphere to carry it...and, unlike numerous others, it succeeds in setting an eerie and unsettling atmosphere that reinforces the story. Between the musical score, the acceptably decent narrative, acting that successfully lends realism and plausibility to a pretty far fetched (though exceedingly uncomfortable) premise, and directing that capitalizes on all of those elements in such a way as to create a very memorable movie that sticks with you after the credits are rolling...this ended up being a movie that lived up to the interest it piqued in me from seeing the trailers. Think of it as The Ring, but with sex as the method of transmission. The correlation with American adaptation of The Ring is appropriate in other ways as well, there is a similarly pervasive atmosphere and an artistic build up that fluctuates between subtle intervals and tense moments that make for a strong overall flow. There is a part of me that thinks teachers should show this in sexual education classes just to make the whole idea of sex as uncomfortable as possible for children and adolescents...because making kids afraid of sex until they are old enough to rationalize that this is entirely fiction might be effective. Hit them when they are young enough and this movie could absolutely implant a bit of fear at the prospect of having sex. Of course I'm not being serious there, since fear of sex is probably about as counterproductive as abstinence-only education...potentially more so. I'm sure there will be mixed feelings from people who watch this one, but personally I found it to be one of the best horror movies I've seen...I like this sort of movie quite a bit though, not that I have seen many along these lines. I'm not going to give anything away. You'll just have to watch it for yourself. Comment",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Weird... but weird is good,"It's nearly impossible to come up with an original idea in the horror genre these days but 'It Follows' gives it a really good shot. This is a creepy, bizarre film that makes for a welcome addition to a genre that has become increasingly stale and unimaginative in recent years.'It Follows' takes plenty of risks and it's inevitable that not everyone will 'get' this film, so it's no surprise to see so many negative reviews.

A dismal film,I was really looking forward to seeing this movie especially as it appeared to have so many positive reviews . However it really is a dismal attempt at a horror or thriller movie. It feels like it has been directed by a group of amateur film students for their school project ! I am truly astounded that this film got any positive reviews at all . It moves at a glacially slow pace . There is absolutely no background story or fleshing out of characters . The same scenes are repeatedly recycled as if the filmmakers seem to run out of ideas after the first 10 minutes . A very pretentious attempt at a film .

Great Aesthetic Nothing Profound,"It Follows is a strange film, a very unique horror film while not being all that unique. I know it's a strange start to a review; stick with me. The director and writer are fans of the original Halloween and Friday the 13th plus pretty much any 80s horror film. The homages are paid with the soundtrack (which I'll give credit is pretty fascinating and nice to hear which added a nice aspect to every scene the score was played), the way the killer works by never stopping (Friday the 13th reference) is also a horror movie love homage. The final homage is with the suburban neighborhoods and cars that look like it's from the late 1900s. Even the cabin that our protagonists go to midway through the film looked like a bad shed, the illusion is lost with one of side protagonist female nerd that had a clamshell phone? Reader? Without giving anything away the way the killer didn't add anything to my experience seeing the film it just felt like any other slasher flick with a twist that doesn't make it as good as the critics or audience says. The film isn't bad but in terms of homage to the horror genre, The Cabin the Woods (2011) did it in a far more entertaining way while also being a better film overall. With its low budget, I can't hold It Follows to the same standards as The Cabin in the Woods (2011). Even ignoring any other horror films, It Follows is not one of the Greatest Horror Films of All Time. At least, in my opinion, I think people just got hyped for a unique horror film that was half decent for the first time in 3 years and that's fine but don't expect a spectacular high budget film also the film has a lot of nudity and the entire plot revolves around sex so make sure to read the parent's guide before showing it to your kids.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The best thing about the movie is its background score and the way it it was shot using wide angled lenses which makes it look expansive and visually stunning.

Best horror movie in years!,"During the commercials that were shown before the film began, I was heavily reminded of the problem with horror movies today. There were two trailers shown in the cinema, one for the new Poltergeist movie and the other one was for Insidious III. This was such a heavy reminder, we never see original horror movies these days, only remakes and sequels. What happened with the genre? I was a big fan of horror flicks back in the day, but then I watched too many bad ones.It Follows is something very special. What begins as a normal teen horror film turns into a suspenseful, scary and GOOD movie. Yes, I said good movie. In fact, this is the best horror film in years. Almost everything is good about it. I don't know how to describe the movie without giving too much away, so let me put this simple.It Follows ""follows"" a young and cute high school girl who is followed by an unknown supernatural force after getting involved in a sexual encounter. That's it, I won't give out any more plot details, because this is an experience that can easily be ruined by probably just watching the trailer and that's why I chose not to do it, although I was VERY excited for this to come out.The movie kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time, even during slow paced scenes there not much happened. Because the movie always felt so haunting. Director David Robert Mitchell took a different turn on the horror genre, and instead of just adding random jump scares he builds up an EXTREME tension. Teenagers are usually bad actors in movies like these, since all they do for most part is having sex, partying and then they are killed off quickly. While It Follows may seem like a sex horror film, there are actually only like three short sex scenes, and they're NOT graphic at all.There's some nudity, we see the main character topless quite a lot, but that's for good reasons only. I really hope It Follows makes a big profit so that the director can make another film. Go see this movie in theaters! It's a haunting experience that is worth the price of the ticket.I'm giving It Follows a 8/10, and this is the first time I ever give a horror movie that score.

"Nerve wrecking and unpredictable, It Follows is a highly effective Indie horror film that should become a cult classic.","What constitutes true cinematic horror? Is it really blood, gore and jump scares, or grotesque monsters and malevolent spirits? How about an unfathomable fear of the unknown? Built on the chassis of 70s and 80s horror classics, It Follows is such a visceral horror film that it instantly redefines the very rules of the genre. And by doing so, it reaches its destination very early and refuses to budge, where needless to say, the destination is none other than a thin layer under your skin!If by now you have noticed my frequent use of the word 'It', I can tell that this film is really going to make your skin crawl. You see, writer-director David Robert Mitchell's story is based on a classic horror template of cause and effect, where the consequence is certain death. But unlike previous horror films where characters must outrun a monster or vengeful ghost just to stay alive, Mitchell's fright mechanism is intensely creepier than scare tactics used in a variety of modern horror films. Using the intimidating chain-letter as a theoretical setup, Mitchell's premise is a hex that manifests into a life threatening situation after a sexual encounter. Jay (Maika Monroe from last year's sleeper hit, The Guest), is the latest 'victim' to have received a sexually transmitted curse after a night out with Hugh (Jake Weary). Left dazed and confused, all Jay knows (or is allowed to know), is that unless she sleeps with another person (and thus pass on the curse), she will be relentlessly hunted and ultimately killed by the titular ""It"".Starting with the intentionally obscure but highly suggestive title, Mitchell's genius is in never revealing what 'It' really is. Is 'It' extraterrestrial or paranormal? We don't know for sure and neither does Jay or her teenage friends who come to her rescue. Why, how and from where are other questions that are left unanswered, inflicting more panic when we see 'It' approaching in human form. Speaking of which, only the victim and the audience can see the approach, which most of the time starts as a blurry figure on either corner of the screen. But Mitchell doesn't stop there. The entire film has a retro look and feel, and if it were not for one character's hand-held device, viewers could be mistaken into thinking this film was set in the late 1960s. Using this setting and significantly adding to the mounting tension is an electronic soundtrack that is as unforgivable as cinematographer Mike Gioulakis' panning and zooming, further wreaking havoc on the viewer's nerves. It works by manifesting an unnerving sense of claustrophobia when there's everywhere to run but nowhere to hide.As an original and highly effective indie horror film, It Follows bucks the trend in cheap clichés with stellar technical achievements, the slow build-up of mood and a terrifying atmosphere throughout. Then there's ample pause for thought on a metaphorical layer mask that you don't see at first. In context, it's like a painful or embarrassing shard of memory you've kept locked away since those turbulent adolescent years. And even if you come out with nerves intact, you still have to deal with those sexual skeletons you may have been harboring in the closet. It Follows may not be the best film of the year, but it's definitely a horror fan's dream come true. For the true horror connoisseur, perhaps even a bed-wetting nightmare!",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
crafty horror film,"Young adults and promiscuity often lead to bad things in horror features. The story's no different for It Follows, where main protagonist Jay (Maika Monroe) is cursed with an ominous, constantly pursuing ""it"" after having sex with her seemingly harmless boyfriend. Amidst heavy nods to the conventions of slasher films past, the caveat here is that, in the same way sex is the bringer of doom, it's also the singular path to salvation: if Jay has sex again, she will pass the ""it"" to her next partner, and so long as the new victim does not get caught by ""it,"" the chain continues. Allegory for STD? Can't be, that's too easy...but either way, it's certainly telling of one of the film's key charms: a sense of ambiguity. What time frame are we in exactly? Are there implications to the persons which ""it"" manifests as? What's the deal with that cliffhanger ending?! Horror films as of late are too much funhouse and not enough suspense, so it's refreshing to see It Follows doesn't rely entirely on out-of-nowhere jolts to justify its scares. Director David Robert Mitchell often incorporates a clever 360-degree camera pan that acts as the audience's wandering eye, always on the lookout for that foreboding figure that walks (and walks only...here's to you , Michael Myers) dead-set towards Jay. The film can occasionally slow down a bit, but this can be forgiven, as it contributes to the looming dread of waiting for ""it"" to next appear.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A tense and unique horror film.,"It Follows tells the story of a a sexual encounter gone bad. While this whole premise feels familiar in one way or another, director David Robert Mitchell manages to inject enough originality and genuinely disturbing images into this scary and tense horror film that is bound for cult glory. The film follows (no pun intended) Jay, an all American girl from the Detroit suburbs who dreams of meeting ""the one"" and having a summer love. As one would expect, it soon turns into a hellish nightmare that ends with a looming, potentially deadly force lurking behind every corner of her life. The film takes twists and turns throughout the way, but the best part about this film is the sense of dread in every scene. It weighs down as heavy as bricks until some truly disturbing visuals make this film go from dreadful and suspense filled to absolutely horrifying. The suspense builds and builds with this film and when it finally releases the tensions with a scare, it becomes almost unbearable to look at the screen without your hands in front of your face. The performances in this film, outside Maika Monroe, are pretty flat. This surprisingly doesn't really affect the film as bad as you would think. There's enough of a good performance coming from Monroe to carry this film to the finish line and then some. My only gripe with this film is that it is really ten minutes too long and feels as though it starts dragging in the second act. These scenes that slow it down are not necessarily bad or poorly done, it just feels as though Mitchell could have maybe left a bit more on the cutting room floor. In retrospect, this is a minimal problem. This is a horror film that is scary and truly unique. In an industry that produces crap films with cheap scares, it is very refreshing to see one that actually takes the genre seriously and delivers some serious scares. It is definitely worth watching and I highly recommend it.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The pacing is slow, but there's an atmosphere in it that is intense and freaky, like you know some thing is about to happen. It keeps it's subtle horror throughout the movie even when nothing is going on, because the thing can always come at any time and can always be there stalking. I never get truly creeped out by movies but this one stays under your skin and keeps you wondering and thinking days after watching it. It's an incredibly terrifying film that doesn't use cheap blood and jumps to deliver its scares. It keeps the horrifying mood throughout that always makes you peek over your shoulder every 2 seconds.

My favorite thing about it was how they made it seems like it was in the 80s, even though they don't make a statement about it as such.There are no computers, no cell phones, an old station wagon, old phones, old t.v.s, black and white movies, and casual sex. This is in the tradition of classic horror flicks of that era. But they don't actually claim it is in the 80s. Because for example, you will see some modern cars too.I also loved the photography of suburban Michigan. That includes the shots of perfect cul-de-sacs, woodsy roads, and lake beaches. Of course for men there is the main character to ogle. She's just old enough so that it's not too creepy, and she's truly as appealing as her character is meant to be.The creatures walk at zombie pace. You can't help but laugh. The plot is probably meant to be fun and different, and it is. Having sex makes zombies stalk you, and having sex again makes zombies stalk your new partner.Yes the ending was disappointing, both for lack of action and lack of explanation. But sometimes the journey there is worth watching.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Wasn't as good as i expected,Watchmojo lists always include this movie in one of the best horror movies and hence I was propelled to watch it. It follows didn't make me feel scared but it was a decent film with a new concept. It wasn't a great movie but it did what most horror movies do. The teens look gorgeous but the sex scenes are plain silly. The solution at the end is really silly too. But most horror movies have a silly premise. I do not believe in ghosts hence exorcisms look silly to me too.,7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Unique, amazing of course, excellent at everything he does! A refresher on Terror.","Lately, we are being presented with more ""out of the box"" horror/thriller genre films ( Hereditary, The Witch or Us ), without following the primer and clichés ( Annabelle, The Conjuring or It ). This is excellent, because human beings are naturally afraid of the unknown, so without following the pattern of horror movies, we already have greater discomfort.It is very common for this genre to have an immense amount of disposable films, as there is a great lack of originality, which is slowly changing. ""It Follows"", in the original, is one of those that have great originality, both in the theme and in the way the film is conducted.As I said: The terror of the human being is the unknown, that said, the film works with doubt, distrust of everything around it, the unstoppable and the unknown. Not knowing how it works, how to escape, how to stop this curse, or whether people believe in it, whether it's a real person coming or whether it's the curse, all play with our most natural vulnerabilities.In conclusion, the film is excellent! But, it's divisible, as it's not an ordinary model movie that follows HollyWood's playbooks. Personally, this results in its excellent driving, soundtrack, camera play and totally uncomfortable ambiance. Definitely very good!",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"It may be original and scary, but the plot drags too much, and it lacks enjoyment","This felt more like an overlong TV episode rather than a movie. I did appreciate the originality of the idea and the ambiance that made it scary. However, I was surprised that the critics gave it 97% on Rotten Tomatoes when it had its own share of flaws from poor character development, an iffy resolution, poor flow, and a dragging plot. It took Nothing was really answered in the movie that well. It might be consistently scary, but it lacked in enjoyment value.At least the movie is watchable. I know it's not that good, but it's not bad. The fact that the movie felt somewhat scary all the time added to it.Overall, it had a really neat idea that managed to make it scary. However, it didn't know what do do with that idea, and instead settled for a dragging, flawed plot that didn't entertain that much and flowed poorly.+ Very original idea (I think this explains the extremely high critic reviews)+ Believable acting from a relatively unknown cast+ Good ambiance+ Consistently scaryPlot drags a lot and flows poorlyLacks enjoyment valuePlot is unanswered in many parts with a poor resolutionLack of character development and good narrativeScore: 6.

Do Not Watch the Trailer!,"Somehow, nearly every important scene from this film was crammed into the two and a half minute long trailer. I am a lifelong horror fan, though the genre has produced more garbage than good, and was really looking forward to an original idea. I was intrigued when I first read about the project, excited when I heard some of the soundtrack, and ecstatic when I saw the trailer. Sadly, that was a mistake. As I watched in anticipation, each scene's suspense was undermined by the fact that the trailer had given away precisely what would happen. 10-15 minutes of build-up, then something from the trailer... Another 10-15 minutes of build-up, then another shot from the trailer.The STD (sexually transmitted demon - I'm sure someone else has made that joke, but I couldn't read through every review) was ultimately a somewhat laughable idea for a film. The acting was decent, the directing / camera angles, and cinematography was fine, the suspense would have been great if not for the trailer, and the overall story / execution was also acceptable. The only thing that blows me away about this film however (other than the seemingly unwarranted critical praise) is the soundtrack. MAJOR props to Disasterpeace for a frightening soundscape.I really, honestly feel that I would have enjoyed this movie so much more if it were not for the trailer revealing so much. Note to self: never watch a movie trailer again. The last horror film I truly enjoyed was ""A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night"" and coincidentally, I knew nothing about the film beforehand. I simply put it on & enjoyed it. That's the way to watch movies anymore, I suppose.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Give Me Some Of That ""Follow"" Sex","I was impressed.There hasn't been a horror film that's been able to cast this sort of spell on me in several years, And not in several recent years either. I can't began to describe the feeling of foreboding that this film repeatedly raped me with during almost every scene. Several times, I found myself on the edge of my seat even before there was real reason to do so. But accompanying this feeling of foreboding was a depression that I was unable to rid myself of. And never before has any cheaply budgeted, independent horror film done such a thing to me.This horror film gave me more goosebumps than actual frights....which was somehow worse. Even though the plot explains itself early on in the film (which should have spoiled it), it still could not stop the chill that kept surging through me with each predictable scene. I knew what was coming long before I even saw it, and knew which character it was coming for. And already knowing still offered me little comfort. Being prepared for what is already self-evident means nothing with this horror film. All that mattered was the POV of the character in peril...this is all we were allowed to see...which was more than enough to pleasantly chill.Anyone who thinks this horror film is tame, I won't argue with you. It's not big-budget Hollywood. This was a good idea made with a small budget. And it worked...for me anyways. Which is a rare happening for myself.I give it a 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
American version of Japanese horror(the original is better),"This movie is an American version of Japanese horror movies, but the original is much better. Japanese horror movies tend to characterize curses as random events, that happen by contagion, not karma or other kind of value oriented causation typical of the Christian culture.Very good, we have recently being able to enjoy quite a few movies paying tribute to great schools of horror, like that sound studio movie, regarding 70s Italian horror.It is good to see a certain revival on the horror genre, which, along with drama, provide the best stories for movies.Enjoy!",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Major Disappointment!,"I wouldn't normally even bother to review a film already critiqued by 800+ contributors, but I was so disappointed by It Follows that I found myself gravitating towards the keyboard, to express my feelings of surprised dismay.Touted regularly as a ""modern classic"", those expecting another genuinely original film such as Get Out! should be prepared for disappointment.The main narrative premise of a ""viral villainous curse"" passed between teenagers, has most obviously and best been seen in The Ring saga. The story therefore can claim no great pretensions to originality. But the way it is presented to the audience is completely and frustratingly daft.Consider: 1 The virtual complete absence of adult support characters. These school going teenagers have apparently no parents from whom to seek advice or get some help. They appear to just about all live in Jay's house. Convenient I suppose, but realistic? 2 The (adult) police can't find Hugh/Jeffrey, but our teenage posse can. Sure! 3 Many have already noted the absence of any explanation at all for the existence of the curse (a major point of difference with The Ring). I could probably live with that, but curiously again there seems little police involvement with the associated deaths, such as we see in the film's introduction. 4 Jay's continually bizarre behaviour is something to behold. She always seems to be running out on her buddies, even when they get shot/injured attempting to help her with naturally, precious little thanks. 5 And what's with the two main male friends trying to bed Jay when they know she's been cursed? One even quite hilariously mounts her in her hospital bed, when she's recovering from a car crash. Shades of David Lynch! It makes little sense. 6 As do the ""its"", when in one scene bullets to the head cause only a minor inconvenience, whilst in another scene, we're expected to believe it's finished one off. Duh! 7 As for the so called symbolism of ""purposely"" highlighted superseded technologies and SF/Horror references ... seriously what was the point? In your face stuff, that's all been done before in much better films.It follows therefore that I strongly advise you don't bother.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Probably the best horror I've ever seen,"I'm struggling to think of a horror that tops this. I am constantly looking for horrors that are to my taste but find that the majority of them fall short, especially those released in the past decade. Blood, gore and violence is not enough for me or I'd say most horror fans but directors seem to think otherwise. David Robert Mitchell, however, fully understands this in a film that has little to no gore and instead makes perfect use of slowly built tension. The only film that I can think of that comes close to this tension wise is The Shining and, although a completely different style, the scariest was perhaps REC but I think they may have just been surpassed. This isn't a big jumpy horror so those going to this expecting such will be disappointed. However, those looking to engage with a film that draws you in and holds the tension throughout will not be left disappointed.One of the best aspects of this cinematic experience is the soundtrack by Disasterpiece; the artist known for his work on indie platform game ""Fez"". The soundtrack to this excellent horror builds tension throughout rarely releasing the listener. The music in collaboration with the creative cinematography makes this film as engrossing as possible. The dizzying spinning shots are some of the most tense and the time between showing the ""Follower"" in shots leaves the audience tensely waiting to see how close it has gotten. This was the most tense film I think I have ever seen. I loved the use of art-house aspects without ever going over the top and losing the run of itself. Disasterpiece's dark synth soundtrack is a masterpiece on its own and is thankfully being released, not that it could be listened to whilst relaxing. Disasterpiece did a fine job and I look forward to hearing more of his music like this if he decides to release more. After this, who knows, maybe he will become a highly sought after film score composer. I sure hope so anyway.I was curious after having read reviews because the trailer seemed to show little more than a run-of-the-mill horror. I am very glad I decided to go and experience this to its fullest in a big cinema with surround sound. It was a wonderful experience leaving me in a state of bliss afterwards wanting to tell the world just how wonderful this film was.....so here I am.I have seen my fair share of horrors and read a large number of horror novels but none have all too successfully scared or creeped me out other than the occasional jump which has no lasting appeal. This film, however, held me tense throughout and I loved the thrill ride. There are briefs moments where the tension breaks but these do not last long as the viewer knows all is not well just yet and the tension begins building once more. This film shows the power of cinema and the importance of soundtrack in collaboration with the cinematography. A big budget is not needed to create a great horror and this film displays that with ease.The film owes a lot to horror films of the 70s and 80s but it far surpasses them. The synth soundtrack is a modern take on soundtracks of the 80s and John Carpenter style motifs. The tension built takes influence from The Shining. In saying this, It Follows is one of the most original horrors I have ever seen. It takes in so many influences and makes them its own.I have probably gone on and on a bit too much about this film but, in my opinion, it was a masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
It follows...until it bores!,"It follows tells us the story of Jay, a nineteen year old girl that after a sexual encounter, finds herself plagued by strange visions and the sense that something is following her.

The rating is indeed high and you may be tempted to see it, but don't go in with high expectations, and don't watch the trailer. Maybe if you watch it with little knowledge you can at least enjoy it.

"Relax, it's just sex Or is it?","I'll admit that my main motivation to see ""It Follows"" was probably the wrong one I didn't necessarily want to see it because it's labeled as one of the freshest, most original and genuinely frightening American horror movies of recent years, but I watched it because I was literally sick and tired of reading how everybody is talking about this movie on film forums! In the message boards section of this lovely website, for example, there are – without exaggerating – ten discussions going on about ""It Follows"" on a daily basis and I got really fed up with avoiding all of them in order not to read any spoilers. Usually when a certain horror film is trending or being the hype of the moment, I postpone my personal viewing so that I can't get influenced too much by the opinions of others. There just isn't coming an end to the hype that is called ""It Follows"" around here on the message boards. Since 7-8 months non-stop already, everybody shouts out his/her opinion and most of them are very positive and enthusiastic. And is ""It Follows"" really worthy of all this interactive attention and mouth-to-mouth publicity? No, of course not I don't think that any film should receive this much exposure, in fact, except maybe in case Alfred Hitchcock would rise from his grave and direct ""Psycho V: Happy Mother's Day"".But hey, at the same time I will gladly admit that ""It Follows"" quite a few positive aspects going for it. More positive than negative ones, in fact. The basic plot concept is original as well as unsettling, the soundtrack and several unexpected scenes are genuinely petrifying and most of the lead protagonists come across as authentic and identifiable young adults. The successful combination of all these aspects already makes ""It Follows"" a dozen times better than the vast majority of US-horror releases nowadays, since most of them are either redundant remakes or lame direct-to-DVD zombie comedies. The cute and friendly girl-next-door Jay Height thinks that she found happiness with her hunky new boyfriend Hugh. However, after they made love for the first time in the backseat of his cool car, everything changes abruptly. It seems as if Hugh was only looking for a victim to physically pass on a terrible kind curse. Since the sex, Jay gets stalked by nightmarish entities and ghastly figures. Jay's closest friends want to help, but naturally no one else sees the entities that she sees, and passing it on herself via casual sex doesn't necessarily make her safe. So, the idea is very good and the handful of genuine shock/fright moments likewise, but sadly the film also contains far too many boring and pointless footage. Writer/director David Robert Mitchell often undercuts the suspense by overlong dialogs and extended scenes of absolutely nothing. Unfortunately he also knows that his script is fairly clever, so several twists (especially near the finale) feel somewhat pretentious. Don't count on proper explanations either, of course. That being said, I would still definitely recommend horror genre fans to check out ""It Follows"", even if it were only for the downright fantastic soundtrack by Disasterpeace. The music fits the atmosphere and grisly images perfectly, and it's arguably the greatest horror score since John Carpenter's music for his own classic ""Halloween"".By the way, I just had a daughter. In case this movie will stand the test of time and it becomes a cult classic, I will definitely show it to her in sixteen years or so. Before she starts dating and clubbing, just to make her think twice about random unsafe sex and one night stands; ha!",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A modern American classic,"Yeah, I know that sounds lofty, but that's the impression this film left on me, and I believe has on many others as well. It's been a long time since I've left the theater after seeing a horror film feeling truly roused, and ""It Follows"" exceeded my wildest expectations.The narrative here is fairly straightforward: A young college student, Jay (Maika Monroe) goes on a date with a guy. On their second outing together, the two have consensual sex in his car; all is well and normal, until he inexplicably chloroforms her. She awakens tied to a wheelchair in an abandoned building, and is warned in detail by her suitor that she's been bestowed a threatening supernatural entity that will follow her until making its fatal strike— the only way out is if she ""passes it on"" by having sex with someone else.Is it a parable of female sexuality? A commentary on millennial sex culture? A veiled warning on the dangers of unprotected sex? I frankly don't know, and I don't think that's really the point here. While the topic of sex is a plot hinge, the real meat of this film is in its execution of concept. Newcomer David Robert Mitchell wrote and directed the film, and has essentially taken a basic concept and fleshed it out into a feature length exercise in disquietude. The reality of this film is that there is not much to the skeleton of it; it is heavy on concept and borderline emaciated on narrative, but not to its own detriment. The main reason the film works so well is because it operates on the universal fear that humans have of being followed— on the street, in our classrooms, in the grocery store, even in our own home. The fear of being followed and not knowing why or who is after you is terrifying on every conceivable level, and Mitchell's playful striking of this very nerve is what this film is all about.This incessant terror creeps in through a series of unsettling and sometimes downright scary confrontations with the nebulous ""it"", which manifests as different people. Sometimes it's strangers, sometimes people the afflicted victim knows; in either case it is inescapable, and the film closes in on the world of its characters to claustrophobic effect.The photography here is another large part of the ambiance in the film, with the camera capturing expansive views of a dilapidating Detroit, and the sleepy lives of young adults living on the suburban outskirts of it. The ambiguity of the time period is hand-in-hand with the general ambiguity of the film itself; the camera-work is sophisticated and even at times lyrical, presenting beautiful compositions and chilling run-ins with the various manifestations of ""it"", whether it be lurking in corners or slowly approaching the camera from distant landscapes. The scope is undoubtedly reminiscent of John Carpenter, which has been mentioned time and again, and while the film playfully references several other genre films, it does so without being obnoxious. Underlying all of this is a pulsing synth score that is jarring yet appropriate, and is perhaps the film's most ostentatious ""throwback"" element. Regardless, it works.Skilled performances are the icing on the cake here, and make it all the more believable in all the unbelievability; Maika Monroe and Keir Gilchrist lead the cast, both turning in admirable and realistic performances, and the supporting cast members are equally believable. It's a rare instance in which I felt like the filmic representation of young adult ennui was on-par. These characters and their relationships toward one another look and feel very real.While some have decried the film's showdown finale and conclusion, I didn't think there was really any better way to end a film like this. In a film whose core is so indefinite, all bets are off as far as I'm concerned, and maybe that's part of what makes the film so quietly scary— the threat lacks definition. The only conclusive attribute ""it"" has is that it follows you, and through a skillful amalgamation of atmospheric camera-work, evocative mood-setting, and strong performances, that is more than enough. Check your inhibitions at the door, and this film will follow you for days. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Casting The Runes,""" The scariest American horror film in years"" and if you're coming out with hyperbole like that you'd better have a damn good movie to go with that type of marketing . That is until you stop to consider that America has been seriously on the back foot when it comes to the horror genre in the last decade and is content to do either horror porn or remakes . I'm wracking my brains and I think the last American horror film to impress me was THE MIST and that was made about seven or eight years ago . On top of that if a mere horror film comes with hype it usually ruins it for me . I thought THE BABADOOK was okay but again that was hyped to high heaven which meant my expectations weren't really matched with the feedback it received from others . IT FOLLOWS has the same sort of acclaim that I instinctively thought would work against it!!!!! SUGGESTIVE SPOILERS !!!!!To be fair writer/director David Robert Mitchell knows how to draw in an audience and opens the film with a good hook - a young woman exits her house obviously terrified and a couple of minutes later the plot thread comes to a conclusive end with a stark , chilling image . From the outset the film shows that it's not a studio picture and it has independent roots which I'm happy to see the likes of the Academy Awards recognise the spirit of independent movie making even if they're hardly likely to hand out nominations and awards to horror movies . Don't get me wrong , I'm not saying IT FOLLOWS should have been up for Best Picture . I'm just saying independent is much more respected these daysOne thing Mitchell seems to have borrowed from greatly is the MR James story Casting The Runes adapted for cinema in 1957 under the name NIGHT OF THE DEMON and here we see a similar type of story featuring an adolescent girl with sex used as a plot device . It's a reworking of the ""horny teenagers in peril"" but works very well for the most part . I say for the most part because the pacing isn't brilliant but Mitchell brings a brooding creepy atmosphere to the film and is helped by good use of amorphous music and when the horror parts happen they rather unsettling . In short it's a fairly good film but the downside is tags such as""Horror masterpiece"" and ""Scariest film in years"" possibly raise expectations just that little bit too high",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Unique and refreshing Horror/Thriller,"I love horror movies, I give even the worst ones a try and often cant get through the first 30 minutes because of bad dialogue and the over fantasticalistic acting that often is the true horror of the movie.I actually expected that from this movie and didn't want to pay very much attention to it due to my clash of clans fixation but this film took me off my phone from the start and it held me to the finish.The concept was great and slightly different to the norm, which was refreshing, but the real strength of the movie is the use of imagery and music to really tell a story, hold the mystery and create a feel for the emotions of the characters.Generally I judge movies by my ability to predict what will happen next and often I can regurgitate the timeline of the movie after seeing the trailer. This movie had me guessing and in suspense the whole time, so bravo a rare experience for me.Lastly I have to say the style of the movie was great, for me, I think it will help set this movie apart from the genre. it reminded me very much of the movie ""driver"" only this movie was interesting. The world was real; no bimbos running and screaming through the forest of their parents 32 bedroom mansion with the creature perusing at 50mph right up until the last inch, where the monster loses the victim. None of that junk here. The people were believable, relate-able and represented the part of the world and situation they are coming from.Great film, I hope to see more from the writer/director.

Fear on the Zone,"It Follows presents an obvious metaphor about the consequences of teenage sex. Instead of STDs, the movie features a curse that is better off explained in the actual movie. The movie shows a horror trick that somehow becomes rare but proves that it still works in today's audience. In a time of unending gore and jump scares (which, of course, still exist in this movie), the practical kind of horror It Follows provides is the fear from the distance. But the movie also sets up an atmosphere that could outcome the worst of the threat that the characters are being haunted from. It just breathes into the terror, thus it's undeniably creepy and surprisingly smart, with some admirable inspirations from the old school horror.The film starts off building its mood and atmosphere, trying to introduce the fear in a disorienting way, but the audience will remain sticking into the experience. The story just explores a typical lifestyle of a teenage protagonist; either trying to look innocent or just hanging out and being lazy with her friends. It's a common representation of the adolescents, but it doesn't get too unlikeable as many horror films tend to portray these days. Once the actual premise has been revealed, the tension just rises into a new level. The scares are visible, but shown in different forms, literally and otherwise. The camera mostly shoots a horror scene from the distance, either the spectator's perspective like the beach scene from Under The Skin, or something tension driven where the enemy is coming closer like the chase scene in Rian Johnson's Brick. But it's more about feeling it than seeing it, the movie has already painted the tone from its cinematography and music score, and when things go wrong from both aspects, you should expect the real impending danger from the main character.The rules of the villain may not be that clear, even in a metaphorical sense, there are times that it sort of drops the ball, but then, there wasn't an exact answer from how this thing works. It's all up to a mystery solving from its characters. It may sound exciting, but the atmosphere that turns their environment into otherworldly remains. The direction is all affectionate inspiration from both horror and art-house. The former is already too obvious by its soundtrack, but the camera also chooses any angles it can, as long as it captures wherever the evil might come right into the main character, even when she is strapped on a wheelchair, driving a car, or lying on a hospital bed. The latter is pretty much adding the mood, like picturing the melancholy of their lives and the darkness of being bound with the sexually transmitted curse. And the main actress, Maika Monroe, really embraces whatever tone the movie takes.It Follows is best described as brilliantly crafted, even if it's mostly based on inspirations. It would have been a gimmick, but it does all of the styles right and it fits perfectly for its ridiculously clever premise. The rules of its killer may not be that straight, but at the same time, it already does right at creeping us out. It's great when the film is just letting everything in action more than explaining. And luckily, it did. Therefore, it's beautiful and uneasy. It's all about feeling their doomed situation and worry about the possibilities that the conflict may do to the characters. And while horror movies today only seek for cheap scares and nothing else, it's kind of cool of seeing one of the rare that is both disturbing and thought-provoking.

"Original, unnerving with room for improvement","It Follows is a breath of fresh air in a horror genre that has succumbed to using jump scares and over-the-top gore to engage its audience. It is suspenseful and borderline ingenious with its concept, but it also has some faults that lessen its lasting impression.The plot of It Follows is as ominous as it is simplistic, yet it is a difficult to discuss without sounding ridiculous. Jay (Maika Monroe) is followed by an insidious force, what is essentially a shape shifting entity, after getting involved in a sexual encounter. She is instructed to ""pass it on"", i.e. sleep with someone else, effectively passing 'It' further down the chain. In short, the film is the product of personifying an STI, with even more horrific results.The director David Robert Mitchell shoots the film in a clear homage to horror films from the genre's golden age, with a sinister and atmospheric mood along the lines of John Carpenter's original Halloween. The slow 360º degree pan and an emphasis on the foreground are used to superb effect, helping create an unnerving atmosphere. Add to this a top-notch soundtrack, echoing 80's horror synth-notes, and you have a very unsettling film indeed. Unfortunately some old horror clichés and contrived plot points designed to advance the story chip away at the film's core.It Follows is the most original horror film since Cabin in the Woods (2012) and a refreshing take on the teenage horror genre, as long as you don't think about it too hard.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Carpenter would be proud, also it gives me Cat People vibes","After watching and loving Under the Silver Lake, I decided to check out David Robert Mitchell's breakout horror film and I wasn't disappointed. There is a lot to love here, especially Mike Gioulakis' another beautiful cinematography which makes this movie so pleasant to watch. The score is also one of the best things about this movie. The premise is really interesting and my interpretation is that IT is actually HIV virus, killing everyone it touches and is transmitted through sexual intercourse. I didn't like the ending though, I wish they rounded it up better and also some of the acting was bad. Nevertheless, this is a great slow horror movie with awesome soundtrack and I can't wait for DRM's next movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A modern horror classic that comes along all too rarely,"I seriously recommend seeing ""It Follows"" - just released on Blu-Ray and DVD. It's one of the best horror films to be released in the 21st century so far, imo. Artistic without ever being pretentious, ripe with a sexual-political subtext without ever being gratuitous, beautifully shot and at times, very, very frightening. I liked it when I saw it in the cinema a few months ago, and just saw it on Blu-Ray and absolutely loved it. Modern horror is a quagmire of sh*t, for the most part, but to save you from digging, ""It Follows"" is a diamond among the cack, and deserves to be hailed as a classic in years to come. I urge you to see it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Public Service Announcement,"""It Follows"" is a a low budget yet decent film about a being/entity/presence that quite literally follows its victim.A young woman gets intimate with a guy only to have him violently tell her, ""tag, you're it"", in a sense. Maybe he didn't say those exact words, but he essentially told her that now he has freed himself and that she will be followed by some unknown malevolent life force and it will continue to follow her until it has killed her. That is, unless she can find someone else to pass it on to.The movie then takes us through some tense moments with a few jump scares. The story line is OK as well as the acting.What I can't figure out though is: is this movie a public service announcement for abstinence or for sleeping with as many people as you can? Makes you go ""hmmmmm?""",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Amazing Just Best For A Real Horror Fan,"Let me first start saying didn't expect much of this movie.Always look for a new horror movie that is different and usually great reviewed and it is crap.Love My Horror!First 10mins thought was a B movie horror average but from then on, What a thrill ride seriously best horror in so long had me in shivers. Original And what a ride i wished it never ended. Watching horror for years and years and this is something that made me really feel terror. One of the scenes has to be the most scariest things i have ever seen and so unexpected.I Congratulate the film makers. If you want to see an original horror movie that wasn't done before, here it is.Thank You",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The overall mood was tremendous but it wasn't really creepy.,"""This thing. It's going to follow you. Somebody gave it to me. And I pass it to you.""Now this was a movie I really was looking forward to. I'm a horror fanatic who's always on the lookout for films in this genre that leave others far behind in terms of originality and atmosphere (such as ""He never died"", ""Goodnight Mommy"", ""The Babadook"" and ""Spring"" for instance). And many advised me to watch this one. The fact that the hype about this movie was disproportionate, made my expectations go sky-high. And did it meet my expectations? Partially it did and partly it didn't. The fact that I went outside for some fresh air after I had watched it and I looked briefly over my shoulder because of the feeling that I was being watched, means that the atmosphere was quite alright. On the other hand it wasn't really creepy and it felt rather as if I watched a ridiculous educational film about the dangers of sexual intercourse.The association with sexually transmitted diseases was made quickly. There's only one difference. Here it's not confined to the proliferation of microscopic cells that'll make sure you get such a terrible disease. In ""It follows"" the deadly sexual disease which spreads from one to another, is presented by slow moving and yet sometimes quite terrifying and sinister-looking individuals. The shape ""It"" takes is randomly. It ranges from totally unknown persons, to someone in your immediate circle of acquaintances. There's only one thing the infected person should keep in mind. And that's not to get caught by ""It"". A certain death would be the end result, after which ""It"" focuses on the previous one in the line of infected victims.The beginning of the film certainly wasn't disappointing. To be honest, in a sense you could say it was brilliant. A confused teenage girl driving off in panic, ending up somewhere on a beach where she makes one last phone call with her parents to say goodbye. The next image is a molested body. The tone was set and it looked like my expectations would be fulfilled. That's what I thought. Because as the movie progressed, the ominous atmosphere and a feeling of discomfort remained, but really frightening it became nowhere. Even worse. They piled up one stupidity after the other. I thought the final piece was pitifully poor and stupid. And again they couldn't resist to finish in the most clichéd manner. The only one who was able to use his brain cells was Paul (Keir Gilchrist). His solution was as effective as dead simple.But once again, the overall mood was tremendous. That constant feeling of threat reminded me of the better horror movies of the 80s like ""Halloween"" or ""Friday the 13th"". The only difference is that now it's not about a crazy psychopath with a shiny sharp knife, but something supernatural. A kind of insidious disease. The soundtrack with intensive synth music and familiar sound effects were reminiscent of films made in that period. Even attributes of that time were used here. Although I sometimes had the impression that they mixed up two different eras (a black and white TV and an e-reader). Maybe the characters were fans of a vintage interior design. In terms of originality ""It follows"" scores very high. But in terms of implementation, the horror content could be somewhat stronger. Maybe they could use this film as an educational film for today's youth.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Very Effective,"Remember that creepy old guy in the black hat from that Poltergeist sequel? Imagine those scenes but with the relentless unstoppable menace of the Terminator, played out in a strange dreamy 80s atmosphere with John Carpenter style music. That's a pretty accurate description of It Follows.Its unique enough to be interesting, and definitely scary enough to be memorable and talked about. Is it good enough to be great? I'm not so sure - I kept thinking of all the interesting avenues the story could have gone down, but it seemed reticent to really explore its own idea. Even the most obvious idea of a long, decent chase/following scene was missing. In place of more plot development, we get lots of long takes and panning shots to build the sense of menace and intrigue. Its creepy, but after a while I felt like I had adapted a little too well to the style and would have preferred more substance instead. There are to few genuinely scary moments when there could have been far, far more.I still respect the idea and the effort - and do love the movie - for me its just one of those films where I really wanted it to be great, to do justice to the strong idea.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"A modern 80's classic. Not a masterpiece, some distinct shortcomings, but great nonetheless.","As most of us Horror fans are well aware of, shooting a Horror film is usually a very unrewarding experience when fame and fortune are considered. It is not a very popular genre, regardless to a loyal and growing fan-base worldwide. In It Follows, writer-director David Robert Mitchell took on an additional challenge - creating an artistic classic inspired by the prominent differentiated style of the 80's. The sales compared to the budget may have deemed the project a failure, but any and every Horror fan out there who would give it a chance would have an extraordinary experience!Everything about It Follows feels like a blast from the past, being an obvious tribute to decades past. The story is quite generic - some supernatural creature following and tormenting its victims. The costumes, acting, lighting and cinematography all resemble the distinct style of the 80's. Even the television sets are old, heavy and round-screened, showing old black and white films. The best feature in this regard is the soundtrack - original, retro and authentic, giving the sensation of watching a film from 30 years ago.Even the socio-political subliminal messages are from a time past. The creature's victims are chosen after having sexual relations, protesting promiscuity and extent sexual freedom. The conversations between the characters (for instance, the ""8 mile speech"" mentioned in the quotes) criticize racism and geographic profiling. These messages, banal as they are in this day and age, were extremely popular back in the 80's.The acting is right on the spot. Body language, intonations, sensations of fear, even the sex scenes - all seem ""older"" and much less intense and ""in your face"" than modern Hollywood. Considering the cast is mostly in its early to mid 20's, they obviously had to expand their abilities and learn how to make their acting style older and more traditional. I personally enjoy modern Horror and prefer it, yet can't ignore the skills displayed by the cast. Very impressive!The downside of the film is the use of certain unnecessary cheats. While the female cast doesn't look like porn actresses with completely flat bellies and huge silicon breasts (and even the bathing suites aren't bikinis, not to mention that bathing suites were actually used instead of showing skinny dip scenes which have become quite popular in modern Slashers) - many scenes (especially of the creature) portray nudity. In addition, one of the first scenes shows very violent graphics. I can't help but feel frustrated with this. Both the violence and the nudity are completely redundant and unnecessary, and feel like a silly attempt at forcing an R rating. The eerie and creepy mood would have wanted for nothing without these cheats, and I honestly can't comprehend why Mitchell decided to use them.However - It Follows gains lots of points for avoiding the use of cheap jump-scares. The situations described in the story and the sympathy with the characters are what make it scary, not stereotypical ""Boo!"" moments. I would have liked to see certain plot twists and a better story development (not to mention a better more climactic ending), but even without the film seems to achieve all that it aims for.In summary, I would definitely recommend It Follows to any Horror fan looking for something different and more intelligent, as well as to cinema fans who enjoy the artistic nuances. Not the best, but far from the worst!",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Interesting Film,"It Follows is a 1980s style horror film about a sexually transmitted haunting. One thing you need to know before seeing this film is that it's not for all everyone because it's not like most horror films. It Follows is unlike the BS horror films Hollywood keeps putting out like Annabelle and Ouija. The film makers made it to tell a story, not just to throw some cheep recycled crap full of jump scares on the screen for two hours to steal your money. The film's cinematography was so beautiful I almost cried. The opening scene was just amazing, but sadly it set the bar a little to high for the film. (Maika Monroe) did a great job portraying her character, Jay, but some of her friends, like Paul (Keir Gilchrist), could have done a little bit better, but it still was not terrible. One of the main disappointments was the story. It had a good basis, but it had many plot holes. Also many critics said this is ""the scariest movie you'll ever see,"" but the scariest part of the whole movie was in first five minutes. Not to give away too much, but the opening is about a girl who had ""It"" before our Jay. The opening scene was pretty gory and terrifying, but that was all. The rest of the movie was not scary at all. One other thing about the film that was the writers portrayal of 80's horror. In most 80's horror the parents are never around, but when they are written out, they have an excuse to leave their kids alone in a time of crisis. In It Follows the parents are around, they just never come on screen. Also the teens were watching classic black and white science fiction comedy, which most teens don't. My friends and I do, but we don't dress and talk like it's the 80's too. Another thing that made no sense is that her friends offer to sleep with her so she doesn't have to worry about it anymore. These friends have seen how messed up ""It"" has made her, and they offer like it's no big deal to take ""It"" off her hands. Lastly there were many plot holes. There were some points where it was OK to leave you guessing, but there were some major plot holes. Like the rules behind ""It"" were very confusing. In the beginning it is said that ""It' can't touch you, ""It"" touches Jay at least three times through out the film and she's just fine. Then there are a few scenes where ""It"" disguises itself as a a creepy old lady, a naked old man, or a beat up bloody cheerleader. Also there are some tiny plot holes with her kid neighbors, but it was not that big of a deal. Some bigger plot holes are like when the main characters are trying to get rid of ""It"" they just sleep with anyone. If whoever has ""It"" gets killed, ""It"" goes back to haunt whoever had it last, knowing this, why didn't the characters just sleep with someone who has a lot of sex. If given to just some random person at a bar who had sex quite often, ""It"" could then then ""be passed further and further away from the characters, so even if ""It"" keeps going down the line killing people, it'll be a while before ""It"" gets back to you. This is finally realized at the end, but it unknown if Jay and her friends are really free of ""It"". Saying all that, the film was great, but it could have been better.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Good and kinda original horror picture,"Greetings from Lithuania.""It Follows"" (2014) has got some really intriguing idea. It's not the most original horror plot, but it will definitely raise a question - ""what would i did in this kind of situation?"" - so you can count this one as having a truly kind of original horror movie plot twist.Execution of this plot is also done not in a traditional way. Cinematography is terrific in here - there are some steady and long shoots, there is no shaky camera, so you can always see bright and clear what is going on. Direction, writing are very solid. Music was also very good, and not a traditional horror movie theme. Acting was good, much better than in average horror flick, although no one here will win anything for in acting department.And yet, i'm giving to ""It Follows"" ""only"" 8/10 - seeing the praises from critics i thought the final rating will be higher. Don't get me wrong - this is an exceptionally well made and kind of original horror picture. It barely drags and is involving from start till finish. But it doesn't grab you as hard as it could have, the premise and execution of it's parts are better then the whole.

The Vidiot Reviews...,"It FollowsOut of all of the STD's, getting pregnant is probably the worst.But as this horror movie suggests - you could contract something even worse.Immediately after having sex, Hugh (Jake Weary) tells Jay (Maika Monroe) that he's transmitted a curse to her that will exterminate every previous carrier if she is killed by the shape-shifting entity that'll be following her until she passes it on.Aided by her friends (Keir Gilchrist, Olivia Luccardi, Lili Sepe), Jay flees the creature – having intercourse in the interim to break the curse - but to no avail.Out of options, they attempt to kill the being before its carnal chain letter unravels.Atmospheric with a moody soundtrack to match, It Follows is an art-house horror movie with layers of sexual subtext; however, this approach evokes more contemplation than trepidation.Besides, the stranger following you around after sex is usually your partner's ex.Yellow Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

It Follows doesn't disappoint.,"Basically it's the camera work of this fine up and coming director David Robert Mitchell who handled this horror film with respect to the genre. Along with the great photography and ---- of course, the lead actress Maika Monroe who's a pleasure to watch. After having watched The Guest in which she also is cast , i went to see this film. There are certain comparisons in the two films - both horror films- the synth music , and maybe hints of the same kind of atmosphere - and that it emphasises on young people and not the parents or older ones.I liked both of them , but i think "" It Follows "" heads higher. Because it also reminded me of "" the shining"" , basically the eerie shots the director filmed in various points , for instance , the ones that are full screen moving sceneries - no people or familiar objects in sight , just moving scenery. It added the haunting vibes , of which the film has plenty and thus , its a successful horror film.The actors overall were solid in their roles. The music was perhaps exceptional. The director certainly paid homage to older horror films , he didn't copy techniques , but he used them to create something of his own , and that is admirable.Because It Follows is original. You can compare it to films coming close to it , but in essence it stands alone.Again , great photography , apparently of Detroit suburbia and solid filming.The reason it got a 7 by me , and not more , is that it got tiresome at a point where you are too familiar with what's happening , you know the pattern. Still , due to the good filming and the cast's work it managed to stand , but there was a mild sense of --- ""ok i get it now - lets move on"". Maybe it was just me , but i got that thought at a point about two thirds into the film.But this is me stating maybe the only "" minus "" of this otherwise great film. So don't be put off by this remark.It will scare you , do watch it with friends , girlfriend/boyfriend or alone , just be warned , it does the job.Well done to the director , a great second feature film to have made.Looking forward to both the director's next work , and the actress's Maika Monroe's with whom i'm starting to have a moderate obsession.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Worth watching but not spectacular.,It was a decent flick but no where near as scary or good as the reviews on here make it sound. It was a bit creepy but the evil element was lame. The follower could have been a lot creepier The way they deal with it was unrealistic considering its supposed to be a supernatural being. The acting was good enough. The story idea was a good one. There were really no special effects to dazzle you. Cant compare to The Ring or the Grudge for creepiness and scariness. Could have been a lot scarier. It was more of an old school creep out rather than a gross out or a blood-fest. It didn't have any surprise jump out of your seat scares.

Horror that weaves itself in the fabric,"Horror is illusion that unfolds in space, mind itself. Nothing else needs said, much less a whole story of explanations.This was Halloween for me. It wasn't a story about this masked killer, how he's an embodiment of evil or all of the other things Loomis run around announcing to us. Loomis was merely the carnival barker - a PT Barnum - ushering us in the tent, grooming the encounter. It was the place you could inhabit from which horror sprang, a sleepy suburbia with kids dashing by on Halloween night and livingrooms dimly lit by TV.And so it is here. There's a story here about a presence that attaches itself to people but it matters little. We have almost no mythos, no real explanations of particulars, the thing somehow exists and is passed on sexually. (I'm sure that will be one for sequels to ruin by explaining)The rest is in being in that place, a quiet suburbia much like Carpenter's with the big houses and nicely kept lawn that shrieks can pierce. It's in the thing that will just lunge at you again and again until it gets you, taking any shape. In the running up and down houses that spills out into quiet suburban streets.Everything you need to know is in the very first scene; a girl runs out of the house screaming on an afternoon, an ordinary day. The street is empty save for a neighbor unloading his shopping bags from a car, who asks is she OK. We have seen nothing, but something has scared her out of her wits.We get a few silly popup moments that mar the effect, but the whole is cool, embodied in space, present. Something has insinuated itself in the fabric of things and occupies bodies that create encounters. My favorite of those is when an inexplicably tall man enters through a door, a chilling moment because of how it throws our footing in a solid reality asunder.And if the world is a remarkable thing, it is not because we see the meaning of it at first and can point to it as something we can explain but on the strength of its chance occurrences and paradoxes.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Some good stuff, but mostly boring","I like the fact that there are times when an expected jump scare just doesn't happen. That's good. I think that if you watch the trailer it ruins the movie.Then there are the characters. I like the fact that they're mostly ""normal"" but it is a shame that they also do too many obvious things. That's a real shame.I think that they could have done much more with this IDEA though...so because of the idea behind it and the fact that this is a budget movie that relies more on suspense than jump scares, I gave it 6 stars. I really wanted to like it more than this but the budget is just TOO obvious. They should have been more in your face about certain things and that is where it fell down for me - too much not happening and then when something does happen then it's not really paid off properly for the audience (at least for me). If they had a bigger budget they could have been more explicit with some of the themes and scenes and that would have paid off more than this one eventually does. Some inconsistencies or non-sensical (yes, I know) stuff that ruined it for me too...watch it and you'll understand.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Great Idea. . executed not enough,"Good acting........enjoyed it very much. But.For now it's only - 1 (enjoy YOURSELf)The main and only drawback of this film is poor executing/realisation. After all. The idea is quite interesting and original, to some extent even instructive... However, its implementation itself is inferior: the acting is at the appropriate level, but the plot is noticeably weak - its step-by-step and presentation, as well as a poor script, too illegible, insufficient, everywhere there are blanks and it incompleteness;
Even the same filming: the cinematography is quite good, but the editing of the entire film looks like an amateur debut. As a result, the film's potential is largely neglected.Some explanations of script actions were missing in places where they are needed. There are not enough corrections in the actions and filming before these actions. The transitions are edited too discretely and not coherently according to the script, when at least a little, but it had to be refined.. . In sense, when more for the sake of a full perception of the picture, (meaning) not for the discovery or understanding of the already obvious. . As a result, in fact, it is too weak and overrated modern cinema. But with a wonderful idea, plan.

Simply chilling!,"This modern day horror film is highly rated based on a simple idea of a young girl who is stalked by a malevolent presence. The style in which it is made, and even the story itself takes you back to the classic horror movies of the 70s and 80s. In fact it reminded me of the original 'Amytville horror' movies and 'Poltergeist'. It begins with the ordinary life of a young girl who has a sexual encounter with a young boy, from this point her living nightmare begins. The viewer experiences her desperate search for an answer to this supernatural force which manifests itself in different ways. The film remains creepy and it's chill can be felt with the characters being believable and likable as they battle something that is crude and evil. The film seems to have an underlying message for teenagers as 'It' seems to represent the filth of society and the evils of debauchery and changing sex partners. However away from the moral messages, this film is a future horror classic and I hope a sequel is coming soon. @zulfmanauthor",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Appropriately Creepy,"On the creepiness factor - which is probably the most important element in a movie like this - ""It Follows"" works brilliantly. For me, what has made a lot of teen horror movies major disappointments is that they've settled into little more than blood and gore fests, where you spend most of your time waiting for the next kid to bite the dust. But a lot of those movies lack the proper atmosphere. This one sets that mood of creepiness over gore right from the start; the moment when Jay (Maika Monroe) wakes up bound and confined to a wheelchair in a parking lot, while the guy she had just had sex with and who chloroformed her after (which was a twist in itself) explains that the sex passed on a curse to her that she could only rid herself of by having sex with someone else. And ""it"" - the curse - stalks her for the rest of the movie, as her friends try to help her.It's a pretty simple plot, and it worked well. Nothing about the curse (except how to get rid of it) was ever explained. It was just a mystery, and that lack of understanding just heightened everything. For this kind of movie, there was surprisingly little nudity, and almost no blood. Instead - surprise - the movie revolved around an actual story, which was very refreshing. On an entirely different level, you could look at this as a warning about the potential danger of casual sex, I suppose.Monroe's performance as Jay was very convincing, and the musical score quite effective. I did keep scratching my head wondering where all these kids' parents were. Or perhaps that was another subtle warning - this one about the danger of absentee parents.Basically, very well done all round. One of the better horror movies made in recent years.

"A classic horror film, in every way!","'IT FOLLOWS': Five Stars (Out of Five)Critically acclaimed indie horror flick about a young woman who's constantly followed by a mysterious unknown entity, which is trying to kill her. It was written and directed by David Robert Mitchell and filmed on a budget of just $2 million. The film stars Maika Monroe, Keir Gilchrist, Lili Sepe, Daniel Zovatto, Jake Weary and Olivia Luccardi. It's a classic horror film, in every way, and it definitely lives up to all of it's hype!Jay (Monroe) is a nineteen-year-old college student with a crush on a 21-year-old guy, named Hugh (Weary), she just met. The two go out on a couple of dates and then have sex together, in Hugh's car. Hugh then knocks her out, with chloroform. When Jay wakes up, Hugh informs her that he's transferred a curse to her, by sleeping with her, and she'll now be followed by a mysterious unknown force, that will constantly try to kill her. He explains that the only way she can get rid of the curse is to sleep with someone else, as he did with her. Jay spends the rest of the film frantically trying to elude the deadly entity, that's now following her, with the help of her friends.The film appears to be set in the 70s or 80s, most of the time, but the characters also use cell phones and other modern devices, at other times. Still it has that classic 70s, or 80s, horror movie feel to it; and the timelessness of the film's setting is part of it's magical charm (Monroe also starred in the retro 80's action flick 'THE GUEST', just last year). The score, by the electronic musician known as Disasterpeace, is strikingly haunting and very reminiscent of the popular slasher flicks of yesteryear. The whole movie just has that classic horror genre movie feel to it; like those directed by John Carpenter or George A. Romero. It feels a lot like a very haunting, and quite disturbing, nightmare; which is what Mitchell says he based the premise for the movie on (his own recurring bad dreams, about something constantly following him). There's of course a lot of unexplained mystery to it, and several aspects of the story that don't seem to always make sense, at all, but that's part of the movie's charm as well.

Started well but got progressively bad.,"I have to admit that I am not really into the horror movie genre even when it's cleverly done. In fact, I cannot remember the last movie of this type I thoroughly enjoyed. This is why I was so nicely surprised when I found myself totally hooked by ""It follows"" a few minutes into the movie.But the thing is that it's not enough to have a decent idea. It's equally important to know what to do with it. And I have the feeling that the scriptwriter did not really know where this was going. I am not going to spoil you the end or the intermediate part. I'll just say that the movie loses character as it progresses and the ending is disappointing to say the least.Still, I'd give it the thumbs up for a Sunday watch, and if you need an excuse to get your girl under the blanket for a hug.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Best Horror Film in Years,"This movie is great for anyone that is sick of the modern ""horror"" film style in recent years. Rather than using cheap jump scares, It Follows has a continuous feeling of dread. The movie has an original premise, but the story can feel silly at times. Some of the dialogue is cringe inducing, but the overall dialogue is decent. The lead actress did a great job with her role. She essentially had to appear to be on the verge of a panic attack for the entire movie, and her performance was very convincing. The supporting actors and actresses were not as good, but still decent enough to not deduct from the overall film. Any fan of horror films should definitely check this out.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
a highly thrilling experience,"This movie makes many things right. First of all it must be said that the main idea of the movie is nicely chosen. Yes, there are some movies which have a similar idea. But ""It follows"" mixes those ideas up and combines them to a new entertaining style of horror. So actually the movie isn't really that innovative, like many people pretend. It is rather how the movie is made, it's about the entertainment. Scary music, combined with a very well proportioned amount of jump-scares and visual-scares. Between those scares the movie doesn't get boring, because the director manages that the viewers are afraid nearly in the same level like the protagonists. Why that? It's because of those scares which are really intensively done. The viewer is just afraid of the next scare, because the viewer knows that it will come for sure, and is waiting it to happen. It could happen in any moment and in every place. So it must be said that the thrill goes non-stop throughout the whole movie. The main aspect which must be criticized is that the protagonists behave really stupid. As a viewer you ask yourself: wait, why doesn't she do this or that? But if you search an entertaining and highly thrilling movie (it's less a horror, i would rather call it a thriller with some horror-like moments), then this is the one you need to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I stumbled upon the best horror movie....,"I was looking for something to watch...as a huge fan of the horror genre I was intrigued by the title, and started to watch without knowing what I was getting into... The greyish, slow, beautiful setting got me interested, the beautiful actors as well. As the storyline developed I found myself sitting by the edge of my seat. The idea in this horror movie is NEW, refreshing... mesmerizing. You always want to know whats next, looking over your shoulder. The ending is superb! Keeps you wanting more...

Pretty. Pretty Pretentious.,"2014 gave us classics like Annabelle, hilarious horror comedies like The Voices and truly disturbing films like Starry Eyes.Then there was It Follows. Whatever the heck it is.It Follows seems to be a self-conscious trip through horror history, with references to the B&W Creature from the Black Lagoon, slow-moving sinister escaped hospital patients sort of like John Carpenter's Halloween, and a beat-you-over-the-head repetitive cliche of people getting killed for having sex like every trashy 1980s slasher ever made.The best element of It Follows is the atmosphere, which has a fluid time travel effect from approximately the late 1960s up until 2014, settling roughly somewhere in the early 1990s. There are some truly magnificent lamps.There's also something authentically eerie about how realistic everything feels, from messy dusty childhood homes to awkward social interactions.But ultimately this slow burn flick ends on kind of a bleh note. I was searching for the point, and it doesn't seem to have anything to do with STIs. It just more or less struck me as a pretentious commentary on horror genre trends from the 1980s through the early 2000s.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

I liked it,"Let's start with pro's, it was a unique horror/thriller with a plot i've never seen or thought of before. There was nothing that took me out of the moment completely. There are lots of unique camera angles that do a good job in making you feel in the situation. To give an example when you learn what the entity is/how it works there are a good amount of shots that make you feel like you never know when you will see it coming. Also there were only like 3 jump scares, my girlfriend and I didn't know what was going to happen or how it would end. Now to the few con's, there are too many times that they do something stupid that could have been avoided to get more suspense out of the situation, it slightly took away to the realness feel of the situation. Also I felt that this movie would have benefited from a more sneaky complex plan to handle or deal with the entity, sometimes there is no out of the box kind of thinking amongst the group. All in all though i really liked it and the freshness of the story, definitely worth a watch. For the people who say not enough was explained about certain parts, i feel like there was an aura of mystery to it and i in no way felt jipped out of parts in the story. And for the person who said sarcastically ""a plane ticket was out of the question"" there are lots of problems with that scenario in my opinion, i don't want to give any parts of the story away explaining why i think that but when i think of how it works doing something like that would have to be very planned out and timed to perfection for it work with the way the entity works.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Wasted a potential classic,"This film certainly had an intriguing concept and that's really what kept me through it.While being overly quite a slow and plodding movie, the way they introduced the actual plot was quite nice. The ""monster"" had a vague presentation which was carefully clarified as the film moved on while the characters simultaneously had to figure out how to deal with the situation. The viewer is also figuring out the whole storyline with them which is a nice detail to the overall presentation.Now, the film is quite neat to look at and the score does its job perfectly fine, as do the actors.However, the main issue I have with it is that it feels very dragged out (ironically considering how short it is). It just feels like they wanted to capitalise on the concept for this film so much that they felt forced into making a full length film, while in reality, this didn't have to be that.But we got what we got and the pacing of the movie is certainly too slow at times to keep itself interesting. I was quite hooked by it throughout since I also wanted to find out more about how this monster operates and what can be done with it.Sadly, I did have to check my watch a few times.

A Great Idea But Disappointing,"(THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS)I am baffled at the gushing reviews given for this movie. Granted the IDEA is superb, I loved the idea behind the plot but the movie overall was a disappointment for me. The camera work, which at first was brilliant, soon lost credibility with so many shots that added NOTHING to the plot and were distracting and misleading. Generally a camera shot should contribute to the plot by offering clues, establishing location, mood, or suspense, but multiple camera shots led NOWHERE and became a distraction. After three or four camera shots led to zero payoff, the director lost credibility. Also, the plot established that those following the victims of the curse would always be walking, but then we see one of those shown earlier as walking, suddenly now shows up on a bike. Also the reason why certain people were ""followers"" is never fleshed out in the plot, with some being dressed, some naked, or partially naked, some just stood (as the man on the house) and NEVER walked at all which we were previously told was a clue as to the nefarious intent of the follower. This plot needs to tie together those that are the followers with those that are followed. In one scene a male ""follower"" enters a house but the murder is carried out by a female. I WILL admit it is an idea that stays with you after you leave the theater and I DID find myself paying attention to people walking towards my direction outside the theater, but overall I was disappointed with many aspects of this film.Sorry.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Epic,"I would recommend this film to anyone who is nostalgic about the 80's style horror movies. It is truly a fresh and new approach compared to the other horror films nowadays which contain many predictable jump-scares and clichés. And of course when I was watching it I thought to myself how well the music suits with the overall style of this particular piece. And as I now looked at the budget and how much it received revenue on the opening week and in gross, I think it is really underrated. I saw the trailer of it in the cinema some days ago but then I learned that it was released already relatively long time ago so I watched it right away,",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

I've seen many indie and or amateur films, some bad and some good. This one, although not the best, would be one of the good.

The Horrors of Sexual Awakening,"""It Follows"" joins ""The Babadook"" in a mini-boom of horror films in the last year or two that turn the literal psychological states of their main characters into tangible bogeymen that are every bit as real (and seemingly unstoppable) as Michael Meyers or Jason Voorhees. In ""The Babadook,"" the protagonist's overwhelming grief became first a frightening predator lurking in the shadows and then a demon that possessed her and turned her into the monster. In ""It Follows,"" the predator springs from adolescent sexual awareness and promiscuity, a sort of walking, talking STD that no medical treatment is going to get rid of. In fact, it's easy to read ""It Follows"" as an anxious response to our modern-day knowledge of every consequence, from deadly to merely embarrassing, that can arise from sex, both protected and otherwise. But I think the movie is less about the fear of anything so specific as contracting an STD, and more about that purgatory between adolescence and adulthood when kids start doing and feeling adult things without the life experience to process them emotionally. It's no accident that parents are absent in this film; these kids are on their own, navigating the scary emotional waters of sexual awakening without a compass.The movie isn't totally successful, and it's certainly not very scary. The threat at the center of the film is sometimes treated as a supernatural force, sometimes as something corporeal that can be outrun and killed, and the balancing act between the two is frequently awkward. But it's a thoughtful movie and, like ""The Babadook,"" it picks as its monster something far more horrifying, because so much more real, than any monster dreamed up in a slasher film.Grade: B+",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Good mystery and suspense story,"I really enjoyed this movie, you have to see it for yourself, it is a good mystery, suspense flick with good moments, it is not the best movie out there so not expect to much, but still worth the time.

Run, hide, but it will keep looking for you and following. It is very simple. Do not expect to much horror, but expect a good mystery suspense movie. I Do not understand why some people give so bad review to a movie that is intended to be slow, to be involving, and is what you get.

"All hype aside, a creepy little thing","It Follows! The long awaited sequel to Stephen Kings It! I couldn't say I recognized much from the original IT, but hey.. What do I know? KIDDING! Hah, I am a funny guy.It follows! I am a little confused here. Did I like this because it was really good, or did I like it because I know it has gotten real good reviews?I don't usually buy into hype, because I've many times experienced that movies ""everybody"" loves, ain't always that good. Therefore I think It follows is pretty good.But let's just get right into it. It Follows has some genuinely creepy scenes. Really creepy. I actually got goosebumps at one time. And I don't goosebump easily from horror.Personally I could have taken a couple more creepy scenes, but maybe they work better since they are not that many. Apart from the creepiness of some scenes, the atmosphere in the movie in general kind of weighs down on you. There's some good use of sound effects and music here. It's unsettling and dark, and you kind of wonder if there is something the movie isn't telling you.The acting is really good. I don't think we've seen the last of Maika Monroe! She works very well because even though she is pretty and hot, she looks like a normal teenager.

Drenched in atmosphere while curiously lacking in substance,"There seems to be quite a few films recently which hearken back to the late 70's/early 80's in terms of filmmaking style. IT FOLLOWS is one of the films in this mold that capture a certain feeling of nostalgia while also having its foot firmly planted in the present. It's about a vague entity that follows you around after having sex with somebody who also has the same problem. Inasmuch as the Friday THE 13TH series was about abstinence, IT FOLLOWS is in a similar vein, with a heavy dose of John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN and Wes Craven for good measure. The most outstanding part of this film is the subtle approach taken with the horror, letting it build quietly without using the score to jolt you. There was also great care taken with the direction and cinematography that helped to build an atmosphere of tension and dread. Even without being a horror movie (albeit, more of a psychological one), the cinematography and camera-work was excellent, with precise, deliberate movement, slow pans and zooms, etc. It was quite artful, to say the least. I should also mention the outstanding score by Disasterpeace, which captures a feeling I haven't felt since watching HALLOWEEN. So, at least on the surface, IT FOLLOWS has a lot going for it. However, I do ask a little bit more from movies I watch than to impress me visually and aurally, and apart from these qualities, IT FOLLOWS was quite banal. The acting was decent, although no one really stood out from the rest. The potential in the setup for this ""it"" to be anything or anyone allowed for a few good sequences, but it also meant that the narratively was a little too linear for my tastes. It boils down to have sex, wait, and run. And for a 100 minute film, I expected more. There wasn't even an underlying emotional subtext like was in THE BABADOOK. Still, despite being bored through parts of it, the film does manage to pull together for a decent (and appropriate) finish. I would recommend people to see this, but don't go in expecting something revolutionary. There is a little bit of subtext about abstinence/STDs that can be read into IT FOLLOWS and, courtesy of a CHARADE billboard, possibly some meta-commentary on artificiality. However, IT FOLLOWS works perfectly fine as a stylistic exercise that aspires to little more than imitating its cinematic forebears, and does an admittedly good job at it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A great psychological horror yarn,"This is a nice little horror flick. There isn't much gore, instead it relies on a psychological edge. The 'it' in the title comes after the main character, very slowly but relentlessly. This is the main theme of the horror, that this force is unstoppable, eternal and very patient. As one of the characters points out it is always out there making its way gradually towards you. The afflicted can't relax as they have the nagging feeling of never knowing when or where it will catch up with you.The film is set in some unspecified earlier decade. This I imagine is to negate the power of modern technology that would make 'it' less scary (mainly mobile phones and cheap air travel) A lot of effort has been made to make this look old without referencing any specific pop culture. The score sounds like it is performed one handed on a casio keyboard and can be distracting.Well produced a great premise, we had hours of discussion about how we would escape it.A good psychological horror.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Completely pathetic. Here's why...,"Hi there people,This is MY personal opinion and review of this film, which may or may not upset some people (particularly Americans).Let me give you a little background first - I have been watching horror films for well over 34 years, it's definitely my favorite genre - yet I do agree that the genre has become stale, stagnant and completely reliant upon cliché's in the past 10 years or so. Where did this all start? :I blame Wes Craven, and the movie Scream (1996), seriously that was the first time I saw a horror movie and really started to wonder what was going on with the genre, it's film makers, and the people who were so willing to buy into it.Since Scream's release back in 1996, I have not really enjoyed many ""mainstream"" horror films, and would quite realistically say that maybe 2-3 out of 60 have been bearable.Now, this brings us to It Follow.Let me start by pointing out my reasons for a 1 star scare:1. Ridiculous characters, who seem to not want to do the obvious thing that would help themselves.2. A plot which is relatively boring and pretty much just follows (no pun intended) a group of whining ""teens"" around a road trip from one place to the next.3. The ""curse"" (if you will call it that) in the film is very badly researched, nothing is really explained about it's origin, or what can be truly done to defend against it.4. Acting.... You cannot call it that really, it was soap-opera level at best, and I know this was a horror film, but come ON!5. Predictable. This films was incredibly predictable, and remained so from the beginning and throughout. Nothing was left to the viewer's own mind, it was all spilled out for them from the beginning, and that which was not was hinted at so blatantly that a FIVE year old could have guessed it.6. Very cheesy ""cash-in"" on the classic 80's vibe. The film tried to portray an 80's vibe throughout, but it came off as just looking bad. The 80's was a tremendous time for horror films (most of which were far superior to this trash), and this was not a ""throwback"" or ""nod"" to the films of that era, it was a goddamn insult. A try-hard affair.Now, did I like anything about the film?Not particularly - the only redeeming quality I can actually say the thing had going for it was it's score. This, however , was also over-used, but was lovely at times.Summary: David Robert Mitchell - please do not direct another film , and if you do chose to - please don't do another horror. America does not need an ""80's horror film revival"", the 80's were perfectly fine without one, and you are so young you probably do not even RECALL the best of that era. Please, if you make more films (and they are indeed labeled as horror) try to come up with a style which is unique, and of it's own, something which viewers can be captivated with, which is not copied by previous masters of the genre (which you are not).",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
About 90% Great,"What I liked, or even loved, about this movie is the same stuff that drew everyone in.The film looks great, Detroit is a textured and very un-Californian place. The cast is interestingly ordinary-seeming, even the pretty protagonist. The story is nuanced and interesting, and the pacing is deliberate rather than Hollywood (which I'd describe as ""frenetic-with-pauses-for-rote-character-development"").I dislike over-explained sf/fantasy/horror, and it didn't go there. I dislike films where everyone does or doesn't believe the protagonist in a blatantly schematic fashion, and I'm really glad it didn't go there, either.Another thing I'm not into is horror movies based on monster-killing action scenes, so there's one scene in this film that almost spoilt it for me. It's basically my only gripe about the film, so it's a shame it's such a pivotal and dramatic scene, giving us the setup for the ending. It was either a clumsy attempt at an action scene or a failure to up the stakes from the suspense that came before.Luckily, what followed was in fact a good ending, and by the time the credits finally rolled I was back on side again. I liked almost everything about the movie, after all.

Most original horror film concept falls just short,"It Follows offers perhaps the most unique and refreshing concept in horror/thriller films in the past few years. This film has an unexplainable ability to suspend the viewer's disbelief of fictional concepts by masking them with the unknown. The concept of this film is not secret by any means, and is spelled out quite early in the film in a remarkably perfect manner. The simple explanation given to us in the parking structure scene about the concept of ""It Follows"" is all the film needed to say, and is all it did say.The unfortunate problem with this film comes as it shows the characters make choices that are remarkably poor. The audience is taken out of the brilliant concept and thus removed from the suspense of the film due to them questioning the logic and reasoning of the characters.Many viewers and critics will love this film because of the first half perfection and the unique and refreshing idea. I for one, was angered for these same reasons, as the second half and the conclusion were not even in the same hemisphere as the first act of the film.*POSSIBLE SPOILER?*The entire film's concept can be debunked by these three words: Fly to China.

Some people do not agree that it's scary, I think it's scarier than most horror movies nowadays. It's closer with style to Rosemary's Baby or Jacob's Ladder than say Insidious. The style of the movie is very psychological, it refers to a fear of being haunted and the unsettling feeling that follows, that someone watches you. The music by Disasterpeace is absolutely brilliant and fits perfectly to this eerie film. The way this movie is shot is also superb. Mainly dark colours, high definition and no unnecessary slow motion effects and very few effects for that matter. One of the most important films for the genre of the last few years.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Could've been so much better!,"Don't usually do reviews, however, I felt that since this was the first time I read such great reviews on a horror movie I should give my input being a horror movie fan. This was definitely worth the watch, different from the normal ghost in the house, demon lurking, and being possessed and having exorcisms. It brought to live another genre of themes for horror movie which was definitely refreshing!Didn't understand why the random nudity was used at parts, bc the parts in the movie when the people had clothes on were just as disturbing as when they were naked. Didn't really prove an effective point.I say it could've been better because there were a few main jump scared throughout the film and various scares however mostly, it was fear of anticipation and the audiences mind concentrated on what the heck was going on at certain times.It also gave a weird vibe considering that this ghost or follower came about by passing it on through sexual intercourse, very odd and strange. The only down side is that this movie end TERRIBLBY. When I say terrible, I mean that I can easily say it was one of the worst endings of a movie I've seen in a while. Absolutely horrible. Notjing was answered, and it was one of those movies where you watching and waiting for something to happen and it just ends. And you sit back and think ""there's no way that can be the ending,"" clearly knowing it obviously is. It was awful, and no questions were answered.

It Follows...that this movie is complete rubbish.,"Well there's an hour and forty minutes of my life I won't get back. Not scary enough to grip you with fear, not interesting enough to spin your mind, not disturbing enough to trouble your soul. Basically, it's none of the things you want and so deeply crave in a horror/thriller film. The idea was solid, the acting was sufficient, the writing was mediocre, and that's all the good there is to say about it. And now the bad, for which i could just write the films title, NUFF SAID. But this is a review, so into the details. The music was repetitive, boring, and failed to create the proper atmosphere, which is a vital part of any film, particularly those in the horror genre. There was no emotional attachment to any of the characters. ""Oh Look! That dude just died!"" Whoopty doo. ""Hey! That chick just got herself killed!"" Aaaaand I don't care. ""Here's a random familial connection and some abrupt backstory that should inspire deep emotion in you!"" WHAT!? WHERE DID THAT EVEN COME FROM!?...oh, and I still don't care. The kills are lame, not that I mind. I prefer psychological fear factor over blood and guts. But then, there isn't any psychological fear factor to be found. And there aren't any real scares to be found either. Whether you're looking for in-your-face jump scares, or slow builds and glimpses in the corner of the frame, keep looking, because it's not to be found here. The only horror/thriller movies I've seen that didn't have a real fear factor at least had some thought provoking notions. Or at the very, very least, had some stomach turning scenes. All in all, if you liked this movie, GREAT! This review isn't for people who have seen it. For those of you who haven't got around to seeing it yet and, like me, are considering checking it out because the 7+ rating and the good reviews, I strongly urge you NOT TO WASTE AN HOUR AND FORTIE MINUTES OF YOUR LIFE. I almost never regret watching a movie, even if it's terrible, I can always pull something from it that makes it feel like time well spent. But this...this is different, it's just dull, so very, very, dull. It creates no fear, inspires no emotion, produces no thought. Quite simply, it sucks. I have only ever written one other IMDb review, this is not something I commonly do. I only write this to try and save an hour and forty minutes of some other prospective viewers life.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Pretty Creepy!,"Let's get the frustrations out of the way. First, when someone breaks into your house call the police. When something happens, TELL someone. That's the horror mantra that It Follows pursues. But I DO understand why they wouldn't tell. No one would believe them. Because as everyone knows, It is only seen by the chain of sexual adventures from one person to another.The characters all seem to have parental issues and have wrapped themselves in their own world, with hardly a care of being caught for things like smoking or even casual sex. And that is the worst of it. The kids are on their own to deal with a monster that pursues someone who had sex with another that It had been pursuing. The religious references usually seen in films is abandoned too. What would YOU do if you suddenly see yourself pursued by It, and no one else sees It?This is a good concept, and the film is left with questions that beg for a sequel. Will there ever be a cure or action to stop It? Why does It follow? And, just what is It? I certainly hope as the filmmakers pursue making sequels and/or prequels to It, that they explain some things. I did wonder if this is some veiled attempt to morality-preach, as there was no religion or family structure whatsoever. And the film took place in a city of complete and utter decay, symbolizing that perhaps, whatever people touch is doomed.It Follows seems like a cat, or brussels sprouts: you either like it or absolutely hate it. It goes against how young people trend: the film shows them embracing all things retro and rejecting technological things - no Facebook friends in this film. That seems like a gamble, since most of the generation are about Twitter and Instagram. Anyway, I enjoyed it enough to hope for a follow-up film to learn what IT is all about.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
It follows...,"It follows. Wherever you go, it's going, too. It can be everyone. A stranger. A friend. Even family. And if it follows you once, it will follow you to your death.Right from the beginning you know that 'It Follows' is not a typical Horror movie. Without further explanation, the movie pushes you right into the action, which in the eye of the ignorant audience might seem weird but yet arouses curiosity. Even though the concept is simple, the movie is terrifying throughout. Just like ""It"" comes slowly but surely closer, the movie itself has a slow build up which in the end results in a well-made climax. The menacing atmosphere throughout the movie is endorsed by a fitting stress-producing cinematography. But 'It Follows' is despite one or another jump scare in no way a shallow horror-shocker, but rather offers a lot of hidden subtext for every Hobby movie-analyzer. Admittedly, one or two jump scares are in the movie, but combined with a well-build tension they make ones hair stand on end. The movie plays with simple fears, but also provides a threatening nature, that enthralls everyone. Not only the protagonists will develop some kind of paranoia but also the viewer will find himself scanning the setting of the movie more precisely. You will inevitably be thrilled every second of this movie and even try for yourself to find away out of this hopeless situation. Sadly some questions will stay unanswered but that doesn't hurt the movie in any way. In my opinion every great horror movie needs this kind of mysteriousness and perplexity in the end.'It Follows' is a movie for every horror lover. Without any unnecessary shockers or disgusting elements, the movie offers a atmospherically threatening experience that will take everybody's breath away. A lot of hidden subtext and symbolism draws through 'It Follows', which provides the movie depth, that you rarely see in other horror movies. 'It Follows' is an example, that others would do well to follow.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Different but slow.,"In the intro, a girl runs out of her house at sunrise in her sleepwear and high heels for some reason. She stands in the middle of the road then runs back into the house and back out. She gets into her car and drives to a beach. Later we see her dead and her body wrecked.Next we meet a girl named ""Jay"" for some reason, her sister, a friend and a guy friend. They hang out, watch old movies on a black and white tube TV. One night she goes out on a date with a guy she's been seeing. They have sex for first time with each other. Afterward, he drugs her, binds her to a wheelchair and takes her to an abandoned building. Now he comes clean. From now on she will be followed by a stranger or somebody she knows. The followers tend to walk slowly so she can outrun them. A way to deal with this situation is to have sex with someone, it will pass on the condition to them. That's why he had sex with her. And he's right, a naked woman goes after them.And sure enough, next day at school Jay sees an old woman following her. Problem is, no one else sees the followers. Her friends don't understand what's going on with her. She starts seeing followers everywhere. Now another kid from the neighborhood joins the gang, which apparently has nothing else going in their lives than looking after Jay. They drive to the new guy's family remote beach house. But even there someone appears. When one of her friends throws a chair at it, it fights back and sends the kid flying. But they realize that shooting it in the head seems to work.Jay ends up in the hospital and decides to have sex with the new guy much to the chagrin of her virginal friend who has a crush on her. But oddly enough the guy sees nothing. One night though, Jay sees him breaking into his own house and his mom has turned into a follower. The kids then devise a plan to trap a follower and eliminate the threat.It Follows is a different horror movie. It's very much influenced by 70s/early 80s horror movies in terms of the music especially. It reminded me of another very original movie--The Guest. And like it, It Follows also is a bit anachronistic. It seems to be set in the 70s and sometimes it doesn't. Perhaps that accounts also for the very slow pace, which is a problem here because in the addition to that, not much really happens. And the lives of the kids isn't particularly interesting and neither is the lead character Jay. It turns out that the followers are most interesting; not that we get to learn anything about them. In fact we learn nothing about this situation. Nor do we learn how come the date happens to know so much about it. Sure there's the interpretation that all this represents a sexually transmitted disease, or AIDS I guess, since we're talking about a Hollywood production. But that doesn't explain anything. So we're left to make whatever we want to make of It Follows. Unfortunately, the movie doesn't give us enough to go on, nor is it striking enough to care about but it does have a different style.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Woah, surprisingly good","I came into watching this movie without much expectation after seeing The Lazarus Effect which was to me a great disappointment. I was not however disappointed in It Follows. Acting is more than adequate, and although sometimes the movie tends to move slowly the plot line is clear and always well defined. The choice they make at the end is somewhat telegraphed in but well acceptable and had me wondering: Why didn't they do that sooner?Well, they'd have spoiled the rest of the film then wouldn't they.All in all a perfect example of a movie that didn't require a billion dollar production budget with massive digital effects and Dolby quadraphonic bionic sound artifices to achieve the desired effect: Scare the viewer.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Perfect? Hardly. Entertaining? Absolutely.,"Independent movie hits are few and far between. It usually takes a Hollywood marketing machine to churn out a box office success. But occasionally, an independent film hits the mainstream based off of its own merits and garners a following, securing a place in pop culture history and usually boosting the profile of its stars and creators. Good examples of this are Pulp Fiction, Clerks, Good Will Hunting and My Big Fat Greek Wedding.A particular genre of film where independent movies can have a good chance of capturing a large audience is that of horror. Entire franchises, sub-genres and mountains of revenue have been spawned from the horror genre. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween, Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street are all, by definition, independent films. New Line Cinema, the studio behind Elm Street, is often referred to as ""the house that Freddy built"", going from an unheard of studio before Elm Street's success to one that would eventually be responsible for theatrical juggernauts like The Lord of the Rings.With that said, a good bet for an independent film to garner high success with little budget is in this genre, and the most recent example of said success is a film titled It Follows. It Follows puts a new spin on the psychological thriller or boogeyman sub-genres by opting for a villain that any conscious and sexually-active human being would be wary of. The story revolves around a vicious entity that will pursue its victim until it catches them and devours them, and the only way to escape from it is to ""pass it on"", so to speak, by sexually transferring it to another victim. Imagine an STD in the form of a relentless killer, and you've got the plot for the film, as ludicrous, yet entertaining, as it sounds.With such an imaginably silly premise, one might be quick to write off It Follows as just another cash-grab in the genre. The opposite is the case, however, once you've viewed the film. One thing that is apparent from director David Robert Mitchell is that he is clearly a respectful fan of horror and litters homages and nods to the pioneering films that made something like this possible. The musical score to It Follows feels like it was composed by John Carpenter or was borrowed from a 70s grindhouse offering. Little nuances like this give the film credibility by its audience for a terrifying, yet fun experience.The screenwriter, also Mitchell, is trying to evoke the real human emotion of fear of disease with a physical manifestation. He pulls it off rather brilliantly, creating a Grim Reaper-like adversary that is born of a poor decision in fidelity. The message is one that resonates with any sexually active person of being cautious of what you get yourself into, because it could ruin your life, or even worse, kill you.Upon finishing the film, it leaves you with a strange comprehension of what you have just seen. While flawed, it certainly executes in the areas where it needs to in order to connect with its audience. If questioning whether the film was worth doing, I would say that any film that keeps you thinking into the next day is one that was worth it, and It Follows accomplishes that wonderfully. From a financial standpoint it was certainly worth the production, as it started in 4 theaters and has managed to work itself through perseverance and word-of-mouth into a much wider release, more than quadrupling its $2 million budget back. It would be an understatement to call the film successful.Using an unknown cast of actors was definitely the right choice for It Follows. For the most part, the characters appear believable and the lack of big names keeps the film grounded. The main girl, Jay, played by Maika Monroe, is a good example of how an unknown actor can carry a role on their shoulders and blossom the film into a believable territory, regardless of how far-fetched the plot may get. The macabre tone of the film and the heightened terror that the cast experiences is conveyed on a very primal but professional level that leaves the viewer enticed, anxious, and most importantly, scared. While none of the performances are Oscar-worthy, for the horror genre, they are very well-portrayed.Is It Follows the scariest film to come out in recent years? Very arguably. Will it go down as a classic of the genre? Probably not. The most important question, however, is if you see it, will it keep you up at night? If you believe that a film can haunt you, then yes, prepare to save a section of your thought-process to ponder over this new type of boogeyman.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Not the best by far.,"Really? 7.3 out of ten? Maybe 25 years ago. A Very slow film with not much happening at all. Oh, they get followed by an entity in the form of a human that walks very slow. No plot to speak of, no special effects or anything to attract an audience. Watched until the end just to see how it pans out and how they get rid of it. Not too much story to give you a spoiler. As John carpenter was mentioned in a previous review I feel there are a lot of his films which are much better than this one like The Thing, The Fog, Vampires, just to mention a few. I definitely wouldn't recommend this film to any of my friends. Of course, make your own mind up as everybody's opinion is different. Thanks.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"""It Follows"" even after the movie","This movie can be a real nightmare for some people. After a long time i finally found something interesting in Horror genre. It Follows is an unnerving and insane horror film with an explosive climax that will leave you buzzed upon leaving the Theater! It Follows is probably one of the most creepiest movie I've seen in a long time or i can say after ""RING"".The plot is simple. Girl gets a PSTD from having unprotected sex with a guy, which causes her to be chased by ghosts only she can see. She must have sex to pass on the PSTD, but once the ghost kills the new carrier it will come back for her. So what makes this movie so good? The atmosphere.

"The hype is ridiculous, but this is a pretty good horror film","Wow! I've never quite heard such angry grumbling over a movie when the lights came up before. The word ""horrible"" was being thrown around generously, so much so that the teenage girl waiting to clean up the theater afterword commented on how angry everyone was. No, I'm not quite with these people (the theater was loaded at 11 AM, for the record), but this was a major disappointment. Much like the desperately overrated The Babadook, this is a somewhat clever horror movie that sort of bucks mainstream horror conventions. Just because it's better than most horror movies (and, believe me, I had to sit through half an hour of terrible-looking horror previews to see this movie - if you want a good laugh look up Unfriended on Youtube) doesn't make it anything fantastic.Maika Monroe (pretty but thankfully not boringly pretty like the protagonists in most horror movies) sleeps with her new boyfriend for the first time, and is in for a rude awakening. He knocks her out and ties her to a wheelchair. When she wakes up, he explains that some mysterious, murderous entity, in the guise of a random person, will follow her until it is able to kill her. She is advised to find someone quick and pass on the curse, although, if the next person is killed, it will come after her again. Monroe, her sister and their friends attempt to run away from the thing, but escape proves impossible.There is definitely some cleverness in the filmmaking. I love the way Mitchell makes you scan every frame of the film to search for the next follower. The film is never that scary, but it does raise some nice tension. There are some big flaws, though. The monster, when it appears, is usually pale with sunken, dark eyes, and it thus resembles a lot of modern horror ghosts and zombies (similar monsters appeared in three or four previews before the movie). The monster even hisses at one point. Lame. The film's biggest mistake is the climax, where the characters suddenly become total morons. My enthusiasm for the film fell a lot during the sequence. The characters in general are pretty bland, though they're perhaps a tiny bit better than your average horror film (I did quite like Monroe's performance). I loved the John Carpenter-esque score.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Good idea awful movie.,"I'm a big fan of the horror movies genre and went to see the movie as a great and scary movie. I was greatly disappointed! The movie is very dull, no background of what's happening there or of the people involved in the story. Actors, well, I can't call them actors, did a poor job a child can act better than them. Music in the background is nice gets you in the mood, but nothing happens so it lives with a bitter aftertaste. The idea of the movie is really good, and could be turned into a great movie, but the director or the writer missed it. If I'm not mistaken the movie is Australian, they can make great horror movies like the Babadook, which is really giving you the creeps.

"Interesting story-idea, but cold and boring film direction.","The following analytical review is just a personal statement of a horror-movies fan. I do not mean to insult or underestimate any of the film cast or workers by any word.When compared to other hot horror movies in 2014-2015 such as Annabelle, The Lazarus Effect, and Insidious 3, I believe that this movie falls behind. We've seen many great cold horror movies in the past (e.x. Orphan, Let the Right One In), but this one is far away from joining them. The simplicity of the story-idea has forbidden the storyline from expanding and involving more creativity. Directors often tend to use the surprise element to make the audience jump from their seats and leave the movies theater very happy (and scared eventually), but Mitchell here wanted to evolve a more complicated cinematic experience in his work which is to be counted, but not praised.I would not watch a ""It Follows 2"" if they decided to do so, but it would be interesting to have another director and script creator to work on this lovely idea.

7.5/10,"After waiting for months and months to watch this horror movie, I finally managed to sit down and see what all the hype was about. I must admit: this film really deserves hype and praise, but it doesn't quite to the extents it has been. It is certainly refreshing and pleasant to get a break from the ""boo!"" standard of horror movies today, but it isn't as thrilling or amazing as something like ""The Babadook"".Starting on a positive note Mitchell deserves amazing credit for the atmosphere he creates. Right from the first shot, which is a kind of statement, the style never wavers and maintains a visual coherence that is ultra rare to find in movies at any point in time. The cinematography is really gorgeous, throughout the film I was locked in just looking at these shots and thinking to myself: ""wow that shot was fu**ing great"". The lighting is impeccable and really helps painting frames that are immaculate. The music by Disasterpiece is a major component of the success movie, it's right up there as one of the best scores of the year. These ingredients combined are always serving story and tension and definitely elevate to the film a notch. It just nails the 70s feel, taking a major page from Carpenter's masterpiece ""Halloween"", making the most out of it and giving it a great update.Ever since last years' ""The Guest"" I have been looking out for Maika Monroe and ""It Follows"" proves everything I said about her a year ago. She embodies her character perfectly and gives a grounded performance that deeply helps give the audience attachment to the character and elevate the credibility of the concept. Regarding the concept, I have to say it is a really smart one that lends itself perfectly to true horror and Mitchell definitely knows how to use it correctly combining it to some brilliant disturbing imagery and not relying on jump scare crap where it could have easily gone. This choice is what ultimately delivers the types of scares and tension I wanted from the film.Unfortunately there isn't enough of that and whilst the screenplay perfectly knows how to setup and get us involved with the characters, it does not know how to fit them coherently in the story which is kind of the core problem of the film. It just never pays off. The tension is always limbering and there are great moments, but time and time again I didn't feel satisfied with what I got when the scene ended. I wanted more. Especially the ending, which is kind of telling of the whole movie, there wasn't enough context there for me to feel the adrenaline rush. I get it that you want to make the movie open ended and surprise me with a non predictable plot, which it definitely has. But there has to be something for me to go ""fu*k yeah"", other than the characters surviving, there has to be that relief or that shock at the end. For example in Halloween (spoilers), Micheal Myers escapes and you don't know where he goes, it really ends on an open note, but you still get that rush of adrenaline and satisfaction because you know Jaime Lee Curtis is kind of out of it.I do still recommend this film for anyone that wants to have a thrill ride and some good and smart horror, you won't feel in anyway your time was wasted, but you will be lest with a sour taste.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Horror is going back to its roots!,"Until this week It Follows was a film I hadn't even heard of, then I saw the overwhelming attention it had received and I actually felt like this would be a horror film that my stick with me, turns out I was right, this is the best horror experience since The Babadook and it truly terrified me, in fact as I am writing this review I am getting shivers because it is a film that relies on psychological horror rather than jump scares (it had one or two but they were well executed at least), and the more I think about it, the more I like it.The film follows Jay, who is a girl who has everything going for her, until a sexual encounter changes everything. A curse was passed to her like a sexually transmitted disease and the only way she can get rid of this curse is by sleeping with somebody else. As the film progresses Jay is plagued by zombie-like imagery of people she knows and loves that only she is able to see and it makes for some skin-crawlingly scary scenes. The way the plot sounds doesn't make the film sound like it is anything special and i have to admit the plot synopsis on IMDb didn't make me want to rush out and see the film, but I am very glad I did.Horror films recently have been tripe, back in the 70s and 80s we had classic horror such as The Evil Dead and A Nightmare on Elm Street among others, these films were heavily reliant on psycholgical and creepy imagery that really did work. More recently we have had a slew of films that have just been jump scares thrown into a sequence of events and called a film.. Prime examples of recent films are Annabelle and The Woman In Black Angel of Death.. neither of these films worked as horror and I found myself more bored than creeped out. Then I saw an awesome film called The Babadook which really made me feel like good horror still exists, I don't want to compare this film to The Babadook too much but I found them to be similar in the way that they both scared the living daylights out of me and had me thinking about them long after seeing them. I cannot remember the last time I felt that way about horror, but with these examples I believe with some more work horror cinema will get back to the way it once was.In the end It Follows is a well acted (especially the main actress who was believable and a pleasure to watch) and downright creepy film that I would definitely recommend to anybody who is a horror fan. The cinematography really shone and the soundtrack was terrifyingly awesome, the score is still in my head and i guarantee after seeing this you will walk out of the cinema and will be really conscious of the people around you. Never will I look at an old lady behind me again without thinking she is going to follow and murder me for her own amusement. It also has what most horrors don't nowadays which is an INCREDIBLY intense climax. I was on the edge of my seat gripping my girlfriend's hand tight in suspense until the very end.One of the gripes I do have is that the ending did kind of suck and was so abrupt that I don't know exactly how I feel about it, although I can see why it was done in this way. Now if you will excuse me there is a creepy lady walking towards me and I have to run, looks like this will be a sleepless night.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Interesting concept,"So here I am, with what i am calling another retro recall. Although I may be a decade early for that title, but still a decade after its release. We'll call it a parle.From the get go I love everything 80's about this film. The slow moving scenes, the score, the dimly lit perspectives and all complete with the obligatory in-the-car; changeover; montage.They don't do too much and really allow you to absorb the time and setting. I love this depiction with a less-is-more stylization. It just reaks of nostalgia from horror movies of old (can't believe i'm calling them ""old"", where does the time go)The cast does a great job. The dialogue is well written even if the plot/storyline leaves you wanting. There are several frustrations of questions left unanswered.Some of this is the beauty of the film, the nostalgia of it all, the rest are my own bothers as I am continually asking myself throughout the film about the 'how's' and what not.Its best not to ask questions and just go along for the ride. Often times that is my process but in this case I genuinely wanted to know. Without saying too much or giving anything away, there are some obvious chronological questions that i *think* are self-explained by the films end.I know this will get a lot of unnecessary criticism and people citing an obvious reference to another movie that came out about 10 years prior to this, but to those people I say: pfffffffft, whatever man. Not interested.I loved the feel of this film from start to finish. Truly a great homage to 80's horror, but done with a twist. A very untypical approach.As with anything in media, its hard to do something new. Original ideas are harder to display when so much has already come before.I genuinely enjoyed this film. The cast does a great job. Very low key, nothing too over-the-top, just well crafted and well delivered.Entertainment Value 7.5/10
Overall Rating 7/10I'm giving this film a soft but very deserved 7 out of 10. I feel like just enough was done to make a complete film, but it was very, very, low key the whole way through.That's not a criticism, but a justification for my rating. It did just enough to earn a 7. I can see where people would think its a really cool flick, and the premise was indeed interesting, however I feel it hit a plateau early, it didn't really peak, but it was consistent all the way through.I enjoyed it, maybe you will too.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Follow through this one!,"""It Follows""! Yes, it does! My grandiose corny puns in my movie reviews, and this one is no different! OK, OK. Please don't leave and I beg you to continue to follow me in my review of the horror independent flick ""It Follows"". Writer-Director David Robert Mitchell has formulated a very inventive horror movie about an unknown supernatural force that follows some of those who have sexual encounters. Our protagonist here is the blonde beauty Jay Height. Jay reaches her own new heights when she starts dating the all-American sporto Hugh. But Hugh will not guess what happens with that encounter, because then if I spill the beans, it will be a Hugh disappointment, and spoilers will follow. Sorry, but I can't resist. Hugh ends up giving Jay the supernatural force that causes weary characters to slowly follow; hence ""It Follows"". It might sound like ""It Follows"" is not it, but it is actually a very engaging movie, that does not mimic most of the formulaic hum-drum horror movies of these days. And it does have its scary moments, including a breakthrough beginning. So I think we should start following the career of David Robert Mitchell because he was it in crafting this feature. I also liked the leading performance of Maika Monroe as Jay. The rest of the cast was moderate but nothing to follow through profusely. OK, that is pretty much it. Now follow ""It Follows"". **** Good",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Without question one of the worst movies ever,Apparently all the other people that saw and reviewed this movie were taking some very good medications at the time. This movie is horrible. Awful. Boring to no end. The characters are flat and have no personality or individuality. It would've been a better movie if they had all been killed. I felt nothing for them. The script is terrible. The premise is utterly ridiculous. There was nothing remotely entertaining to keep you hooked or to keep you watching. The only reason I made it to the end was because my husband wanted to finish it since we ordered it on PPV. I've seen far more than my fair share of movies before but this one is definitely in my top 5 worst movies list. Maybe even top 3. Why anyone likes it is completely beyond me. Don't waste your time. I've never reviewed a movie on here before but this movie was so awful I had to.,1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
a very well made horror film,"The thing i like about this movie is that theres a lot of little details going on in the background that rewards people who pay attention, the movie was genuinely scary and one thing i really liked about the movie was the cinematography, theres a lot of unique shots in the film that really utilize the medium of visual media to its full potential, although sometimes it wasnt done in a very good way like this one scene where the camera spun around for like a full minute, it was an interesting trick that the director used to portray stuff to the audience but it was kinda neausiating. the acting was pretty great although most of the characters didnt have any real personality, i honestly dont remember any of their names because they were so forgettable. one thing i didnt like about the movie was they were kinda inconsistent as to the rules of what the ""it"" has, like in the beach scene where it seems to have the ability to run faster than it normally does in between shots (because theres NO way it travelled that fast in its regular speed offscreen) or how there was this one shot where it was standing stationary on top of the main characters house even though in every other scene of the film the only time where it was able to stand still was if there was something in its way. there was also this other scene where it started throwing objects at the main character instead of its usual tactic of just persuing her at a slow pace, if it can utilize physical objects then why dosent it get a rope and try to lasso its targets or something? also in almost every scene the monster took the form of a naked person, i dont think theres a particular reason why it did that but hey, gotta get that sweet R rating somehow am i right?
anyway this movie was still pretty enjoyable (even if it may not seem that way with how much i ranted on about the problems surrounding the monster) and i really think you should check it out, it honestly seems like an underappreciated film to me",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

That was some serious GARBAGE..!!!!,"Really??? OMG that was one of the most irritating, disgusting and probably the most overrated horror film of all time. Im a crazy movie buff. I even watch movies which are rated below 4 sometimes. Its not that i like belove par movies but its because sometimes the IMDb rating's completely misleads u. Some movies which are rated for example 3.5 or 4 may be.. are complete gems. Indie masterpieces. And vice versa. Well thats my point. The rating of IT FOLLOWS should not be more than 4 (and i am being very generous here). This movie completely sucks. STD... OHHH god seriously? Naked men and women with huge titties and completely outgrown pubic hair following you for no purpose. 30 minutes into the movie i was rooting for the ghosts or so called ""IT""s.

It Follows -- pretty well for a while,"A young woman finds herself being followed by a slow moving but unstopping supernatural entity after having sex with a young man she hardly knows. After making her a target through sexual intercourse, the young man explains the rules: The entity will follow you, and eventually kill you when it reaches you, if you don't pass it on by having sex with someone else. It is a creepy premise that starts off very well. The cinematography and music are moody and atmospheric. Sadly, after such a good start, the movie falls apart in the second half. It's as if the filmmakers didn't know how to end the film. Still, it was well worth watching. I look forward to seeing another film from the director.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Very Brief Opinion,"1. You could certainly do a lot worse for 12 bucks.2. If you can't appreciate the hipster feel satire, you will hate this movie as it insists entirely upon it.3. The soundtrack tries hard. And is just modern enough to get the point of generational transition across.4. This movie is not scary at all. It's not.5. It's a cool joke about the trite use of sex as a deterrent to whatever...6. Slow monster. STDs are becoming less scary and this expresses that perfectly. I have seen several Christian critics say it has a ""good message"" and that's why the movie is great. These people got duped. The film prays on hipsters and is written by cannabalistic hipsters. There is no deep meaning.7. Camera work is fantastic and generous........8. Calling the dude ""Paul"" is a nice nod to the boyfriend in Halloween. (1978, not that disgrace by Rob Zombie) The ambiguity of when this happens is great.Obviously different people see different things. The characters are in the late 70's for sure. But their environment is on a 50 year timeline loop. Modern cars, a Kindle, old cars, black and white box t.v. (another nod to Carpenter).9. Just beware of the niche""iness"" of it's intended unintended intentional unintentional tendencies to tend to be a low budget horror movie unworthy of praise.And remember...

Refreshing,"From the very beginning It Follows is cool, unique and fresh. The soundtrack is reminiscent of Stranger Things and with the help of some fantastic camerawork we can really allow ourselves to feel as trapped as our protagonist. Overall a really enjoyable experience, that doesn't take itself too seriously, but unfortunately not one that will have you hiding under your bed covers. The whole movie moved at a fast pace and although it would have been nice to learn some more about the characters, a long scene purely devoted to character development could have potentially destroyed the unending tension that had been built up. It's nice to see some good filmmaking brought into this degenerating genre: it feels like it was made for a purpose; not a profit.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Can you? I mean, it certainly wouldn't be just a certain select few who had ""it"" - No - The bedevilled ones would be absolutely pandemic. It's true.Anyway - Not only was the acting in ""It Follows"" hideously bad, the dialogue utterly crummy, and the characters totally boring (where everyone was staged like a prop) - But there were so many inexplicable ""dead-air"" moments in the story, that I swear everyone involved in this mind-numbing production was a certified idiot and nothing else.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"""It"" is an objet petit a: both object-cause and illusory fulfillment of desire","""It"" has so far been understood properly in review by Andrew Kingsley of The Darthmouth, where he stated that the film captures the abject, but let's not stop at Freud. As someone who has experienced a crippling, unfulfilling desire for another person, as a desiring subject myself, I could completely relate to the agonies of our protagonist.As seen in one of the first scenes of the movie, she seems to have fulfilled her childhood dreams of driving away and having fun with a guy she likes. But, when he leaves her, she's left in a state of utter agony. Spoken in Lacanian psychoanalytic terminology, the ""objet petit a"" that served the purpose of an illusory object that filled the hole in the chain of signification for her was driven away from her and she was left ""with her hands tied"", to make it obvious that this object is illusory, thus the ""objet petit a"" remains only the hole in the signifying chain, waiting to be filled by another ""objet petit a"", or in English, whatever object momentarily comes to serve the purpose; or anyone else she might experience the same crippling desire for. This desire is never to be fulfilled, but only reproduced, as it is the essence of this hole in the chain of signification.She being tied implies rape for many, but IMHO it symbolizes the suffocating and immobilizing feeling of inability to ever fulfill our desire for the other. The fact that Paul is the only one able to see our protagonists' ""objet petit a"", her object-cause of desire, is possibly because he understands very well his desire for her, as they knew each other from the young age. The film ending with the two of them holding hands is in this context a positive outcome for both of them, even though the scene seems grim. They might have realized that the crippling desire for the illusory ""objet petit a"" will follow them for the rest of their lives and the possible way to put an end to this agony is by coming to terms with this fact, settling down and accepting yourself and your partner as two lacking subjects. In that case, another illusory ""objet petit a"" appears, serving the purpose of ""covering over"" the hole in the signifying chain produced by insatiability of their desire. This object, at the end, might be: mutual understanding, friendship, love, or whatever signifier one would use to give a name to this illusory object.To conclude, this is not the best horror I've seen, but I was lured towards it by rather smart plot that apparently did very well for me, according to a fact that I identified so strongly with the protagonist, even though the symbolical depictions of desire that goes after her were, well... Perhaps too graphical. But it was necessary for them to be able to murder their desiring subjects, as possibly a message from the director that we should look after ourselves in our pursuit to fulfill the desires, as this might take us down the roads of exaggeration in sex and drugs or whatever comes, only then possibly leading to rape, STDs' and unfortunate deaths. This is real-life horrific truth about how we function amidst the dialectic of desire, where actually only death is certain, as emphasisingly quoted at the end of the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Very Creepy and Much Better Than I Was Expecting!!!,"For the longest time, I've heard nothing but negative comments about this movie from friends and online reviews, so I was never really too interested in watching it, but I finally decided to give it a try tonight and I really quite enjoyed it! It was simple, but very creepy. Horror movies don't have to be overly gory for it be good. Just the thought of some entity slowly following you non-stop until it kills you is very scary to me. I'm so glad I finally watched it.A young teen girl named Jay is dating a guy named Hugh. She thinks they're hitting it off, until he acts weird at the theater and wants to go someplace else. After a consensual sexual encounter, he knocks her out and ties her up and tells her to prepare for what is coming. An entity that only they can see will start pursuing her until she's dead, or until she hooks up with someone else. The entity can look like anyone and can change its appearance at anytime.The next day at school, Jay begins to see an old lady in a gown outside the classroom slowly walking toward her, getting closer. She runs out and seeks help from her sister, Kelly and their friends, Paul, Greg, and Yara. They keep her company at night and drive her away, anytime the entity comes close to her. None of her friends can see it, but she can. They must come up with a plan to stop the entity from killing Jay, or pass it to somebody else. I thought this movie was very original and creative.

Gratuitous or a metaphor for SA?,"The opening scene includes a scantily clad young woman running in *red high heels.* Who chooses to run in heels!?? I have to think that this is a deliberate choice to either make her look desirable or vulnerable and I'm not sure which...Repeatedly through the movie ""It"" appears as a woman, usually naked or only partially clothed and at least once early as an obvious victim of SA. It's this specific appearance that makes me believe that there might be a deeper meaning behind ""It"" that includes something other than just the obvious curse of an STD.In general, people pass the curse of ""It"" without the consent of the new victim, without telling them first what consequences sex is going to have. Nobody can see evidence of SA assault unless they are looking for it and are ready to believe and the same is true of ""It."" To be a victim of SA *or* IT means you are likely to not be believed. ...But if that's really what ""It"" is supposed to represent then it seems like someone taking on the curse voluntarily would be the way to destroy ""It.""The ending is a bit ambiguous which I actually kinda like, but this is also one of those rare cases where I wish the underlying metaphor (if there is one) was a little clearer.

This is Horror that Doesn't Scream in Your Face But Makes You Scream in Your Head For Days,"Any horror fans out there? This one comes highly recommended. It borrows heavily from the masters of the genre but yet it manages to do it intelligently. Made for only 2mil but it looks like it was made for 5 times that amount. Good horror is like a needle in a haystack. This is good horror.The premise sounds dumb - a terrible curse is transmitted through sex. The supernatural entity will then come for the unfortunate person in any human-like form to kill him/her. You can't stop the curse, you can only propagate the curse by having sex with another person, but if this new person dies the supernatural force will then come for you and work up the food chain. Dumb right? But the execution is pure masterclass.If you didn't already catch the allegory, let me tell you that the writer-director is ""metaphorizing"" STD. This one is going to make you think twice about having casual sex. The subtext doesn't become full-on distracting winks at you but does enough to get under your skin.The characters are not over-written and easily relatable. The atmosphere is nail-biting and the unnamed dread is killer. The tension builds and builds to a point that it becomes a visceral force. The music soundtrack hearkens back to the electronic scores of John Carpenter and it really creeps me out. This is lo-fi horror but it is buoyed by the Mother of hi-fi power, with just a teaspoon of blood. It is horror that doesn't scream in your face but makes you scream inside your head for days.PS - I saw this on blu-ray in the comfort of my home. Nothing beats watching horror movies at home.

Also, the soundtrack is memorable, namely the theme, which in my opinion right up there with the Halloween theme and the Nightmare On Elm St. theme, I get chills every time I hear it.Maybe there are a few people who genuinely don't like this movie, but I'm willing to bet that most of them aren't actually that into horror movies or prefer the modern horror dribble over the classics.

This film is about losing innocence and realizing that the world isn't fair.There are some jump scares and graphic intensity, but the real heart of the film is in the dialogue and feelings of the characters.

"Fresh, original concept for a horror movie","It Follows is an original concept compiled into what can only be explained as an artistic horror film. It was released in 2014 but has gained some traction over the past few years and landed on many ""must watch horror"" lists. The concept is that ""it"" will follow whoever the carrier is, which is passed on through sex to a new carrier. Not the kind of STD that your doctor is going to write you a script of penicillin to clear up. So, buckle up and let's do a spoiler free review of It Follows.The Good: The first thing you're probably going to ask yourself while watching this movie is what time frame this is set in. The style of clothing could match the modern-day hipster or young adults that are fashion savvy. The settings and most of the technology or lack thereof (other than some weird shell e-reader thing) could also lean towards being late 70s/early 80s. It makes for an interesting approach to the overall atmosphere and according to the director David Robert Mitchell, it's intentionally filmed this way to create a dream effect (AV Club). It's a very cool spin to what is already an interesting concept for a movie.The build of suspension in this movie is phenomenal. The score is constantly building tension, as Jay (Maika Monroe) is eluding her stalking demon. The beauty of it is that half the time you never actually see the monster and when you do, it often looks very ordinary. Yet the director still manages to build a sense of dread without going in the direction of making it hokey. Like horror of old, the director created a slow, steady and unrelenting monster which will constantly keep you on edge. They could have very easily gone with an over-the- top CGI monster but I'm certainly glad they went with a far subtler approach. This movie will make you think twice about anyone slowly walking in your direction.This film is also paced very well. It Follows wastes no time in introducing you for what's to come and manages to stay consistent for the entire film. The director manages to make an almost two hour film feel like an hour. Jay and her friends are quick to start coming up with some ideas on how to evade the creature and buy some time to really assess the situation. I love when characters in horror movies play it smart by developing and executing plans that don't suck. Whether they're all successful or not is a totally different story.The Bad: Now that I went on my whole rant about great plans and execution, I have to add a caveat and say that they also had some really dumb ideas and lack of trying other approaches. I understand horror and most stories in general, at their core rely on characters failing to execute plans. I would for once like to see a horror movie try all rational approaches that a real person would try just so that the audience would feel like there truly are no other options. Throughout the film I was coming up with all sorts of different ways that I'd deal with this and I was a bit disappointed that the scope of their creativity was so limited.Some of the characters seemed either totally unnecessary or became annoying in their persistence that the monster wasn't real. Personally, if I saw a door get blown in half, I'd probably start believing the girl that's freaking out about an invisible creature stalking her. Yara (played by Olivia Luccardi) is by far the most unnecessary character as she basically has no lines other than ""What's wrong?!"" whenever the creature approaches and Jay starts freaking out. Dude, you know what's wrong, stop asking.The Judgment: The flaws of this movie are minor and easily overlooked because of the great concept and storytelling of the film. I believe that this was a solid mark on the new age of horror films and showed that it's not dead yet. David Robert Mitchell managed to bring back the spirit of old horror and give it a fresh spin. I'll definitely be looking out for a sequel to this movie that may hopefully visit the origins of the demon or conclude the story in a more permanent way. I strongly recommend this film if you're looking for a solid, original horror.Check out this review and more at TheCynicist.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"A scary, clever ignition of the horror genre","After the a long series of horror films that failed to leave a lasting impression on the horror genre, it comes almost explicitly clear that the horror genre is running scarce of ideas. Thus, the genre is found lost in the sea of old, tiresome clichés that have long overstayed their welcome. This is until director David Robert Mitchell steps in the game to deliver this psychological horror-thriller sparked with one of the most original ideas of the genre brought in recent memory. Devoid of nearly every overused trope including terrorizing paranormal entities, masked killers wielding a bladed weapon, and flesh-eating zombies, this movie formulates an all-new original concept that some can interpret as an allegory of the AIDS epidemic that went viral in the 1980s, a deadly virus transmitted to teenagers through engagement of sexual activity and renders them into a dangerous life-threatening situation. With little works under his belt other than the 2011 coming-of-age drama 'The Myth of The American Sleepover', David Robert Mitchell takes the director's chair in this horror flick starring Maika Monroe as Jay, a young college girl who goes out on a date with her boyfriend Hugh (played by Jake Weary) which leads to intimate sexual encounter. Soon, when Jay becomes experiencing some terrifying hallucinations, she learns her life in mortal danger. Her escape from the dreadful virus is to pass over the virus to another individual via sexual intercourse.David Robert Mitchell succeeds in energizes this film with not only generating all-new concept but also executing it in an effective manner. This task involves taking the typical ""only virgins survive"" trope common in the slasher genre (Halloween, Scream for example) and expanding upon it. Rather pounding the audience with constant sight scares and jump scenes, the film conveys it's scare factor by building up it's dark, eerie atmosphere through slick character development and the revolving fear of the characters battling against the horrors of this sexually transmitted virus. Though the plot's slow pace can be frustrating for the impatient viewers, Mitchell succeeds on making the concept work. But the scares are the only the film's high caliber. The movie was filmed on location in an old tranquil neighborhood in Detroit and uses vintage synthesized music score common by Disaster Peace that pay effective homages to the horror classics from the 70s and 80s. As a result, viewers are presented with what feels like a retro horror flick. The music score succeeds on only obtaining a retro feel for the film but also constructing it's true eerie atmosphere. Aside from all this, the cast shows off some great performances, particularly Maika Monroe as the steamy scream queen serving the center role in the story. Are the performances very memorable? Not really, but certainly work.It Follows is a fresh, stunning addition to the horror genre that introduces a fresh new idea to the category with fresh performances, spectacular direction by David Robert Mitchell, and an overall solid execution of a newborn concept. The chances of this becoming a horror classic are hard to say at this point but it is definitely a must-watch for all horror fans looking for something new.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Falls short of the high expectations set by its critical acclaim,"The exceptional cinematography contributes to its distinctive atmosphere and is unquestionably the finest element of the ""It Follows"".

Boring and not scary,"I had high hopes for this movie. From the trailer to the reviews I was convinced this was going to deliver the spooks. I was so wrong. It was slow moving and not scary at all. A few brief mild frights came from the the sudden appearances of the the ""unknown supernatural force"" but that's as good as it gets. The unknown actors played their parts pretty well, but their monotone voices and lack of expression during most of the film was underwhelming. One of the only things I enjoyed in this movie was the use of old style horror sounds in scenes that should have been scary.

Great Setup,"It Follows has a intriguing setup involving an STD-like curse that follows you forever until it finally catches you and kills you.

"A Unique, Original, and Creepy Film","While far from perfect, I consider this movie to be one of my favorite horror movies in recent years. Some of the actors could be a little better, but I really like the group of friends in this film and find most of them to be convincing for the most part. The slower scenes in which they are reminiscing about their childhood or just being there for one another are some of my favorite scenes. I think it's best to watch this movie without knowing what this thing is, so I won't go into details. I'll just say that I find this concept to be terrifying. When it comes to the technical aspects of this film, I love the way this film looks. Whether it's day or night time, I love the look. And lastly, the music in this movie is amazing and terrifying. If you love music from 80's horror films, you'll probably love this soundtrack as well. I really only have one issue with the movie and it's one that others have mentioned. The rules regarding this thing the characters are running from are inconsistent. For better or for worse, the rules aren't consistent or explained outside of an early exposition scene. I don't find the final confrontation scene to be bad, but I wouldn't say it's great either. While I'm not completely satisfied with that scene, I do really like the ending to this movie. I do think this film is the most enjoyable on your first viewing when you don't know what's going on.

Fear That Walks,"It Follows, directed by David Robert Mitchell, is a chilling and atmospheric horror film that builds tension with a simple yet unsettling premise. The story follows Jay (Maika Monroe), a teenage girl who becomes the target of a supernatural entity after a sexual encounter. The entity relentlessly follows its victims at a slow, deliberate pace, taking on the appearance of different people until it captures them. With its minimalist storytelling, eerie soundtrack, and innovative concept, It Follows offers a fresh take on supernatural horror, though it occasionally falters in its execution.Maika Monroe delivers a compelling performance as Jay, capturing the character's growing paranoia and fear as she tries to outrun the unstoppable entity. Her vulnerability and determination bring depth to the role, making Jay's journey both emotionally engaging and suspenseful. The supporting cast, including Keir Gilchrist and Olivia Luccardi, adds dimension to Jay's friendships, grounding the supernatural events in relatable relationships.Mitchell's direction creates an atmosphere of dread with his use of wide shots, lingering camera work, and a hauntingly effective score by Rich Vreeland (disasterpeace). The film's pacing, which is intentionally slow and measured, contributes to the sense of inevitability as the entity follows its victims. The cinematography uses the suburban setting to its advantage, making everyday locations feel sinister and oppressive, heightening the sense of dread.While the film's concept is creative and compelling, It Follows doesn't fully explore the mythology behind the entity, leaving some viewers with unanswered questions. Additionally, the film's pacing can feel uneven at times, as certain sequences of suspense drag on longer than necessary. The ambiguity of the creature's rules adds to the mystery but also detracts from the story's focus, making it feel somewhat disjointed.In conclusion, It Follows is a clever, atmospheric horror film with a unique premise and strong performances, but its slow pacing and lack of deeper explanation may leave some viewers wanting more. While it stands as a solid entry in modern horror, offering a refreshing concept, it falls short of creating the sustained tension that would elevate it to a truly unforgettable experience.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Better than expected,"It Follows is one of my go-to horror movies that I never get tired of. It's not very scary but is creepy and suspenseful. From the very first scene you know there is something to be afraid of and I love how it kicks off the dread for the rest of the movie.While ""It"" is passed along via sex, the movie never feels raunchy or gratuitous. Maika Monroe acts legitimately terrified which is probably what prevents this movie from ever seeming stupid. That's not to say there aren't a few disappointments. The last 20 or 30 minutes are a bit lackluster but I still enjoy the film as a whole.The direction, cinematography, and score of It Follows are superb; the 360 shots are used brilliantly to make you feel like danger can come from anywhere, and the music fits each scene so well. There's a very surreal undertone, like how in dreams things don't always fit together or make sense. It's a great way of subconsciously throwing you off. I'm a fan of subtle scares, creepy things you may not always notice on the first watch. In the opening scene you hear a screen door screech as a girl runs out, then off screen you hear it two more times, but see only one other person has exited from it. It's the subtle things like that that I personally love in horror movies. If you prefer jump scares or supernatural-looking monsters, this may not be for you. I recommend giving it a chance though.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"We're following the leader, the leader, the leader ♪","I actually enjoyed it. It was pretty tense when it wanted to be and the atmosphere was pretty suspenseful. Very little jump scares unlike most horror films these days and more among the lines of the terror that could happen. Had a bit of a late 70s/early 80s tone to it as I was somehow reminded of Halloween. I can't help but also wonder if Twilight Zone was an inspiration. There was just something about it felt like it could be among those many scenarios. Scary, subtle, fun, though leaves you questioning some of the film's standards of how this particular monster works specifically beyond the explained rules. How does it kill? Thrusting your leg aggressively? At some points it makes no sense, or at least to most horror movie standards but this only makes it interesting to question more (should there be a sequel) should you be one like me that overthinks such topics. And seriously? Kids, what is the deal with your logic? I know you're teens, but geez. Some of the choices, guys... not sure which is dimmer: your choices or the gloomy camera lenses. ....Clearly I was somewhat invested in these characters haha. The music was interesting to listen to-- old electronic synths mixed with a bit of spooky ambiance. Occasionally there are sounds reminiscent of a Super Mario game and bled a sense of John Carpenter somewhere in our midst.

"Outstandingly smart, with terrific atmosphere, taking common ideas in a different direction","Even for the positive buzz this generated upon release it's fair to wonder what lasting value it will have to offer. The notion of a curse that can pass from one person to the next is not new; the 'Ring' films,' Japanese or American, certainly come to mind, and there are plentiful other examples. The premise alone furthermore portends a tale that leans heavily on the major trope of latter-day horror, popularized by slashers, that in some ironic expression of puritanical morality punishes characters for being sexually active. The combination of these facets is effectively a ghostly horror treatment of sexually-transmitted infections. Ultimately, however, I'm pleased to say that its strength speaks for itself, and it proves its worth far beyond the common root ideas. 'It follows' may not fully demand viewership for one and all, but I'm taken with just how excellent it really turned out to be, and I think it deserves even more recognition than it's gotten in the past several years.Filmmaker David Robert Mitchell, writing and directing, sagely employs a few different elements in very precise, limited measurements to keep the storytelling fresh without wholly getting bogged down in one part or another. We're greeted to the vision of one gnarly death at the outset, but otherwise the picture relies predominantly on the unceasing tension and anxiety of the unyielding entity, always moving forward. Just as much to the point, the unnatural movement, presence, and appearance of the entity provide a consistent, irregular spike of chills and thrills that's genuinely unnerving; that we come to see the entity do more than just walk at a deliberate pace cements the stark vexation, and I can't even be upset at the use of CGI in these instances because the obvious contrivance in this case only adds to the dark vibrancy. To this add other aspects of the narrative, lightly touched upon, that elsewhere might get heavier focus: efforts by the characters to investigate the matter, or attempt self-defense, and so on. Always is the spotlight on that dread atmosphere, however, realized in no small part through the strong acting of the cast (primarily but not exclusively star Maika Monroe), and bolstered significantly by the original score of Disasterpeace. Some of the themes in early exposition are overbearing in their levity, yet by and large the varied electronic music is geared toward carefully calculated chords - ranging from the clean to the harsh - to accentuate the grim disquiet, and at their best even the dire gravity of the characters' plight. I'm quite reminded of the compositions of John Carpenter, and if that's not a high compliment then I don't know what is.Well and truly, every component is shrewdly woven in with just the right proportions to make them striking, meaningful, and impactful without overstaying their welcome. That includes the even more insidious notion of doom being deferred, and kicked down the proverbial road, by willfully spreading it and drawing other people into the curse through risky behavior. 'It follows' also declines the tack adopted in some flicks to include the rules, laws, responsibilities, and reactions from secondary or tertiary characters that our chief figures surely, realistically, would butt up against in endeavoring to resolve their quandary (e.g., the possibility of Jay being considered mentally unwell and committed to a psychiatric unit against her will). We don't even necessarily see all that much of the entity, strictly speaking, and the title is more about the constant terror it inspires. Meanwhile, in every other regard the feature is superbly well made, meeting the high standards of most modern cinema. The sound design is impeccable, and alongside Mitchell's outstandingly smart direction, Mike Gioulakis' sharp cinematography, and Julio C. Perez IV's keen editing, is bent always toward maximizing the cold, gnawing vitality that the saga has to offer. The stunts, special makeup, and effects (practical and digital) are stunning and invigorating; everything from art direction and lighting to costume design, filming locations, and hair and makeup are fantastic. Not to be counted out, Mitchell's screenplay really is a minor marvel, giving us believable and sympathetic characters, highly varied but potent scene writing, and a narrative that through to the end strives above all for pervasive, inescapable, unsettled ambience. Why, it's not just the music; Carpenter as a filmmaker is (was) a master of atmospheric horror, and if 'It follows' is any indication, Mitchell has learned from that master.I'm so pleasantly surprised. I repeat that despite positive word of mouth I never gave much thought to this movie in all the time since it was released; between the premise and a degree of mistrust of modern horror, I just wasn't keen on the idea. I've been well overdue to give it a try, however, and I am altogether delighted by just how powerful the feelings are that the final product evokes, and the dreary airs that it fosters and maintains. Frankly I've been remiss to wait so long to check this out, and it's possible that all the praise I'd gathered secondhand actually didn't go far enough. Everyone involved turned in brilliant work, from Monroe, Keir Gilchrist, and their co-stars, to Mitchell as both writer and director, to composer Richard Vreeland and all others operating behind the scenes. This isn't so much a title to offer up huge visceral thrills and violence, but the gloom it imparts is even more impressive and lasting. I could scarcely be happier with just how great 'It follows' is, and I think that anyone who appreciates the slightly more understated and underhanded side of horror will find much to love here.

STDS = Sexually Transmitted Demonic Stalker,"I have seen a lot of Horror movies, and while my short list includes films like John Carpenter's The Thing or Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, some of my favorites are the B-Movie variety of the 70s and 80s. I have sat through some truly strange stuff in my time and have learned to appreciate lots of different Horror movies, which is probably why I enjoyed this one as much as I did.This isn't a particularly good film or a very original one. It involves a malevolent entity with a target that is determined as the most recent individual to be sexually active with someone already infected with its curse. The protagonist goes on a date with this guy, they do what adolescents do on dates, then the clorophorms her so he can restrain her in order to let her know that she is now the prey of this thing. That already had me thinking that it was recycling an idea used in The Ring. Then at times it reminded me of The Terminator because this thing targets Jay with the same unwavering determination that the time-traveling machine pursued Sarah Connor. But it walks really slowly, like your typical zombie.There's a few jump scares in this movie too, which typically just annoy me as they are a cheap attempt at startling the audience.The story is not terribly clever and seems to write itself into a corner by the end. And ain't nobody from this movie winning any acting awards, that's for sure. Nevertheless, there were a few scenes that managed to find a good combination of creepiness with escalating tension that is ultimately the desired effect that I am looking for in a movie like this.All in all, it felt like a good adaptation of your average Stephen King novel, where it starts off with a neat idea that then coasts for a while until it kinda sorta resolves in what feels like a rushed compromise.

While the subject matter and kind of direction holds one's interest, there is no reason whatsoever that the demons that appear seem to be chasing anyone who makes love or have sex. This kind of cheapens the film. Although a ton of reasons appear from fandom sites none are completely satisfactory.Good to notice however the use or appearance of water throughout.The scenario at the end was quiet goo and the ending is ambiguous as to the actual state of affairs.

Could have been more effective,"This is a good horror movie, but it is being over-hyped. It is often creepy and sometimes downright scary (and I have no problem with the lack of explanation for ""It), but the director has intentionally refrained from making it a relentless exercise in terror by giving occasional breaks to the tension as if to relieve the spectator. In other words, it doesn't really deliver the promise of the terrifying opening sequence. In my book, it is not as great as Babadook for example, but of course much better than an average horror movie. I tend to agree with the Village Voice review that this is a horror movie made for people who say they don't like horror movies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Expected a scary horror flick, got creepy thriller instead","It follows is definitely disturbing and chilling movie, but sorry to say that it doesn't seem scary. So, I guess most of us expecting usual jump scares would be disappointed. Also, it isn't as good as the critics say, it has the flaws too. So, calling it the best modern horror movie or even the best horror film of the decade (Ah yes, a critic thinks so..xD) would be a shame to this genre. So, why are the critics overwhelmed.Is it coz of it's orignality? No, It's because they think that the demons represent STD and the movie would spread awareness against it( Lmao...but to me,STDs seems to be sexually transmitted demons.xD)So, the movie is about a demon whose curse is transferred from one person to other while sexual intercourse. Due to this, the main protagonist girl is affected as his boyfriend transferred it to her and now it'll follow her. Tbh, the acting in this movie is pretty bad, except for Jay (the main girl). That's why we can't feel them. Nevertheless, the cinematography, screenplay and Background score succeds to build a tense and creepy atmosphere which saves the movie.Now, a theory is very popular which changes the whole perspective of the movie. It says that the children in this movie are picked from different timelines and don't have any parents, as we couldn't see them in the movie. Instead they are raised by different demons in hell. Yeah, they are living in hell.

"A pleasant, slow-moving watch","This is really, as I just mentioned in the title to this review, a very pleasant, slow-moving watch. The lovely cinematography elevates what could otherwise have been another silly teen-horror-type affair into a fairly immersive experience. In fact, I regularly found myself pleasantly puzzled by the effort which had been put into creating such a visually engaging film, when it really wouldn't necessarily be expected of it, given the subject matter. But, naturally, it is this emphasis on slowness and cinematography which really crafts the whole experience.I don't think it delves too far into the realm of spoilers to say that this is a 'nice' horror film. There is nothing emotionally wrenching. There is no torture porn... Nothing to make you particularly miserable. It just plods pleasantly along, not moving you too desperately as it goes... but in a good way. There are also no dumb jump scares. The nature of the villain is brooding, and that is how the film presents itself.Now... While the film does a great job of being absorbing and just sucking you in with its long takes and gently spiralling panoramas, it is not without its cinematic faults. There were two points in the movie where completely unnecessary (and appallingly bad) CGI abruptly took me out of the moment and reminded me that I was actually watching an unbelievable horror film. The use of godawful CGI for these two shots absolutely baffles me. I imagine you'll spot the bits I'm talking about. It looks like freakin' Birdemic and is completely out of character with the rest of the film. Just bizarre. Still... this was only a few seconds out of the movie.The cast seemed to me to do a fine job. No quibbles there.This movie, told as it is, feels very much like an allegory. A metaphor for the hopelessness of being young and directionless in a consuming spiral of tedium and urban decay.It's pretty great.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Good story, poor screenplay","This film is a good thriller, but I think it is a bit overrated, in particular considering critics. Surely it's above the average of the modern thriller and horror films. It has a cool story, creepy atmospheres (the idea of setting it in Detroit suburbs is great!) and a disturbing soundtrack. What really misses is the script: it seems everything happens and happens, repetitive, but in the end nothing really happens. There are some incongruities, too.I don't want to discuss the meaning of the whole film (the director said he had got the idea of the story from a recurring nightmare he used to have), if it's a condemn to certain sexual habits or whatever. Maybe we can find a denounce to parents who ""abandon"" their kids to themselves.As an horror fan, I recognize the effort made to propose a fresh product, with the right direction and atmosphere.But, all in all, something misses, that flair that could have made it more terrific and unforgettable.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

I cannot believe how incredible the entire film was for me on a late night whim My wife and Myself went on one heck of a ride,"I cannot even handle the new world we live in when you see the absolutely terrible lies being told by other Reviews or Critics. I came across this one by accident and I cannot believe how absolutely incredible this film is. I noticed a few stating to not waste your time and I am guessing that they did not and never finished the movie because I have now watched it many times and every person in my family has also seen it. I can say it could also be used as a tool for your kids if you know what I mean lol. I want to explain typical big horror movies have a budget ranging from 50-200 million dollars and this film was created with 1.3 that is one million three hundred thousand dollars. I posted below directly from wiki. So for some viewers to state it is garbage I would just ignore those and maybe they are just trying to hurt the movie because they are the same people who blew a massive budget filming something like VAN HELSING with a 160 million budget and produce utter trash so sending the workers to give these false reviews is not unlikely. I mean this era is very odd they also stated THE GALLOWS was to scary and it was a boring snooze fest but hey they have another one coming so I guess someone must have money to lose LOL. Do not miss this one it will likely go down in history as one of the best indie low budget films ever made and I am hopeful we get more from this creator soon!It Follows received acclaim from critics, who praised its originality and Monroe's performance.It grossed $23.3 million worldwide against a $1.3 million budget.

Putting this title in the same sentence with The Exorcist, Halloween, The Shining, or even completely mediocre modern horror movies like Insidious (yes, Insidious is also highly overrated, but compared to this crap it looks like Citizen Kane) offends me as a human being and makes me question the credibility of IMDb's and Rotten Tomatoes's rating system.

"Forget Smile, watch this!","If you're going to build tension the right way with an innovative take on the 'curse' Horror, then It Follows does it.The film is well shot, brilliantly paced and you feel the struggle of Jay as the main character trying to understand and escape the horror she has had bestowed upon her by a stranger.The movie has a strong core of characters who as friends try and support Jay through her struggles but also are somewhat distanced from it as it is not their reality. She's living it, and the visual imagery and threat are hers and hers alone, so despite this support she's still truly isolated.Until the moment of reckoning.Great film, and what Smile clumsily does this avoids and creates a whole turn of its own without needing gore, jump scares or too many special effects to leave you feeling quite simply disturbed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Except way, way slower.Some people mention tension too. Where?!? It's either walking right at you like a zombie or it's not It.

And during that scene I was trying to figure out why in the world you would go hang at the beach when you're being hunted. What they should have done was wait until It shows. Drive to a certain location. Wait til It shows there. Look at a clock and figure out how long it took. Then you can go back to location one and actually prepare for it without worrying about how much time you have.There were so many little scenes that just didn't make sense too.

A chiller with a sexual twist,"Jay Height is an attractive nineteen year old college student whose life is changed after a casual sexual encounter. Shortly after they have sex the boy chloroforms her. She wakes to find herself tied up and he explains the situation to her. He tells her that a being, who can appears as anybody known or unknown, will start to follow her. This person walks slowly but will won't stop coming for her; if it catches her it will kill her. The only way for her to escape is to pass it on to another person by having sex... however if that person is killed it will start going after her again. Only people being followed or who have been followed cab see it. Jay manages to get her friends to believe her and they try to help her escape but wherever they go it will surely find her.This is a superior chiller. There are surprisingly few shocking moments, most notably the sight of a previous victim in an early scene. Rather than relying on a large body count and gory deaths we get a near constant feeling that something is about to happen. The way the threat is passed from one potential victim to the next; like a game of sexual tag is interesting thanks to the moral dilemmas it raises. The fact that the entity that follows is always referred to as 'It' reinforces the tag similarities even if here the person tagged is followed by It rather than being It. The cast does a fine job; most notably Maika Monroe who is great as Jay. Director David Robert Mitchell does an impressive job keeping the tension high without resorting to jump scares and violent scenes; this is helped by Rich Vreeland's atmospheric score. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to horror fans looking for something different.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Best Horror Film in Years,"A young woman (Maika Monroe) is followed by an unknown supernatural force after getting involved in a sexual encounter.This film hit hard with intense hype, and created two camps: a larger, more positive camp that loved the hype and the film. And a smaller camp, who were disappointed and thought it was much ado about nothing. While it would be hard to say that one side was right and one was wrong (we all have opinions), the larger camp seems to be winning.And why not? We have a fresh, new idea here played out with great actors and some creepy effects. Beyond the involvement of Robert Kurtzman, this was almost completely a cast and crew of people whose names are not going to ring bells in the horror community. But they will now, because many people were terrified. There is something about a creature that slowly stalks that can be far more terrifying than the in-your-face machete-wielder.Most clever is the concept that after the creature (or virus or whatever) is passed on, it could still return to kill you if it kills the next person in line. This makes the task of avoiding it so much more difficult. You could pass it along, but five years later, just as you calm down and get back to a normal routine... bam! It has worked through the chain back to you!Worth singling out is the score from Disasterpiece (Rich Vreeland), Jeff Szpirglas has called a ""nifty fusion"" of John Carpenter and Krzysztof Penderecki. The music is one of the best things of the film, completing the hollow, lifeless mood of the setting. It moves in a simple, methodical direction, creating the tension that something is slowly creeping from a distance... or right behind you. That is pure, aural gold.""It Follows"" is, without a doubt, the best horror film to be released in years, and perhaps the best of the 21st century so far.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A modern classic.,"As a person who's main film interest is the horror genre and as a person who sees most main horror films at the theater and on demand, I know where the horror genre stands. I admit found footage films have their issues and it is overdone but I like most of them. Sadly though, from January through at least February you are going to get studios putting out and dumping horror films on the market that they know will not make money and will have not get a good reception. You don't see horror weekly at a theater due to the fact it's a genre with a limited market and audience. A growing theme to be noted is that the best horror are the independent films or at the least the ones with the least amount of star power and budget in my eyes.The 2014 movie It Follows has several themes. It has only a budget of $2 million and it's got a smaller release to start which later expanded to a bigger release. With a cast of people like Maika Monroe, Keir Gilchrist and Jake Weary, this is a cast of the not the biggest names. I thought It Follows might be a good horror movie. Good is not the right term for this. It Follows has you lost for descriptive words for all the right reasons.After Jay Height (Monroe) goes on a first date with Hugh (Jake Weary) and after having a sex in his car, Jay wakes up underdressed and tied up in a wheelchair. Hugh claims that a curse is now upon her with a type of entity that will follow Jay until she passes it on to somebody else. Jay now must try to survive while many of her close friends are at her side.One issue with horror nowadays is originality. Sure, we can find some good original horror films but stuff like The Last Exorcism or You're Next were toned down and not very good because of a lack of originality. Yes, It Follows is very original but it's such a different type of topic and substance to plot. We've had many horror films have sex scenes before but this film does it the smart way by having no nudity and not being very detailed in those scenes. It's as if the film is trying to say it's taboo for you to have sex and this entity is your punishment. You also have all those small time actors all delivering strong performances while making this plot very convincing. It's up to the audience to decide what this brilliant and uncanny plot actually is and you could literally have a several hour conversation over it.If you go into It Follows expecting to get jump scares, you are in the wrong mindset. This film is meant to creep you out but not that way. Why is a girl with urine coming out of her walking towards us? Why is person with a nightgown on top of the roof? The idea of being tied up right after sex is unsettling. With nothing explained again about these elements, your mind is led to wander to interesting places. Not only that, but director David Robert Mitchell puts in this alternative/techno music that's just going to get under your skin. He also sets up scenes with interesting camera angles and big backgrounds that seems to be a clear inspiration from something like Halloween of 1978.A theme some people who are taking about this movie are not touching upon is the idea of water. Jay goes to a beach house to get away from the curse. There is also an interesting above-ground pool ""floating"" scene. She also fights this entity in a local rec pool which might be the most interesting film scene I have ever seen. Maybe this entity comes from water? It's also not like water is a common theme in horror either. Very imaginative.Shot around the Detroit area, this movie ultimately comes back to me. Growing up in the same general area and my dad's side of the family lived in these exact style neighborhood the film presents to us. Call it bias on my part but this atmosphere does add to strangeness level of the film because the houses are so dated with 70's/80's touches that are not at all modern. The neighborhoods seem isolated with a lack of people around. This is an atmosphere that nobody has ever seen before and because it's not like many horror films are shot in Detroit. Twenty years from now, I know for a fact I will be the guy checking out these film locations right by me.It Follows is a film with no answers and even with getting that wider release, it's still not going to earn as much money as a big horror film. You do hope Mitchell and his cast all get more recognition because it is credit that is deserved. I do have a strong feel though that a cult following will be attached to this later on and that we will be calling this ""Michigan Horror"". It Follows is something we should follow because you have nothing to lose. A modern classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

One time watch.,"It's a no nonsense horror story. The turn of events are somewhat logical if not unexpected. This movie doesn't have sudden horrifying moments but does able to do justice with the genre due to the engaging story line.The name ""It follows"" is quite generic as usually in horror films the ghost or spirit sticks to something and then follows you everywhere. In that sense it's the same. But, the treatment is different and some part of the special effects seemed like the Hollywood flick ""Hollow man"" while the other part resembled ""The Grudge"" which too followed the victim everywhere. It's not the most horrifying movie out there. But, it certainly is able to play with people's psychology. All in all, it's the same old wine in a new bottle. I would give 8 stars out of 10.

The Horror Movie I Might have been Waiting For,"I am not an avid horror movie-goer, let's put it that way. I think most modern horror movies are very bland, and when it's not some demented doll or house, its teen drama revolving around a curse. 'It Follows' brings back that classic 'can't run away from slowly moving threat' theme. But, it works. Yeah there's sex and cheesy things like that, BUT the characters aren't TOO bland together and work well as a realistic group of friends. None of the scares really 'jump' out at you. The filmmakers simply lay it out for you on plate and you get to look at it for a few seconds. This works though! I hate horror movies filled with jump scares and what not, it has to be terrifying throughout the entire scene. The cinematography is great, I was impressed with the shots and the color choices/variation and the editing isn't too bad either.

Thoughtful and unique horror movie,"There is a scene about 2/3 of the way into the movie when the teenagers are talking about their fear of going into an area that is no longer within their safe, predictable manicured suburbs. They talk about how they used to need permission from their parents to even travel to the border of the city which is portrayed as dark, decaying and ultimately existentially threatening. Their stage of life mirrors this border. They are dependents who are about to be independent. They are secluded in the suburbs and about to be among the diverse society. They have parents who child proof the world but soon their responsibilities will impact them directly and follow them.Instead of jump cuts you get long takes of the entity lurching toward her. Instead of a main character's personality remaining constant or her getting stronger, jay goes from a normal teenager to showing real trauma. Real trauma makes you zone out.

Eerie and Atmospheric...IT FOLLOWS is One to Watch,"It's always refreshing to find a horror movie that succeeds in freaking me out to some extent. David Robert Mitchell's IT FOLLOWS manages to do just that. Watching it the first time in total darkness and slightly less than sober, it had me jumping at shadows when it was over. It's just so perfectly atmospheric. It feels so retro and modern and the same time, and it comes with a John Carpenter vibe thanks to the eerie synth score from Disasterpeace. This has got to be a breakout hit for both writer/director Mitchell and his cast of unknowns. I've been trying to do my part in spreading the word on the film to friends, as I know it'll be easy for a small indie film like this to pass under the radar without getting the attention I feel it rightly deserves. IT FOLLOWS is essentially a film about a sexually-transmitted poltergeist. We're introduced to our heroine Jay (Maika Monroe) as she's preparing for a date with a guy she's feeling pretty good about, and the date goes well enough that the two of them close it out with a tryst in his car in an abandoned industrial parking lot (romantic, yeah?). Then it gets freaky. He knocks her out and ties her to a wheelchair, but it's for her own good. He needs her to listen to what he's about to explain: he has just passed It on to her. What ""it"" is, he has no idea. But it was following him and now it's going to follow her. Then only way to get rid of it is to have sex with someone else and pass it along. It will follow you, no matter where you run. And never, ever let it catch up to youI went into IT FOLLOWS expecting a slasher film. A murderous specter that haunts you, following you until it gets close enough to murder you, and all you can do to survive is pass it down the line. The premise sounds ripe for some real cheese but nope. Mitchell presents IT FOLLOWS with full seriousness and it works so incredibly well. The death count is low in this movie because it isn't about the kills. It's about the constant nagging fear and paranoia of the victim. They're forced to constantly keep one eye over their shoulder and if you suspect someone in the crowd isn't what they appear, you run. The spirit/demon/ghost/whatever will attempt to disguise itself if it means getting close enough to its victim. And the best part? Mitchell never bothers explaining what ""It"" is. I can't state how much I love that It is left a mystery. From start to finish, we waste no time speculating on what it is. We just ride along with Jay and her friends as they scramble to figure out how to save her; granted she could just pass it off but that's no guarantee. If ""It"" manages to kill its next victim, it just reverts back to the previous. Then there's the whole ""willingly giving an unsuspecting victim a death sentence"" thing that (understandably) bothers her.IT FOLLOWS feels as much a psychological thriller as it is a horror film. Like I said, it wasn't the slasher I was anticipating so we spend the majority of the movie with Jay, watching how she handles her bleak situation. She starts the film so bright-eyed and hopeful. She relaxes in the pool, playfully shooing away neighborhood kids peeping through the fence, and kids around with her sister and their friends. Her life appears incredibly simple and happy. Then it all changes and she is absolutely traumatized. She takes to locking herself away, barricading doors and trusting no one. Nowhere is safe. But her friends are there for her through the whole of it, even if her story sounds more than a little insane. IT FOLLOWS has obvious allusions to the inherent dangers in sex (particularly STDs) but I feel as if there could be even more layers that I haven't picked up on. This is a movie that almost demands multiple viewings, as you're bound to discover more each time. There's a recurring theme of water (what with constant use of pools and lakes) but I haven't figured out the significance behind it yet. It's one of those elements ripe for post-viewing discussion. IT FOLLOWS is tense, haunting, and it would stick with me long after it finished. I have few complaints about the film but the one major misstep that bothers me each time is the final act, when Jay and her friends devise a harebrained scheme to put an end to It. But it's a minor quibble that doesn't detract from my glowing praise for the film, and I really recommend anyone that's considering IT FOLLOWS should give it the time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Amazing horror film,"It's hard to find a great horror film anymore. They either rely too much on jump scares, boobs, or blood. Sure, 80's horror films are still fun to watch, but most newer horror films are derived from the idea that fake guts are scary... that's where It Follows comes in. It's scary without being campy or cheesy, it has sex without being obscene, and it has death without being gross. This is a great movie with an amazing score, cinematography, cast, and writing. The story is great and if you watch the trailer you will have a rough idea what you're getting into (I don't want to spoil anything). In the end, It Follows is an incredibly well-made movie that can watched every year with the same appreciation it was received with the first time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
HORRible movie more suitable than HORRor movie,"It seems a new genre of movies is in town; we no longer have HORRor movies but instead it seems we have HORRible movies. There is not much to say about ''It follows'', only that:it should be rated 0/10... but IMDb seems not to allow 0 as a rating; too bad ... 1 is way too much for it; - it should not be called a horror movie... it is not even a thriller... it should be called: ''a too bad to watch movie''; - it is a huge disappointment for a 7 / 10 horror movie (on such a scale ''The Conjuring'' should at least have 100 / 10 ratings; - very poor acting, stupid script, ''old school'' music that don't actually fit with this movie, awful from start to the end (perhaps except the first couple minutes when actually you feel you will watch a horror movie after all).My advice would be not to lose time of your life watching this movie... although I would like more people to see how bad it is and to receive ratings it deserves.I really hope that a sequel IT will not FOLLOW.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Maybe the best American horror film in this millennium,"Once in a blue moon, a horror film comes along with a simple, universal and powerful idea that doesn't feel like a rehash of every other film in the genre. It hasn't happened often in the last few decades, but let me mention Wan/Whannell's Saw from 2004 and Tomas Alfredsson's Låt den rätte komma in from 2008 as other recent examples. It Follows, written, filmed and conceived by David Robert Mitchell on a moderate budget, may well be the best American horror film in this millennium.First of all, It Follows has that all-important basic premise which is both timeless and universal; Mitchell cleverly mixes the fear of sexually transmitted diseases into his version of a personal demon, and then understands one decisive thing about human fear: that the threat of violence and death makes a more profound impression on us than actual representations of the same. Because Mitchell isn't out to disgust or shock us here; he's out to scare us, both viscerally and intellectually.Secondly, the director is able to follow-up his good idea with effective and economical choices of what to shoot and what to cut, which makes the story not only tight enough, but also ensures that his meanderings in the supernatural stay just close enough to our sense of reality. He never gets overboard, never gets in his own way, and he has the guts to trust his own script and concept enough not to resort to cheap effects or easy payoffs. Although the story as such is simplistic in essence, the implications and possible readings can be intricate in the eye of the beholder, and Mitchell gives us the opportunity to play them out. His direction is elegant and refined.The only tool Mitchell uses to excess is his musical score, which at times borders on counterproductive. When it doesn't, however, it is effective in the same harrowing, aggressive way that John Carpenter's best musical scores were. It substantiates the ever-present, but often unrepresented threat that our protagonist Jay is haunted by, thus creating an interface between the calm surface populated with people living their lives as usual, and the internal (and to some degree external) chaos Jay experiences. This is minimalist filmmaking at its most effective, and in contrast to most horror filmmakers with a good premise, Mitchell rows this boat gently and teasingly ashore with full confidence. It Follows is a future classic in the making.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
It Follows and I didn't care !,"This was one of the most painful movies I've watched in a long time. Very boring and stupid.For some reason, none of the teen's parents were ever around through the whole movie.It was very low key and low budget although the acting wasn't too terrible.From reading all of the good reviews on this movie, I kind of wonder if I saw the same one. The writer and director was David Robert Mitchell who, in my opinion, needs to work on his craft a bit more before attempting to write and direct another movie of any kind. A horrible attempt at a horror movie and I would rather chew on a bucket of nails than to see it again. Don't waste your money....go to McDonalds instead.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Best Horror Film of This Century,"When I rented this movie, I'll admit I was a little skeptical. It seemed like it was a love it/hate it kind of movie.

I am serious when I say this is the best horror film of this century.I've seen so many 1/10s on IMDb, and I just can't even fathom that. This film is so good. I really respect the quality film making with this. The way the director is able to build tension is absolutely astonishing. There are so many very subtle things that are placed in scenes which really adds to the re- watchability. Every time I watch it, I notice something new. This film also has an amazing score that really adds to the intensity. The cinematography is also incredible.I honestly don't really have any complaints. It's one of the only horror films that I can say actually scared me. It Follows is pretty close to being a perfect horror film.

Ghastly - Not Ghostly or Even Remotely Scary,"I have never given a movie a 1 star rating until I saw this film today. No spoilers to be addressed, as there was nothing to spoil - the movie was already fatally flawed. Faint story line from start to finish, and not a single moment where I felt scared, haunted, afraid or any of the other things one expects while watching a horror movie. There was some nudity, sprinkled with mild sex scenes, for those who care. And, I had to wonder where they filmed the movie; jokingly saying it must have been Chernobyl, as so much of the area filmed looked like it had been abandoned after an apocalyptic event - peopled with humans who appeared zombie-like. Plus, it would seem the movie-makers obtained most of their set material from 1970-1980's secondhand stores. Odd, that! And not in keeping with the time period of the film.All-in-all, very disappointing.

It follows ... an interesting start into the mediocrity.,"'It follows' is an OK horror movie.The starting scene is brilliant and establishes that it's not another typical cheap jump-scare movie. But as the acts follow, it falls into a slump of repeating what you have already seen in lesser movies.Characters choose to do away with any semblance of logic and the ending, at least on the surface, is very uncharacteristic of the premise.
However, there is one scary scene in particular which is ingeniously directed and will remain in my mind as the highlight of the movie. But other than that I wasn't scared almost at all during the entirety of the movie, even though I am not hard to scare; unless I was expected to be terrified by characters watching random people through different windows.On a higher level, the plot attempts to deliver some metaphors which communicate specific moral values and also there are a few not-so-obvious twists that you can miss if you aren't paying attention. Which all are left (presumably artistically) open for interpretation.Overall, the movie is somewhere in between. Its flaws somewhat mask its genius moments, but hose moments are there regardless. In the end, you end up with a good movie, which in my less than humble opinion, is far from a masterpiece. And to be honest, I am surprised by other reviews which most reside at far ends of the spectrum.Personal suggestion: Watch it, if you have no better horror movies at hand.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I adore the look of the film,"I wanted more by the end, but that's not to say 'It Follows' isn't a very, very good film - it is.I adore the look of the film, the cinematography is superb; the score is nice too. Maika Monroe leads a solid cast excellently. The premise is certainly interesting and it does create suitable tension, while the effects used are neat. The plot is quite sexual, potentially overly so in a couple of moments but in truth it needs to be for the most part. I would've, elsewhere, appreciated a deeper dive into the antagonists, also.I could see a sequel coming from this, it's the sorta concept that could easily produce many sequels.

Disdain Follows,"Common to what you find in today's cinema, it's a poor movie that uses hipsteresque elements to draw attention to itself.-The soundtrack: it is a mix of retro-wave garbage and poor synth sound fx. The main highlight is that the composer drenches the soundtrack with that iconic cs-80 sound that you would immediately remember from Blade Runner. I found the soundtrack to be grating, not to mention inappropriate for the nature of the movie. It just plain fit wrong.-The main story: This is the one good aspect of the movie, as it's actually a clever premise. The movie is basically a hybrid ripoff of both The Ring and Halloween - which doesn't necessarily make for a bad thing. The problems arise from the fact that the narrative does not measure up to the quality of the premise; the story plot points are dull and feel lazy and cheap, and all of the characters amount to being mysterious bystanders. The writer/director shrouds some elements in mystery, but ultimately I lost interest or concern for any of it by the final conclusion.-The cinematography: I found the cinematography to be gimmicky and ultimately dull. It, like the soundtrack, amounted to an additional distraction and annoyance to the rest of the package. More than once there was a full 180-degree pan, which served no purpose. There were lots of long-shots that perplexed me, as they served no purpose for what was taking place.-The location: It was filmed in Detroit, and it felt uninspired. Random scenes in abandoned(?) houses and buildings seemed to be more about showing the structures, rather than advancing the story ...That is all",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Yeah, then this movie doesn't quite cut it.What this movie do deliver, is an original phsycological thriller, with a somewhat ridiculous plot, different but awesome old school music, and a very low budget. You could film this entire movie simply with access to a cabin, a house, a high school, and a bunch of extras. If you compare movies based on budgets, this is a great one. The actors are not A-class, but they carry the movie great. What I liked the most, is that their behaviours seem realistic, something that bugs the hell out of me when it doesn't.

There's essentially a constant ticking-clock from beginning to end, so it ends up being suspenseful throughout. I like the kid from Atypical, and the other actors were decent.Its biggest flaw is that it drags in the spaces between monster attacks, and that the characters don't always act logically. I'd fly to Australia and back. It doesn't like pools, so have fun getting out of the Mariana Trench, monster. They said it's not dumb, but is it smart enough to know how to board a boat bound to a specific destination? You could handcuff a GPS tracker to it. That's why this movie is fun, because it raises so many interesting questions.I remember it being better when I saw it in 2014, but it's still a modern horror classic on par with Babadook, Talk to Me, Black Phone, Us, etc. A must-watch for any horror aficionado.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A scary fun gem,"It Follows follows Jay Height (Maika Monroe), a college student who loses her virginity to a boy in his car.

Disasterpeace does a fantastic job with the score, giving it the John Carpenter treatment. The plot is a simplistic idea from a type of nightmare everyone has had at one point, even director David Robert Mitchell himself. The rules of the ""It"" are also not too complex either.The writing was well-written, even though some of the character choices were silly and could be easily fatal. The jump scares were well-earned at times, other times they tended to be cheap.There is ambiguity as to what era or time of the year this film takes place, as characters' clothing choices and fashion trends vary throughout the film.

One you will never forget,"A Frightening and incredibly grounded horror flick, It Follows defines a new horror generation in the most unique of ways- while also being quite suspenseful throughout. I really admire the look and atmosphere of this film. Some may criticize David Robert Mitchell with his lack of appeal or lack of taste in making the film more, for lack of a better word, good to look at, but that's just what I love about it. It Follows feels real, and it feels real not only due to the films tone, but it looks real. It doesn't rely on pretty settings, CGI, or any other artificial surroundings to make it an appealing picture. It feels grounded in this way, and in the way that it portrays its characters, giving them depth without forgetting their flaws. It becomes sickening at times to see so many horror films use cliched characters in its supporting and lead roles, but It Follows doesn't only feel unique in its approach, but very well crafted. Its script is without a doubt, masterful storytelling, and I praise Mitchell for writing it, as well as again directing it with a budget of only 2 million. Its cast is impressive, with Maika Monroe being the obvious standout, as well as Keir Gilchrist and Jake Weary. Its cinematography is impressive, unique, and very unsettling, and I almost find a comfort in the fact that all parts of this film are very unsettling- including the wonderful score throughout. The film may not be the most entertaining horror flick, but luckily it provides just enough suspenseful and interesting moments to carry itself along, even enough so that I am anxious to see it again. In the end, It Follows is a wonderful and incredibly creative effort that will not go unnoticed and is bound to be recognized by future generations for some time.

One of the best horror movies of the XXI century,"I have no doubt that this is one of the most important horror movies of these first two decades of the XXI century. It's one of those films that manages to capture something ethereal and unexplainable, like the pulse of an era (like ""Halloween"" did in its time), with not only a great idea and a brilliant execution, but a powerful metaphoric lecture (that touches on growing up, the human need for love, sex and affection and the basic dread of life itself) full of evocative images and feelings, that extend far beyond the movie and stay with you long after watching it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Hepatitis C-,"It Follows has quite a preposterous concept to sell to the viewer. Can you follow the idea of a deadly curse being dispensed through sexual intercourse? In the horror genre, anything can happen and you must give it the benefit of the doubt. Does it work in this film? That all depends on how you like to slice your logic. In my minuscule opinion, without proper connection between mythology and reality, the story becomes downright silly in short time. I blame the execution more than the concept. The film could have certainly got away with no explanation of how things came to be if it had just been more covert about certain visual elements which only boggled the mind (uneven death scenes and the exposure of death incarnate). A story involving sexual ritual (more of this) and shadowy lurkers (and less of that) would've served the concept better. Instead, we are given too much to feed the imagination which leaves the story exposed and all its faults to hang.And so it doesn't even scare. There's nothing to be scared of... unless you're generally afraid of strangers in a lethargic state. With no element of suspense to build the threat, the horror effect is mostly underwhelming. There is scarcely a worry of who or what is around the corner. Mystery goes totally ignored and the fear of isolation is grossly underused here. Again, better off keeping the monster in obscurity than showing its cute face is the summation of this review.Does the soundtrack remind anyone else of an 80s sword and sorcery b-movie?",3.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Good horror film,"I'd highly recommend the beautiful cinematography alone, something great and not seen that often in horror films.The topic itself is novel enough and proposes interesting viewpoints to watch this film from. The basic plot is a horror story with a curse that follows people who are 'it'. The curse is temporarily passed on when the person has sex with another; and it latches on to them.The demon takes up physical form but is invisible to anyone not cursed, and it seems to devour it's victim sexually until they are dead.On the other hand the demon could be taken as a representation of something else; others have suggested guilt, or judgement from others, or even STI's such as HIV.Either way the movie was enjoyable and something I also thought was excellent is the music.

This is a unique and outstanding addition to the horror genre that is worth having in your collection,"It Follows (2014) is a movie I recently watched out of my personal collection (and is also available on Amazon Prime).

A near perfect modern horror film that haunts the viewer for days,"It Follows is, quite simply, a great achievement. David Robert Mitchell has created a film that's unsettling on many levels. From the moment the Carpenter-esque electronic score kicks in and the chilling, bizarre opening scenes play out, the viewer knows that this is not going to be a conventional ride.Like A Nightmare on Elm Street, I love the mythology of this film. Its premise is quite simple but it's something I've not seen before, especially in Western cinema. The closest comparison that immediately springs to mind is 1998's Ring and this may be partly to the cinematography. It Follows looks beautiful and there are a lot of things going on at an almost subliminal level that knock the viewer out of their comfort zone. Pay attention to the changing seasons, the sense of timelessness that cloaks It Follows, the general other- worldliness that exists. Like The Shining, it's a smörgåsbord of tiny details that all stack up to create an unnerving and thoroughly uncomfortable experience.This is a clever, thinking person's horror tale. The shocks and chills are smart and constant and there's very little time for the viewer to relax. There's a genuine sense that something bad is just out of the camera's sight and that an unspeakable, mysterious evil is stalking characters who we care about.9 out of 10.

Fooled by reviews...,"This won't be a long review, but after watching, I was surprised this movie had the reviews it did. I was skeptical at first because the synopsis just wasn't that appealing to me. But, my husband and I decided to give it a go after reading the reviews and seeing a 6 was the lowest it had gotten. I didn't like this movie at all and actually turned it off about half way through. It does have an 80's feel to it and the scare isn't from a noise that will make you jump. I did like that aspect of it, because horror movies today just aren't horror. I haven't seen a good horror movie in years and this was another disappointment. It was kind of creepy in different parts, but I wouldn't recommend it. I am an avid horror fan and prefer this genre over any other, but this movie wasn't a good one.

SUCH A VIBEEE,"It Follows was such an incredible watch! The soundtrack is so mesmerizing and hypnotic! You can't take your eyes off the screen when watching this movie. I've never seen a horror film like this before, with the 80's / 90's feel to it, it really was a unique film in itself and so engaging. Although the premise of the film is quite unusual and goofy the cinematography, colour palette, music, acting and set design brings you into a whole new dimension, and keeps you wanting more. It's not too scary of a film, but very strange and unsettling at times. Has a very independent / indie film type of vibe to it, but that makes the movie so much more creepy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Great, original film.","Firstly I want to say that please ignore all the ridiculous 1/10 reviews. These people are either unintelligent, or just didnt understand or appreciate it. 1 review said you would enjoy it if you were under 10!!! I'm 52, Hello??
I found the film very refreshingly different to anything else I'd seen for years.
Great acting, musical score and idea, that something reletness and after you, no matter where you go or what you do. No stupid jump scenes or boring teen slasher here thankfully. This instead is an individual, original and beautiful film. Which reminds me of the best horrors from the 70s and 80s, where the best horror is fear of the unknown.
Highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Brilliant,"Wow. This one left a mark. A modern horror film that actually works (for me, that is). I felt like watching an old John Carpenter movie.THE STORY takes you directly into the action but leaves enough unanswered questions to be eerie and exciting. You don't really know what is following you or why. Also the time period is unclear: looks like the 70's, feels like the 80's but sometimes seems to be present time. Adds to the mystery a bit.THE CHARACTERS are typical of 70's horror flicks but not as obnoxious or stupid, what makes it more fun to watch.THE ATMOSPHERE is just oppressive. The ""monster"" moves slow and steady, relentless like Michael Myers. Since it can look like anyone you never feel quite safe. The camera work is exceptional and perfectly underlined with the outstanding soundtrack that actually could be considered a character of it's own here.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Absolute waste of time,"This has to be one of the most BORING horror films I've seen in a long time (I use the word horror in the most liberal sense!). Having read all the reviews I was expecting SOMETHING but there wasn't one redeeming thing about this film so I'm obviously missing something. Everything about this film is rubbish, there's no tension, no real shocks, the music is awful and the way its been filmed looks like a REALLY bad 1970's B movie. I'll be interested to see if anybody can point out what I'm missing and why everybody thinks this film is so good. If you want to see a decent horror film I would suggest Sinister, Sinister 2 or the Conjuring. An hour and forty minutes of my life I will never get back!!!",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Refreshingly different from the usual horror fair.,"Horror, like may genres, seems to go through trends. What was once classic monsters films such as Dracula (1931) and Frankenstein (1931) became unkillable maniacs chasing teens (played by 28 year olds) to their inevitable and, might I add, creatively gory demises (Freddy and Jason, you scamps, you). Found Footage movies resembling the Youtube Generation's preferred method of receiving media spawned from the trend setting The Blair Witch Project back in 1999 (if you don't feel old, lucky you). Or the Torture Porn crassness of everyday characters tortured for the pleasure of another everyday character (not a fan myself). Occasionally, a movie will come out which breaks the mold of convention, standing out from the the status quo. John Carpenter's The Thing (1982) and Alien (1979) are examples of pictures that took common conventions and integrated them into a new style. Using Sci-Fi, Horror, desolate locals, and a unknown entity bent on chaos, as well as the greatest plot device, ""Who can you trust?"" they allowed us to be there with the characters and learn along with them. To sympathize with the plight as our own worst fear boiled in our bellies. It Follows (2014) is now a part of that mold breaking pantheon.Read the rest of this review at: www.mockfilmsblog.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Catch it if you can.,"We're all familiar with the old slasher movie trope 'Have sex and die'; well, that's what happens in It Follows, but it's not a machete wielding maniac who comes a-calling after its characters bump uglies but rather a deadly STD: a Sexually Transmitted Demon!After dropping her knickers for boyfriend Hugh (Jake Weary), pretty teenager Jay (Maika Monroe) is informed that she is now being followed by a supernatural entity that will kill her if it catches up with her, and that the only way to stop it from doing so is to 'pass it on'. Understandably upset, Jay confides in her sister Kelly (Lili Sepe) and friends Paul and Yara (Keir Gilchrist and Olivia Luccardi), who are somewhat sceptical but willing to help. With the malevolent being approaching at walking speed, Jay has plenty of time to consider her options, but must keep an ever watchful eye out for the creature, which can take on many different guises and is invisible to the uninfected.Like its monster, It Follows moves at a steady pace, but is never dull thanks to its ingenious plot, engaging performances from its talented young cast, and spot-on handling from writer/director David Robert Mitchell, who cleverly keeps the viewer as much on their toes as the film's central character. While the subject is somewhat reminiscent of J-horror classic Ringu, the atmosphere Mitchell achieves is more akin to the foreboding tension of John Carpenter's Halloween, with careful framing of each shot leading to heightened tension, and a suitably brooding synth score (by Disasterpeace) only adding to the fear factor. Gore is minimal, but effective when used (the early sight of one victim with her leg bent backwards, knee broken open, shows the true horror of the curse).In a world where so many horror films are content with delivering cheap, jump scares, and practically non-existent character development, It Follows makes for a very refreshing change.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
NO CAP. This movie will sky-rocket your ANXIETY!,"This movie is smart but not pretentious. The dialogue is well-written, realistic, and poignant. Now, the ultimate question: Is it scary? Yes AND No. It isn't scary if you're looking for jump-scares or wild gore effects but it sure is scary if you immerse yourself into the story and protagonist. I found myself getting anxious in my own room watching this the first time around and still get goosebumps on every re-watch.

It works. And this is why:,"""It Follows"" is a good scary movie for several reasons: first of all, it's a great idea. Despite the fact that it is a simple idea, it works
incredibly well.Another reason is the convincing acting of the lead role actress. But all of the other actors are doing a good job as well. The trick would not work without them.The tension increases constantly and reaches its peak after half of the playtime. Then, the focus switches to the story and the question, how is the story going to evolve? The atmosphere is dark and scary in ordinary everyday situations. Why dark and scary in everyday situations? Because the movie shows her point of view. She is scared by the thought that anywhere out there is a possessed person, walking straight in her direction, always, constantly - without a pause, no matter how far away the person is. The person doesn't run, just walks and they want to kill her when it gets close enough. Others can not see that possessed person. And It can be any person who walks in her direction whilst staring at her. All of that is creating a unique feeling of horror. Very frightening.""It Follows"" deserves to be in the top 10 of the best horror movies since 2010. Very effective and Innovative.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Waste of Time and Money,"It follows has so much potential, from looking at the trailer and seeing the title ""one of the most striking American horror films in years"", I thought this movie would be the best it could be. I was thrilled when I sat in my seat and started to watch the movie. But not long after merely 15 minuets into the movie, I was leaned back waiting for it to be over. The storyline was great and it had a great idea, but the presentation of the movie was so crappy and poorly filmed. As I watched this movie scene by scene, I felt like it would never end. I honestly was bored of watching it and regret seeing it completely. The total amount of scares, maybe 3 or 4. But, in this case, I would still give it 1/10 stars for the quality and the performance of the money. It left too many unanswered unnecessary questions that threw off the storyline and caused me to lose interest immediately. It Follows started as seeming to be one of the best horror films to be released in 2015, but turned into a complete waste of my time and money that I spent watching the unimportant and dis interesting film.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Quality horror for a new generation.,"I grew up on teen slashers Friday the 13th, Halloween, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and A Nightmare on Elm Street. Makes me sound like a sicko but I also watched The Sound of Music and Beaches. As silly as those horror movies seem now, they frightened the bejesus out of us as young teenagers. I wasn't as frightened myself during this film but I appreciated the craft in the storytelling and lower-budget frights. I made a calculated assumption during the film that those audience members of the same cohort as our lead characters would find the film as frightening as I did my generation's horror films back in the early 80's.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Uncanny & retro looking,"I've seen a lot of glowing reviews for this film, and for good reason. There's something dreamy about this film-something uncanny & retro looking. The TVs are old, the cars are old, and a lot of the scenes are shot in wide open spaces. This effect causes the viewer to constantly survey the entire screen looking for the entity to appear. The jump scares are perfect. And the performances were on point -- with characters you could relate to and connect with.The climax wasn't nearly as scary as the rest of the film... but the final shot sends shivers down your spine. Overall, the film has a coming-of-age theme... and the ending shows that we move on and grow up, but our innocence is gone, and the horrors of reality are always lurking - we just choose to ignore them.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Not like every other today's horror movie,"I rarely give reviews, but had to with this one after just recently seeing it. I really thought the whole idea behind this movie sounded dumb, so didn't bother watching it before. After hearing so many good things about it though, I decided to give it a chance, and this one got to me. I grew up watching horror movies, and never really get nightmares, but this one gave me chills. I could barely sleep that night after watching.I won't give any spoilers, but knowing there is something out there constantly slowly following you,and will not stop until it gets you, no matter where you go really freaks me out. I wouldn't say it's the best horror movie, but it is one of the better ones I've seen today. It doesn't rely on cheap jump scares, not much CGI, has a good soundtrack, the acting is decent, and is not an 'in your face' type of horror. It's just chilling, which gets to me more than anything.Everyone's different.. I'm sure there are people that would find it lame, or boring... But if you're like me, and it's the little things that scare you instead of monsters jumping out at the screen at you.. Then I think you would like. Even if you're not a fan of the story, this movie definitely has it's moments, and some creepy scenes. Would recommend",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Good but Over-hyped.,"Never has a film pushed abstinence more then 'It Follows'. I know this sounds weird. Even more so when it's a horror film we are talking about. While the film is memorable is countless other ways, this is what I personally got out of 'It Follows'. I am hard pressed to recall a horror film pushing a subject so hard. In every action it takes we are pushed more and more into thinking, ""Don't do the diddly, that will solve all your problems."" It's an interesting combination that doesn't always work.The mix of horror and preachyness is often times very odd. The only times it doesn't work is when we see ""IT"". The mysterious being that, simply, follows our lead character(s). More times than not ""IT"" is a half (or fully) naked woman. This choice does stay in tune with it's major goal but often comes across more comical than horrifying. The times when one will push themselves against the back of their respective seat is countless. Yet, a number of these times were dampened by weird and sometimes unintentionally funny moments.This is a big issue for me regardless of how terrifying this film is. And it is terrifying. It will wiggle its way to your very center and stay there. There is quite a bit of down time between each tense scene however. But 'It Follows' isn't dumb enough to just plain give you a break. Even in scenes were nothing happens, fear lingers in the air. It places ""IT"" in the back ground of shots multiple times. Moving ever so slowly towards its prey.The film cleverly dodges character development, especially with all its down time. It doesn't really give you a moment to think about it's characters. You are as set on getting rid of this horror as it's characters are. This works incredibly well for this film. It gives its characters just enough personality to care about them and feel intensely threatened by ""IT"".""It Follows' soundtrack is also something I should mention. It has an 80's arcade feel surrounding it. It's odd yet it does a fantastic job of bringing the film to life without sounding like the stereotypical horror score. It's as exacting as the film it plays over top. Even if some of the plot decisions falter from time to time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I love this movie a lot.,This is one of my favorite horror movies that I have seen. The story is creative and unique with a supernatural entity following its victims and killing them and the only way to survive is to pass it on to someone else. It's build-up well with the entity first showing up and the task the main character has to do to survive it. I do think the entity symbolism of the sexually transmitted infection is both dangerous and threatening to have. I like the psychological horror of how this entity is affecting the main character's mental illness on how throughout she becomes more paranoid and isolated due to having this thing following her all the time. It makes the movie more suspenseful in how we want to see the main character survive this thing and the climax of the movie.One thing the movie does is leave current things ambiguous. Like how the period is questionable because throughout the movie we see either modern technology and cars or things from the past. Even the seasons are strange since the characters are either wearing summer or winter clothing. And current events are left ambiguous.,9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Obviously this is subjective as everyone is different but having seen so many horror films it's nice to know I'm not immune to that creepy feeling.I'd love to know what the people giving this film silly low ratings for the sake of it actually like...gore I'd guess.Very intelligent and terrifying. If you like The Haunting 1963 or the first Halloween you will love it.The film deserves credit for the score alone.The genius however is that when nothing is happening you are just as spooked as when something is because ""it"" can be anywhere.The wide angled shots are beautiful and straight out of John Carpenter's Halloween to create a strong sense of dread.The comments giving this film low marks are laughable but unfortunately also the reason why we don't get more great horror films these days rather than the junk people have come to expect.I'm with the critics.

A creepy movie that is actually creepy,"There are so many movies out there that look so scary from the trailer. Then you watch it and realise you've seen it all before.The same jump scares, the same whispering dialogue to create a more effective scare later on, the looking under the bed, etc etc.'It Follows' is something new and creates psychological tension & horror. It is actually a very simple idea, almost childlike - but it delivers and is one of the few movies that kept me looking over my shoulder or checking the garden before my walk up the stairs to bed.What I loved most about 'It Follows' is that the nightmare never stops.

High reviews. For me not a great plot which does not work on so many levels.,"Watched this not knowing there are high ratings for this. There is talent here. The plot though doesn't work for me. Not just the plot holes which I wont mention in detail. The atmosphere of the movie is very low as was intended with the developing plot. But some of it logically does not make sense. When you are building a creepy, scary movie the plot has to be believable in the actions and intents of characters. Or you can go the other way to make it a scare jump movie to make you not question it and if done well can work. This just moves on very slowly. Comes to for me a comical climax which tries too hard and does not fit in with the intended suspense of the rest of the film. And the very ending of the movie and I even want to consider it was feasible.4/10 comes from me for the actors and the attempted writing, filming and direction of the movie. Maybe I am missing something but I found overall the film is not very good. Despite all the talent of all the makers of the film. There was a very good film that this could have been maybe. I dont know how so I give praise for the effort put in to it. I am sure all the talent will move on to success. I can see the proffesnialism of all involved will move on to better things.

A truly great modern horror film,"Out of the horror movies made in the 2000's-2010's that I've seen, I think this is the only one that I would call great. The film doesn't really put a strong focus on scaring you to death, but more so puts a focus on creeping you out and giving you an anxiety attack for an hour and forty minutes. The premise of the movie is that there is this thing, ""it"", if you will, and ""it"" follows you. It will never stop following you and if it catches you, then you're dead. It can look like anybody. It could be someone you know or a random person in a crowd. The only way to get rid of it is to have sex with someone else, but if ""it"" kills the person you gave it to, then ""it"" will come back for you. The one benefit (I guess this is a benefit) is that it only walks toward you. It doesn't run or teleport. It simply walks. You can probably see why this movie makes you more anxious than terrified based on this premise. The entire time you're thinking ""Is that it? Is that the thing?"". It'll drive you nuts, I guarantee it. This movie does a lot of other things right as well. The director has said this movie was supposed to be a nice throwback older horror movies and he did it quite well. The soundtrack sounds like it came straight from the 80's. It reminded me of Halloween the most. Not only does the soundtrack just serve as a throwback, but it also sets the tone of this film perfectly. It makes certain scenes 10x creepier. Thankfully, there wasn't the ""car won't start in time of need"" cliché and there were no slutty characters. Both are rather small things granted, but I'm happy they weren't annoyingly stuck in the movie. Only issue I have are with the rules of ""it"". You get ""it"" from having sex with a person who had ""it"" following them. Okay, fine. But what if it's gay or lesbian sex? How would that work? What if it's an animal? Or a dead body? Does oral count? How about anal? Do you get it from the penetration or from ejaculation? In the end these questions don't really matter, but I would have really liked to get an answer. Ah, it doesn't affect my opinion of the movie too much. I'd still say go see it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Something Very Different,"I've heard a lot of good things about this one so I felt like I had to watch it. It starts off kind of quick and straight away makes you wonder what is happening.The music in the movie and the suspense it builds is really well done.Cinematography is great and the way some shots are placed and filmed are excellent. Characters are written in a way that makes you forget that this is a movie and these are actors.The concept and the story is fairly average but the way they execute it is very interesting. It is not textbook scary but it has it's moments. There are little things that I've noticed in the movie that makes you appriciate where they went with the idea.The budget for this was $1.3 Million and the movie made $23.3 Million. I was pretty amazed when I found out, what a profit! To be honest they had all the tools they needed to make this a success and so they did.Overall I liked it, I see why it is so highly praised by some.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Beautiful movie, it will probably turn off those seeking conventional horror.","This movie is getting a lot of bad reviews by some users here. I think that is stemming from people going into the movie with preconceived notions of what it should be. I would describe this movie more as a cross between The Virgin Suicides/The Ring/and the slender-man mythos. The cinematography is amazing and the sound design/score knocks it out of the park. John Carpenter-esque retro electronic music and subsonic rumbles create an atmosphere of dread.This movie is by turns dreamy and terrifying. Let the movie's slow pace (and the pace of ""it"") hypnotize you. Don't be put off by reviewers who went in expecting torture porn.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Expect the unexpected,"Imagine yourself surrounded with strangers any of whom might be the entity trying to kill you. It could be anyone from someone passing thru your neighborhood to someone creepy you see at school. It doesn't really matter how slow that entity moves, it will always get you when you have your pants down.This is absolutely a great psychological horror movie that has pumped fresh air into horror genre. Horror fans like me were really getting tired of seeing the same type of clichés that have been repeating in 99% of all horror movies. Now they don't even bother putting some thought into the movies they make to avoid plot holes or goofs.Probably because producers are targeting the young that have nothing to do on a weekend night, and willing to get some profit putting in very little.With It follows, I am hoping things will change and we will see better, more thought-provoking movies that will nail us down and keep us under effect for weeks, which I honestly expect from a good movie, no matter what genre.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Explicit Sex At The Expense Of Horror.,"An unnamed girl flees her house running around in circles in the street before finally jumping in her car and speeding away. She drives to the beach where she calls her father apologising for trivial reasons as she speaks with fear in her voice. By the following morning, she has been brutally murdered, her body twisted and contorted.Young college student Jay goes on a movie date with Hugh. In the theatre, they begin playing a game whereby one person picks someone out of the audience and other person must guess who they've selected. Hugh points out a woman standing at the entrance in a yellow dress whom Jay cannot see. Fearful, he demands they leave. On another date, Hugh and Jay have sex in his car, after which Hugh incapacitates her with chloroform. When she wakes, tied to a wheelchair, Hugh explains that their sex has passed on a curse: an entity which can only be seen by those with the curse, and can take on the appearance of any person. It will follow Jay at walking pace. If it catches her it will kill her and then pursue the previous person to have passed it on. This explanation points out to the audience that the unnamed girl at the beginning of the story is clearly who Hugh had passed it on to, but upon her death, ""it"" has returned to haunt him once again. He tells Jay that the only way she can escape the entity is to sleep with someone to pass on the curse. Wanting Jay to witness ""it"" first hand, so she will believe Hugh is telling the truth, he waits until a naked woman begins walking toward them. As Jay is clearly hysterical by this chain of events, he eventually releases her, drives her home, and flees.The next day, the police cannot find the woman or Hugh. At school, Jay sees an old woman in a hospital gown walking towards her, invisible to others. Jay's sister, Kelly, and her friends Paul and Yara agree to help and spend the night in her house. In the middle of the night Paul investigates a smashed kitchen window but sees no one; Jay sees a half-naked and bloodied woman walking toward her, urinating. She runs upstairs to the others, who cannot see the entity. When a tall man with gouged-out eyes enters the bedroom, Jay flees the house and rides a bike to a nearby playground, where her friends find her.With the help of their neighbour Greg, they drive to a unsavoury part of urban Detroit to an abandoned house where supposedly Hugh lived. Inside they find that Hugh has set up strings of tin cans and other noisemakers to detect an intruder entering the house. Living in ""squatter-like"" conditions, they discover a picture of Hugh and a girl wearing a varsity letterman's jacket, thus identifying his high school alma mater. Jay and Greg then go to his high school, and searching through an old high school yearbook, they discover that indeed Hugh is really ""Jeff."" The group traces Jeff to his real address. He tells them he got the curse from a one-night stand. The group decides to drive to Greg's lake house, where Jay learns to fire a gun. The entity, taking on the appearances of Yara, the tall man, and Paul, attacks Jay; she shoots it, but it recovers. Jay flees in Greg's car but crashes into a corn field, and awakens in the hospital with a broken arm and a head injury.Greg agrees to sleep with Jay to pass on the curse, and insists he doesn't believe in it. Days later, Jay sees Greg smash the window to his own house and enter. She tries to warn the real Greg on the telephone but he does not answer. She runs into the house and finds the entity in the form of Greg's half-naked mother knocking on his bedroom door; it jumps on Greg and appears to rape him as he dies.Jay flees by car and spends the night outdoors. Awaking the next day, she hears music and voices coming from the nearby lake. Walking to the beach, Jay sees three young men on a boat just offshore. She undresses and walks into the water with the apparent intention of having sex with them to pass on the curse. When she returns home, Paul arrives, but she refuses Paul's offer of sex to pass on the curse. Paul formulates another plan, and the group leaves Jay's house. As they drive away, she sees a naked man on the roof of her house watching her, showing that she either never slept with the young men or that the stalking entity has already killed them and has returned to her.The group then heads to an abandoned swimming pool, where they plan to kill the entity by luring it into the pool and plunging electrical devices into the water. Jay, waiting in the pool, spots the entity and realises it has taken the appearance of her deceased father; it throws the devices at her. Firing at an invisible target, Paul accidentally wounds Yara, but manages to shoot the entity in the head, knocking it into the pool. As it drags Jay underwater, he shoots it again and Jay escapes. She then sees its blood filling the pool.Jay and Paul have sex. Later, Paul drives through a seedy part of town past women who appear to be prostitutes. In the final scene, Paul and Jay walk down the street hand in hand, as a unknown stranger approaches them from behind on foot, but their fate is left unknown as the camera fades.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Interesting Concept, Well Executed","I've seen a wide range of horror movies and therefore tend to find them predictable. I don't mean the plots themselves, though there's plenty of that, but rather the scares.I figured this movie would be another slasher or paranormal film that I've seen a hundred times. I was delighted to see that was not the case.The plot is unique and gripping. The scares, while few and far between, are effective. The highlight of this film is not the jump scares, but the overwhelming sense of anxiety. I was on edge the entire time. There were very few calm moments and they were skillfully places to give a little relief before continuing the dread and uneasiness.I loved that the ending didn't leave you feeling happy or cathartic, yet it still was satisfying. It reminded me, slightly, of the ending of Babadook. It won't be a happily ever after, but it still feels like a complete story fitting for a horror movie.I highly recommend this for people who are seeking more than jump scares.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A sinister tale of lost innocence,"There's a lot to like about this film. Clearly there are obvious cinematic influences, the Halloween style soundtrack, the faded cool autumnal look, the sexually infatuated teens all relate to recent horror tradition.While for some this is imitation, I kind of enjoyed the way it was all put together. The photography and cinematography is interesting as well, the camera is always moving, the people in the background are constantly involved, I was left wondering who was a threat and who wasn't throughout.This mostly is a well told story of the transition from childhood to adulthood. Sex is this point around which death stalks its victims and there is more than a hint of a suggestion that the point at which we achieve adulthood is where we are forced to consider our own mortality. Death come in the form of those who have already been taken.Deeper philosophical interpretation aside, there's enough teen slasher shocks and jump scares to satisfy the horror movie fans.For me the ending let the film down a bit, it felt like a door was being left open for a potential sequel which is inevitable these days I suppose.All in all this is a solid films, excellently produced, written and directed.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Started out with a neat and spooky idea, then took it nowhere","At the very beginning I thought this was shaping up to be a decent horror movie based on a novel idea. Unfortunately I found myself waiting and waiting for something interesting or scary to happen and it just never delivered. Slow pace, mediocre acting, plot holes big enough to drive a bus through, (such as why did the original guy take the time and effort to seduce the young, pretty suburban girl instead of just visiting a prostitute?) by the end which is one of those that comes abruptly where you're left thinking ""huh?"" I felt disappointed. Ultimately it boils down to something like a supernatural STD that you can get rid of by giving it to someone else. The forms ""it"" takes on throughout are pretty lame and not really explained in any way.",2.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One of those rare horror movies where characters are not overtly dramatic,"Throughout the film, all those who were not ""infected"" were almost always chill even though the protagonist was scaredYou will notice it in the very beginning when that woman by the car offers to help and just casually carries on when rejected; this attitude persists all the way till the end.I loved this little detail - which I have no idea if was intentional or not. This is because I imagine it portrays exactly our behavior if it were to happen in real life; doubting the person and moving on with our own lives.Even when her friends eventually come to know its real they do not act dramatic and are not tense all the time afterwards.This made it for me !The thing that bothered me was how her mother was absent the whole time since they lived in the same house. Same feeling in that swimming pool showdown; how did they just trespassed into that building, fired guns and no one took notice the whole time. Weird.Nonetheless the movie itself is creepy (if not scary). The music was impressive and adds to the mood.I see the reviews are polarized here. Personally it was a really good movie which despite its few downsides stands strong on its own.That so largely because of its plot.There were talks about a sequel which would trace it origins of ""it"". I hope it gets made.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Very disappointing.,"""It Follows"" is a film about teenagers being stalked by an entity with sinister motives.I attended this film as part of the Melbourne film festival with high hopes expecting to be scared and entertained and unfortunately I was only a little entertained and not at all moved emotionally. The film has a good premise but I found it bland. The music I must mention was overpowering at times, like John Carpenter on acid, and tried to make scenes scary just by musical cues alone.I did enjoy the lead character's performance, she was fine, but the film was not well done so two stars from me.",2.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Modern Take on a Classic Story,"This film is one that I rented after no longer working at Family Video. I believe my buddy and I watched this with another movie that night. After that initial viewing, I liked it, but wasn't sure fully what I had seen. I've caught part of this another time with my family, but hadn't seen it all the way through for a long time. I am now as part of the Summer Series for The Podcast Under the Stairs. The synopsis is a young woman is followed by an unknown supernatural force after a sexual encounter.We begin with a young woman running out of her house. She is wearing heels and pajamas. A woman asks her if she is okay and she tells her she is. Her father comes outside and asks her the same thing. She goes back inside her house and then comes back out with car keys. She drives off to a beach where she takes a call from her daughter. She apologizes and the next morning we see that she's dead in a violent way.The movie then takes us to Jay Height (Maika Monroe) who is hanging out in her swimming pool. There are some neighborhood boys that are spying on her and she says something to them. She goes inside where her sister of Kelly (Lili Sepe) is hanging out with her friends Yara (Olivia Luccardi) and Paul (Keir Gilchrist). It should be pointed out here that Paul is in love with Jay.Jay is seeing an older guy by the name of Hugh (Jake Weary). They're in to see a movie, but they leave before it starts. He sees a woman in a yellow dress, but Jay doesn't. She is concerned why he's as bothered as he is. They end up going out to dinner and then have sex in his car.Things take a dark turn afterwards when Hugh puts something over Jay's mouth and knocks her out. She wakes up tied to a wheelchair. He tells her that he has passed something to her and that it will now follow her. He gives her the rules which are not to let it touch her. It walks slowly, but it will never stop. He also says that she needs to sleep with someone so it will stop following her. She needs to pass it on, because if it catches her, then he will become the target again.Hugh then drops Jay off at her home while her sister and friends are sitting outside. They help her and the police are notified. When she goes to school, she sees an old woman walking toward her while in class. She then sees her in a school hallway, but no one sees her though. Jay then flees.She thinks she is going crazy. Paul offers to stay over to watch over her and make sure nothing happens. Yara also comes over to stay the night as well. A window is broken in the kitchen that night while Jay and Paul are talking. It ends with Jay being chased from the house. The three friends meet her in a park while she sits on a swing. Greg Hannigan (Daniel Zovatto) who lives across the street also shows up and offers his help.The group then tries to figure out who Hugh really is and how they can stop this thing from following Jay. Not everyone fully believes until there's another encounter on the beach. Can she figure out how to stop this creature before it is too late? Or will she decide to share this curse with someone else?That is where I want to leave my recap. I was reading over my original review and it appears that I learned of this movie from its trailer. Something else that I saw was that this movie was based on older horror. What is interesting though is that this movie has a timeless feel. It is set in Detroit in neighborhoods that are a bit rundown. We are seeing older televisions being watched, but Yara has this futuristic clamshell that she reads books on. I like that we're getting a movie that feels like a throwback while still being set in a more modern era.Where I should go next is the major concept/theme of this movie. At its core it is a coming of age tale. We have Jay who is seeing an older guy. There is a line that is dropped later in the movie that she might not actually be a virgin. I have a tough time believing that with what happens between her and the guy she supposedly slept with. Regardless, I know the major idea behind this is Jay losing her innocence by sleeping with Hugh. This causes her to be followed by this creature. I did hear from a podcaster on the Summer Series episode that they don't necessarily think this is about STDs, but more about how becoming an adult gets you closer to death. That is closer to how I read this movie that Jay has lost her innocence and now is struggling with the realizations of needing to survive.The thing in this movie is interesting. It doesn't have a permanent form. It can look like someone you know or someone you don't, whatever it can to get close to you. I think this is creepy as it allows the movie to use different actors to play it. We get things like Greg's mom or Jay's deceased father. We get this man that is quite tall, an older woman and heck, even Greg himself. On the television there are a couple of different old Sci-Fi movies that are playing that deal with aliens that are monsters. I think that is an interesting touch there as this entity is unknown. They don't know how to stop it, no one is really an expert on it and they're just doing things they think will help. I think this idea that no matter what they do, it continues to follow them.A major part of this movie though is the acting. I think that Monroe does a great job as Jay. She is this younger woman that is coming into womanhood. She is faced with a horrible decision that she didn't necessarily agree to. I know there are a couple things she may or may not do that would make her a villain. When it comes to surviving though, I can't fault her. I like Gilchrist as this guy who will do anything for her. I've been in his position. The stakes haven't been this high, but I've been put in the friend-zone. I like Sepe and Luccardi in their minor roles along with Weary and Zovatto. I do want to give credit to everyone that plays the entity as well. They all bring this creepiness to it that works for me.Then I believe the last things to talk about are the effects, cinematography and the soundtrack. For the effects, the movie does use some CGI. There isn't a lot of it though. What we do get is there to enhance some things which work for me. I do like the make-up that is used on the creature as well. I do know we get some CGI during some of the attack scenes, but I like what they do with it. The cinematography is well done as well. We linger on things to give character to the rundown area they're living in. I do have a gripe that the movie runs a bit long if I'm going to be honest. What I don't have issues with though is the soundtrack. It has a great synth feel that just adds another layer to this movie. I've listened to it a few times and it is one of the better ones from the last decade to me.So then in conclusion here, I think we are getting a different take on a story we've seen before and that works. I like that we have this entity that we don't know about and no one is really an expert on it. The acting works well in bringing these characters to life. I think that the effects and the cinematography are good. The soundtrack is great. If I have an issue, I think the movie goes on a bit long. There is a lull in the middle that makes sense while it also could be trimmed. Regardless though, I think this is a great movie in my opinion. It is one that I definitely recommend.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Were the creators brain-dead during story development? I love horror movies, but this was a major disappointment. After the movie ended, I still didn't understand what was going on.

Think all teen horror movies are the same? Think again. See this movie!,"From the late 1980s to the late 1990s, ""when was the last time you were tested?"" preceded every ""I love you."" Everyone knew someone who had died of AIDS, no one knew when the epidemic would end, and thinking of the other person's prior sexual encounters added to the anxiety of the first time between every couple. At that time, HIV always became the death sentence of AIDS.""It Follows"" may have not been written as a metaphor for AIDS, but it does the job anyway. Filmed in Detroit, it's a showcases what happens to the American dream when someone else has a better idea. Crumbling factories, fading mid century ranch homes, and metal-fatigued muscle cars tell us that, no matter how young and beautiful we are today, we will rot from the inside, unless we understand how temporary it all is.There are genuinely terrifying parts of this film.

"Poorly conceptualized, written and acted/performed","Was this story an idea from a middle school video-photography class who's script was written by a group of 6th through 8th graders?

I'm guessing that this is a way for millionaires or billionaires to invest money into the film or movie industry as some kind of tax shelter. Perhaps it's not relevant for it to be great, good, bad or absolute s#!+. If this were shown in a ""pot"" smoker's movie house I'd say the dialog and visual story is just about all that a person who's very high could comprehend or desire.

Well done for what you get.,"The low budget caused some obvious production limitations - in particular an awkward bounce from day to night and back again, and some iffy effects. However, the suburban Detroit setting provides a nice backdrop, and of special note are the Redford Theatre (est 1928) replete with its beautiful pipe organ, and the indoor swimming pool put to spectacular use in the film's climax. As long as the audience is not expecting the typical teen slasher, this creative horror film should gain an audience while putting director David Robert Mitchell on the fast track to bigger budget films.So what's the bottom line? Well done for what you get. Writer/Director Mitchell has a heck of a career ahead of him. Several ""jump out of your seat"" moments. And also a plot riff which you just know was contributed by some of the frat boys who crowd-sourced the film -- ""you can get rid of the curse if you just sleep with someone, fast!""The soundtrack really stands out; It is perfectly in tune with the scene, surroundings and the plot. It gives you goose bumps even during the scenes where nothing is happening. Dark, classical sounds adds so much emotions, gives you a feeling that 'IT' is somewhere behind you, in the movie theater.
There are not many GORY scenes here but once it happens, it's definitely a terrifying one to look at. Overall, It Follows is not only the scariest film since The Conjuring but also one of the best ones worth watching before you die for its directing, concept, performance, music, etc, all of which comes together and works perfectly. It may have some funny moments along the way but once the scare comes, it's just expertly done and this film will surely scare the daylight out of you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"doesn't follow its own exposition; not creepy, but hilarious; character actions are devoid of reason","An interesting premise ruined by the lack of creating or logic. Plot devices introduced in the beginning via blunt exposition such as ""it will appear to you as someone you know, whatever it can do to get close to you"" (this doesn't happen; it only appears as random strangers who are partially or fully nude for some reason) and ""don't let it touch you, you'll die"" (I guess hair doesn't count?). It's shown that shooting it in the head has no effect yet characters proceed to shoot at it, which is invisible, this indirectly shooting a friend clearly in the line of fire (lol). In order to get rid of it, also revealed in that spiel of exposition in the first 20min (clever writing bub), she has to have sex with someone, so then it'll be their problem. She proceeds to do this 2 days later and no precautions are taken. While initially seeming like a tale that's anti-sex, the solution is clearly ""have lots of promiscuous sex."" On top of it all, the movie is littered with drawn out scenes of absolutely nothing happening at all, ya know, to act as filler and push the movie to a reasonable runtime. A solid 3 if you watch it with low expectations and take a shot every time you get scared. In other words, a sober drinking game. Not fun.

Perfect? No. Daring and creepy? Yes.,"This is one of those movies that's generated so many polarized opinions that it's hard to sift through them all. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor: stop scrolling through reviews right now and go watch it. ""It Follows"" isn't perfect, and some people might find it genuinely ridiculous, but it's original enough to deserve being viewed with fresh eyes and an open mind.What hooked me was the essentially nightmarish quality of the premise: an inexplicable ""thing"" following you, relentlessly, no matter what. You can run, as they say, but you can't hide. ""It"" often takes forms that are (seemingly) non-threatening yet incongruous: a hospital-gowned old woman in a school hallway, for instance. By its very premise, this movie builds an atmosphere of dread that I've never felt before. The first time a character makes note of a ""person"" that he quickly discovers no one else can see was almost unbearably tense.However, the monster in ""It Follows"" does fall into the trap that all such heavily rule-based creatures fall into: you'll spend most of the movie thinking of creative ways to beat it. This is especially so in the second half, where all the characters are trying to plan out exactly that. It also starts getting weighed down a bit by the sexual drama, some of which is a little groan-worthy (case in point: the boy who seems completely willing to inherit a death curse if it means he can sleep with his friend). These two negatives might be enough to kill the experience for some - I thought the acting (especially from lead Maika Monroe) was good enough to pull me through when another movie might have lost me completely.""It Follows"" seems to be a love/hate it kind of movie, and one you'll really need to form your own opinions on.

A horror masterclass,"I'm a pretty hardened horror movie watcher. Very little gets under my skin these days, for example I can quite comfortably sit and watch The Exorcist on my own, in the middle of the night and not feel a teeny weeny bit frightened. Whilst all the kids were losing their heads over The Conjuring, I sat there completely stone-faced, although that could be something to do with the crap cinema I saw it at in Loughborough which had a screen the size of a microwave. The last film to properly scare me was Sleepaway Camp, but that's only because of THAT ending Perhaps I'm not as hardened as I make out though. There have been a few recent horror films which have given me some genuine chills: Kill List, Sinister and The Babadook have all unsettled me greatly. It Follows can also be added to that list.I watched It Follows alone last night and once it had finished I ran off to bed with chills tingling along my back, hopped straight into bed and threw the covers over my head like a 14 year-old girl. It's something I've not done for a while, but It Follows really got under my skin! It's been at the top of my watch list for a while after the buzz it created at all the festivals last year. Once it hit a wider release, all of the critics were raving at how brilliant it was and how it was the scariest film to come out in a decade. It Follows quickly fell into what I call the hype machine. The trouble with this is that you often let your expectations rocket to impossible heights which ends up in massive disappointment.I allowed the hype to die down (and for the blu-ray to become cheaper!) and gave it a watch with lower expectations, and it worked! It's easy to see how many were disappointed when people were calling it the new Halloween and a new horror classic. I wouldn't quite go that far, but in an age full of horrendously conventional horror films with bad acting, super-fast editing and unoriginal ideas; It Follows stands head and shoulders above the rest as the superior animal. It grabbed my attention right from the opening shot which is done all in one long take. There's no shaky camera and no cutting away every two seconds, it's just one long shot of a girl running away in a panic. It feels grounded, real and completely refreshing. The incredibly cool retro synth score doesn't do it any trouble either! David Robert Mitchell is clearly someone who knows what he's doing behind the camera. The opening also culminates in a jarringly haunting image which feels like something from a nightmare. It Follows means business from the start.We then follow our hero, Jay who's a blameless young adult going about her normal boring life until she decides to do a bit of innocent dogging. It results in her being cursed like a girl from Japan, but instead of a long black-haired figure following her, it's an invisible demon. It's an incredibly simple premise to pad out into a 100 minute feature film, but it absolutely works. Every single scene is filled with a strong atmosphere of complete dread because you never know when the demon is going to return, or what form it's going to take. Even scenes where Jay and her friends are sat talking are suspenseful because you can feel a presence. Someone is always watching and it makes for a nightmarish experience.When the stalking demon appears, that's when stuff gets real. The film reaches its most terrifying peak when Jay and her friends stay up all night at her house to watch out for spooky happenings. I don't want to spoil it for those who are yet to see the film, but suffice to say that it has a couple of seriously nightmarish images that will stay with me for quite a long time. It's masterfully executed to squeeze out the maximum scares possible. It's scary in the same way Kairo (Pulse) was. Rather than generating quick jump scares, the imagery slowly creeps under your skin and sends sharp chills all the way up your spine. It's truly a spine-tingling experience, or at least it was for me!Throughout the whole film you're basically waiting for the demon to make another appearance and because you don't know when that's going to be the film was never boring for me. The film does lean towards the art-house side, so those not familiar with arty, slow stuff might find it a little tedious. It's not the kind of film you can dip in and out of with your phone and just watch when 'something happens'. It Follows requires your full attention for it to really work.It's not quite perfect though. I have to admit that although the group of characters were likable, I did find them flat. They don't really say a lot and at one point I was thinking that they could possibly be the most boring group of people you could ever hang out with! Also, I found Maika Monroe, who plays main girl, Jay distractingly attractive. I know it's my fault for being a hormonal young man but at times when I should've been completely focused on the film, I was distracted by how drop-dead gorgeous she is! She also flashed a lot of flesh which didn't help the situation. She's in a swimming costume for the thrilling finale for gawd's sake!In all seriousness though, It Follows is a modern horror master-class. It's flawlessly executed and feels refreshing and original. It's also genuinely terrifying for once! I won't use the old cliché by saying 'it's the scariest film in years' because lots of scary films pop up every year if you look hard enough. I'd say it's the best horror film to come out since Babadook.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Case For Video Piracy,"Carried helplessly into a culture of self-mutilation presents a worrisome effect to a man enveloped by monotony, if only to feel once again.What persists as a one hundred minute metaphor for syphilis and its merry band of gift-giving compatriots, It Follows will only serve to intensify our impatience with the elderly and disdain for public urination. Every cliché of the genre is checked as the defenestration of ingenuity rings apparent. It will not inspire, it will not frighten; but its creative malfeasance will serve to make one feel better about those terrible macaroni pictures made as a child.An affront to anything cinematic, this flavor-of-the-week art house claptrap rides a familiar bandwagon already overburdened with crap like Drive and The Guest. I'd ask it for a refund, but who has the time for it to catch up?Skip the movie but heed its overall message: Dressing like Halloween will attract many a ghoul; a catalyst for eternal damnation within the chambers of Old Country Buffet.

"Familiar, not clichéd. Methodical, not slow.","You probably have heard that It Follows is the best American horror movie in years. You probably have heard that so many times you are starting to doubt it. Well please don't. It Follows really is a great horror movie, without a doubt the scariest American one in recent memory. But actually, great horror movies are not as rare in this century as you might believe. France, the UK Australia and Japan have been cranking out tremendous horror movies for the entire 2000s. It Follows stands alone among them by being both a movie that we've seen a hundred times and one that we never would have dreamed of going to. The film is set in the suburbs of Detroit in a time that we don't know. Already the film is working on us. Cell phones show up, but so do corded ones. Typewriters, but modern cars. We have no firm place to stand on. Jay is a pretty young woman, this is about all we know. She is the protagonist. She has sex with her boyfriend. He chloroforms her and ties her up after, so he can deliver a terrifying message: she is now going to be followed. By something that can change its shape and won't stop until she is dead. He drops her off in her underwear and drives off, she can't stand up. The police have to ask if the sex was consensual. And now we come to the fascinating part of the film. The fear of sex is what drives horror. It is a laughably predictable trope: sex means you will die. But It Follows is too smart for that, or maybe too feminist. The movie knows that a woman in Western Society is either a whore or a virgin. So the monster in the film can be interpreted as female sexuality. The inescapable double standard surrounding sex, the ever-present stares of men. This is the monster. The metaphor is far from subtle, but it is incredibly effective, and the mere presence of hidden meaning and symbolism is something to be applauded. The best part about It Follows, however, is it's technical brilliance. This film features some striking cinematography. It would be fairly easy to watch the film in another language. So much is communicated visually, not just the story, but also the mood. The shots are lonely, and dark. You feel sad looking at them. They are also beautiful, ornate and well thought out. The titular IT shows up a lot in them. I especially appreciated that. It was like a Where's Waldo, only finding Waldo was essential or else the great characters would die. The soundtrack is brilliant. It hearkens back to the late '70s and '80s, in films like Halloween. Mostly synths, the music sets the mood fantastically. Director David Robert Mitchell also when to employ it. Sometimes it leads us into the scary scene, sometimes it only comes in when we are already curled up in fear. Of course, It Follows knows the two essential elements of great horror 1) Show don't tell and 2) What's off-screen is immediately scarier than what is on. It should be revered and studied for its subtly and respect for the audience. We come to our own conclusions with every scare, every character change is hidden and we must observe it our selves. It reminds me a lot of Halloween, but also The Shining. Remember the bathtub scene in that horror classic? Imagine that over and over again, and you have a sense of what It Follows is like.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Do Not Waste Your Time and Money!!!,"I am appalled. It was utterly dreadful, pathetic and painful as you realize you have spent money and devoted time to waste it on such a horrific and epic failure of filmmaking. The movie has no real story that has some sort of an outcome. I absolutely do not see the point why they even made this movie. In my opinion, it should have never been released. I have made bad choices before, but this one beats them all by far. I feel robbed out of my time and money. I can't believe it has(had) such a high rating. It has to be some kind of propaganda to make people see it.

Excellent classic teen scary movie,"Let me precede my review stating that at the time of this review (October 2015) I am far from a teen. Yours truly is almost 40. But that does not mean I have lost the taste for a good classic style horror movie, and this one delivers 100%.The plot is simple. The scares, crafty and, even if sometimes expected, you can always find yourself surprised by the delivery. The actors can perfectly fit your group of friends back when you were a teen (or right now, depending on your age).This movie kept me watching it to the end, so its a movie that I would definitely recommend to others.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Effective slow building masterpiece,"'It Follows' is a delightful indie horror flick that combines both supernatural and slasher elements and creates a compelling masterpiece. The movie has a unique premise that can be interpreted in several different ways, as-well as creating an unnerving atmosphere with slow building anxiety set against some of the most striking visuals in the genre.The plot = A young woman Jay (Maika Monroe) is stalked by an unknown supernatural force that can only be caused by sexual encounters. The only way to beat it is to either pass it on or can she find a way to stop it once and for all.The first time I saw it back in 2014, I thought the movie was fine, nothing special, but after watching it again recently I found that not only has it aged incredibly well, but it's also a brilliantly disturbing horror masterpiece. There's a lot to appreciate here with the stunning cinematography that creates a cool dreamlike landscape, the relentless slow burn pace and the eerily effective synth score by Rich Veerland that really sets the tone perfectly. The direction by David Robert Mitchell is excellent with every single frame looking like a retro work of art along brilliant long camera tracking shots that really builds tension and suspense as well as offering layers beyond the usual horror tropes.The performances are excellent in this with each cast member giving natural performances, Maika Monroe is excellent in the lead role as Jay creating a grounded and convincing performance, as well as being someone you could easily connect to. Definitely this generation's Scream Queen. Olivia Luccardi and Lili Seppi were also strong standouts as well as Keir Gilchrist who really impresses in his role and creates some strong chemistry with the female lead.Overall 'It Follows' is a must for any fans of horror and rightly deserves all the praise it got.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Disturbing and original idea,"The idea that generates terror around this movie is very original and somewhat frightening. The film does not have a lot (and does not want to have) extreme scare moments but creeps with the idea that focuses.It is slow pacing but well-sewn and arouses curiosity right from the start. Somehow it reminds me of some old film adapted from the Stephen King's novels, or movies who slowly burn like ""The Others"" but without surprising twist. You will not find here many usual volume pumped frighting scenes, unlike it is all about a subtle terror centered in a single and great very scary horror idea.If you expect to jump on the seat or to see lot of blood this is not for you. The movie definitely deserves for departing from the some usual technical that can be found in many horror films.8/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Super smooth and clean!,"What a good movie. I really liked the fresh, new storyline added to the thriller genre. The old adage of teen sex is spiced up with something that will kill you. It slowly creeps towards you, no matter where you are located and it can't be stopped! The maiden film for David Robert Mitchell has excellent camera work. It was smooth and crisp with great angles that made your eyes search for what is coming. The score was dark and it fit perfectly with the film. Some sequences would not work without it. As for the acting. The young cast did quite well. The director and writers made sure that the adults of the movie took a back seat. Leaving the teens to handle their own problems and confront this horrible force by themselves. This film is definitely creepy and it keeps your mind guessing on how it will end the entire time. Don't expect tons of action and there is little blood. This film is hugely based on suspense and it delves the minds of the young and shows an eerie response to their actions. I recommend a dark environment when watching.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Badly executed film,"The idea behind this film had a lot of potential; if a curse could be passed on only through sex, then you would have to create a very strong bond with someone and then break that apart, or sexually abuse someone, both of which would be traumatic and emotionally exhausting. This film could have been so much more of a horror than it was.Other than lame teenage acting, this film was bad for a number of reasons.1. Music. What was up with the music?! It's like some kind of retro synthetic crap that really has no place in a horror movie, especially not for the entire movie, when frightening and suspenseful music would have been much more appropriate. It just made it laughable and seem much more dated than it was.2. The speed at which ""It"" follows. To have the evil entity following at slower than walking pace is just ridiculous. You could easily evade this entity without difficulty for the rest of your life if you had to, so the fact that even 1 person died is just unbelievable.3. It's not actually scary. The scenes where you are clearly intended to be frightened are just, well, not scary. I wouldn't go as far as saying they are laughable, but I would definitely say that they are ineffective and unentertaining.I just wouldn't recommend this movie, I'm sorry.",3.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"""It Follows"" is sure to develop a sizable cult following...","The new 2014 horror film ""It Follows"" (released earlier this year in March of 2015) is one of the most talked-about horror films to come out in years. ""It Follows"" is, in many ways, a kind of throwback to the relatively gore-free, atmosphere-rich shock-fests of the 1970s, with films such as ""The Exorcist"" (1973) and ""Halloween"" (1978) - the latter of which this film invokes especially during the course of its 100-minute running time. And because of these deliberate invocations of horror films from 40 years ago (while also breaking with a number of well-known horror movie traditions and stereotypes), it's hard to not buy into the high amount of praise ""It Follows"" has received.Writer and director David Robert Mitchell has stated in interviews that ""It Follows"" is rooted in nightmares he suffered from as a child, where he was chased by a malevolent, slow-moving, shape-shifting supernatural entity that followed him everywhere he went. This idea managed to work its way into his second feature, where Detroit teenagers on the cusp of adulthood find themselves stalked by such a supernatural entity.The film opens unsettlingly enough - and with a pulsating synthesizer score by Disasterpeace (which is another key invocation from the 1970s) - with a scantily-clad young girl running from her house, getting into her car, and driving away. We next see her on the beach, tearfully calling her parents and telling her how much she loves them and that she's sorry for all the bad things that she's put them through. The next morning, the young girl is found brutally murdered.We're then introduced to Jay Height (Maika Monroe). Jay has a date with a 21-year-old hunk named Hugh (Jake Weary) that starts innocently enough. We next see them having sex in the backseat of his car. From this little encounter, Jay soon finds herself stalked by the malevolent, shape-changing supernatural entity (of Mitchell's childhood nightmares, remember) that will follow her everywhere she goes until it finally kills her - unless she can save herself by having sex with someone else and thus passing the curse along to them (even though we also learn that's really no guarantee she'll be fine - because if it kills the next person she passes it on to, it will come back for her).So she has to call upon her friends to help her extinguish a lethargic, invisible entity that only she can see, and this does lead to some genuinely frightening moments later on in the film (in particular, a climatic final showdown involving the teens at a community swimming pool).Many reviewers have also read into this film's events as an allegory on the dangers of STDs and promiscuous sex. When ""Scream"" (1996) premiered 19 years ago, it commented - albeit satirically - on how it is usually in slasher films (""Halloween,"" ""Friday the 13th,"" ""A Nightmare on Elm Street,"" etc.), that the virgin always survives and that one of the only ways to not die in a horror movie is to simply abstain from having sex. (This has caused some to analyze some movie slashers such as Michael Myers or Jason Voorhees as moral avengers slaying promiscuous, drug-abusing teenagers and young adults.)But in ""It Follows,"" that concept is turned on its head: sex is the only way to survive. But the filmmakers are not saying that sex is the key to prolonging one's existence here - however long that may be, since, according to the ""rules"" surrounding the creature/curse here, there's no guarantee of survival by simply passing ""it"" along to another person. The filmmakers have commented that the STD comparison is a fair interpretation, but David Robert Mitchell seems to suggest that it's more about the fear of your own mortality - and yet sex in itself, is about living, and connecting, physically and emotionally, with someone else. Personally, I would even go further to suggest the possibility that the film is really more about the fear of the unseen, the unknown - which can also connect to a fear of death, which many people, especially young people, cannot see or comprehend: These teens, in a figurative sense as well as a literal sense, must out-run death, from which there may ultimately be no escape. Really, any interpretation is fair here, and key to understanding the feature.""It Follows"" is one of the best new horror films of the new millennium. It has a low budget, but like a lot of low-budget horror features, it is also stunningly well-made but most importantly, it has ambitions, ideas, that are realized in spite of its financial limitations. I've commented in the past that the British cult classic ""The Descent"" (2005) is the best and scariest horror movie I've seen so far since the beginning of the 21st century; like ""It Follows,"" ""The Descent"" was also inspired by horror films of the 1970s, which is perhaps why these two films are so outstanding on a number of levels to me.This film will definitely require multiple viewings to fully understand everything it has to offer you.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Not mindless entertainment,"I came into this movie very neutral as I just heard a friend talk about it and decided to look into it since I am a huge fan of the horror genre. The first thing I want to address is the amount of negative reviews here. It seems most of these reviews are written by people that don't want to think about things or are really into the current trend of horror which is gore/slasher. (Which is totally acceptable)If you're okay with not having to know every single little detail about something then this movie will be just fine for you. If you don't particularly care about blood and gore this movie will be just fine for you. If you're the kind of person who likes to just sit back, ""turn off"" your mind and enjoy a film, this movie is NOT for you. You need to let yourself think about the characters and the plot. Don't come in with expectations, (as you should do with all movies) good or bad. This movie wasn't the most horrifying but I did think it was exciting. I love when I, the viewer, get to make the connections and look for every small detail in every scene and connect the dots to form a better picture of what's going on. This movie is filled with symbolism and it's not always easy to pick up on but it is rewarding when you find out what certain things in the movie represent or foreshadow.If you enjoy being interactive with what you're watching then I definitely recommend this movie to you. Don't let hastily written negative reviews stop you from seeing this movie if you have the time to spare and if anything I've written about it interests you.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
It Follows... It's Scary,"Drugged and tied to a wheelchair; Jay (Maika Monroe) awakes to find Hugh, her date, in a frenzy. Looking for something that can't be found, it seems, and then he screams, rolls her to the edge of a car park and points. A nude woman on the lip of an amber light, just walking directly at them, unstoppable. Jay has been cursed by Hugh, he passed the curse to her through sex, and as Jay stays alive Hugh is guaranteed to stay alive too. The curse can take the shape of any person and will work endlessly to find its next victim; it follows.Set in Detroit, David Robert Mitchell uses It Follows to tell the feeling of alienation and isolation felt by teenagers in the 21st century. Each teen awkwardly interacts with one another, and adults play a remote role in the movie. Authority and structure almost seem non-existent; the police only appearance and they seem non-plus by the possibility of a rape, this creates a believable environment where the mysterious deaths of teens would not affect the community. Also, the film's monster runs along the edge of nearly every shot allowing run seamlessly into the narrative and the environment.The visual tone of the film is stark, and many driving scenes roll through the decaying landscape of the 8 Mile Stretch. Some of the shots are also unique in building tension, like attaching the camera to the leg of the wheel chair or spinning the camera on its own axis to give a panoramic showing of monster and it's potential victim. Also lighting is one of the nuances of the terror; one scene early in the film has a friend opening the door, behind the hall is lit to be completely black, this allows for the monster a giant man to lurch into the shot, and my heart pulsed throughout the sequence.Acting in the film is subtle for a horror movie; the actors shift from action to apathy seamlessly. Keir Gilchrist in particular adds a depth of desperation to the dreariness. His constant melancholy stares at Maika Monroe, the aimless body language and his ability for his face to express angst conveys the emotional depth of the film.There is one flaw to the film; the main plot of the film is engaging up until the climax. The film final confrontation seemed a bit forced, and all too similar to the climax in Stephen King's It. The sequence isn't terrible and does have this feeling of anxious scurrying, also its significance is exposed skilfully after. It just doesn't gel with the rest of the film.Definitely one of the best English speaking horror films I have seen since The Descent; I was left feeling tense and the concept for the monster is one that should unnerve most people.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
extremely slow,"Read the reviews before deciding to watch this movie, found them intriguing with statements like ""this is not a Horror, Slasher type Movie"", which is great as I prefer horror movies that don't involve horror based around mental disorders/psychopaths etc. This movie is extremely slow, as much as you understand most of what the premise the movie is based on, it does not get intriguing until half way through, then the pace picks up until we reach the end and what a letdown, what an end, there is no end, no answers, no reason, not even a cliff hanger, nothing. I wont be watching it again and advise other viewers that there are much more enticing, watchable movies out there.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"My Review Of ""It Follows""","The cast give great performances bringing these ""half-dead, unmotivated, wasted young"" formations of teenage 'angsters' to life. The cinematography is more indie than the usual MTV produced films that have come out before ""It Follows"", and the total lack of product placement that screams 21st century cinema is refreshing. The story is very dark, with some real emotion that seeps in just enough for fans to connect with the horror that is teen logic and lack of parental supervision. Then add the actual nightmare of consequence in the form of a demon, (which is obviously a show of blatant disregard for sexual responsibility, and the spread of STD's), is really entertaining and thrilling to watch play out.The special effects hang on a mix of chilling suspense as we see the characters reaction to some f'ed up personas that the demon uses while stalking the victims, strong bass driven sound effects that instantly put you on guard anticipating the approaching horror. The special effects stay mixed between really cool practical effects and the necessary CGI stuff. The soundtrack is as off beat, and indie as the filming style choice, and the set designs. Honestly it is all just really impressive, and even though it is Hollywood level production, everything looks and feels so indie.Overall ""It Follows"" is a great return to classic horror film movie making, and filled with plenty of terrifying moments to delight most horror fans. The gore is limited, and the kills are on the mild side, but most of the film is just so intense, dark, and filled with chilling atmosphere that the build up to the actual kill/death scene gives good scare. My only disappointment was the f'ed up ending. If you can call it that. Yeah I know it is a creative way to say that the story is not over, because sex and youth making bad choices is eternal, much like the evil and darkness that accompanies all our choices in this complicated life. Still it ticked me off a bit, they could have took a few steps more with that final scene instead of the one they went with, maybe a small reactionary moment with the characters. Anyway ""It Follows"" is a great modern horror film that deserves props for originality and a definitive return to classic nightmare story telling.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

One of the Best actual horror movies,"It Follows is an instant classic that shows us a great horror film with a different and interesting to teens Classic Movies visual proposal.This film takes us to the eighties horror movie, where teenagers are the protagonists and where sexuality was the main motive to be the next victim. This is where sex appear like main topic, but no longer the taboo of the time but a constant reminder of the dangers of unprotected sex, being here not AIDS or other venereal disease the enemy if not a paranormal entity who harass his victim to rip it.Aesthetics and visual proposal leaves the conventional, it is purposeful and enriches each frame and plot of the movie, this and retro music composition accompanied by accentuating the eighties climate gives us an excellent mix of classic and contemporary.Another great successes is that the performances are quite credible, leaving behind the cliché overplayed classic horror film, the characters have a history and personality, each is developed and well played, making you get involved in the film and points voltage become more intense as the film progresses.It's definitely one of the best actual horror movies, without major scares with sounds or exaggerated appearances meaningless, but good management care suspense and tension.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Most horror films don't even try half the things 'It Follows' expertly achieves,"There are scary movies and then there are horror films. Scary movies make up the overwhelming bulk of the ""horror"" landscape — these days it's supernatural haunting films stacked with jump-scares and creepy little kids. Conceptually, ""It Follows"" appears to be in that vein, but David Robert Mitchell's sophomore feature film has artistic inclinations that elevate it well above schlock. The flip-side is that for every film buff who appreciates it, a horror junkie might be a little underwhelmed. To the junkies, I say too bad — ""It Follows"" is a retro-style horror triumph.Part coming-of-age film, part supernatural slasher movie, ""It Follows"" centers on Jay (Maika Monroe), a 19-year-old in suburban Detroit whose romantic hookup with Hugh (Jake Weary) takes a turn for the terrifying when he reveals to her that he's passed something on to her — an ""it"" that takes on various human forms and will follow her until it kills her or she's able to pass it on to someone else.Jay doesn't really believe it at first, but when it becomes clear that she's never safe in one place for long before some creepy, half- or fully-naked being comes after her, she enlists the help of her sister and some friends to help her figure out her next move.Jay and her friends appear to be living in contemporary times, but there's a conscious absence of most technology and the inclusion of older car models and box TV sets, creating the aesthetic of a '70s suburban slasher movie. Combined with the subtle but haunting electronic score, ""It Follows"" is a pretty clear homage to John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" — suburbia honestly hasn't looked this creepy on film since the slasher heyday.That's just one of the many horror sensibilities that Mitchell absolutely nails. His use of 360-degree camera pans and his overall patience with the camera in an era when horror movies seem to require moments of hand-held panic and chaos serve as not only the ultimate throwback to great '70s horror movies (I'm including ""The Shining"" in that category), but add to the thrill-level of the film experience.""It Follows"" does have moments when it caves to contemporary techniques and puts aside its slow-burn tactics, and they're among the weaker parts of the movie to be sure, but they don't sink it. In an effort to ratchet up the plot, the characters do have some extremely close encounters with ""it"" after a handful of hide-and-seek sequences, but what matters more is that Mitchell insists on keeping the audience in the dark and does not yield information that would compromise the mystery of ""it."" This will infuriate some folks, but it's part of what separates ""It Follows"" from its peers.Symbolism is also a device Mitchell employs in spades that quickly elevates the film. That — and poetry, literature and foreshadow. ""It Follows"" could actually be the first horror film appropriate for a high school English class. Mitchell's liberal but calculated use of these techniques adds layers upon layers to the movie and it evolves into so much more than an eerie and effective horror concept. Whether it's the sexual or erotic imagery or the symbolism presented by the many bodies of water that appear throughout the film, these are just some examples of the way the film tackles bigger, more relevant questions that most horror films don't aspire to even scratch the surface of, the biggest of which is most definitely loss of innocence. It's clear that ""It Follows"" is as much about growing up and the terror that comes with it as it is the terror of running from certain death.Even if it doesn't reach the level of thrills that ought to accompany a sit-down with a horror flick, the sheer depth and degree of intention in ""It Follows"" is staggering. Mitchell hasn't crafted a masterpiece exactly, but his film does so many things and goes so many places that others with similar concepts flat out don't, and they all blend together into this contemporary indie throwback horror film that stands tall.~Steven CThanks for reading!

"Terrific, original vision with near-flawless execution","I was inspired to write my own review of this film after sifting through pages of critiques from people who expect some ADD-friendly, big-budget hack job with MTV-style editing and jump scares.If you're going into this movie expecting that, of course you're going to be disappointed. Those types of movies are played out and aren't frightening at all. This film gave me the worst feeling of dread since watching the first Halloween movie. And you know what made that movie great and the remakes so inferior? We barely know who or what ""IT"" is. Modern horror films and remakes/sequels try to analyze what makes the scary person or thing tick. But the unknown is always scarier than the known. We don't need a back story. We can't expect the characters to know the origin of ""it.""""It"" in this story is a curse of some sort -- I won't spoil it -- but the primary victim in this story didn't ask to be infected with this curse and only gets a cursory explanation from her sexual partner (at least there's that) before she is left to deal with it herself. Not knowing who ""it"" is, what ""it"" looks like or why it's following you is absolutely horrifying.Anyway, this film offers tense, atmospheric horror without cheap scares. The suburban Detroit location adds a creepy backdrop. The minimalist Casio score adds to the sparse feel. This is a horrifying premise and the delivery is nearly flawless. As Quentin Tarantino has noted, the filmmaker breaks some of his own rules throughout the film and that is a minor issue, but it doesn't take away from the experience. This is easily one of the top five horror films of the past 25 years.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Solid thriller,"Really enjoyed it and I see a lot of horror films. It's hard to find something good that hasn't been done before and this was also a simple plot. I enjoyed the suspense and could empathize with the characters. Good acting too. I look forward to the eventual sequel. It's always fun to put yourself in the place of the protagonist and ask, ""Would I do this?"" I'd put it just below the echelon of The Descent and Jeepers Creepers. It gets a few more kudos for having a no-name cast. David Robert Mitchell writes a sensational script and Maika Monroe is pretty sharp as the protagonist. What else can I say? See it and let me know if I'm wrong.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
It's and interesting premise,"It Follows has a high degree of original content in its set up: the originating premise is stark and bold. Imo however that is by far and away the best feature of this horror film.Even this though has the unfortunate defect of inviting speculation as to the immediate metaphorical meaning of the 'sexually transmitted misfortune'.There remains the decided possibility that it's just a good way of making the mechanics of a slasher teen horror film unfold as usual; and we are dealing with a neat and direct take on a writers crafting of cause and effect upon their story and their characters.Another possibility is that it's a direct filmmakers reference to the well known trope of this sub-genre to use youngsters getting frisky as a means of imperilling them at the hands of a monster that has used their 'distracted' state to get into an attack position!!A trope which is often over-analysed by film critics and fans as having moralistic rather than mechanical meanings.At times, particularly in the initial encounters with 'It' a good eerie atmosphere is generated; and this lasts for a fair while into 'It Follows'.Sadly as the plot proceeds most of this good work meanders and becomes formulaic with unremarkable straight forward exploitative shocks and 'nasties'.This left me less and less impressed and less and less sympathetic to the protagonists and to the film as a whole.My final rating is a strong 4/10.....with some recommendations but overall I'm not going to say that I enjoyed 'It Follows' any more than that; by the end I found it to be simply serviceable slasher horror",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Great atmospheric movie,"I would have given this movie a better score if it wasn't for a few things in the last half hour that made me love this movie just a little bit less. The atmospheric slow paced photography was something I noticed and loved straight away, a bit retro-indie style that gave a lot of tension. The actors are great, and the characters are well written, even if there's no much introduction to them they feel real and well connected, and the script lets you know things about them and their relationships with just little details that say a lot. The music added up a lot of atmosphere too, also in a retro 80's style that suits everything else very well. Even the set up is retro, there's no cellphones or LCD screens (how refreshing it feels!) or new technologies of any kind. What I really liked beside the interesting premise was the characters, that were not the typical moronic teenagers from latest horror movies, but felt more realistic and believable. I didn't like a scene in the end, where unfortunately they started doing silly things (don't want to spoil it) but wasn't that bad to make me not like the whole thing. The ending was (NO SPOILER) a bit too open maybe, but can't say it's a bad one... Maybe people will want explanations about everything, but I rather in this kind of movie the suspense of not knowing the why... Great photography and acting. Very good story, design and sound. Great horror film, watch it at night, in the dark and in silence.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
What the heck was this? - besides a waste of my time and money,"For me, in order for a horror movie to be effective it must have a plot, a point, a twist, or true scares, not the type of startle-reflex cheap shots used in this lousy excuse for a movie. Oh, and did I mention that it has NO plot, NO point, NO twist (so don't bother staying around until the credits roll hoping something worthwhile or twisty or explanatory will happen - it won't), and - to make things worse - it insults our intelligence with its lack of all the above? In reading the most recent two pages of reviews, I noted that the majority of them were 1- and 2-star reviews with a couple of 10s thrown in to bring the average up to just over 3 stars, not the 7.4 that is misleadingly displayed in the Reviews heading. The more I think about this, the more I believe that the earliest reviews are most likely written by friends and family of the director and/or producer and/or actors, followed by the honest reviews that a potential moviegoer should really pay attention to. I was so disappointed and if it hadn't been for the music (one star for that), which BTW was WAAAAY too loud, I would've fallen asleep halfway through. Not a ringing endorsement for a horror flick.",2.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Has you looking at the background, and not just for the great visuals","Going in, I was really skeptical of this movie because of the plot. Someone had explained it to me, and it really just sounded like the kind of ghost stories I found the most boring. The super natural sexual killer. This movie manages to find the potential in those kind of stories, and conveys it brilliantly.I'll focus on the aspect on the movie that I liked the most. Because of the situation depicted, where one never knows what appearance It will have, and only knows that it will be walking slowly towards you, this movie has you constantly looking at the background. This is a brilliant move, as it helps keeping you on the edge of your seat. But it also requires the movie to have interesting visuals, because looking at the background and being annoyed by it would make the movie worse. By accomplishing both having the audience looking at the backgrounds, and also have the audience enjoy the visuals of the movie, the movie makers has really done a good job.What I did not like: How it's out of question to contact someone who might research/experiment on It. It's easy enough to find a big, open area, and have a car ready to escape. But as in all horror movies, you have to allow the characters to make some decisions you disagree with.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Horror Classic in the Making,"The first time I watched ""Halloween"" was all the way back in October 2012, on Halloween night, to be exact. I was fifteen-years-old, had never considered myself to be a horror fan, and didn't have a clue what made the film such a hit among slasher buffs. Midway through the harrowing climax, my sister, who had gone out trick-or-treating all night, crept up to the living room's back window and banged on the pane as hard as she could. That should have been the fright of my life, but ""Halloween"", as it turns out, is so scary that a quick jolt hardly compares to the lasting disturbia of its nuts and bolts. Everything about it is straight out of a hyper-realistic nightmare you might have had after a night of anxiety attacks — the score, the acting, and of course, the sight of Michael Myers' mask are still enough to cause me to collapse into a puddle of yesterday's confidence. And despite the fact that the film is really and truly an exercise in horror, the scene that has lasted with me the longest is the final scene, which, after a few seconds of regrouping, cuts to a shot of Laurie Strode's lawn from the view of the balcony. There, the body of Michael Myers (recently shot) should have been strewn. But after barely recovering from her attack, Laurie peers over the ledge and finds him gone. On the loose. Ready to kill. Again.When putting my movie watching history into consideration, ambiguity is the tool that seems to make a horror movie work for me. My personal favorite, ""The Blair Witch Project"", was such a masterpiece because the fear was never fully explained, despite seeing monstrosity after monstrosity occur before our very eyes; and in other excellent works, such as ""The Innocents"" or ""The Babadook"", the villain on the prowl is kept invisible, while we collapse in fear over the mental detonation that befalls its protagonist.Horror is one of the few genres that rarely seems to work — because the main goal is to scare, much of the plot points have a similar air, even the gems ringing with a sort of depressing familiarity. And considering the genre has been around since the 1920s, it seems to be, especially as of late, increasingly difficult to make a chiller completely new and completely disturbing.Finally, we have a mood piece worthy of the hype: ""It Follows"" is one of the best, if not the best, horror movie of the 2010s. It takes the best of Carpenter, the most subdued of Argento, and the ghostliest of Romero and makes for the most outrightly ominous terror train of recent years. It sticks with you — no, scratch that: it follows you — for much too long, individual scenes as impactive as the aforementioned finale sequence of ""Halloween"". As of right now, it may be denoted as a terrifying indie sensation that pushed past its low- budget constraints and broke the ground. But in twenty years, it might be a golden egg horror buffs gaze upon like a stack of one-hundred dollar bills, the knight in shining armor that saved the genre from completely collapsing into hardly seen independent fare.The monster stalking the premises is not an axe wielding murderer or a snaggletoothed demon but a soulless entity who menaces a victim at a time. The victim in ""It Follows"" is Jay Height (the wonderful Maika Monroe), a blonde college student whose life is turned upside down after spontaneously having sex with date. The guy (Jake Weary), it seems, did not undergo the act as a deed of passion but as one of necessity. He is being staked by the previously mentioned ghoul, who follows him, like a zombie, wherever he goes. Like an STD, the fiend seems to travel from victim to victim through intercourse — but if the person on the receiving end of the devilish transfer is killed, it goes right back to its previous owner. It's a cycle of the most vicious quality, making life a living hell for anyone touched by the curse. Jay, a heroine in the same spirit as Laurie Strode and Dana Polk, isn't content passably sitting like a helpless victim, doing everything she can to survive and figure out to end the problem, her clueless friends in tow.In concept alone, ""It Follows"" is intriguing to the highest caliber, but execution is what makes a film what it is and David Cameron Mitchell is an auteur of enormous potential. Some scenes have the specificity of a severely darkened Wes Anderson flick, others drowned in uncomfortably colorful dread only found in the finest Bava. He's intensely concerned about texture and sound — the tone, unrelentingly gutted by dread, is threatening enough to cause the Blair Witch to back off; the score, emulating ""Halloween"" and the chamber stealth of an Ennio Morricone scored giallo, sends a rippling effect of panic through the body. If it were flatly shot, ""It Follows"" would be frightening, but not emotionally stimulating. And because Mitchell's dynamic is so saturated and so eerie, we don't solely jump in fright at the nearest cat-at-the-camera scare; we feel so blatantly terrorized that we become certain that maybe it's following us.Ghostly, stylish, and deliriously terrifying, ""It Follows"" is a classic in the making, a supernaturally subtle piece of uncompromising power. It renews what we've come to love about the horror genre, injecting much needed adrenaline in the long suffering brand. More, please.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Finally, An Original Horror","It Follows could be viewed as a metaphor of sexually transmitted diseases, or one could take a more literal approach to the film; either way, the concept is new, refreshing and above all, good. It Follows is apart of a small band of horror films that, in modern times, is very good, very engaging and very entertaining. You would be hard pressed to find a better horror film that doesn't rely on the typical clichés of the genre. However, if criticism prevails, It Follows fails in the scares department. The film is pretty lack luster in the whole scary mood, but that doesn't mean it's terrible, in fact, it's hard to see this movie being scary without resulting to clichés and cheap jump scares.A very good job to the creators of this film. It's original, it's probably the funniest film I've watched in a while and it produces a decent wave for other films to follow in its footsteps. A true gem in the rough.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
carpenter-esque,"I was leery renting a horror film, they've all become so awful, especially the supernatural thrillers. But the tittle and the synopsis convinced me to brave a peek, I was not disappointed This is the movie paranormal activity wanted to be. While paranormal activity labored under the idiot plot of a Husband merely shrugging off a wife who stared motionless at him for hours while he slept, and seizing a camera instead of a weapon or car keys. The characters in this movie don't behave like idiots at all.From the scoring to the pace of the menace it is rich with homage to Carpenter's Halloween, it also owes much of it's style and theme to movies like Jacob's Ladder, The Happening, Susperia and The Entity but it doesn't rip any of these movies off.It also is an allegory which is refreshing because while I enjoy a slasher flick as much as anyone, rarely do even supernatural horror films address the human situation in any real way, beyond the occasional theological reference of holy vs unholy or sane vs insane. They even slip in some social commentary in a way that seems natural.It follows makes my top 10 list of horror movies made since the new century and maybe since 1990.

"I rarely like horror movies, but this one is so very much more.","The horror in this movie is secondary to the sheer brilliance of the cinematography and direction. I rarely like horror, as it seems to be the haven for low-budget films, most of the violence is gratuitous, as the nudity and screams. Most horror is like popcorn, and as forgettable as is most movie snacks. Not so with this one, every shot communicated more than most of the dialog in any movie, visually stunning and unforgettable. The premise was creative the actors fell right into their roles and were captured beautifully. I've never recommended a horror movie in my life, but have passed on several recommendations to friends because they need to see what *can* be done, as opposed to what is usually done.

It Follows: A Unique Blend of Terror and Atmosphere,"It Follows is a 2014 horror film directed by David Robert Mitchell that delivers a fresh and innovative take on the genre. The story follows Jay (Maika Monroe), a teenager who becomes haunted by a supernatural entity after an intimate encounter. The entity relentlessly walks toward its victim, creating a constant sense of dread and unease.This film earns an 8/10 rating for its brilliant ability to evoke terror through atmosphere and concept rather than relying on jump scares. Mike Gioulakis' cinematography enhances the eerie ambiance, while Disasterpeace's haunting retro-inspired score amplifies the tension, perfectly complementing the film's setting.Maika Monroe delivers a standout performance, convincingly portraying Jay's fear and desperation. The film's subtle symbolism explores themes of responsibility and consequence, adding depth to its narrative.However, while its core idea is innovative, some viewers may find the pacing slow or be left wanting more explanation about the mysterious entity.

"Horror in the Detroit area, but maybe... love conquers all","RELEASED IN 2014 and written & directed by David Robert Mitchell, ""It Follows"" chronicles events in the Detroit area when a group of suburban youths have to contend with a strange curse spread through loose sex wherein the victim is followed by some THING, unless s/he passes the curse on to someone else.This movie shows what a talented filmmaker can do with only $2 million, a competent no-name cast and a brilliant composer (Rich Vreeland). In tone & quality the movie's akin to 2008's ""From Within,"" but more haunting and less talky, not to mention without the awkwardly overt commentary on Christian legalism vs. wicca. The film scores good marks in the female department with Bailey Spry (""Annie"" in the prologue), Maika Monroe (""Jay"") and Lili Sepe (""Kelly""); Olivia Luccardi too (""Yara"").COMMENTARY ON MAIN THEME (Don't read until you see the movie): The premise isn't juvenile at all, as some clueless critic suggested. In fact, it reflects real life as the potentially fatal curse for loose sex is akin to venereal disease, albeit spiritually rooted. It's the casual-sex-equals-death motif of slasher flicks but deeper. The ""monster"" in the movie represents the repercussions of meaningless sex, which may be physical, psychological or spiritual, but there is a price to pay. Two of the characters are childhood friends and their union is the antithesis of casual. Note the subtle yet potent climax.In addition, there are interesting subthemes to be gleaned, like the safe suburbs vs. the danger of the rundown inner city.THE FILM RUNS 1 hours & 40 minutes and was shot in Detroit and the surrounding region (Sterling Heights, Berkley, Northville, Troy and Clawson,).GRADE: A",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Simple yet Engaging,"""It Follows"" is a low budget indie horror made in Detroit.

Follow the opinions of the high raters more than the haters on this one!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"wait...7,3? ah ah ah ah ah ah ah! One of the most stupid movies ever done!","I was expecting this movie for so long, and when I finally saw it I was totally disappointed. What is this? It's not horror, it's not a comedy,though it has its comic moments. How is it possible that some people felt fear when watching it? It has nothing to do with terror, horror,fear or stuff like that. Not a single frame of this movie is scary...neither the soundtrack helps...very boring. The ""it""'s that follows are not scary at all; They are slow, normal people, that just keeps following someone..and some of them are half naked in topless!Uh! scary! If there's something that can really scare me that would have to be a woman in underwear with her boobs off..uh! run away for the killer boob! run for your life...there's a woman outhere.Wait...she is runing...no just walking...she has her sleep dress on and her boobs off...this can only mean one thing: she wants to kill you! Run for your life. Wait! if you can get to your girlfriend first and have sex...problem solved. Next, please! The idea of this movie is so dumb; but even so, it could be much better explored. NOTHING happens whatsoever. Zero tension!One of the most stupid movies ever! 7,3? really? Are the adults voters on strike? This must certainly have to do with the effect of skewed voting by unbearded immature teenagers. Please! give me a break!",2.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
So messed up,Get drunk and watch this movie and you'll freak yourself out so bad. This movie really messes with your mind when you're drunk. It started out interesting and then this movie turned really dark. I couldn't separate what was real from what wasn't when I was drunk. Don't drink and watch this movie if you appreciate your sanity! I'm not sure if I can sleep tonight thanks to this movie!,8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Effectively atmospheric; unusual,"This unusual ""horror"" film enjoys excellent, effective mood, atmosphere, and music. Its careful pace won't please some, but works well in suggesting menace beginning in a Michigan suburb strangely devoid of adults or apps, continuing to the deteriorated inner city and the ultimate climax (though not quite the one that got Jay, the central character, into her psychic mess). Despite showing sexual contact as having very unpleasant consequences, the film probably won't stop couples coupling in the back seat of a car.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Visually terrific, but the basic idea is marshmallow nonsense","It Follows (2015)Turbo review: great photography, lame premise. So it fits in with lots of lower budget horror films, scary and a little stupid at the same time. For some it will be scary enough to not matter—that's the point, right? And the cinematography is really very very nice.It's also a male-gaze movie. Meaning that it has lots of young women with few clothes and the camera staring at them. Not sure if director/writer David Robert Mitchell is still working through puberty (his pictures show him very young, so it's not a stretch), but I found it a bit insulting and unnecessary. It cheapens the whole thing, even though it's a questionable quality of lots of horror films to demean the women in the story.What works least is the main idea: some kind of force, not purely psychological, makes the victim see some kind of changeable person follow them. Everywhere. But always on foot, like a zombie. But with strangely fast and dangerous powers, too, whenever the scene requires. There is no rationale for this, no history, no nothing—it just happens to be the premise of the movie, and so there you have it. Let down your guard and like it, or question it (as I did) and get annoyed.The acting is not bad, but that's putting it on some kind of low budget horror film scale. It's meant to be ""normal"" and it is, with some uneven performances. What does rise above is the visual panache, which is wonderful. It might actually be low budget, too, but it doesn't matter—cinematographer Mike Gioulakis makes the most of his digital camera rigs and over-the-top (not quite naturalistic) lighting. It's almost a requirement for students to watch for how to make the most out of simple equipment. Nice!You'll have to decide whether this saves the movie. For me, there were just too many holes.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Dreamlike Dread,"Good evening, everyone! I'm Mr. C Reviewer, and tonight we'll be diving into the film It Follows. I had the opportunity to watch it on Netflix. This movie originally premiered on May 17, 2014, and has a runtime of 1 hour and 40 minutes. It is rated for viewers aged 15 and older. Notably, parts of the film were filmed in Michigan, USA. The estimated budget for it follows was around $1,000,000, and it grossed approximately $21,808,393. As someone on the autism spectrum, I appreciated the inclusion of subtitles, which greatly enhanced my ability to follow along with the dialogue throughout the film. The film was both directed and written by David Robert Mitchell.Summary: After sharing an intimate moment with Hugh, Jay is suddenly plunged into a terrifying reality when Hugh discloses that she has fallen victim to a supernatural curse-a haunting transmitted through sexual encounters. This sinister force relentlessly stalks her, taking on various forms that may be familiar or completely foreign. The only means for Jay to liberate herself from this unyielding entity is to transfer the curse to another individual through sexual relations.Review: -I appreciated the film's opening, which introduces us to a character named Annie. She appears genuinely terrified as she flees from an unseen entity, setting a suspenseful tone. As the narrative unfolds, we learn about the consequences of being pursued by this ominous force. The story then shifts to focus on Jay, the main character, and her friends, exploring how this unsettling experience impacts their life. I found it engaging that we get to know Jay before the chaos ensues, allowing us to connect with her character on a deeper level prior to the unfolding events even that it was only for a little while. I found the film's unique concept of a sexually transmitted curse to be particularly compelling, as it introduces an intriguing element to the horror genre. This creative approach distinguishes it from conventional slasher films. The film delves into intricate themes of sexuality, vulnerability, and the repercussions of individual choices, fostering meaningful conversations about broader societal issues intertwined with these subjects. I appreciated the film's intentional and measured pacing, which plays a crucial role in cultivating an atmosphere of dread and suspense. Rather than relying on rapid action sequences or jump scares, the film effectively builds tension through a gradual, ominous inevitability that reflects the monster's unyielding pursuit of its victims. This methodical pacing enhances the immersive experience, allowing viewers to truly feel the weight of the characters' fear and anxiety. However, I did find that some moments lingered longer than necessary, resulting in occasional dips in tension. Nonetheless, these slower segments ultimately serve to amplify anticipation for the monster's eventual appearance. The film kept me on the edge of my seat several times during the viewing, and I found certain scenes to be quite unsettling. I appreciated the casting choices in the movie, as the actors delivered commendable performances. Maika's portrayal stood out to me; she infused her character with authenticity and emotional depth, skilfully expressing the fear and vulnerability that arise from being pursued by an unseen entity. The supporting characters played a crucial role in enriching the narrative, their reactions to her struggles adding essential layers that helped establish a believable group dynamic. The film employs a minimalist dialogue approach, which I found to be a refreshing departure from the typical horror genre that often leans heavily on exposition. The characters engage in conversations that closely resemble those in real life, effectively anchoring the horror elements within a credible framework. I found certain elements of the soundtrack to be enjoyable; however, I felt that it did not consistently align with the tone of various scenes, resulting in a somewhat fragmented viewing experience. I believe this disconnection was largely influenced by the volume levels at which the soundtrack and sound effects were mixed within the film itself. I came across information indicating that the music's volume in the theatrical version was significantly louder compared to the 2015 Blu-Ray and DVD releases. Therefore, I anticipate that re-watching it on DVD might provide a more cohesive experience.-The film featured remarkably realistic gore effects that were both striking and convincingly depicted on screen. I admired how the film's cinematography skilfully employed a variety of shot types to enhance its storytelling. In the film, various camera techniques enhance the storytelling and emotional depth. The use of Long, Slow Zooms during character introductions creates a palpable tension and sense of foreboding, allowing viewers to experience an unsettling distance as they observe the characters' actions. In contrast, Creeping Push-Ins are employed during intimate moments that convey the essence of ""It,"" gradually bringing the camera closer to the subjects to heighten emotional intensity and immerse viewers deeper into the narrative. The emphasis on Depth of Field Shots in several scenes enriches the viewing experience by enabling audiences to engage with multiple elements within a single frame, fostering a more immersive atmosphere. Rigged Camera Shots introduce unsettling perspectives that enhance viewer engagement with the characters' struggles. Finally, Wide-Angle Shots are effectively utilized throughout expansive locations, capturing vast spaces that contribute to a profound sense of isolation and vulnerability faced by characters within their environments. I valued the nuanced atmosphere established by the soft lighting; while I found that all crucial elements within the frame were discernible, certain areas could have benefited from a touch more brightness. Personally, when I watch films, I often adjust my screen's brightness to enhance my viewing experience, which proved particularly advantageous during this movie.-I enjoyed the opportunity to meet most of the characters in the film. While I would have appreciated a deeper exploration of their backstories, I found Jay's character particularly compelling as a relatable portrayal of young adulthood and the intricate issues surrounding sexuality. Jay exemplifies both vulnerability and resilience as she navigates the daunting implications of her encounter with Hugh. Her journey serves not only as a coming-of-age narrative but also as a reflection on the repercussions of sexual relationships. The emotional depth she experiences resonates with viewers, making her challenges feel genuine and impactful. Kelly, Jay's sister, serves as a stabilizing force for Jay amidst her harrowing experiences, embodying unwavering loyalty and love in the face of adversity. Greg was portrayed as quintessential who becomes embroiled in Jay's battle against the Entity; his character not only reflects familiar tropes but also intensifies the narrative tension through his dynamic interactions with Jay. Meanwhile, Paul emerges as a compelling figure due to his unreciprocated affection for Jay. His readiness to assist her, despite the likelihood of his feelings remaining unreturned, enriches his character and underscores profound themes of friendship and sacrifice.-I personally appreciated the film's ending, which leaves viewers with an ambiguous conclusion. This uncertainty is a crucial element of the film's horror, as it enhances themes of paranoia and highlights the inescapable nature of the curse.I rate each film I watch out of 10 and for this one, I give it a 7.5 Remember this was what I thought about the movie personally and I suggest that you give it a go for yourself.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
See what it would be like if one of your greatest fears is realized...,"There are so many reviews here and a lot has already been said, but I'd like to focus on what I think is the core and root of the terror in this film. I can say for sure that the following situation has happened to almost everyone, especially in their childhood: Imagine you're all alone in the house, sitting on the couch. All of a sudden you get one of those paranoid frights that the combination of silence, idleness, and being alone bring. Your eyes turn to the half open door of a room, or to the top of the wooden stairs behind you. You feel a sudden chill. You can't look away. What if someone, or something, comes in through that door or down the stairs? What's it gonna be like? What's it gonna do to me? What will I do? Can I evade it and get out of the house? etc. The fear keeps chewing at your soul until someone finally arrives and you're off the hook. Would you like to see and feel what it would be like if such a thing could become an actual threat, something real, and much more terrifying than you could have imagined? That is something It Follows skillfully manages to pull off. It's a nightmarish ride, slow but captivating. It doesn't shock you with a sudden 200-volt electrical current, but it makes sure you're connected to a low-voltage one throughout the movie. Its against-the-grain approach to the concept of horror gets a hold on you, one that would probably stick with you long after you're done watching it. Sure, the premise might seem to be no different than a cliché horror flick; a girl infected by a demonic entity transmitted through sexual intercourse, the usual scenario where a couple of teenagers struggle with a curse and go searching for clues to figure out how to get rid of it. It Follows, however, is much more than that. It's like a tiny little bug that's placed on your palm. It appears harmless at first, but while you're unaware, it slowly crawls into your ear and your brain, infecting you with a bone-chilling thought. It's by no means perfect, of course. There are plot holes that might occur to you after you're done watching it, and at times the rhythm becomes annoyingly dull and slow. It's not perfect, but it doesn't need to be. It does what it intends to do quite well, and frankly, with such a budget, it's more than acceptable. If you're into horror of the psychological kind, you will definitely get enjoyment out of this film. If it doesn't happen the first time you watch it, it will probably come to you once you give it serious thought or watch it a second time. Long story short, it's a genuine and admirable attempt at psychological horror, a la Babadook!",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Expected a lot less than I found here (creepy),Great original horror film any real horror fan will not be disappointed with this one,9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Skin-crawlingly creepy, with its emphasis on suspense instead of gore.","'It Follows (2015)' is the best horror film of 2015, primarily because it's much more psychological than many others in the genre. It isn't terrifying - or even scary, as such - but is skin-crawlingly creepy in a long-lasting kind of way. It's a slow-burn with a keen focus on tone that prefers building genuine suspense over portraying overt gore. It's the deft handling of a unique 'monster', one steeped in - but not consumed by - allegory, that allows it to be as effecting as it is, with the inherently scary premise combining with it's arresting visuals and superb score to a suitably subtle but certainly supreme effect. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"""IT FOLLOWS"" a masterpiece from sound...YOU MUST SEE !","It Follows is a masterpiece created out of the element of sound. If you watched this movie without sound you'd rate it a 3.1 simply because it stars Maika Monroe. An up and coming star you've seen in 5th Wave, Independence Day Resurgence and now It Follows. But this movie, created on a limited budget, jumps to a 9.0 and important enough for me to write my first review solely based on Disasterpeace's use of sound in the movie. Here is the star of It Follows.Rich Vreeland is the story behind this movie that YOU MUST SEE ! Most all of his work to date believe it or not has been video game technology. The sound track in this movie will have you scared to death from the opening scene til the credits which is where they first show you the title.
