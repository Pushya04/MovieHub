Absolutely Charming,"Overtly nostalgic movie about a bunch of kids stumbling on a secret weapon blunder while making a zombie flick. Yes, it is an obvious hommage to Spielberg, that much have been said.The kids are remarkable, everyone of them. In fact, as soon as the movie moves away from them, it suffers, althought Kyle Chandler, reliable, does a good job with non-verbal acting. The one kid I liked most was the ""directing"" one, reacting with slight disgust at the thought that his own sister (she must have been ugly when younger) could actually be attractive to others, but all of them had their quirps that made them likeable in their own ways.When compared with contemporary Stephen King's ""It"" adaptation, which is similar in many ways, it is less lurid and graphic, and adults are less of a threat, but the nostalgia factor is doubled. I especially liked the middle-class settings and realities, the small Ohio town. My favorite moment was when they actually showed the full movie the kids made (""The Case"") during the end credits, which makes it the most agreable end credits I ever witnessed.Alas, not all was perfect and the main CGI creature is somewhat of a wet petard, and some characters were less than convincing, like the stoner guy. It is however a movie with a heart. Or maybe it's me who's getting too old.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
first 80 minutes : great!!! last 30 minutes : horrible!!!,"I have never seen a movie which could be divided to two parts of ""absolutely amazing"" and ""boring and childish"". The first 80 minutes is awesome, I was shocked by how good this movie was as I had seen some bad reviews on IMDb but then the cheesy part kicked in and ruined the whole thing.First thing that comes in to everybody's mind when they see the first scenes is that this movie is so similar to et! The style is the same, the theme is the same, it even happens in the same era with the same kind of neighborhood which is kinda cool and nostalgic for my generation. Super 8 seems like a fan-made dedication to Spielberg but it just didn't work quite well.From the actor's performance perspective; Elle Fanning's performance was breath-taking, and she saved some scenes. She's got potential to be a big star in the future. Kyle Chandler on the other hand was just plain and simple awful. He made the whole thing look kinda funny and stupid.From special effects and sounding perspective, I'd say it was stunning. One of the best I have seen in the genre in years as you would expect when you see Spielberg's name on the screen. There's this big scene at the first half an hour into the movie where you just get nailed to your sit due to the load sound which should have been annoying but it was not. It was awesome. You don't see this in Germany often but after this specific scene, the audience gave Abram an standing ovation!!! It was awesome. Of course at the end, everyone was angry because he ruined the whole thing with a very cheesy ""et-like"" ending but all in all it was worth the money, better than most of the movies in the last 6 months, I would say.I'm giving it 6/10 because first of all, I expected so much more from the creator of Lost and second of all, the last 30 minutes is really bad and the ending is just pure garbage. They used some cgi stuff which was very impressive but didn't quite go with the theme of the movie and was really inconsistent. All in all, it doesn't deserve the crap that it's getting in the reviews but it quite doesn't deserve the praises either. It's only OK",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Been there, done that","As an homage to the Spielberg films of the 80's, this movie succeeds. As a piece of original entertainment? Nothing happening, folks. Now, if you're a kid and have never seen The Goonies, Jaws, ET, War of the Worlds, and Cloverfield, you may think this film is absolutely wonderful. And judged through the lens of cinema history, it may well be looked upon as a culmination of all that came before.Let's just hope that the future is filled with something in rare supply: originality.It's not that I wasn't entertained, it's just that I expected something more.And I suppose that's another problem with getting older. There aren't as many surprises left in the world.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Six friends spend their time making a terror film when takes place weird deeds and something more terrifying than any of them could have imagined.,"Entertaining film with funny situations , state-of-art special effects and interesting screenplay ; according to J.J. Abrams was homage to the producer of the film, Steven Spielberg, and his films of the 1970's ranging reverence from Spielberg's directorial films . This Spielberg production is a fun movie concerning a feisty bunch of underprivileged kids whose Super 8 filmmaking project is about to be destroyed by weird events . During the summer of 1979, in a small Ohio town a group of friends (film debut of Joel Courtney and Riley Griffiths) while making a super 8 Zombie movie (since the kids were making a zombie movie, there are several references to director George A. Romero , as the poster for one of his movies in Joe's bedroom) witness a catastrophic train crash and soon suspect that it was not an accident. Shortly after, unusual disappearances and inexplicable events begin to take place in town, and the local Deputy (Kyle Chandler, Jeremy Renner declined the lead role ) tries to uncover the truth - something more frightening than any of them could have thought - and investigate subsequent unexplained events in their small town. They spend one last adventure-filled Saturday Afternoon together when one of them is kidnapped (Elle Fanning , sister of Dakota Fanning who during the town hall meeting, for a brief second you can spot among the assistants) . This happens after they find a film about their teacher , that could be the solution to all their problems .This is an amusing mess made in Spielberg style, the goal was to pay homage to the science-fiction movies of the '70s and 80s . The story results to be an emotive homage to Spielberg -as the famous bicycle from Steven Spielberg's movie E.T. can be seen as a part of metal junk that is being attached to the water tower in one of the final scenes- and to cinema of the 80s , taking parts here and there from various film as ¨E.T.¨ , ¨Close encounters of third kind¨ and specially ¨The Goonies¨ , though directed by Richard Donner was written by Spielberg . Imaginative and rousing musical score by Michael Giacchino in John Williams style . Colorful and evocative cinematography by Larry Fong . Top-notch FX , Bruce Greenwood provided the motion-capture performance of the alien , as J.J. Abrams insisted that the train station scenes were actually shot at night outside, instead of in a studio , though the train is completely computer-generated , in fact , the train crash was purposely made much more sensational than a train crash would actually be. Lavishly produced by Steven Spielberg was reportedly on set many times throughout the course of filming , Director J.J. Abrams and Spielberg have both gone on record stating that the filming of this production was some of the most fun they have ever had on set. The motion picture will appeal to Steven Spielberg and J.J. Abrams buffs . Rating : Better tan average , well worth watching .",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Magic,"Look, I'm biased. When I first saw the movie in 2011 while I was still just in middle school, I was enamored. Now, 8 years later, as a film student inspired by this movie, I can honestly say that it still holds up. A lot of the love I have for this movie is purely fueled by nostalgia, but even aside from that, the thrills and heartstring tugs this movie delivers still stand up to the test of time so far.

Nostalgia Not of the Cynical Kind,"It is nostalgia ridden like many other films have been this past decade, the only difference is it's not of the cynical kind.The film's narrative FELT all over the place (probably more the plot than the narrative) - there was a certain tightness missing from this that was present in J.J. Abrams' previous film but, other than that, everything else did exactly what it's supposed to. The kids are both engaging and entertaining, the monster turns out to be quite frightening, the dialogue's great, the acting's great, visual effects, cinematography- everything's on point.It felt like I was watching a proper film!

Interesting mystery sci-fi film,"This film is an interesting mystery sci-fi that revolves around a small group of teenagers with a passion for cinema. They have a common project for a film, but end up witnessing a major rail disaster while filming. It is immediately clear that the accident is very unusual, and that the military's interest in what happened is far from normal. Set in the late Seventies, a remarkable decade for sci-fi thanks to the fascination of aliens and technology in general, it is a film of familiar contours where mystery is well used.The film is skillfully directed by J.J.Abrams, and presents a good story, with young teens taking the lead. The film strives to portray teenagers, the way they relate and even the family environment and the relationships between families, which are important for a very small community like this small town. I don't think sentimentality is bad, I think that in the right measure it brings depth to the film.Elle Fanning and Joel Courtney are the main actors in the film, which gives a lot of scope for young actors to show what they are worth, and these two young actors have definitely done a good job here. Riley Griffiths is good, but not so good. In the adult cast, Kyle Chandler and Ron Eldard deserve an especially positive mention, the latter giving life to a character that is rather unfriendly to the audience.Technically, the film invests a lot in the environment, in creating tension. It is not that kind of film loaded with thunderous effects, but one where what is suggested matters more than what we see. Honestly, I think it's more interesting than most big-budget sci-fi films, which are basically shot on the green screen. This does not mean that it was not used here or that there are no effects: the film has good special and visual effects, a competent CGI and good sound, but it knows how to use these resources without exaggeration. The good soundtrack also deserves a mention.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Mixing Their Trademarks,"The concept of ""Super 8"" is combining the elements of J.J. Abrams and Steven Spielberg. The trailer made you think it's like E.T. plus Cloverfield. Well, it's true. There is nothing new about ""Super 8"" but it brought us back to the good old classic times, it's funny, it's exciting, and it's amazing.""Super 8"" is another intriguing monster movie by J.J. Abrams. Yes, you really wanna know what it looks like but I'm not gonna tell you. The sad thing is it's not as intriguing as Cloverfield. But It's easy to ignore that problem because there is something better than being another Cloverfield. It feels like you are watching a good old classic movie. Great characters, Good old fashion score, and kids intrigued by the situation.The story is really about the characters' zombie movie making and the family tragedy while there's a monster attacking their town. The monster is like the background or the subplot of this film. But the movie still got suspense. The movie is indeed beautiful and plenty of heart. The movie is just nostalgic stuff. It's not trying to be new. It just wants to show how J.J. Abrams is inspired by Steven Spielberg's movies.There are some amazing scenes in this film. Example, the train collision was breathtaking. The movie sure has a lot of humor. It's like a relic to the old family movies. The CGI is good enough. The performances were good. The kids gave a lot of personality to their roles.""Super 8"" is a J.J. Abrams film with Spielberg's trademarks all over it. It's not a blockbuster that has a lot of action and less talking. This movie is made in old fashion style. Yep, this movie is nostalgic if you saw Spielberg's old movies and it's good to see another one like it.Note: There is something interesting in the credits.

ET meets Goonies meets The Sandlot,"I was fortunate enough to see a screening this morning in DC. I had pretty high hopes for it from what I saw from the trailers. I don't lean one way or the other when it comes to Abrams, some of his stuff I like, some of it I don't. Super 8 is one that I loved.In the current era of CGI laden, soul-dead adventure flicks, Super 8 distinguishes itself by having heart. There is an authenticity to those kids in the film, a familiarity in their conversations. It reminded me of when I was a kid. It was like ET meets Goonies meets The Sandlot. And the film that they are trying to make within the film, and their obsession with ""production values"" draws a lot of laughs.The friendship between the kids in the film really resonates, and the emotional elements of the film totally deliver. One of the most poignant scenes in the film has nothing to do with whats in the train car, or the air force, and anything like that....rather, its a scene that takes place in Joe's bedroom as he sits on the floor talking to Alice.Now, as much as I loved the film, it is not without some flaws, mostly in continuity. Also, I would have liked a little more exposition for some of the characters, I would love to know more about Alice's father. That being said, I am forgiving on those things because the movie hits its mark everywhere else.Surely it will draw its comparisons to ET, and the other early Spielberg works, but those comparisons will always be unfair. Those films came at a different time. And the people who see Super 8 today, have changed since they first saw ET, or any of those other films. I am just glad the generation of younger people will have this as a generational film for them, as I had with those other great adventure films.All in all, Super 8 was a terrific film experience, that will leave you with a smile on your face.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Best 2011 Movie,"Steven Spielberg and J.J Abrams working on a project together. That idea alone is great however the finished project is a masterpiece. I was expecting a lot when I walked into the theater, when I walked out, not only were my expectations met but it was much better than i thought it would be. Let's start off with the actors, they all did a great job, but I was really impressed with Elle Fanning's acting, she added lots to the movie. I know it won't happen for this movie but I think she deserves an Oscar for her performance. Next, let's talk about the overall movie, it was great, it had, action, comedy, Mystery, romance, and suspense. The special effects were amazing, best this year. Now, the ending, i'm not going to say what happens, but many people hated it but I thought it was perfect, great way to end the film. Overall, suspense, action packed movie with great special effects and great acting from underrated stars makes the best movie of 2011, and one of the best movies ever. 10/10",,Anonymous,Mystery
"A fantastically entertaining, old school movie","I'm just going to say this upfront, Super 8 is now one of my favorite movies. It is one of the most thrilling , emotional, well-acted and just all around entertaining movies I have ever seen, and I've seen a lot of movies. It brings back that old school movie feel of wonder and innocence that made movies like E.T. , Stand By Me, and the Goonies , the classics that they are now and I think Super 8 is right in the same league. But Super 8 has another side to it as well, it's a monster movie. This aspect is obviously modeled after other Spielberg classics like Jurassic Park and Jaws and uses some of the same techniques to great effect.As I said above, the acting is amazing. All the kids are absolutely fantastic they really act like real teenagers- the way they talk, the way they act and all their different quirks are all hilarious. It's so fun watching them all together. The adults are all great too particularly Kyle Chandler who plays the main character, Joe's, father. He perfectly displays his difficulty in the situation he is in and his lack of communication with his son.Super 8 is actually a very emotional movie. Joe and his father have been through some tragic events and they are still trying to cope with their loss. There is some real depth in the emotional scenes and this makes you care more for the character and it makes the movie much more intense when the action starts heating up. That brings me to the next great aspect of the movie, the action.There are some very intense scenes in Super 8. The movie has one of the most awesome scenes of destruction (the train crash) I have seen in a movie, and its in the first thirty minutes. After this is when the unseen monster starts causing havoc. What's great is that you hardly ever see the monster. It's just like Jaws, the less you see, the scarier things are. This makes it so that once you see the monster it is very satisfying.There are flaws in the movie such as the drastic change in tones between the lighthearted events with the kids to the pretty dark and violent scenes with the monster, and the movie ends a little bit too soon, but this is all negligible because the movie is so entertaining, moving, and heartfelt.http://evsmoviezone.wordpress.com/2011/06/12/review-super-8/",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
They don't make 'em like this anymore...,"Simultaneously premiering in the UAE on 16 Jun, I had a choice to make""Green Lantern"" or ""Super 8"". If you are reading this, then my choice was quite obvious. Although the marketing hype for ""Green Lantern"" was good, I settled for this movie simply due to the J. J. Abrams and Steven Spielberg collaboration. While both have been known to possess a flair for Sci-fi adventures, my curiosity was out of bounds when anticipating what this partnership could produce.Set during the summer break of 1979, teenagers Joe, Charles, Cary, Preston, Martin and Alice go about producing a low budget zombie movie using Charles' hand held Super 8 motion camera. Just before wrapping up, they witness a horrific train crash, caused by derailment by head-on collision with a pick-up truck. Having barely survived the crash, the children's biology teacher, instructs them never to recount what they just saw; for their own safety and the safety of their parents. Soon enough, the crash site is cordoned off by the US Air Force, plunging the small town into mystery and peril with unexplained disappearances of household metals and even some town folk.Written, produced and directed by J. J. Abrams with Spielberg signing on as co-producer, this film is more than just a tribute to sci-fi mysteries of the 1980s. True, there will always be negative criticism, as the film's plot will be compared to ""E.T The Extraterrestrial"", ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and ""Cloverfield"". But with ""Super 8"" produced by Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment, there is absolutely no question of plagiarism on Abrams part. How can there be one, when the studio executive is none other than Spielberg himself? Unwarranted negative criticism aside, this film is well made, from casting and acting to special effects and production values. Although Abrams has interjected humour at the right moments, his general feel of the plot centres on the tragedy of loosing a loved one. For good measure, he also throws in moral messages associated with the sense of belonging and acceptance. Again, this juncture will be compared to Spielberg's ET trying to fit in amongst humans. As the narrative revolves around the lives of teenage children, casting is near perfect with captivating portrayals from Joe Lamb and Elle Fanning as Joe and Alice. This could well be Elle's claim to fame, rather than living of her sister's (Dakota) repute as a child star. Some unexpected yet amusing moments are well rendered by Riley Griffiths, Ryan Lee and Zach Mills. With limited screen time, but worthy of screen presence, Kyle Chandler as Joe's grieving father and the town sheriff, and Ron Eldard as Alice's alcoholic father standout among the adult cast.As a child of the 1980s, I can relate to this film with boyish nostalgia. Thankfully, I didn't have to deal with aliens or monsters in the flesh. However, Abrams does an excellent job in capturing the mindset of a teenager. From that perspective, there is adventure, fantasy, puppy love, heart break and even terror. Filming is clearly digital and takes you back to an era when low lit scenes were peppered with heavy grain, also called 'noise' by photographers. Back then, cinematographers had to use special films for low lit scenes. The unavoidable disadvantage was the noise level. Here, this works to Abrams' advantage and is obviously intentional in creating the look and feel of a bygone era in film making. Another aspect Abrams gets right was resisting the temptation to bring this out in 3D. While there are moments during the film that could have the audience bobbing and weaving, the intended atmosphere would have been lost to a plastic gimmick. Where Abrams excels as the film's director, is in placing special effects in the background. He gives a lot of focus to character development while heightening the mystery of 'something dangerous lurking in the background'. As such, we never get a full glimpse of what terrorizes the small town of Lillian (Ohio). When we do get to see it, the film is in the final act. This here is my only gripe, especially when there is evidently so much work put into drawing in the audience. Maybe it is just me, but if the film spans 112 minutes, where is the harm in adding another 15 minutes to avoid the risk of an abrupt ending? Although ""King Kong"" (2005) has a tragic ending, the final act is simply spectacular. Having said that, if you are the type of person to go for first impressions, rather than last impressions, then ""Super 8"" is an otherwise great piece of filmmaking.With a PG-13 rating (PG-15 in the UAE), this is a film for the entire family. So load up the SUV and get to the nearest cinema. Leave the dog at home.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Saw this movie in 2011 an i thought it was just amazing. I watch today and it is still good. Its not GREAT, but it is a good movie. Why people hate this movie i don't know... Sure it takes a lot from other movies, but so does EVERY SINGLE MOVIE EVER.
I do believe that without this movie there would be no stranger things, it no doubt inspired the duffer brothers. Clearly there were other movies before this to pave the way, but i would say stranger things steals quite a bit from this movie. Namely the entire look of the alien creature lol.Some Things I like About This
-They nail the early 80s/late 70s vibe
-The movie starts out very good
-They hype up the lil alien pretty well
-Train crash is very cool
-Big budget movie, so it feels very ""Mint"" ;)
-Great Score
-Great Cinematography
-Really good child actors (who have surprisingly been in nothing after this)Things I Do Not Like About This Movie
-The last 20 minutes get a wee cheese
-Lack of character development... nobody changes, except for the father who is just a side character so that doesn't count
-goofy romance
-Rather shallow in meaning
-Pretty Weak ending",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A typical American sci-fi movie!,Film of the events of a group of boys who enjoy filming with super 8. Their aim is to make a film since they love the magic of cinema. At first the train wreck is more scenic than realistic. Both the plot at certain points and the setting are very reminiscent of the Stranger Things series. I think the creators of the TV series were also inspired by this film. This is a film that is also suitable for children to watch. The end didn't convince me much. It's a pleasant film but in some points it could have been developed better. Film that I recommend to lovers of the late 70s and lovers of stories about a group of friends.

One of the great ones,"In 1979, in the fictional town of Lillian, Ohio, a preteen boy named Joe Lamb is trying to cope with the recent death of his mother, who was killed in a factory accident. Much to the frustration of his father, the town's deputy sheriff, Joe copes by immersing himself in a project lead by his best friend, Charles. That project is a horror film, shot on a SUPER 8 camera, and Charles has enlisted the help of not only Joe, but the rest of his misfit friends, and has surprised everyone by talking Alice Dainard, the prettiest girl in school, into playing the hero's wife. On the night of the first big shoot, the would be filmmaker witness a train crash. Pretty soon, the town of Lillian is swarmed by military men, who won't tell anybody what is going on. Abrams and Spielberg may be the only two people in Hollywood who still know how to keep a secret, so I won't spoil that by going into the plot too much further. But I will say that Super 8 lives up to every bit of hype and expectation surrounding it. This is a beautifully crafted, emotional, funny, scary, thrilling movie that enthralls an audience the ways Spielberg's 80s classics did. And this is coming from someone who has been accused of ""worshipping"" Spielberg. Abrams has recreated the look and feel of vintage Spielberg expertly, down to the last detail. For a Spielberg fan, it's an absolute joy to behold.But Abrams somehow manages to do this without completely sacrificing his own unique voice as a filmmaker. It's got the twists and turns of Lost, the personality of his Star Trek, and, like most Abrams projects, a leading lady who propels the whole thing. In this case, it's young Elle Fanning, who, as Alice, projects such a genuine combination of childlike innocence and ahead of her years maturity, that you can't take her eyes off of her whenever she's on screen. The entire cast is terrific, especially Joel Courtney as Joe, and Riley Griffiths as Charles, but Fanning steals the movie. We become completely involved with these characters in a way we rarely do with adult Hollywood heroes. I found myself caring every bit as much about the budding romance between Alice and Joe as I did the more spectacular events of the film.And it is spectacular. Abrams and Spielberg give us action/suspense scenes that evoke Spielberg's classics Jaws, Jurassic Park, and E.T. They also come as close to the emotion of E.T. as any film of this type has done since then. Super 8 is the kind of film for which the cliché ""You''ll laugh, you'll cry"" was invented. If you're a child of the 80s and complain that they don't make movies the way they did when you were a kid, well, Abrams and Spielberg have done exactly that.And Michael Giacchino further establishes himself as one of the best film composers to come along in years. His score soars with emotions and build suspense in the vein of (of course) John Williams.I also have to take a moment, as former amateur child filmmaker, to talk about how well rendered that aspect of the story is. It certainly added an extra level of enjoyment for me that I vividly remember the days of trying to make my own blockbusters with nothing but a camera, a few friends, and wildly overactive imagination.It's worth mentioning, by way of warning (especially to parents) that Super 8 is rated PG-13 for a reason, namely the intensity, and for an E.T./Goonies like tendency to have the kids swear. Most audiences will get past this, but certainly some will not, and I'm absolving myself of any complaints.Movies like this are the reason I love movies. In an age when trailers give away everything, Super 8 unfolds before us, capturing us in its spell, and never letting go. It's an unforgettable movie experience. A film to be treasured,",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Prometheus Bound,"Abrams has proved to be a talented cameraman. I don't mean this in a condescending manner, at least not entirely. But that's all there is with him, shape and contour. He's yet to situate himself within a worldview - so he borrows from where it is convenient to fit into. Here it's Spielberg - his world of wondrous discovery, magical escapade into comfortable menace, but where everything is wistfully made right again.So you probably know by now how this is a pastiche built from other stuff; Close Encounters, The Host, The Goonies. The point-of-view is from the children (who are, perhaps, the only characters worth watching), the monster stalking the perimeters. The military is the faceless inhuman machine of cruel intentions.What Abrams does is perfectly in tune with post-modernist ideas. But whereas the Coens appropriate raw essentials and even whole chunks of preconceived world but build from them their own notion of a universe, Abrams is merely an itinerant garbage collector.It's all so derivative, so uniformly processed, it makes me wonder why anyone would take time out of their lives to make it - assuming one has creative aspirations about the art. Is Close Encounters really that old? So, like the myth of Prometheus; some artists risk to steal the fire that will renew our lives, a dangerous fire, others merely spend their time bound in the confines of earlier discovery.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Enjoyable but in the end nothing special,"A friend won two tickets to an advanced screening of this movie last night - so this review is done from the perspective of having watched it for free. :)There are a lot of great things about this movie: The special effects are excellent without being gratuitous. In other words, the special effects enhance the story as opposed to BEING the story. The child actors do a great job of having their own personalities and really portraying the fun that kids have at that age. It does a good job of not making the adults out to be idiots (as so many movies do with child actors) but at the same time the adults have their own weaknesses. I felt connected to all the characters internal struggles. There is a good amount of tension throughout the first half of the movie, including several scenes that make you ""jump"". There are also several scenes that made me laugh so despite the tension, it never felt heavy.The bad: The ending was disappointingly predictable. There were a couple moments of, ""There is no way a middle school kid would do that.""In the end, I was glad to watch the movie but I don't think I'll be seeing it again. If you're looking for a good popcorn movie with a decent story, this is it.

The first time I watched this movie I was the same age as the kids, I didn't like it with nothing driving forward the plot apart from the film. Now I understand that it's just the filmmakers remaking their childhoods, not for their earlier selves but for the present day versions.

"Fun, if familiar","Entertaining if derivative Steven Spielberg homage (ironically produced by Spielberg himself), this is smarter than most modern summer action movies by a long shot, with some amazing special effects, some fun shocks, and good performances from a brace of young actors.What it doesn't have is a lot of originality, being sort of a mash up of E.T. and Close Encounters with a few bits of The Goonies and old monster movies thrown in.It does remind us of how good those stories were, and that there's no reason you can't make a teenage friendly action adventure with smarts. It was fun and fast paced, but after the smashing (literally) opening I was hoping for more than a warm hearted, well made re-tread of films gone by.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Before ""Stranger Things,"" J.J. Abrams did his own 80s/Spielberg love letter","Before ""Stranger Things"" was ever a thing, J.J. Abrams did his own love letter to early Steven Spielberg, a nostalgic and spot-on homage to films such as ""E.T.,"" ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" or ""Poltergeist."" Sure Tobe Hooper directed the last one, but Spielberg produced and left his mark all over it and the horror elements of that film are embraced in ""Super 8"". Spielberg also produced ""Super 8"" and it contains many early Spieberg-ian hallmarks; childhood innocence, broken families, government conspiracies, the sense of wonder and faith, parent-child relationships, etc. Set in the summer of 1979, a group of middle school boys and one girl are filming their super 8 zombie movie when they unexpectedly film a train crash transporting a secret cargo. To reveal more would spoil the plot, but the plot isn't what make ""Super 8"" memorable. Just like the best Spielberg films, it's the characters and their relationships that have endeared those film to us and made them classics. ""Poltergeist"" is a perfect example of this. The plot is a fairly straightforward haunted house story that is basically a riff on ""The Twilight Zone"" episode ""Little Girl Lost,"" but the believability of the characters and the realistic portrait of a typical suburban family connect the audience so much more to the plot (and the scares) than would a similar haunted house story with lesser defined of characters. Even strong haunted house films like ""The Entity"" or ""House by the Cemetery"" are nowhere as immediately identifiable to audiences as the family depicted in ""Poltergeist,"" which has the impact of making the scares all the more scary. ""Super 8"" manages to capture that same type of middle America feel, but does so steeped in nostalgia, in very much the same way the Duffer Brothers have done with ""Stranger Things."" Now despite the well drawn characters and the warm nostalgia the film generates, the story about the mysterious cargo on the train and the kids investigation is nowhere as interesting or compelling as Spielberg's best films. ""Super 8"" is probably on the same level as ""Explorers"" when it comes to story, which isn't bad, but the plot is just not up to ET or Close Encounters levels of greatness. Back to the film's strengths, it boasts a strong cast of unknown child actors, with the exception of Elle Fanning who I think at the time was more famous because of her sister, Dakota. The always reliable Kyle Chandler is also a standout as a deputy sheriff looking into the train crash against his superior's wishes and who's also the father of the main boy of the group, both who are grieving the recent loss of the boy's mother. Also of note is a fine score by composer Michael Giacchino, which manages to be nicely evocative of the John Williams/Jerry Goldsmith type of scores that frequently accompanied Spielberg films of this era. Overall, J.J. Abrams does a terrific job of capturing the innocence and wonder of early Steven Spielberg, which is a real treat for anyone who grew up watching these film.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great - Good - Average - Poor wrt progress of movie,"It was a highly anticipated movie so watched it with much expectations. Movie started off quite well and I really got interested. Reminding me of Goonies it gathered my attention. As the movie progresses things go pretty well. An environment is created that something is gonna happen. But when it happens its not much of a surprise, the movie falls down then to the category of average. In short it's good for most of the former part but the latter has spoiled it. The problem is with script which do not cooperate with the theme well at the end. Its one of the same old formula used several time in movies like Goonies, ET, Close Encounters etc. The acts are pretty fine by everyone. CG work is nice. There are few good sudden scenes to stir you which serves well. Now I feel that surely when you see it you will find that you were not actually expecting the movie to turn out so bad reaching the end with stupid script. Anyways, this will serve as a nice flick overall and entertaining as well but don't keep high expectations or you may regret.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Very good film, final act not so much","Super 8 was one of the movies I was looking forward to all year and while it was slight disappointing I enjoyed it immensely. Super 8 looks absolutely great, with superb effects and cinematography. The score also fits well with the movie without feeling too generic, it is tautly directed by Abrams and the script and characters are engaging with the feel of a Spielberg film which made Super 8 somewhat nostalgic in a sense. The story, making the most of an intriguing concept, does have heart and poignancy and also quite intense, while the acting particularly from Elle Fanning is very impressive. Also, the train crash set piece is simply spectacular. If there is a let down though, it is the final act, which feels like a different movie altogether. The looser it gets, the less tense and more heavy handed it gets, and that's a shame because the rest of Super 8 was excellent. Overall, started off excellent but meandered making the final result just very good. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Enjoyable sci-fi thriller with the Spielberg touch,"A group of kids are making a movie for a school contest and witness a massive train wreck (actually they are in the middle of it). This isn't any train, but a US Air Force train carrying sensitive materials. Strange things start happening in town, engines disappearing from cars, dogs vanishing and a massive electrical outage. The kids start their own investigation and things get crazier and crazier. The acting by these group of kids is outstanding and the CGI effects excellent. Yes, there are some plot holes, but so what?

Bad movie,"First time I've seen a movie with this much rate and it's so bad, it's literally comedy and no mystery at all.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A film with an identity crisis,"I saw this film at a screening tonight, and I must say it's the most disjointed film I've seen so far this year.First off, I have no complaints about the actors. In fact, the actors kind of reminded me of what Goonies could possibly look like in the 21st century. Okay, the actors are fine. So far, so good.The movie goes off the rails midway through it; precisely when the alien storyline comes to the fore. While this particular storyline isn't that bad initially, it wears out its welcome in a hurry, especially when it all comes together. I don't think I'm spoiling much by saying that there isn't much to it.Quite frankly, I think that Abrams' love of Spielberg's previous films has prevented him from actually making this his own film. It could also be because Spielberg produced the film, meaning it would require his stamp of approval in order for the movie to be released. A shame really, because if Abrams did it his way, he would have made a better movie than 'Cloverfield'.Don't expect to have the same wonderment that you get from Spielberg films, however. You can tell those moments were merely tacked-on to fit the 'Spielberg' mould. Anyone who's seen the early 80's Spielberg movies knows what I'm talking about.So, with all that being said, what are we left with? The closest analogy would be a chocolate bar with layered and soft caramel on the outside, but a rough, hard to chew toffee middle. As good as the caramel is, the toffee sure makes it hard to swallow.Wait for it on Netflix or your local video store. You'll thank me later.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Simply an AMAZING STORY!,"Swift shot: If you see this one in theaters, count yourself enlightened, if you wait to rent or own Blu Ray, consider yourself miserable. Because, trust me, if you wait til you are home to see this for the first time, unless you are exceptionally wealthy and have a veritable theater sized screen at home – - – you are going to be kicking yourself forever! Occasionally, every few decades or so, a film comes along that just fires on all cylinders and resonates with something inside you that hasn't been active since you were a kid. Super 8 manages to do just that, stir up imaginations I once thought completely dormant – where the critical, cynical adult in me keeps the child bolted up in a dungeon called ""the impossible"". I want to thank EVERYONE who made this film a reality, and I wonder if Paramount knows just how fortunate they are to have some of the best film-makers to ever hold that title on their label? Set in 1979 in a steel town in Ohio, Super 8 essentially is a story about a group of friends, over the summer, dealing with a tragedy that one of them endures at the onset of the film. It has the feel of a Stand By Me script, though devoid of any narration or device that tells the story in the present. This film, again, is just an Amazing Story with a supernatural, monster-thriller, or sci-fi element tossed in to keep the characters constantly malleable and interesting.With great tragedy comes the need for great distraction, and Writer/Director J. J. Abrams gets this, and displays this, quite efficiently. Rather than let their friend, Joe (Joel Courtney) dwell on his personal loss, his gang of misfits, led by Charles (Riley Griffiths) – who thinks he is the next Hitchcock or Romero – comes up with a perfect distraction . . . a zombie film. At first some of the others think it a bit tacky to involve a kid who just lost someone close to be shooting a zombie flick, but they figure it might help him take his mind off of the loss as well. Not to mention, the girl who everyone is afraid to talk to, Alice Dainard (Elle Fanning) has agreed to be in the film as zombie hunting detective, Martin's (Gabriel Basso) wife.It all starts off innocently enough, Alice steals her dad's car, without a license (rebels that they are) to drive them to the shoot, EXTERIOR: late at night, a train station, now closed. They run through lines, Charles delights in directing his friends, and he tries to get the most out of what he's working with. His friends are a great team, considering they are in middle-school, and they manage a level of professionalism that exceeds their years. Then, something happens, a crash, about an EIGHT on the butt-pucker scale (patent pending), which really sets the sci-fi or supernatural elements into locomotion.What happens next is all too easy to spoil, suffice it to say, something is not quite right in the steel town of Lilian, Ohio circa 1979. The Air Force, helmed by Colonel Nelec (Noah Emmerich) is somehow involved, Joe's dad, Jackson, the deputy sheriff, played by the exceptionally talented TV-actor (Kyle Chandler) is suddenly put in charge and the misfits find themselves caught in the middle of everything but are still hell-bent on finishing their film to submit to the Cleveland Film Festival . . . ah great aspirations must start somewhere, but Cleveland? Comedy and tragedy is spliced into the story masterfully in short little bursts with character dialog, incredible action sequences and excellent acting. And, someone check me if I am wrong, but did they cryo freeze the blond-haired brat from the 70′s version of The Bad News Bears and place braces on him to hide his identity? Because, that kid Cary (Ryan Lee) in Super 8 is his clone! Super 8 is a high-tech drama with a childish heart that reminds you what it was like to build models, pine for the prettiest girl in school, and to never stop fighting for those you love. It is a film about loss, grief, struggling to cope and acceptance, all with a ""twist"" just to make things more interesting . . . or rather, AMAZING!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Mostly fun, mostly absurd, partly great theatrics, suburban dystopia redefined","Super 8 (2011)Oh dear, I guess Stephen Spielberg knows what might make money, and he produced this movie without taking a huge risk. And writer/director J.J. Abrams buys into the extravaganza of the Spielberg kind of sci-fi story, with suburban America on the fringe of something big and otherworldly. It could have worked even with the endlessly overworked clichés, with better writing and better direction. Yes, that would be you, Mr. Abrams.It helps to know going in that this is a teen movie, and teen viewers will get a lot more out of it because the main crew of actors are all high schoolers, and convincing ones. In fact, the strength of the whole thing depends on these kids, who are a great ensemble, smart and immature in turns and in unexpected gaffes and laughs. It's almost fun enough watching them to get through the rest.But there is the rest, which is combination E.T. (quite literally, an alien wanting to go home) and the ""Andromeda Strain"" (where the military rushes in to face an extraterrestrial force, revisited recently in ""The Crazies"" in 2010). The highlight for me was the last part, where a nostalgically sweet small town suburbia goes into a colorful apocalypse. Never mind the improbability of the plot, the super spaceship, the monster with unreasonable (and not quite explained) powers, or even the history of such a thing going undetected until now, surviving surely on something besides nuts and berries.In a very fun twist, there is at first a movie within a movie, where our high schoolers are making their own short and entertaining movie. That's where the title comes in (the time seems to be roughly 1975, before video). The train crash at the beginning is so excessive (it goes on forever, with enough burning and screeching for several movies) you know that something is amiss. And not just in the scene (this is no ordinary train) but in the direction (there is a woeful lack of balance). Pauses happen when there isn't time, and things are frenetic when a little pacing might have added more suspense and less kinetic frenzy.This might all make it sound like a disaster of a movie rather than a disaster movie, but it's somewhere between. If you fit the demographic, it might work. If you don't mind sitting through some ludicrous moments for the much better ones, it does work (this would be me, Mr. Abrams). And if you like seriously inventive sci-fi disaster flicks, this won't quite cut it.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Outstanding film, great time","Here's how I feel about it in one sweeping oversimplification: If you love movies, you're going to love this movie. That is of course unless you've grown cynical and bitter and can no longer tolerate genre-entertainment.It has everything I want in a movie. Adventure, action, suspense, humor, and relatable characters who experience things the way humans do. Sure, there were a couple moments at the end where I thought, ""Really?"", but Abrams and the gang were savvy enough to put almost every objection my overly-rational grown-up mind had throughout the picture and put skeptical words into the mouth of a nearby character, thereby stealing my ammunition.I don't think you need to love movies in order to enjoy this ride, but if you love movies or, especially, if you've ever made one of your own, I don't see how you could dislike it.Plus all the sci-fi-ish stuff was badass.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"This movie is the inspiration of ""Stranger Things""","First of all, when I first watched the official teaser of the movie I really liked it and I had high expectations about it. Eventually, it was as good as I had imagined and I really enjoyed it. The plot of the movie was very interesting, mysterious and kinda innovative. The storyline was very well written, well-explained and easy to understand. The characters were very interesting, well-developed and really likeable, especially the group of friends. The filming location of the movie was nice, just a small town in America. Also, the casting was nice and their performance was descent. I have to admit, it was a very intense movie, action-filled and full of epic scenes. In my opinion, the train crash scene and the ending were probably the BEST parts of the movie. Especially, the ending scene was brilliant, definitely unpredictable and kinda emotional. Moreover, it wasn't a very scary movie, even though there were some unpredictable jumpscares. By the way, the cinematography and the score of the movie were both amazing. Overall, ""Super 8"" was an enjoyable sci-fi film, adventurous and I would definitely recommend it to my friends! Last but not least, that movie definitely deserved a sequel, even though they're not planning to make one.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Familiarity bred contempt.,"Being a fan of Steven Spielberg's 70's films like Jaws and Close Encounters makes me a pretty hard to please fan of the blockbuster. So when JJ Abrams comes along with his clever marketing schemes and pitches a new film that looks and sounds like one of Stevens early ones, my defences are cautiously lowered. Unwise of me. I found Super 8 to be forced and tiresome. Those of us who rode the crazy wave of the first blockbusters in the late 70's and early 80's know exactly how they felt and don't need some jumped up Spielberg wannabe regurgitating them up. That's exactly what JJ tries, but somehow it comes off as being the same, but not as good. Just like McG did with Terminator Salavation. Film makers inspired by other great film makers trying their hardest to replicate the work. It's kind of the ultimate tribute, but it's also just a little bit boring for those of us wanting to feel like were being taken on an adventure, not being reminded constantly of better films.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Good,Super 8 is nice movie with awesome cinematography and superb editing and a very interesting story which centers group of children in 1979 who are filming and something very unexpected happens. Super 8 might be the best summer movie of 2011 but who knows there are many other titles coming which of course I have not seen. JJ Abrams sure is a nice director. The suspense of the movie is extreme at some points and the sound effects make it even intense.Performance by the entire cast is OK and the script/dialogue/story is pretty genuine and the movie looks like very REAL and you are compelled to believe it.Cinematography is another very positive point of the movie and the scenes really take you 30 years back.Original Score is nice too.IMO the movie will enjoy excellent critic/public/award response this year. and business will be good as well.9/10.,7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
No New Ground; But Well Done!,"I know that little new material was presented in this film. We have become so jaded with all the special effects available. If the computer people get a little carried away, it soon begins to detract from the central flow of the plot. This is why foreign films are, for the most part, better than American films. When you don't have the bells and whistles available, you have to actually tell a good ""story."" This movie, however, is a cut above most of the others of its ilk because I really did begin to care about the characters. Also, having been a middle-school teacher for forty years, I found the goofiness and charm of the kids to be pretty believable. Granted, the deck is stacked because they all have issues. Not every quartet of young people automatically includes four levels of dysfunction. Still, the actors are out of the ET mode, in that they seem to act in a somewhat real way, considering the circumstances. I agree, however, that the military is up to no good and that is old hat. Also, why are the aliens so typically reptilian. I wish the creators could come up with something new. Finally, the first two-thirds are really captivating but the final third can't maintain it. It's still worth the time.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A wildly nostalgic and truly spectacular must-see event,"As the marketing and hype started to build for Super 8, I decided to try my best to not watch any real trailers or promos for the film. It was a difficult task, but somehow I managed to pull off allowing the film to be a mystery leading into its release. When I got the opportunity to see the film in advance fell into my lap, I did not second guess the hype – I ran to the theatre as fast as I could.Taking place in the summer of 1979, Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney) is part of an atypical group of friends making a film to enter into a local film festival. While shooting on a train platform late one night, the group witnesses a horrific train crash. They survive the mysterious crash, and do not think much of it. But then strange things begin happening in the town, and the US military suddenly shows up to clean up the damage, not to mention some bizarre things are being recovered from the crash.I already feel like I have said too much regarding about Super 8, but my enthusiasm for this ridiculously well done film is too hard to contain. Abrams, alongside producer and obvious inspiration Steven Spielberg, has crafted something both special and truly extraordinary. What is on the outside a very keenly and nostalgically made film about the loss of innocence and the wonder of personal discovery, is also a period picture examining a time when the slightest enigmatic occurrence could lead to an accusation of Soviet invasion. Many will instantly equate the film to the early work of Spielberg himself (not only because of the various homages), but this is a film that was never meant to draw such easy comparisons.With Super 8, Abrams has matured into a great filmmaker who is very quickly on their way to becoming a master of the craft. He tenderly embraces the format of a monster movie and the hard lessons behind growing up (not unlike Joe Cornish's significantly grittier Attack the Block), and never lets either get too far ahead of itself. While it can be thrilling and fused with electric intensity, it can also be very tender and moving. We know the focus is on these adorable, wide-eyed kids, but Abrams invests enough time into the adult characters like Kyle Chandler's Deputy Jackson Lamb and Louis Dainard, played by the obscenely underrated Ron Eldard as well. By doing this, he allows the audience to follow in the wonder of the children's vague cluelessness of the hell that is going on around them, and the adults trying to unravel the mystery. He also lets the script speak for itself, directing the increasing action brilliantly and allowing the actors to truly become the characters they are playing. I just hope he quickly realizes his stylish use of lens flare is beginning to border a little too close to overbearing.Acting wise, the film fires on all cylinders. Chandler and Eldard are excellent in their fatherly roles, as is Noah Emmerich's absolutely despicable Nelec. But the show is completely stolen far and away by the children. This is really their movie, and they shine in each of their scenes. Casting relative unknowns in the majority of these roles, not least Courtney in the lead, helps give an enhanced sense of authenticity and fascination. The looks of fear, confusion, sadness and fun are real in the most flattering way possible. There is not one instance where any of these kids look like they are acting against a green-screen, or acting on a set. They act like seasoned veterans, and will surprise you consistently from the opening frame right until the end of the credits. Special mention also goes to Elle Fanning, who is rapidly proving to be a formidable talent who might be even stronger than her famous sister Dakota.While I will not give away too many specific details, I can say the special effects should already be considered an early front runner for the best of the year. The train crash sequence involves some of the most incredibly and intensely depicted images of destruction I have ever seen. You will be on the edge of your seat unable to look away from just how amazingly realistic it all looks. With Super 8, the visual effects are taken to the extreme, and look absolutely astounding every time they are employed. Without ruining anything else, I can safely say you will be both terrified and awestruck by just how much effort was put into making these effects look so realistic.If I hold anything against the film, it is the finale. The film is brilliantly paced and the tone is never taken for granted, but it just comes off a bit odd when compared to the rest of the film. It is not as disappointing as some may have you believe, but it was a bit too soft and cuddly for my liking – a little bit too close to what Spielberg would have done. We know the film is a nostalgic homage to those films that so many of us remember watching on weekends as kids, but the ending just does not jive as well as it could have. It feels like Abrams just did not want to commit to anything darker, and just went with the safest route he could think of.If you are still reading this review and can see Super 8 now, than you have made a big mistake. With only his third film, Abrams has made a truly spectacular must-see film that demands to be seen as quickly as possible. Allowing some of the surprises to be spoiled is simply not an option. This is the best film of the summer thus far, and will be remembered well into the end of the year.9/10.(An extended review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Close encounters of the third kind / E.T,"Not every day world is given sci-fi film and not every time its that good. Unfortunately like 99% of films that comes from Hollywood its deeply flawed however in comparison to certain robo trilogy this is a masterpiece (brainless teenagers that concentrated mainly in one country probably wont agree :P ). This film is a mix of 2 sci-fi classics that were given to us by mr Spielberg. I'm talking about E.T and Close Encounters of the third kind. Like in et we have brave, pure hearted teenagers who against all odds in their stupidity are also only smart and righteous people in town. Like in Close encounters we have evil military that just wont share info with good people of US and mystery which is obvious from the beginning but for things to unveil completely we have to first bite off our nails for an hour. This is actually good think because don't know how about you but I'm just sick of the trailers that reveal key-points of the story not to mention films with no mystery. Here informations are given to the audience piece by piece and that is what makes it so damn interesting (for most parts).SPOILER ALERTJust like I mentioned earlier film is flawed. Mainly by so common idiotism. First off all in 1979 US pick-ups were the safest vehicles on earth they could take head on collision with the train and after be in better condition then locomotive. Like that dude couldn't steal some big track and leave it on the tracks and while running he could be struck by a splinter from those big explosions. Necessity for drama won over common sense. That left really bad impression and its full of such moments. After those moments I always wonder either a film maker is that stupid or the audience for which its intended for. Like in most of JJ's films there is cinematography that reveal nothing more then a hand or claw of the monster (Cloverfield all over again but there it was justified with sudo-documental style of the film). This is kind of entertaining at the beginning but after each scene it keeps getting more and more irritating. I don't necessarily consider it as a flaw more like going a little bit over the top.SPOILERS - THE ENDWhen it comes to acting... Lets just say its not bad. Joel is quite credible in his role. However his complete lack of fear is in my opinion a little bit disappointing. Unfortunately this is how JJ probably imagined that character. I mus mention Elle Fanning's role, she was outstanding in comparison to the rest of cast and I hope she can give even better performances in the future.CGI is very good especially derail of a train (in a clash with fearsome pickup. Monsters snout is also very lovely.In conclusion I must recommend it to all of you who liked any of Spielbergs sci-fi films. And its a must see for those who grew up on his work. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Pretty Good,"A group of kids start to make a movie with a Super 8 camera by railroad tracks when they witness a huge train derailment. In time they come to realize it was no accident.This is basically a kids movie with some language: S-words and one F-bomb. Not good. The director was good in making an almost Disney movie with kids (the way they used to), but the language? Why? Why? Why? Other than that mis-step, this was pretty good.However, if you are a Kyle Chandler fan, and I am, this is not his movie. The movie belongs to Elle Fanning as Alice and to Joel Courtney as Joe Lamb and the other kids who all performed well. Chandler is Jackson Lamb the town's deputy and he was excellent. He was at wits end trying to figure out what was happening in the town with people, dogs, power lines, car engines and microwaves disappearing; and he could get no answers from the military who had taken over the town.Elle Fanning is becoming a major force in movies. Look out Dakota.The CGI, cinematography and dialogues were all good. That train derailment was spectacular.Near the end of the movie there was a bit of a continuity problem. The kids are in the underground cave and trying to get out, and the next scene has them on the main street of the town watching a space ship being built by the alien. Oh, you didn't know an alien was involved? Now you do. Not a big mystery here and you will have figured that out early on anyway.

Celebration of E.T. and Close Encounters comes with mixture of humor and horror that works brilliantly.,"Review Score: 8.5 – Go see it.Super 8 is the story of a young group of kids who are trying to make a zombie movie in the summer of 1979. They're filming when they witness a terrible train wreck that causes their small town to become the hot spot of an Air Force Military Investigation. It quickly becomes clear that the military is attempting to keep something secret from everyone else and when people and mechanical items from around town begin disappearing things get even more hectic.First off, if you couldn't tell by the trailers, Super 8 is a celebration of old school films Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) and E.T. (1980) and mixes it with J.J. Abrams' two big secret dangerous monster staying off camera until further and further into the movie, a la Cloverfield (2008) and Lost (2004). This ultimately makes for a unique blend of sad child hood misfortune and scary dodgy monster movie tactics, which is a great mixture and works very well.While I have a few quips with the movie, there is nothing particularly negative to say. The movie has brilliant development and revolves around a central theme of loss. The pacing seems appropriate and nothing seems terribly out of place. It does seem to have a love of needless explosions, though this seems more like a tactic to draw in the less enthusiastic action blockbuster crowd to see a movie that is ultimately more mystery and drama than action and explosions.Which brings me to my one major quip, the train wreck scene and some of the plot developments around it (a stolen car that would at least be a bit dirty after a thousand explosions go off around it) seem to be ignored for the sake of letting the children get away with it. A few other plot points never seem to pan out, and really just seems like the director wasn't entirely sure they could control the plot lines (like say the children being arrested by the Air Force). Also the ending is unfortunately thin and easy to see coming.But, as I said, any quips I have are minor. Another great thing is that its filled with quite a bit of humor, particularly the character and relationship of all the children making the film together blends together perfect and none are left without real character development by the end of the movie.Great movie, catch it when you can.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Good Hollywood entertainment, but obviously not much more to offer.","One of the reasons i watched this movie was that, initially, remind me at those 80's movies like E.T., Poltergeist, Explorers, etc.The movie takes place in 1979 and has that characteristic aesthetics of that time.From the beginning, the movie is interesting and is made with the right pace. It has been created unstable family situations, in order to reinforce the drama. Anyway, for now, the movie works and keeps you guessing.In the end, ""Hollywood effect"" came swiftly with the typical military deployment, probably unnecessary. From there, the movie begins to lose its strength.As popcorn movie deserves note, but it belongs to a genre where quality cinema is not common.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
when J.J. Abrams and Steven Spielberg met,"I sat to watch Super 8 with the expectation of seeing the science-fiction / fantasy film of the year. The director is after all J.J. Abrams, the director of the last Star Trek and the producer of my previous favorite science-fiction series Lost and of my current favorite Fringe. No other than Steven Spielberg is the producer and rumors have that he had quite an active part in this production. And yet I was disappointed.Super 8 has a very spielbergian look, colors and cinematography-like. It is set in 1979, at the same period when Spielberg's great science-fiction films were made. Kids are in the center of the action, and Spielberg likes and knows to make movies and maybe understands better kids than women for example. The first 15-20 minutes when we get to know the heroes are pure fun, as a gang of kids get together to make a film, kind of an homage to the films noirs of the 40s - all is fine as in a good Spielberg film. But, hey, wait a moment, this is a J.J. Abrams film, isn't it? And actually trouble starts exactly when the aliens and the rest of the grown-ups world interfere. I mean trouble for the heroes, but also or merely for the film.Here is the problem of this film as I see it. There are too many Spielberg ideas here, and too little of J.J. Abrams. It looks like the master threw a basket of ideas, many ideas, good ideas, and the apprentice did not really succeed in putting them together in a convincing one story line. There are too many quotes in this film, from Humphrey Bogart passing through the special effects a la 50s and reaching to E.T. Many pieces of magic, a few scenes to remember, but here I am a few weeks after I saw the film and I cannot remember well the story line, which means that it did not really matter. Many people will like the film, and I also liked the passion for cinema and for alien encounters, but the overall impression is of a collection of beautiful scenes wrapped in a conventional and unconvincing story. A miss, maybe a miss to remember, but still a miss.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Clichéd encounters of the Spielberg kind,"The old cliché that every story has already been told seems as pertinent as ever in Hollywood. A quick glance at the forthcoming releases reveals a bevy of rehashes, from Sherlock Holmes 2 to the upcoming Footloose remake. But Super 8 is different. It doesn't simply try to rehash; no, it attempts to reinvent the Spielberg formula for a new generation. Yet despite incorporating all the elements which made Spielberg's early movies so great, Super 8's endless references to these classics of family cinema only underlines its inability to measure up.Written and directed by JJ Abrams, Super 8 tells the story of 13-year- old Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney) who, while helping his best friend Charles (Riley Griffiths) make a zombie flick on Super 8 millimeter film, witnesses a train crash which both releases a mysterious monster from one of the carriages and launches Joe into a classically Spielbergian adventure. Over its 112 minutes Joe strives to woo the girl of his dreams (Elle Fanning), discover the secret of the train's cargo and, when he has the time, help finish Charles's movie.In the past few years the name Steven Spielberg seems only ever to appear after the words 'Executive Producer', as if nowadays he's little more than a rubber stamp. However, in a film paying such obvious homage to Spielberg, his presence on the production staff is more than token. Spielberg's involvement serves as a validation of Super 8's blatant plagiarism. Because plagiarism is what it is. Everything, from the smalltown US setting to the BMXs Joe and his friends race around on, harks back to Spielberg's action-adventure opuses Close Encounters of the Third Kind and ET the Extra-Terrestrial.Spielberg's stamp of approval also gives Abrams the space to employ this mode of film-within-a-film storytelling, denoted by the title, in a way that is unabashedly self-aware. There is absolutely nothing here which we haven't seen before, and Abrams knows it. Even Joe's tousled, mousey- brown mop makes him a dead ringer for Elliott, ET's 10-year-old protagonist. Yet it is these knowing nods to Abram's influences which allow the viewer to see past Super 8's lack of originality and enjoy it for what it is: a vehicle to relive those bygone moments of movie magic.The boys' persistence in making their film, despite the deaths and disappearances all around them, draws a smile even after the most fearsome set pieces. Only 24 hours after they narrowly escaped death at the train station, Charles and his crew rush, monster make-up in hand, back to the crash sight, hoping that the backdrop will give the film the 'production values' Charles is seeking.Moments like this indicate that this is a film not to be taken too seriously. Yet tongue-in-cheek nostalgia is not enough to sustain the entire movie, as becomes painfully clear halfway through. Then, with more and more townsfolk having disappeared, the zombie film is postponed and, with it, the loving homage ceases. From there on in, the plot descends into one all-too-familiar setpiece after another. And the moment Super 8 begins to take its own story seriously, it becomes the very thing it was trying to escape: being merely derivative.It doesn't help that while the setpieces are big and visually stunning, the pastiche which opens the film creates a barrier between the viewer and the action. The sense that it is all one big in-joke, full of film- buff allusions and references, makes it hard to really care about the fate of Joe and his friends. So although Super 8 is well acted and has decent dialogue, you find it hard to believe in either young Joel Courtney or Elle Fanning when, at the back of your mind, you know that they are not so much characters as ironic nods to a filmmaking past.The regurgitative approach to filmmaking Hollywood that has employed for the past few decades has left a creative vacuum. Whereas the likes of Close Encounters and ET made mainstream film an artistic medium, they seemed to prepare the way for a long chain of bad remakes. These attempts at giving the audience more of what they want has only left us pining for those old movies all the more. Super 8 may be a trip down memory lane, but it still struggles with this vicious cycle: it delights because of what it reminds us of, but fails to tell its own story.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

That simply means it's very, very good. Almost perfect. This is how movies should be done in all aspects. All the technical parts are flawless, but that's only a base of the movie, underlining it. It has everything it should have: emotions, suspense, storyline, a bit of predictability (of course :), and two happy endings. Why two? Remember to watch this movie all the way, even through the ending credits, and you'll see. And they say: never work on a movie with animals or children. Nonsense.

J.J. does a bit of Goonies and Close Encounters,"It's 1979 Lillian, Ohio. Joel loses his mother in a steel mill accident. His father Jack Lamb (Kyle Chandler) is a deputy sheriff. His friends want to make a zombie movie for the summer. They get Alice Dainard (Elle Fanning) to be the romantic lead. Alice is not happy to be driving without a license with the deputy's son as the sound man. They are filming by the railroad when a train derails. They promise Alice to keep it a secret from her troubled father (Ron Eldard). The train turns out to be a secret military transport. While the kids continue their filming, the Air Force does the cleanup but strange things keep happening.J.J. Abrams has made a good film. He's using a lot of that lens flare that he loves so much, but the train crash looks good. The kids' acting is paramount to this and they do an acceptable job. It would be nice if they had a bigger presence. Elle Fanning is like a giant to these kids. I didn't mind that as much as her monotone voice. It's a minor distraction. Other than Elle, none of the kids have a big enough presence. Maybe they're too normal or too new. There is good and bad about that. This has both the innocence of an earlier times and the tension of a creepy sci-fi thriller. It strikes different cords. It's a bit of Goonies and a bit of Close Encounters.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Lack of foreshadowing leads to a film with nothing more than interchangeable conflict and twists.,"In the late '70s, a group of kids witness a bizarre train crash while recording an amateur zombie movie; the event is captured on a Super 8 mm film. Other strange events follow the crash, and the group of kids set out to find the answers. Terrific small-town '70s setting and wonderfully driven dialogue that meshes surprisingly well with the large amount of action. However, aside from the annoyance of dragging on way too long, the most fatal flaw of this thriller is the lack of foreshadowing. When a story builds its suspense on twist after twist like it's a game of Jenga, rather than strategizing a complex conflict to bring everything full circle, really does a film injustice. Disappointingly two-dimensional with numerous disposable elements—why is an important character like Dr. Woodward (Turman) introduced during the first plot point without any development?**½ (out of four)",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Excellent storytelling. It's the kind of movie Spielberg would make in the 80's.,"I like this movie. I really do, honest. Most of the blockbusters are mostly solid while most of the others are ho-hum. However, J.J. Abrams has performed a summer movie miracle. In the process of creating a homage of Steven Spielberg movies, he has crafted an extremely entertaining film that has a heart as big as its thrills.I won't describe the juiciest bits of the story here, since they'll spoil the public. All I can tell you is that it's about kids making a movie using their Super 8 camera, something mysterious happen, strange things start to happen. Having said that, the screenplay is well written, most notably the dialog by the children which is funny, witty and engaging. I especially admire the children's attention to detail - like finding production value for their movie. The way they make their own little movie is a touching, heartfelt ode to the filmmakers who also started out that way. Makes anyone, young or old, want to make their own movies again if they haven't already.It's an amazing feat when all of the child actors perform especially well in their roles, and actually make you care about them, and bring you into their adventure. I really hope all child actors will get good, promising careers in the future. In addition, it's nice to see Kyle Chandler on the big screen again.Abrams pulled it off here, not only in writing the screenplay but directing the movie as well with care and focus. He has direction that would make Spielberg proud. Of course, with Spielberg himself producing the film it's no surprise that the entire film feels like a genuine Spielberg movie, the kind of adventure movie that he would make before ""Schindler's List"" changed him into a bona-fide serious filmmaker (not that that's a bad thing). We've come a long way since adventure films like ""E.T."" and ""The Goonies"", but Spielberg and Abrams prove that old school works, and works well. The well-rendered CGI and some spectacular action sequences are actually overshadowed by the mystery, story and characters, proving once again that eye candy is no match for a big heart and good ol' fashioned storytelling.With good cinematography, production design and a John William-esque score by Michael Giacchino, ""Super 8"" is the best of the blockbusters, maybe for the summer, maybe for 2011 itself (I still patiently await Spielberg's own ""Tintin""). One thing's for sure, in terms of pure entertainment, this is perfect. It has that rare blockbuster movie magic, and I would not be surprised if ""Super 8"" was nominated for Best Picture at next year's Oscars. No, I'm not joking, and I'm certainly not exaggerating.If J.J. Abrams can keep this up, he would be a potential successor to Steven Spielberg. And lastly, stay for the credits.Overall rating: 86/100",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Abrams Honors Spielberg,"Super 8 appears to be J.J. Abrams' way of paying his respects to Steven Spielberg. I was steadily reminded of E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind throughout this film. The community kids are the first to discover the strange things happening around town, are almost always the only witnesses to important events, and repeatedly run into the adults who just don't understand.An article in this week's New York Times magazine describes how a young J.J. Abrams got a job repairing and editing Steven Spielberg's old Super 8 films. That is a great memory to start your new screenplay with. Five pre-teen kids in an out of the way, small Ohio town are making a zombie movie on a Super 8. The boss kid is the director and persistently updating screenwriter. There is also the nervous lead actor, the kid obsessed with explosives who plays the zombie, and our film's main character, the make-up artist who is also adept at model trains and airplanes. While sneaking out at night to work on their movie with a newly recruited girl in their mix, the kids witness a train derailment and so begins the mystery.I will reveal nothing about the train, what was on it, and what happens after that. Would you have wanted the answer to everything about E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind before seeing them? No way. Just know that this is not a movie just for the kids. There are genuinely suspenseful moments, a lot of pre-teen cursing, drug use, some quality horror gore, and an overall tight story. It is very refreshing to see a summer movie which is not a franchise continuing sequel or about a new superhero. These kids are real and there small town adventure mystery is well worth it.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Super 8,"This film is J.J. Abrams' amalgam love letter to producer Spielberg's E.T.: THE EXTRA- TERRESTRIAL (1982) and CLOSE ENCOUNTER OF THE THIRD KIND (1977), and in the meantime, to a great extent to pander to the new youngsters of the technology-era (the juvenile filming crew is awesome!).In order to maintain an orthodox balance between a summer blockbuster family film and an Alien-like horror-fest, the film consummates a relatively shrewd paradigm (a PG-13 rating is well-suited): you will never witness the ugly facade of the monster until the acme moment and it is certainly not scary; no blood will be splattered (the only exception is literally fake blood); no children and animals will be dispatched on the scene, in spite of a seemingly hyper-perilous train-wreckage, while grownups are trashily disposable (under one condition is that as long as there are no actual slaughter shots); the mass-killing is all behind the scene and the sudden seizure tactic has been exerted a dozen of times, which is considered as irksome thanks to a wonderful young cast for their endeavor to make the scene credible.Plot-wise, the film obviously suffers from some plausible expositions, the latter part of the film comparatively passes by hastily, The ""communication with the creature"" and the pinnacle ""magnetic muster"" scenes are too much similar and not original, what's more all is done on the spur of the moment, which bugs me whether J.J's inspiration well has running out of fuel? I'm still anticipating his new Star Trek project next year!But overall, I do enjoy the film quite a lot, first the CGI effects are marvelous even watching on a television screen, and the young cast, I'm name-checking the lead boy Joel Courtney (the boy's eyes can talk!) and another Fanning girl, Elle Fanning (a stunning monodrama presentation in the film and she is only 13 at that time), by far they are the best children performances I have seen for years among mainstream Hollywood films (along with Hit-girl in KICK-ASS 2010).",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Mixed, could have been good but falls flat","Wow, I really, really wanted to like this movie. I had mixed expectations going in. On the one hand, I expected a typical Spielberg style kids vs. monster type flick, on the other, I have been disappointed by Abrams before with Cloverfield.So, for the first three quarters of the movie, I was actually enjoying the ride. At least this time, Abrams managed to make characters that I could care about. I was able to suspend my disbelief and go along in spite of many problems with physics and continuity. As the story went on, the unexplained bits and pieces of the plot began to wear thin.Basically, if you read the negative reviews on here you will see the problems with this film; the complete rehashing of so many Spielberg clichés, multiple goofy continuity problems, and poor plot exposition and so on. I actually could have overlooked most of this for the positives, if it weren't for the particularly flat ending.The rest of the film had enough great production values, character development and a great feeling of an old time 50's monster movie I really was having fun, until it got toward the end. They just couldn't pull all the plot elements together in a satisfying way. Worst yet, the ending fell totally flat. Where there should have been some tension building with a good climactic scene, it just kind of ended, plop, that was it, very unsatisfying.I don't understand the trend with filmmakers like Abrams, Shyamalan and a others these days. There is a tendency to have characters with strong but contrived story lines, where the plot exposition is so minimal and choppy that it is difficult to actually develop an emotional connection with them. Then, it is difficult to tell where some of their motivation comes from. Ultimately, these characters act in ways that seem inappropriate under the circumstances. Anyway, I just tire with this kind of half-ass story telling. These guys need to watch some classic Hitchcock, Lumet, Reiner etc. and get some tips on plot and character development.Bummer, this was so close to being a really good movie, if not great, it just needed better storytelling and a decent ending.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Hype Over Substance... Dull and Predictable,"My major problem with Super 8 is not with the unremarkable cast or with the cheesy attempts at tension. It's not that it's ""slow"" or poorly paced for a summer film. If I had to sum it up with a word, I'd say coldness, maybe carelessness. How about dreary? How can anyone enjoy bad dialogue and poor pacing if they don't care for the characters? The execution was palatable but you simply didn't care about anyone or anything that was going on. This is slasher film quality without the slashing. It's just a poor story and a poor effort by all involved.Without a doubt this film going to be the quintessential ""hype over substance"" film we all reference for years to come. The mystique, marketing and mystery leading up to release was bigger than what we actually see on screen. This overrated film has done nothing but hide behind big names to draw a big opening weekend at the box office. It wanted to be another ""Signs"" type drama but all it delivers is disappointment.Forget ""Signs"" this movie was like combining M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Happening"" and Spielberg's ""War of The Worlds."" Not exactly a winning combination despite the hype. I'll give the creator's of this film a pass because they usually deliver but the sooner we all forget about this mess and J.J. moves on to the Star Trek sequel the better.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Perfectly Spielbergian,"""Super 8"" is a very hyped-up movie. The trailer does not tell us much, just a train crash that a group of middle school kids witness. But truth to tell, the name of Steven Spielberg attached to this project still did a lot to bring the audience in. I was one of them. J.J. Abrams as the director also gives the film some pedigree.""Super 8"" brings us back to the summer of1979. We follow a gang of kids who are finishing a zombie film for a short film competition. While shooting a scene at a train station one midnight, they witness a massive train crash. Following this event, strange goings-on like missing appliances and disappearing pets then people pervade their small town of Lilian, Ohio. Before they know it, the US Air Force comes in and evacuates the whole town. These events are seen in the eyes of these young teens.The central character is Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney). We share his excitement over his shared film project with his friends, where his role is make-up and models. We share his sadness over his mom's death and his alienation from his busy policeman father (Kyle Chandler). We share his puppy love with Alice (a very pretty and mature-looking Elle Fanning). His personal story was intertwined with the terrorization of his town by an unknown menace.This is not really a perfect film. The ending (which I found cheesy, overly sentimental but ultimately senseless, especially that locket scene)could in fact have been done much better. However, it is a perfectly Spielbergian film. We see him in the precocious children who play the lead characters. We see him in the passionate hobby of the kids. We see him in the alien monster. So many elements of 80's Spielberg can be seen in ""Super 8"", now for a new generation of kids to identify with.As the main film faded out, I was thinking they should have shown the film that the kids were working on. Happily, they did! Stay on through the first half of the credits as you see the kids' ouevre, entitled ""The Case.""",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Abrams and Spielberg never say ... Goonies?,"Of course it would be unfair to compare it with Goonies (a true classic). Still the comparisons can be made. But it's only part of the fun. The movie is a mix of two ideas as Abrams has stated himself. He had his idea (kids filming with a Super 8 camera as homage) and mixed it with another idea he found. I won't say what for those who actually haven't heard about it and do not want to spoil their surprise.Having said that, the kid actors (Dakota Fannings sister is in it) are mostly newcomers, with about half of them making their debut in this very film. If you consider this, they are naturals and everyone is very good at what they're doing. Cinematography and effects are great. If you could fault something, it could be the unbalanced story. Is it for kids or maybe more for adults? Still this might be nit-picking, the fact is, that this is a great movie to enjoy",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
This is so Mint!,"Greetings again from the darkness. A nostalgic feeling generated by nostalgic filmmaking at the hands of JJ Abrams and classic Spielberg. Yes, I meant to use nostalgic twice ... the film has a familiar feel to it, but also entirely new twists and effects. That's what happens when the master (Spielberg) and the star pupil (Abrams) unite.Part of the nostalgia is that this is kind of a throwback to the blockbuster era that Spielberg helped create. There are bits and pieces of Jurassic Park, E.T., The Goonies, *Batteries not Included, and Jaws. Spielberg has always had a nice feel for kids and emotions, and in this film the genius of Abrams' script and special effects make for a spectacular combination.You know there is nothing more fun for these filmmakers than a story about smart, outcast kids obsessed with making a movie! Throw in the adolescent battle over the out-of-reach older girl, the somewhat demented kid who just loves explosions, the sensitive kid dealing with the death of his mother, the wise beyond her years girl who is a natural actress, and the chubby, driven boy with a camera ... mix it up with a couple of clueless parents and the evil, secretive Air Force, and you have quite the exciting small town Ohio drama with comedic elements and startling special effects.Not going to say anything about the ""surprise"" that was hinted in the trailer, but what I will say is that the first hour of this movie was pure movie magic to me. Unfortunately, the second half was a slight let down, though not horrible at all. I just enjoyed the pure human elements on display before it became just another ...The film really rides on the shoulders of Elle Fanning (probably the last time I will reference her as Dakota's little sis). Ms. Fanning has proved again that she may be the most talented of the acting sisters. She really has a feel for her scenes and clearly melts the heart of young Joe Lamb, played by newcomer Joel Courtney. Also excellent are Riley Griffiths as Charles the movie maker, and Ryan Lee as Cary the demolition ""expert"". Joe's dad is played by Kyle Chandler (Friday Night Lights), but again, this film really belongs to the kids.The film is rated PG-13 for some pretty intense scenes and some language that many prefer not to hear coming from kids. It's too bad more films ""like"" this aren't made, but that's probably a factor of not many filmmakers being in the class of Spielberg and Abrams (Lost, Star Trek).",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

More than the sum of its parts,"Essentially a pastiche of numerous other movies and film tropes you've seen countless times before (think ""E.T."", ""The Goonies,"" and ""Close Encounters"" with a dash of ""Romeo & Juliet""), ""Super 8"" is that oddly appealing kind of film that amounts to more than the sum of its parts.

The titular camera plays a pivotal role in unraveling the mystery behind the train crash, as do our intrepid young hero and his star-crossed crush (the daughter of the town drunk/ne'er do well who may or may not have been responsible for the death of our hero's mother). Despite the clichéd ingredients, this film boasts a strong heart and a dedication to classic narrative and character development—elements that make this film much better than your typical mindless summer blockbuster.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Eight Reasons to See Super 8 (and Two Reasons Why Not),"Instead of presenting this as a normal review, I'll put it in the form of bullets. I just think it's more reader-friendly for this. It also helps to avoid plot details, and that's probably better if you want to go in with a blank slate.1. If you like Steven Spielberg, you'll like this movie. J.J. Abrams has clearly created the movie as a homage to the classics that Spielberg has made. Echoes of Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Jurassic Park are felt throughout the entire film. Super 8 directly borrows Jaws' style in that the viewer only gets brief glimpses at the monster for the first two thirds; it isn't until the last third that the viewer sees it in its entirety.2. The acting. Elle Fanning is the highlight of a great cast of child actors. Fanning has proved herself once with Somewhere, but she ups the ante with Super 8. There's one great scene where she has to act as though she's acting in a movie filmed by the other children. She, along with the rest of them, nails it.3. J.J. Abrams' script. The writing is one of the best things about Super 8. It's rich, fast, and, again, Spielbergian. Abrams' screenplay is delightful because it plays on the viewer's own childhood memories. It's basically one long nostalgia trip.4. J.J. Abrams' direction. He basically becomes Steven Spielberg to make this movie, as seen in his use of constant Steadicam shots and visual restraint when it comes to the shots of the monster in the early parts of the movie.5. The cinematography and color palette. Also reminiscent of 1970s blockbuster film is the visual look of the movie. The drowned-out colors are similar to that of Close Encounters of the Third Kind.6. The train sequence. The best scene in the movie is one involving a train crash. It's basically what you've already seen from the first trailer, but this time, it's from a different point-of-view. Watch this in a big theater. You're going to want to hear how great the sound editing is in this scene.7. The monster. I'm not going to say anything other than that I very much enjoyed the way the monster looked.8. The tone. Like The Goonies, Super 8 is a summer movie that's made to make you feel like a kid again. It's wonderful, at times whimsical and at other times frightening. It's exactly what one should want from a summer movie, but...Reasons why not to see Super 8: 1. J.J. Abrams got too bogged down in becoming Steven Spielberg. The film is sometimes obnoxious in how much it wants to be Jaws. This ends up getting in the way of the film's great story, and keeps it from becoming a classic.2. It's not perfect. Super 8 has pacing issues a lot of the time and will often involve characters and subplots that completely unnecessary. There are certain elements of the movie that could have absolutely been taken away without any repercussions.Overall, Super 8 is worth seeing. Take the family out and have fun. See it in a big theater with a good sound system. It's a fun but unfortunately forgettable ride.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
tries to recapture an era but just feels derivative,"J.J. Abrams' ""Super 8"" hearkens back to the days of early Steven Spielberg (who co-produced the film) - a time when summer blockbusters could appeal as much to the heart as to the eye, when a group of intrepid suburban kids could unravel mysteries and take on evil forces, when the military-industrial complex was clearly up to no good, and when tear-stained characters could look in wide-eyed, tight-shot amazement at wonders unraveling above them in the heavens.Set, appropriately, in 1979 - in a time before digital cameras and CGI technology, when children had to express their creativity and imagination with what was then the technological equivalent of chewing gum and baling wire - ""Super 8"" centers on a group of nerdish preteens who are attempting to make their own amateur zombie-splatter film for an upcoming contest. While filming one night, the kids are witness to a horrifying freight train crash, the repercussions of which go far beyond just the mass of mangled, twisted metal strewn across the area. For it seems the Air Force has taken a more than casual interest in the event, and soon strange and inexplicable occurrences begin happening in town.The focal point of the story is Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney), a young boy whose mother has just been killed in a tragic factory accident, and whose grieving father (Kyle Chandler from TV's incomparable ""Friday Night Lights"") serves as the town's deputy. Joe also has a crush on the pretty and alluring Alice Dainard (Elle Fanning), who has been brought into the boys' film project at the last moment.The similarities between ""Super 8"" and any number of Spielberg - or at least Spielbergian - films (most notably, of course, ""E.T."") are both so numerous and so obvious that they really don't bear repeating here. Yet, while I admire much of what Abrams is trying to do in this movie, so much of it falls flat that I really can't recommend it in the final analysis. What's actually missing is that special Spielberg touch, that almost Quixotic visionary conviction that could turn even a simple work like ""E.T."" into a timeless classic. One never questions Spielberg's belief in his material, but I'm not sure one can quite make the same claim about Abrams, at least not in this particular instance. Abrams' story lacks the streamlined clarity of an ""E.T."" and, by extension, the emotional resonance that comes along with it. ""Super 8"" seems to be going off in so many different directions at once that it winds up going nowhere. And, frankly, the sci-fi aspects of the story feel awfully stale at this late stage in the game.In addition to ""E.T.,"" there are bits and pieces of ""The Goonies,"" ""Stand By Me,"" ""Gremlins,"" and ""War of the Worlds"" in the film as well. And that, in the final analysis, is what's most wrong with ""Super 8."" It's made up of so many borrowed parts that, in the end, it's left with nothing it can truly call its own.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Nostalgic Trip Into the Era of Spielberg's Hits,"""Super 8"" takes us back to the glorious days of Spielberg treats like ""The Goonies"", ""E.T. The Extraterrestrial"", and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"". Indeed, written and directed by Jeffrey Jacob Abrams, ""Super 8"" is a collaboration between Abrams and Steven Spielberg who serves as producer.As a teenager, Abrams' film-making exploits caught Spielberg's eye and it earned him a gig restoring Spielberg's own 8mm movies. And if, after viewing the movie, you thought that this is Abrams' homage to Spielberg, Abrams has denied it, saying (in an interview) that ""It was never intended as homage to him, but really to that period of my life, which was really the first impulse of this movie."" For many, ""Super 8"" will also remind them of their own childhood adventures and maybe even their first love.During the summer of 1979, a group of school friends led by aspiring director Charles (Riley Griffiths) and make-up trainee Joe (Joel Courtney) are making a zombie movie in a small town in Ohio when they witness a catastrophic train crash. The boys, and their volunteer actress Alice (Elle Fanning), soon suspect that there is more to the accident than meets the eye. Soon people and dogs go missing, and violent, inexplicable events begin to take place in town. And as the US military arrive, Joe's dad Jackson (Kyle Chandler), the local Deputy Sheriff, tries to uncover the truth - which turns out to more terrifying than any of them could have imagined.The first thing I noticed about ""Super 8"" is how the young cast, led by Dakota Fanning's sister Elle, draw us into their movie-within-a-movie. Fanning's Alice may be talented and pretty and the romantic interest of the boys around her, but she is the gutsiest among the kids. Needless to say, she grabs our attention whenever she is on-screen - as do the other youngsters as they strive to make sense of what is happening from the events captured on the Super 8 camera.The movie may deal with an alien 'invasion' but it is mainly about that time when American adolescents learn about friendship, loyalty, survival and love. Joe, the protagonist, has admired Alice from a distance and boy, does he revel in the chance to touch her face - while doing her make-up. These 'soft' scenes are interspersed with hard-core action sequences like the train crash and the devastation by the alien (which looks quite like the monster from Alien). It is to Abrams' credit that he has resisted the temptation to give audiences a proper view of the 'extra-terrestrial'. Anyway, sustaining curiosity is Abrams' forte, having created TV's ""Lost"" and ""Fringe"" series.Among the adult cast are Noah Emmerich, who plays the nasty military commander, and Ron Eldard as Alice's father. They put up credible performances but it is a pity to see them upstaged by the outstanding young cast. Bravo to the youngsters. - (limchangmoh.blogspot.com)",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Super 8... Super Satisfies,"Hats of to Spielberg who truly has a talent for spotting a great story. The film is a bit of a period piece that follows a young boy still coping with an emotional loss who unwittingly embarks on an adventure of finding himself and discovering love all while unraveling the mystery of a tragic train accident that hits his small town. This film strongly resembles the mystery of E.T. and the camaraderie of goonies. Good plot, great story. Abrams is great at using the camera and angles to build suspense and to properly place you in the action. I do feel the film suffers from snip happy editing; too much footage left on the cutting room floor. Though the released version is already near the two hour limit, an additional 30 minutes of character and story building would have made this an undisputed instant classic. As I'm suggesting the film should have been a little longer, I certainly enjoyed it ;-). Recommended.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Super 8,"In the first 10 minutes, the film actually spells out everything that's wrong with ATTACK THE BLOCK -- you need to care about the characters. It's presented almost like a mission statement. And these are characters I did care about. That is to say, white people. Heh, I'm joking, of course. No, I mean they're kids with personalities and creativity and relatable problems and aspirations. Yes, the film isn't very original. It wears its influences (GOONIES, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS, E.T., and so forth) proudly on its sleeve and there's probably nothing here you haven't seen before. I mean, good lord, if I never see another ""shadowy military conspiracy"" plot again it'll be too soon. And for fuck's sake, Abrams, lay off the lens flares. It's incredibly distracting once you start noticing it. But the movie is very entertaining, with pacing that rarely feels too sluggish or too fast, engaging action scenes, a pretty good sense of humor, and some skillfully prepared character moments. The cast of kids is quite likable... even the little pyro who irritated me at first eventually won me over. Technically the film is solid, too (except the overdose of lens flares) and I liked the score. Even if a lot of the film was overly familiar, I had a really good time watching it and would see it again.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Bring Back Sci-Fi,"Science Fiction is a genre that its hard to pull off. I'd put it on the same difficulty scale as Comedies. Every person has their own expectations and preferences when it comes to these genres. Some people will be impressed by the material while others will scoff at it. Super 8 received mixed reviews and I think that could be attributed to different people having different expectations.For me this Sci-Fi renewed my faith in the genre. Amidst the many remakes, sequels, and superhero movies there haven't been much show of original stories in recent years. Super 8 took a few ingredients from other successful Sci-Fi films and blended them together to make a up to date recipe. Now some people might not like this, but I think J.J. Abrams (Lost, Star Trek) did an excellent job bringing back Sci-Fi. It may be an old wine but it's in a new bottle.Super 8 follows the story of Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney) and his friends as they try to make a short film. While the group shoot at nearby train station they experience an event that they know they need to keep secret. After the incident mysterious happenings occur in their town and the kids realize that what they experienced might have more consequences than the single incident.The film impresses on a lot of levels. The writing and the directing is something you come to expect from J.J. Abrams. And the cinematography is excellent. But what stands out are the performances. Joel Courtney does a solid job of leading the film at such a young age. And opposite him Elle Fanning (Deja Vu, Babel) makes her presence known as Alice Dainard. A nice surprise is Kyle Chandler (Friday Night Lights) playing Joe Lamb's father.All in all this film did a decent job of doing a well celebrated genre justice. Your preferences may be different to what this film offers, but it is definitely one to watch to see if it does meet your expectations.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
There's no there there,"I really wanted to like this movie, but had the same problems with it that a lot of folks are having. It has no soul. It's like having to change from vinyl LP's to CD, some strangely sterile difference that ""technically"" is unprovable. It tries to fill-in with forced dialogue that was almost condescending. Not cool. Maybe the real problem is that the sci-fi genre has been done to death. Or better yet, the money-making genre is all that matters. Not anything new there, but nonetheless discouraging every time I run up against it. I joke with my pacifist friends about what literature or entertainment would look like if, suddenly, the world changed to their way. I used to say it would be a bunch of books that nobody would want to read. Now, after seeing Super 8, I may have to back-pedal and pray for something honest.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Flashback...,"SUPER 8 is Director J. J. Abrams' ode to the movies of the 1970's -80's. Produced by Steven Spielberg, it looks exactly like a movie he would have made back then. The young characters are also reminiscent of the kids in the movies of that era. Even the small town looks like the towns in films of the 70's.S8 works as a throwback sci-fi movie because it doesn't try to be a parody thereof. The story is -mostly- played straight, like CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND and E. T. were.This is as close to a ""new"" film from the actual period that you can get without a time machine...",,Anonymous,Mystery
A Solid B movie,"I've wanted to see this movie since the first teaser came out. I really wanted to like this movie. I wanted to be blown away by it. But I'd have to say, I didn't feel it lived up to my expectations.People use the word ""nostalgia"" a lot when talking about this movie. I suppose that means a couple of things: 1) The movie is set in the late 1970s, in small town America, when friendships were made through real face-to-face interactions. 2) It's a thriller told through the eyes of kids, which has been done most successfully by Spielberg, who had a hand in the story. (M. Night Shyamalan would be the next guy in mind, but it's not great to be compared to him right now.) If that is all you need for a movie to work, you're all set. Super 8 has all of that. It has a fantastic cast of child actors and a story that works. It wasn't trying to blow you away with explosions (although there's plenty of that). In fact, it's the polar opposite of a Michael Bay action film. It's an action film that focuses on story, not action.I feel that the excitement Abrams had in making this movie reflected the excitement the kids in the movie had in making their own movie. I think many kids (including myself when I was that age) who managed to get their hands on a camera liked making movies and telling stories. But if you're familiar with Abrams style of storytelling, you know that he likes to start of with a big mysterious happening and tease the audience along. That works only for so long because eventually, you need to reveal what is really happening. The movie as a whole becomes a tease that grows gradually over the movie. You see a flash, a shadow, a glimpse, you see things that suggest size and power and you picture something awesome.In many ways, Super 8 follows the dangerous path that M. Night Shyamalan followed in movies like ""The Village"" and ""Signs."" In this case, I'm not talking about a twist ending. I'm talking about the build-up to the mystery core of the movie. If you're going to spend most of your marketing and most of the movie teasing your audience about a mystery ""thing,"" you'd better make sure that ""thing"" works. One thing about Spielberg's movies like Jaws and Jurassic Park is that there's no mystery about what you'll see. You know what a shark looks like and you know what dinosaurs look like. With a movie like Super 8, a lot of the expectation rests on what exactly this ""thing"" is and whether that ""thing"" turns out to meet or exceed your expectations. For me, it didn't meet my expectations. It was just okay. I felt like I've seen it before. You probably have as well.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A film with great potential falls well short,"I have just gotten home from a trip to the theatre. Me and a few friends decided on Super 8. What appealed to me most about this film is that it was very mysterious, and I myself had only seen 1 trailer on it. I prefer to go into a movie knowing nothing about it, so I have no expectations.For about 100 minutes, I thought the film was fantastic. The old-school style of filming really hooked me in. The children in this movie, I must say, were fantastic actors for their age and the genre. Charles, the director of the children's zombie movie, seemed to satirize a bossy director who always wanted things differently. The quiet boy Joe, with a crush, and their relationship was great, as well as the rest of the young actors relationships (until the end, I'll get to that).I also enjoyed that there was a parallel storyline going on, so the viewer could see the story from an adults and child's point of view. It kept me guessing throughout the film. The suspense, the build up, was mostly perfect, keeping my friends and I on the edge of our seats. That was a spoiler-less summation of the first 100 minutes.I only wanted to write this review based on what happened after this 100 minutes.Now, after this 100 minute mark, the movie was concluding. Quickly. VERY quickly. To me, and many other people, it seemed as though JJ Abrams had to sum up the movie as quickly as he could, which was where the 'actual' train wreck began.So after this 100 minute mark, young Joe is having a conversation with another character. After this short conversation, the 2nd character leaves, and Joe and 2 of his friends do as well, into town. They go completely unnoticed by anyone else, which I thought was very odd. As they, along with everyone around them, watch the scene take place, the movie attempts to sum itself up. To avoid spoilers, I will have to leave it at that.Basically the movie was going in a direction with a lot of build up, as most movies do, and then the build up died. The climax was forgotten, and the entire movie fell apart. Had the filmmakers decided to lengthen the film and try to gradually end it, I would not be so upset. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Also, the ending had nothing to do with the rest of the film, and instead the solution came from almost out of the blue.All-in-all, the film 'Super 8' had the potential to be fantastic. It was humorous, suspenseful, and mysterious. But when it came down to the final minutes, the filmmakers didn't deliver. All of the conflicts in the film were summed up so quickly, the build up seemed pointless entirely. You impressed me, Mr. Abrams, and yet my impression quickly faded away with your terrible ending I give this film a 6 out of 10. Had the final 12 minutes been different, I believe it could have been worthy of a spot in the top 250.Thanks for reading everyone.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

i waited over a year for this movie and was amazed when i saw it!,"This movie was just incredible, let me say that. It really made the summer kick off. It starts off with a great story and that, then is halted by an insanely awesome train crash. After that, the story continues, but keeps getting hooked up with odd things happening in the hometown of the characters. In the end, the creature starts to fully reveal itself. I will not spoil anything about the creature. Anayway, the story is awesome, the creature is awesome, the ending is awesome, and the acting is surprisingly awesome as well. There are some scary scenes, i could easily handle it but if you are thinking of taking a six year old or under to this film, you might want to consider rethinking it. I still believe that transformers 3: Dark of the Moon is going to be the best movie of the summer, but this is still definitely worth seeing. I would not be surprised if this wins an Oscar.

Like seeing an old favorite for the first time,"Super 8Right off the bat, I have to say that this movie pays homage and reminds me of so many movies that I love: E.T, The Goonies, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, District 9, Cloverfield (ok, I didn't actually see that one). It has a little bit of Lost thrown in, but all in all, it is a thoroughly enjoyable JJ Abrams creation. Super 8, set in 1979, is about a group of kids who are making a zombie film for a super 8 film contest. One night, in the middle of filming, they witness an extraordinary train crash, created by an apparently insane motorist who drives his truck on to the tracks, directly in the way of the oncoming train. There is a terrific explosion--one that actually seems too far-fetched to be plausible (I used to live 60 feet from train tracks and have seen the results of a derailment, so my BS meter was going off--but I held it in check--besides, there does turn out to be an explanation for this) and this sets off the chain of events which involves a military cover-up and one very-angry-but possibly-misunderstood-alien who, as it turns out, really just wants to go home. If it doesn't sound like the first time you've heard this, well, it isn't. But ten minutes into this film, it won me over. The parallels to the movies listed above are obvious: an alien who wants to go home (E.T.), a conspiracy with a large dose of ""what the hell?"" happening (Lost, Close Encounters) a misunderstood alien who is ultimately a benevolent being (E.T., District 9), and a plucky group of young kids who save the day (Goonies.) Plus there is a sweet tale of adolescent first crush, first love set against the background of tragedy which is almost universal. Yeah--while I can't say I haven't seen any of this before, I find myself absolutely delighted by the way this all turned out. You could certainly do much worse than to pay homage to Spielberg. Super 8 is a wonderful film that is worth seeing if only to remind us of what it felt like to be a kid and to see any of your favorite movies for the first time.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Horrifying! (For all the wrong reasons.),"By now, we all know the plot; while making a super-8 zombie movie, a group of kids (""Stand By Me"") inadvertently film a train wreck that releases some mysterious cargo (""Cloverfield""). As the kids get caught up in the mystery, the army (and its villainous leader) run around trying to contain both the kids and the cargo in what amounts to a clusterf*ck of exposition and deus ex machina. (That's Latin for, ""Nigga, please.""). How big are the plot holes? Put it this way: a 60-foot, spider-like alien could crawl through them without so much as an ""excuse me.""Like the story's protagonists, I love being terrified by way of a willing suspension of disbelief. Instead, I found myself horrified by the film's utter suspension of common sense. I can't understand why Spielberg, the mastermind behind ""Close Encounters"" and ""Jaws,"" EP'd this movie. Actually, I can -- when I think of Spielberg, the producer. He truly ""gets"" the ever-descending standards of today's movie-going public. For better or worse the man has always understood his audience. In Spielberg's day, we were better, smarter. Today, well... we have the Tea Party. Actually, we have its progeny, spending their parents' unemployment checks on movies when they should be reading their bibles and burning crosses on the White House lawn.Is it any wonder my respect for Spielberg as a filmmaker increases tenfold when comparing his abilities to Abrams'? Spielberg could have farted a better film. And 30 years ago, he would have -- as a TV episode of The Night Gallery. Remember that show? Neither do I. But Abrams' ascendancy in the world of television explains a lot about his shortcomings as someone looking to be the next Spielberg. Maybe on some other planet.The idea, itself, is great. But Super-8 gets derailed the moment the train careens off the tracks, releasing its cargo of cheap scares and incredulity, causing M. Night Shamalamananyan to wonder what the hell happened to his FedEx package! Even ""E.T. - The Extraterrestrial"" appeals to both adults and kids, dishing out thrills for the latter without insulting the intelligence of the former. Not so with Super-8.The characters have nothing to do with the larger story. While the performances are solid - and Elle Fanning's foreshadows future Oscars - the kids play no role pivotal to the outcome of the tale. Nor do the events really change them beyond what's expected. It's as if there are two movies playing out simultaneously. And the one with the expensive monster is crap. An afterthought. Only the secondary and tertiary characters undergo any real change. But their stories are so fleeting, who cares if the love interest's Dad starts out as a bastard and ends up as a swell guy? We can't even remember his name. Ironically, the best part of the movie was watching the kids' completed zombie flick during the credit roll, which turned out to be scarier and more plausible than Abrams' big-budget train wreck. (I get the feeling Spielberg directed it). As for the larger movie, I'm not gonna run through all the plot holes, which are sufficient for an entirely separate article.But how is it that such a large and unstoppable creature could have been contained for over 20 years -- or even 20 seconds (in a box car no less) -- only to escape when the box car gets knocked sideways alongside a small town in the middle of nowhere? Why does the military wait a week or two (allowing all the necessary characters enough time to get wise to the extraterrestrial cargo) before finally evacuating the town -- when they already know there's a giant alien on the loose in search of used appliances? Hello?? Earth calling common sense?? And just what is it about microwave ovens and old refrigerators that make for such great alien space ship launching pads? Hell, had I known back then that my old Zenith harbored highly-advanced technology, I would have sold it to a Chinese kid.Even the era is totally arbitrary to the story, satisfying only the filmmakers' sentimental yearning for the old days when they were kids with super-8 movie cameras. I get it, but so what? This isn't relevant to me; in the late 70s, I was learning to masturbate while wearing KISS make-up. Super-8 (the format) has nothing to do with me, or the story. The movie could have been called Hi-8. Or MiniDV for all it matters. I suppose it's convenient for the story take place before most of the audience was born, so there's fewer people calling bullshit on the references. I mean, come on -- no respectable nerd would buy a Hunchback model over a Karloff Bride of Frankenstein; the stores couldn't give the Lon Chaney Quasimodo ones away.Altogether, the era, the lapses in logic, the predictability -- all of it suited Abrams' needs rather than those of the story. And isn't that the whole problem with movies these days? Nobody wants to do the work. Not the filmmakers. Not the audience. Not the focus group moderators. We want it easy. We want CGI. F*ck stop-motion, it's too much work! Save your provocation for the art house, we'd rather not think, thank you very much.  We want all the services without paying any of the taxes. In this context, Super-8 makes total sense, along with most of the ""blockbusters"" these days.But why I spent over $60 to see this in the theaters when I should have known better? That remains a mystery for which I have no sufficient answer. I guess, like everyone else, I'm only human, and not that smart either. Although, looking back, I certainly understand the alien's motivation for wanting to get off this planet. When confronted by the likes of those in Middle America... well, let's just say the horror was all his.",,Anonymous,Mystery
J.J. Abrams gives Spielberg a cinematic man-hug.,"Director J.J. Abrams, an obvious sci-fi nut, was born in 1966, meaning that, like myself, he would have grown up following the career of Steven Spielberg; Super 8 is his cinematic love-letter to all things Spielbergian, a big-budget tribute to the bearded-one's particular brand of suburban sci-fi.Set in a small-town America in the late 1970s, the film follows a close-knit group of high school film-makers who stumble upon a military secret whilst shooting a scene for their 8mm zombie flick. With its small group of dysfunctional friends, sinister government officials, spectacular effects-laden set-pieces, and a suitably schmaltzy message, Super 8 gets the ingredients more or less spot-on, but still fails to be a wholly satisfying affair, Abrams playing his trump card way too early with an improbably fiery but utterly exhilarating train crash that he never manages to top, followed by a rather uneventful middle third, and a disappointing finale that only succeeds in matching Spielberg in terms of mawkish sentimentality.An amusing end credits sequence that features the 8mm movie made by Super 8's budding Romeros proves to be one of the highlights of the whole film.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A movie to be watched,"I really enjoyed the storyline of this movie. It is a bit different to other movies but followed the basic storyline of a typical 'monster take over world' movie. The idea of having children as the main characters and trying to discover the secret the U.S Air Force was hiding was brilliant and somewhat unique. It also reminded me of the storyline of Cloverfield. JJ Abrams and Steven Spielberg has made an excellent team in the creation of this storyline.The acting of the main characters was not the best. I specifically didn't like how Elle Fanning portrayed Alice. Joel Courtney and Riley Griffiths on the other hand both did an excellent job with their acting and a portrayal of two of the main characters. I thoroughly enjoyed watching the two new actors throughout the movie.The main thing I didn't like with the movie was the filming. The filming itself was terrible and the special thing with all the lights really put me off (not sure what you call it). This type of lighting and filming was a real let down especially when the blue lighting was covering the screen and blocking out the picture. However, the special effects has really supported this movie and they have done an excellent job.I give this movie a 7 out of 10 because of it's original storyline and the brilliant acting of two of the main characters. It is definitely a movie to be watched and enjoyed.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
ughhhhhh Its OK I guess,"I have to admit this was better than I expected. I love the whole concept of teens making a movie throughout this whole film. The story was decent but it just felt like a remake of E.T. except the alien isn't friendly. At first it didn't bother me not to see the creature but as the time went on, you get a bit anxious and then I was disappointed. It was just another family film where the dad doesn't get along with the kid or understand each other but I couldn't help but see a bit resemblance to Jurassic Park.

"Scary, Funny, and has a nice feel","It has been almost a year since this movie came out, hard to believe isn't it, I can still remember the hype, everyone going crazy about how much they were looking forward to the film. Yet after it finally came out, it seems that so many people were disappointed with the film. Sure it has good reviews, but look up the film on IMDb, look at the featured review, I guarantee it will most likely be someone saying it sucked, or was only OK. Well unlike so many other people, I absolutely loved this movie.From what I get, a lot of people were disappointed was because it was too similar to other movies like E.T. and the Goonies. Um, yeah, that was the point. The movie was supposed to be like an 80's Spielberg movie.The film was directed by J.J. Abrams, who is quickly becoming one of my favorite filmmakers. I enjoyed Mission Impossible 3, he produced Cloverfield, one of my favorite movies, and while Star Trek put me to sleep, it looked like he did a good job from what I saw of it. Super 8 looks fantastic, homaging classic Spielberg while also having Abram's own style. The child actors were all fantastic, they didn't seem like actors, they seemed like real kids, and created some funny and memorable characters, my favorite being Charlie.The effects are top notch, some might complain that there is too much CGI, but come on guys, this was 2011, be happy there are any practical effects. The train derailment was so overblown that it was awesome. And the production value was fantastic, I was born in the 90's, so I can't speak from experience, but I always believed that they were in 1979.It's hilarious, especially the kid who has an unhealthy obsession with explosives. The diologue is great, the kids swear, like, you know, KIDS. My brother is 12 and he swears more than I do. But the film is also really scary at times. I jumped quite a bit. Which brings me to the sound. I have never thought more about Sound Mixing more than in this movie (Why wasn't this movie nominated for any Oscars?) I had only one big problem with this movie, and that was the ending. The last seven minutes aren't really bad, but it seems the writer didn't know how to end it. I won't spoil anything, but some things just don't make sense.Super 8 was a great movie, it seems quite a lot of people were disappointed with it, but personally with the exception of the last seven minutes or so, I was completely satisfied.9/10 Very Mint!!!",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A great film overall, much better than Cloverfeild","Walking into this film, I figured that this would just be ""Cloverfield in the '70's with kids"", but I was totally wrong. The film exceeded almost all my expectations The plot is very basic: a train wreck with mysterious cargo crashes in a quiet, rural town. 5 children witness the crash and run off in fear. The town is then tormented by a mysterious creature from the train. I don't want to give any major details away, so I'll stop there. What I will say, however is that the film has the tension and excitement that Abrams fans have come to expect from all his latest films. The acting in this, however, exceeds all that I've seen this year (and I've seen a lot this year). The child actors SHINE compared to the adults in the movie (and in some other films this year: Pirates 4 for example).Abrams really got rid of all the negative qualities of Cloverfield and replaced them with audience-friendly traits: the most important being ANSWERS!!!!! Many (including myself) walked out of Cloverfield with questions about everything: what happened to the characters, what is the monster, where did the monster come from, etc. ALL of these are answered in Super 8. Some could argue that the lack of answers added to the mysteriousness of Cloverfeild, but others want to know backstory about the film's characters (myself included). However, Abrams still sticks to the Cloverfeild formula; giving the audience little glimpses of the monster to keep everyone interested Abrams stuck with his editing team from Star Trek for Super 8, lens flares and all. The lens flares weren't as annoying in this as they were in Star Trek, but you still notice them as they fill the screen with a bright light. I found it really annoying (I wear heavy prescription glasses and have to put up with lens flare all the time) and at some times it was worse than Star Trek. Abrams really toned it down, all considered.In close, I really have to say that this has been my favorite film this year (and putting up with trash like Fast Five, it's not a surprise). The acting is superb, especially from the children. It's a must-see",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A unique and refreshing film.,"I saw this movie in New York on opening day and I loved every second of this film. I was already a huge fan of Steven Spielberg and J.J. Abrams so I knew that this would be a unique experience and it turned out to be everything that I hoped it would be. I won't go into detail in this review and let everyone else make up their own mind about the film.I thought that this was a very refreshing movie that does a good job at combining different genres without being too obvious. Even though the movie does have elements of Science Fiction, action and fantasy. It also is a very heartfelt coming of age story and I believe it's one of the essential elements of the film. Without these characters, I wouldn't have believed in the film as much as I did. J.J. Abrams does a nice job and making the characters and what they go through the most important part of the story and it works. The movie also has elements of comedy, their are plenty of moments that will have you laughing or smiling. I don't want to give anything away for those who haven't seen the film but stay in your seats when the credits roll at the end of the film, you won't regret it.I love E.T., Close Encounters and The Goonies and this movie brought me back to those films and how much I loved them as a child and still do. Go see this movie, it may be the most fun and delightful time you will have at the movies this year.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Gets the spirit of those throwback family sci-fi films just right, but takes the weaker aspects with it","I'm not adding anything to the discussion by noting that Super 8 is deliberately and professionally a throwback to those family-friendly sci-fi films of the 80's. Explorers comes to mind, as does Flight of the Navigator and The Goonies. However, for as many people observing this, not enough of them appear to be happy to accept some of the weaknesses that Super 8 also carries forward into 2011. The story here is that a group of high-school students are making an amateur short film on a friend's super 8 camera when a massive crash occurs and they flee just as, for some reason, the military move in to take control. Shortly it transpires that ""something"" may have been in the train and is now loose in this small town community.The set-up is classic and by choosing to set the film in this time period it works even better because it is able to be mostly free of modern cynicism or reference points and manages to capture a sort of image of childhood and small-town life that may never have existed but certainly a lot of people of my age will have already been sold on since we grew up on the films this one is referencing. In this regard I can understand why the main love for Super 8 appears to be from a certain age-group, not to suggest others do not enjoy it, but certainly the nostalgic sense of familiarity with the tone and approach did add a bit for me on my viewing. The gentle comic bantering between the characters is great stuff and it frames the film and provides enjoyment and colour around the sci-fi action.This action is not quite as good but again it hearkens back to days where seeing the creature is less important than seeing what it does. It worked for me and I was more than happy to see the destruction played out in a teasing way as it was. Those expecting Cloverfield 2 though, will be disappointed as it is not that type of film. Although it is a throwback, it is impressive how well Abrams captures the spirit and content of these films of that period. I'm not a massive fan of his because at times he seems all about the hype of the moment rather than the lasting substance, but here he does a solid job. The downside of this is that he also captures the sentimentality and rather pat endings of these films. I accepted this as being a genre thing but the ending still is a little weak as a result. I also thought he overdid the lens-flare effect, it is a nice touch done sparingly but here it seems to be in almost every scene and it got on my nerves.Overall though Super 8 is a great little throwback film that will play best with those of us of an age to no longer fancy another noisy and hollow effects films this summer but rather something that benefits from a nostalgic warmth. It does really well at catching this spirit and content and for that it deserves credit even if the downside is that it captures the weaknesses as well. Fun and engaging if you let yourself get in an 80's frame of reference.",,Anonymous,Mystery
A mash up of the classics - why not?,"I just watched ET, Jaws, Jurassic Park, The Goonies, Poltergeist, War of the Worlds, Close Encounters and Cloverfield mashed into one frolicking fun ride.And that's no bad thing at all. Yes it's flawed by giant gaping character and story holes, but it's so nostalgically framed, the kids' acting is so good and the references unashamed, why not enjoy it? At the end of the day it hit the notes it's not hiding from aiming for, and unlike so many films today took me back to a place I'd rather be. Any film in which you could pause almost any frame and get a classic movie photo has to be worth something. Yes, I even fell for the over use of lens flares - pure eye candy and a step aside from video game CGI.Great fun, take it on face value, and go take some photos with Hipstamatic to get in the mood!

Super 8 is a 10,"When I go to a movie I take a notebook. I usually jot down a few items about the movies as I watch. I can look back at my notes and see the movies that really engaged by the amount of notes I take during a movie. For this film, I have only one note in my book: ""loved it! "" I was completely engaged throughout the picture. Every aspect of this movie was masterfully done. The acting, the storytelling, set design -- everything was done really well. The pace of the story was fine and the balancing act between all of the human emotions is awesome. Some people have said that it's a cross between The Goonies and Cloverfield.

"A Touching, Exciting Summer Blockbuster","If there is any wonder about what Abrams is capable of in terms of being a filmmaker, Super 8 should sufficiently debunk this. While he is certainly a great producer, this is Abrams first original picture. But never fear, he succeeds again with a fine picture that will warm your heart and excite you.In case you are wondering what this whole thing is about, I will try to keep the plot as a minimum so as to save much of the surprise. Joe Lamb is helping his best buddy make a zombie film in the 1970's when they witness a horrendous train wreck. What follows are several days of unexplained activity that alters all their lives in exciting and frightening ways.Super 8 has been said to be reminiscent of all those old Amblin Spielberg films of the 80's, and it's not far off. There is a good mix of several films in here, including Stand By Me, ET, Close Encounters, and other classic films. Some will blow this off as nothing special, merely a nostalgic trip trying to replicate Spielberg. But in Abrams hands, this is a well crafted and very well directed film. The child actors here are some of the best most emotionally provocative that I have seen in a long, long time. Elle Fanning, in particular, is fantastic. All the children are, and it's something that has rarely been seen since Spielberg, who is arguably the best child director in the industry.But beyond the actors, the cinematography is also of note. Firstly, the train wreck is handled extremely well. It's both frightening and exciting and truly underscores the damage and effect that it will have on the town. And when the creature from within the train begins to wreak havoc, it's extremely effective. Though this is not a horror movie, horror film principles are applied in getting the most out of the tension of these scenes. Some reviews have called the sci-fi elements weak, but I would argue against that. There are issues, which I will get into later, but the scenes dealing with this creature before it's big reveal are nice and scary. These scenes are countered with even better drama. As stated, these child actors are fantastic, and that really makes the scenes in which the budding love story or family drama shines through.Of course, the film has it's issues, the reason it's an 8 and not higher. First of all, I took issue with some of the separation between the monster plot line and the plots involving the kids and their drama. It's almost like two films are being played out here, and while that may have been how the film initially started (as ideas for two different films coming together), it's kind of disheartening to see that they never truly figured out how to make the two interweave naturally. My second issue involves some story elements that seem like they could have been developed more, namely the father-son relationship between Joe and his father. His dad spends much of the time trying to figure out what's going on. We know there are issues there between Joe and his father, and one scene between the two showing this doesn't really encompass the true nature and effect of these problems. It would have also been nice to see more interaction between the two, but I won't spoil anything about why I think this.These are minor issues though for a film that is well crafted and truly enjoyable. Yes, the film is quite nostalgic. However, there are a great deal of touches Abrams puts in himself that make this his own film. For those who grew up on all those old Amblin films, this will warm your heart, and for those who didn't grow up on those, you'll have a chance to know what it felt like to see a film like ET for the first time. Simply put, call this film this generations ET or Stand By Me.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Could be as much inspired by King as it is Spielberg,"In the small town of Lilian, Ohio 14 year old Joe Lamb(Joel Courtney) has only just tragically lost his mother in what was a freak factory accident. Finding barely any real solace in the presence of his father(who is the towns deputy-sheriff), what little he does find is in the company of his friends who are filming an amateur Zombie flick. Directed by the portly and bossy Charles Kaznyk (Riley Griffiths) , he convinces young Alice Dainard, a pretty young girl who both he and Joe have a crush on to be the film's leading lady. While filming a night- time scene at an old train depot a pick up truck drives on to the train tracks and in front of an oncoming train, derailing it. The kids, then forced to come to terms with what's just happened soon learn that this is only the beginning of their problems as it is for their small town. Something unearthly made up part of the trains cargo and makes it's ominous presence felt when a series of seemingly inconceivable events gradually leads to the town being thrown in to chaos!The latest project from J.J. Abrams, the clever mind behind one of TV's most cerebral enigma's which was ""Lost"". ""Super 8"" is his own undeniably affectionate Spielbergian homage, fitting as it is seeing as it comes figuratively packaged with the iconic film-maker's name on the box. It's small town backdrop and it's use of events being seen through that of children's perspectives inviting instant comparisons to Steven Spielberg's highly influential ""E.T."" It's never the less an alien movie but one less cutesy and certainly without a creature needing to ""phone home!"" Indeed Abrams is borrowing much of the schmaltzy sentiment, a notable hallmark of a man who he undeniably considers his mentor and chief counsel. But while he delivers on the requisite tugging of heart-strings the movie has a distinct feeling of de-ja-vu. Had it not been for the fact that Abrams had previously produced a certain cult monster movie named ""Cloverfield"". A picture which also utilised the basic tool of a film camera to forward the slight plot there wouldn't be an overawing sense of ""been there, seen that about"" the film.In fact it doesn't stop there. The sentimental reflection on small town Americana could be accused of being just as influentially Stephen Kingesque. There are visibly shades of ""It"", ""The Body""(which was brought to the big screen as ""Stand By Me"") and ""Dreamcatcher. Where as in ""The Body"" the youthful Gordie Lachance was having to come to terms with the death of his older brother and is the victim of disapproving rebuke from his father, Joe Lamb has to cope with the death of his mother and try to somehow reconcile with his grieving, over-bearing father. Abrams piles on the apparent nods to familiar cinematic and literary works unashamedly although to his merit there is a deftness to the skill with which he applies and moulds it altogether although the outcome is a somewhat routine and superficial.The show-stopping train crash that acts as the catalyst that sets the main plot in motion is however a testament to Abram's formidable talents as a director. The fact that it involves children rather than adults being thrown in to the lions den marks it out as a daring set-piece and one that no doubt was a challenging one to film.The young cast that are undoubtedly the heart of the movie are the epitome of a rag-tag group of feisty, nerdy or just plain bossy kids. There is a likable, exuberant chemistry shared by the young actors which benefits the film so they are not irritating. Their idiosyncrasies being for the most part endearing. Although ultimately it is chiefly left to Joel Courtney to give the story it's emotional centre with both Riley Griffiths and Elle Fanning just bringing up the rear. A combination of wide eyed innocence which is monumentally shattered he also exhibits a courageous yet gentle conviction making him a worthy hero. The adult stars though don't disappoint either and offer reliably, solid support with both Kyle Chandler and Ron Eldard endeavouring to apply further emotional weight behind the film with their respective performances. But as any film of this kind it needs it's human antagonist that works as a common antagonist to both the Alien fugitive and the townsfolk which takes shape in the form of the air-force headed by Noah Emmerich's obsessive, single minded Col. Nelec. A character that could so easily have been in some part inspired by ""Dreamcatcher's"" merciless Col. Abraham Curtis. Brutally and efficiently militaristic with an unnerving, imposing calm he is a far cry from the more amiable and kindly government agent ""Keys"" played by Peter Coyote in Spielberg's ""E.T.""As for the Alien itself when it finally rear's in to full view on screen while it is excellently brought to live with the most advanced state of the art CGI. It's a rather less than overawing experience seeing as it's not something we really haven't seen before. Although younger less experienced audience members may be less inclined to be as unimpressed and stare open-mouthed in wonderment or rush behind the nearest chair or sofa in fear. It's merely a less than sweet cherry on a cake of middling quality. Although not awful ""Super 8"" is a second rate, bitter-sweet attempt at a family friendly salute to one of cinema's leading pioneer film-makers. Honourable in intent but passable when it comes to the final analysis it will appeal more to a less demanding audience while those more cynical of us will find something of adequately diverting time-waster.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Derivative, but still fun and well-made","You can tell that Abrams and Spielberg worked together on this movie, because it's a cross between Goonies, E.T., and Cloverfield, with some Close Encounters thrown in. This is JJ Abram's worst movie, but it's still watchable. As a gen-Xer, this movie took me back (feels like mid-70's), and the ""production values"" are very good. The tween love between Joe and Alice is realistic and likable - probably the best thing about this movie.

"""Super 8"" is a fabulous trip back to the 80s that will bring you some nostalgia and, at least for two hours, we are all children again","Assuming the children's point of view as the basis of the narrative, ""Super 8"" has its best moments precisely when focusing on the dynamics between young people, from the fascination that the unknown awakens in the group to the lack of focus present in their conversations - as in the scene in which, in a snack bar, they begin to discuss what they witnessed and soon divert to jokes, provocations and parallel discussions.Abrams is not concerned with creating a uniquely original narrative, it is full of clichés. However, this does not negatively affect the development of the film. Thanks to this revisitation of conflicts already explored in other films, Abrams guarantees a completely unique nostalgic feeling to his film. The most interesting thing about Abrams' script is its frightening fluidity. The screenwriter does not roll up when delivering the major conflicts right at the beginning of the story. That is, the film is very fast and satisfies the viewer's curiosity in each scene thanks to the intelligent development of each plot. Abrams also does not fail to surprise the audience with the emphasis given to the film's amorous subplot, which ends up becoming more interesting than the main conflict of the film - the alien behaves more like a toast to the viewer.The story of forbidden youthful romance between Joe and Alice is simply enchanting and very well explored. Joe is a completely withdrawn boy thanks to a reason I won't reveal - Joe functions as the typical protagonist overshadowed by supporting actors. However, his confidence and courage slowly return as his relationship with Alice becomes more stable. Alice is the complete opposite of Joe. She is independent, courageous and proud, but still indirectly bears the guilt of a fatality that she considers to have been caused by her father. Here comes another conflict - the one between Louis Dainard, Alice's father, and Jackson Lamb, Joe's father. Jackson, the town marshal, is a discredited character who projects his anger and disappointment onto Louis, ultimately affecting his son's relationship with Alice directly. Jackson is so concerned with protecting everything and everyone thanks to the disaster that occurs in his life, that he ends up forgetting his own son, leaving him completely alienated and alienated from his life. Proof of this are uncomfortable dialogues between the characters. However, Abrams overemphasizes this conflict between the boys' parents to resolve it in a very simplistic way, which may disappoint some. The final situation was perfect for creating a worthy climax to this well-constructed conflict. In addition to exploring this father-son relationship typical of Spielberg films, Abrams tries to mystify the figure of Joe's mother through the necklace that acts as a talisman for the character. Incidentally, relationships in family environments are not lacking in the narrative of ""Super 8"". An example of this is the fun Kaznyk family.Joe's friends are other rare pieces with invaluable charisma. Abrams worked with stereotypes inspired by the juvenile characters of ""The Goonies"". With such good supporting actors, Abrams finds the opportunity to insert a great asset of his script, the essentially innocent and youthful humor. The screenwriter understands very well the troubled essence of pre-adolescence. At this stage of life, it is common to make jokes at completely inappropriate times, discover and be disappointed with your first love, decide what to do with your life and, finally, the constant search for recognition from everyone. All these characteristics are present in the psychology of Joe's friends, especially Charles. Interesting, too, is the distinct metalanguage of his script. Through it, he introduces the attentive public to the functioning of cinematographic departments such as make-up, visual effects, photography and direction.Another aspect that Abrams knew how to work very well from the beginning of his career is the mystery. In this case, the suspense surrounding the emblematic figure of the alien. This happened in the first season of ""Lost"" and in ""Cloverfield"". Here the story could not have been different. He works with the strange effects that occur in the city after the creature's release. Disappearances of animals, people, appliances and the local electricity are mere examples of the pandemonium that the alien causes to the citizens of Lilian who blame, innocently, the communists. Abrams' ET is not a kind creature like the being ""ET - The Extraterrestrial"". He deliberately and violently kills anyone who becomes an obstacle to achieving his goals, after all he is desperate.Abrams casts a cause-and-effect relationship on the extraterrestrial's troubled psyche. The character is tired, irritated and just wants to return to his planet in peace, but the army is determined to recover his cargo to continue torturing him. With this, Abrams makes a very subjective critique questioning the manipulative, dangerous, cowardly and conspiratorial methods of the US military, in addition to the very destructively curious essence of man. Abrams creates very interesting features for his new alien. He suggests that the being's communication is done telepathically through touch. However, the screenwriter does not explain this very well. I still have doubts if the recipient of the message is entitled to a reply to the alien. And why launch an idea that the monster interferes with electronic devices when this ended up being completely outside the character's narrative arc? He tried to create an excellent sci-fi story, but he didn't need to extrapolate to the point where he didn't know what to do with so many elements.With a photograph that oscillates well between the frightening darkness and the illuminated and nostalgic daily life of the heroes (besides, of course, exaggerating in the luminous reflections - or flares - that became almost an Abrams signature), Super 8 is impeccable in its values of production, from the design that efficiently reconstructs the period in focus to the details of props and costumes (such as the obvious wig that covers the head of an almost extra and that helps to compose the logic of that city and its inhabitants). Similarly, the visual effects are also efficient - especially in the sequence involving the train wreck, which still has spectacular sound design. On the other hand, the sound effects are disappointing for betting on the cliché when conceiving the creature's roar - which, as in Cloverfield, also disappoints in its confusing and personality less look (which partly explains why the film works better while Abrams does not). Reveals, extracting an important lesson from ""Jaws"" by keeping it hidden most of the time in the shadows, behind trees or even huge light signs).J. J. Abrams shows impeccable mastery in orchestrating the train derailment sequence. This is a scene that went down in movie history. It is considerably long, complex and full of features to make the atmosphere unique. Abrams blows it all up and throws fog, dirt, wood and metal into the scene as he shoots with several Dutch shots to illustrate it. So, Abrams teaches Mr. Michael Bay how to engage the viewer in these catastrophe scenes. After all, there's no point in blowing up the world if the viewer doesn't care about the characters. Evidently, this is not the case. Another craze of Abrams is to hide the alien being in every possible way. Plates, treetops, broken glass, reflections, shadows are some examples of how the director hides the monster. In the end, he reveals his creature for a few moments, but uses a very desperate device to humanize it.Incidentally, the more ""Super 8"" reveals to the viewer, the worse it gets: not only is its creature pathetic (including the ""climactic"" revelation of its eyes, in a dreadful attempt to humanize it), but also its motivations - and it is impossible, in retrospect, defend the film's explanation for what happens to the humans captured by the ""monster"" (especially considering what happens in the third act, which is too convenient and artificial). Furthermore, the subplot involving Joe (Courtney) and Alice's (Fanning, fabulous) relationships with their respective fathers are Manichaean and melodramatic, shamelessly trying to thrill through cliché and an unconvincing resolution. As if that were not enough, Abrams still creates a very weak villain who, even played by the good Noah Emmerich, is nothing more than a caricature of the crazed military man.The filmmaker fails only in the visual cues he gives the audience. Thanks to these tips, Abrams makes the film predictable in some key moments. However, it's easy to think you're watching a Spielberg film, rather than a work directed by Abrams thanks to the enormous similarity in the direction of the two. The ending of the film is similar to that of ""E. T. - The Extra-Terrestrial"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"". Another scene that takes place on a bus is practically the same as a segment from ""Jurassic Park: The Lost World"". As a result, Abram loses the opportunity to create original scenes for his feature, excluding the much-discussed disaster scene.""Super 8"" is a fabulous trip back to the 80s that will bring you some nostalgia, but don't worry, the viewer will leave the session satisfied. It is also something that marvels the senses and excites in the right measure. It is one of the best works of Steven Spielberg's entire career, only directed by J. J. Abrams, the pupil who correctly learned the master's lessons and now surprises by delivering a work at the height of the original. Melancholic without being corny, electrifying without being empty, contagious without abusing clichés, fun without being gratuitous: it is a film that hits all the proposed questions. And it still leaves anyone in the audience with a huge smile on their face, provoking the feeling that, at least for two hours, we are all children again.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
As Good As You Hoped It Would Be,"J. J. Abrams (creator of Lost) makes his greatest film yet with this homage to his hero, Steven Spielberg. The fact that Spielberg co- produced this movie with Abrams helps to make it seem like a class 80's Spielberg movie. And who doesn't like that?In the middle of a small Midwestern town in 1979, a group of middle schoolers are trying to make a short film with a Super 8 mm camera. One night they all sneak out of their homes and head to the train station. They film the scene as a train is passing for ""production value"", but suddenly a pickup truck smashes headlong into the train. After a fantastically over-the-top train wreck, Joe witnesses something escape from the train.Although the movie does involve monsters and science-fiction, the focus remains on the kids. Joel Courtney plays the main character, Joe, who is reeling from his mother's death, and strikes up a relationship with Alice, played by Elle Fanning, who steals the show. But all of the kids are phenomenal, each one hitting the nail on the head with preteen awkwardness; and Kyle Chandler is great as Joe's dad, the sheriff who has to deal with losing his wife, and the strange happenings in town.The script, written by Abrams, is exciting and skillfully paced. There always seems to be several subplots going on at once, yet there is never a moment of confusion about what is going on. Packing in action, emotion, and commentaries about childhood, Abrams' script never stops short of pure entertainment.As for directing, Abrams makes a fantastic popcorn movie, the kind of which hasn't been made since—well, Spielberg's last film. Abrams gives a wonderful feeling to his movie, always putting the audience in the midst of it all as if they were a part of the town. Some may argue that Super 8 is much more than a popcorn movie, and perhaps it is. The point is it doesn't really matter, because either way, this movie rocks.A Spielberg homage like this is very interesting and entertaining to watch. This reviewer certainly hopes Abrams has a long and fruitful film career, especially if he continues to make movies of this caliber. A wildly exciting and beautifully photographed film, this summer blockbuster should not be missed.http://thatguythatlikesmovies.blogspot.com",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The kids here are joyful to watch, especially Elle Fanning who really comes into her own, not just to be thought of has Dakotas younger sister.

The Vidiot Reviews...,"Super 8Although technology's made it easier for young filmmakers to bring their vision to life, without product placement they'll never have a hit.Case in point: the movie being filmed by the teenagers in this sci-fi film.After his mother's death, Joe (Joel Courtney) finds solace assisting his friend (Riley Griffiths) with his 8mm movie.However, while shooting exterior scenes at night, the crew captures images of a train derailment and a creature fleeing from the wreckage.Now, with strange occurrences transpiring around town, it's up to the deputy (Kyle Chandler) to locate the monster before the military lays waste to his jurisdiction.With a superlative cast of up-and-coming actors, Super 8 starts as a thrilling mystery, but, by the end, is nothing more than a trite extraterrestrial tale.Besides, if the kids really wanted to make a viral video, then they should've got footage of the alien ghost-riding his UFO.

Supernatural coming of age story,"""Super 8"" is a 2011 mystery thriller directed by J.J. Abrams starring Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning. This movie and I have shared a history together, even if I watched for the first time today. I still remember how I went on a field trip in school and this film was planned to be broadcasted on TV. I was encouraged to watch it with my class mates, but in the end, I was the only one who didn't watch it, simply due to the fact that I was chicken hearted as hell back in then and suddenly decided against it. That's why it was a strange moment for me to finally give it a watch today, with my sisters that are now the same age I was back then and to see that things have come full circle in some way. It wasn't even as bad as I heard, as many complained about the film's nature. To be honest, it's sorta misleading. What else but a masterpiece would you have expected from a Spielberg production in form of an alien film? Another ""Close Encounters Of The Third Kind""? Another ""E.T.""? Well, maybe, but remember it's basically an Abrams directed movie. What I immediately realized is that the film is no horror film in the first place, but a coming of age story of eight Ohio small town teenagers trying to make it as a film crew that is coincidentally drawn into the supernatural situation. The film's greatest achievement is how it successfully managed to bring a loveable group of friends to the big screen that stands out even in comparison to the adult actors. Even though he only functions as a producer, the Spielberg type of magic is palpable between the characters. They all also perform on a decent level, but Elle Fanning is terrific in here! She's one of my favourite actresses and really impressed me again, as she's shining in every scene she's in. It fits decently into the atmosphere of the film that's more children friendly mystery thriller than an alien horror flick. Nevertheless, one of the most prominent flaws of this flick are the run time and story development. It's stretching it's substance way too much and this sorta disturbs a consistent and well paced buildup of suspense. Aside from that, it's not overall scary and the design of the alien isn't quite frightening, but it definitely has some unexpected medium level brutality in it that hits if you constantly remind yourself that it's a children suitable film in the first place. It wasn't the most brutal thing I've ever seen in a film, but I personally still felt totally nervous at times, cause I always tried to see it from the perspective of my teenaged sisters who sat next to me and possibly might find it too scary. Considering this, I was unintentionally thrilled at times together with them and I think that was an advantage, as I was able to see it as if I was a member of the target audience. Furthermore, as it's known from a Spielberg production, it also had a family conflict elaborated in it, a story of loss, grieving and letting go and the final scene with the necklace was heartwarming, least to say. All in all, this flick is more of a supernatural drama than a horror film and definitely plays a significant role as a coming of age film for young adults to learn from. While it has a nice concept, it could have focused more on the flair of it's time, but still manages to entertain decently. It's a promising formula that's already shown there that, if it was perfectly executed, might be iconic and, in my opinion, eventually hit the screen as the famous Netflix show ""Stranger Things"". It's a fun watch, go in it without expecting too much.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Best movie of 2011 so far!,"""Super 8"" is the movie they used to make back in ""the good old days."" Back when special effects were creatively used to serve the story and characters, not just there to cover the screen and show off the latest tech. Back when kids in films would act like real people without being over-simplified and dumbed-down. Back when films were made seemingly to grab at your imagination, not just make a quick buck. In an era of the endless sequel/retread/reboot/prequel/cash-in, Super 8 arrives like a breeze on a warm day. It is the greatest homage to classic 70's and 80's sci fi adventure that has been attempted. It is for all of us that grew up on films like E.T, Close Encounters, The Goonies, and Stand By Me. It is for anyone that saw a Steven Spielberg film and was moved by the sense of wonder he brought to them, the way I was the first time I saw movies like Jurassic Park, Jaws, or Back to the Future. It is for all of us that appreciate the art of film making. And in glorious two dimensions to boot.I've gotten this far without mentioning who is behind all of this. Super 8 was written and directed by JJ Abrams (director of 2009's Star Trek and Mission:Impossible 3, producer of Cloverfield, and creator of shows such as Lost and Fringe), and it should come as no surprise to find that Steven Spielberg himself was the producer. Abrams has clearly always had a love for Spielberg's work, and the passion with which he creates this tribute is clear from the start. He inserts references to almost all of Steven's trademarks, taking elements from those famous films and expertly crafting the film to play as familiar but never ripped-off or copied. It's more the sense of adventure and mystery that he owes to the original films than the actual story. Sure, some cynics may disagree, but I never felt like I was watching a movie I had seen before. Similar feelings and themes were invoked, but I was never less than enthralled with what would happen next.Super 8 bases much of it's humor and young group of friends dynamic off of what we loved in The Goonies and Stand by Me. I was surprised and impressed with just how funny the dialog and banter is. There was numerous one-liners that had my group of friends cracking up and repeating them afterward. Even in the midst of intense action, Abrams manages to sneak in some great humor without it feeling forced or contrived. Abrams recognizes that without these well-rounded and endearing characters, all the special effects in the world are meaningless. Sure, they look great (alright, I admit the opening train sequence is pretty ridiculous), but what makes everything work is we really do care about these characters and we are eager to see how they overcome their obstacles.It's no accident that the plot starts off with the kids trying to shoot their own movie. Abrams bases the story in the late 70's, and we are immediately treated to a wondrous sequence that gives us a taste of their lives while setting up an effective atmosphere. And for those that are wondering, Super 8 gets its name from the young wanna-be film makers in the actual story, trying to shoot their movie on Super 8 film, like so many did in those days. It isn't long before the big mystery begins, and the way it unravels will be no shock to Abrams' veterans. He wisely believes in the idea of less-is-more, and waits to tie everything together. Of couse, I'd be lying if I said there was some huge twist that will blow your mind. That's not the point or goal. In that regard, it comes off well because the motivations for everyone (no, I'm not going to spoil everything this movie is about, you can go elsewhere if you insist on that) are so believable. There wasn't any point where I got frustrated at a lack of understanding. Not everything needs to be explained thoroughly, what matters is that we know what's going on and essentially why. When a film has multiple layers and stories, it can be a burden for some to keep up with it. This was a problem for some when viewing LOST, and although Super 8 is hardly as complex, the same rules apply.In the end, Super 8 is a great time at the movies, in every way a great time at the movies should be. It entertains first and formost, but features undeniable humor, a fun mystery, fresh performances, and a feeling that I have not felt since I grew up with all those films Abrams' carefully emulates. The nostalgia factor may have been a big part, but I don't care. As one review so astutely put it, ""It's a great thing to see a motion picture spectacle that does not require a temporary lobotomy for gratification."" An easy front-runner for best movie of 2011, Super 8 is an enjoyable adventure for all but the biggest cynics. 9/10",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A true masterpiece,"If there's one movie you shouldn't miss this year, it's Super 8. There's more heart and soul in it's two hour running time than most mainstream movies could ever hope to conjure. It's the kind of film that reminds you of why you go to the movies.In the current era of CGI laden, soul-dead adventure flicks, Super 8 distinguishes itself by having heart. There is an authenticity to those kids in the film, a familiarity in their conversations. It reminded me of when I was a kid. The friendship between the kids in the film really resonates, and the emotional elements of the film totally deliver. One of the most poignant scenes in the film has nothing to do with whats in the train car, or the air force, and anything like that....rather, its a scene that takes place in Joe's bedroom as he sits on the floor talking to Alice.Super 8 is an Abrams ""Mystery Box"" complete with a satisfying unveiling of the goodies inside. With only his third film, Abrams has made a truly spectacular must-see film that demands to be seen as quickly as possible. Allowing some of the surprises to be spoiled is simply not an option. It's the best movie so far of 2011, and it's a real treat. You do not want to miss it!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A kids film, perfectly done in the style of the mid 80's. Expect that and you'll enjoy it.","I think the marketing strategy in part is working against Super 8 - preventing it from getting better reviews. For months we were fed mysterious viral footage online and teased with images of something huge and terrifying beating it's way out of military train wreck.Obviously when you set a film up like that you're going to get a lot of disappointed reviews from audience members who expected something a little more adult, more serious... more... Cloverfield.But let me tell you what this film is, straight up: it's a kids film.It's 100% nostalgia - a pleasant trip back to the mid 80's. If you fondly remember The Goonies, The Explorers, Flight of the Navigator, ET, Gremlins and their ilk then you're going to dig this. There's no attempt at an evolution or updating of those styles - the film is pure homage and JJ Abrams nailed it.There's a certain sadness here for the thirty-somethings that grew up in the 80's - a realization that those old films you loved weren't *that* great and were in fact, kind of shallow and cheesy - as is this one. But there's also a big deep breath of fresh air - a momentary relief from the current trends of rapid editing, shaky cam, perversely convoluted plots and arcless characters. This is good, old fashioned three-act, well-arced storytelling. The camera, for the most part, is firmly fixed on a tripod. There's a simple love story. Some simple parent-child relationship stuff, and a clear theme of moving on from loss. I for one found myself grinning from ear to ear through most of it.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the best movies I have ever seen,"*****Spoiler Alert***** When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I could not wait to see it. Every time I saw this trailer, I had goosebumps. That did not change when I first saw this film. This movie grips you and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The movie is very well acted, which is surprising since there are many young actors in the film. Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning really had break-out roles in this film, especially Joel Courtney. He is perfect in this movie and really makes it a great movie. Kyle Chandler also plays the 'grieving father' role perfectly. At the end, when Joel Courtney(Joe Lamb) and Kyle Chandler(Jack Lamb) hug for the first time, and when he lets go of his necklace, I cried. I am a teenage male and have never cried while seeing a movie, which only proves how much of an affect this movie has on the viewer. I definitely recommend seeing this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Modernized Love Letter to 80s Adventure Flicks is Sometimes Too Indulgent,"For better or for worse, this certainly wasn't what I was expecting. At times an innocent, slice of life glimpse back at childhood in the very late 1970s, the film's sudden, jolting leaps into completely different genres left me disoriented and on edge for its duration. Mixing equal parts of The Goonies, Cloverfield, ET and Red Dawn in the same blender, the final product admittedly feels a bit blotchy and uneven. Rather than running from the stereotypes inherent in each ingredient, like a cast of minors fleeing a destructive unseen monster, Super 8 wears them boldly on its chest like a badge of honor. In many ways this plays out like a picture from the distant past, more concerned with upping the ante and bringing an excess of action and adventure than delivering any messages beneath the surface. A broad, varied lead cast toes the line between strong characterization and oversharing, while their less-than-stellar supporting characters bring the cheese in lethal doses. It's a fantastic popcorn muncher with a fascinating knack for the unpredictable, but much, much more shallow than anything else in the Abrams catalog. Fun for a single viewing, I doubt I'll be back for more.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
SUPER 8 is Super Lame,"What a roller coaster ride!! I'm not talking about SUPER 8 itself, but am referring to the marketing blitz and mysterious buzz this film's had over the past year. Since May of 2010, this film's had a buzz even before the casting was finalized. There were rumors that SUPER 8 was either the prequel or sequel to CLOVERFIELD and then that it was a stand-alone ""giant creature runs amok"" film. Either way I was really looking forward to seeing SUPER 8 for the better part of a year. Then all of a sudden Steven Spielberg got involved. Hhmmm. Sure he terrified us with JAWS and somewhat scared us with POLTERGEIST, but since then I really can't say Spielberg has done anything all that interesting in the genre. And then I saw the trailer; the trailer where all you see are children and floating cars. I suddenly found myself not all that excited anymore. My gut was telling me this was gonna be a pathetic kid's flick; an E.T. for the new generation. My gut was right.I'm angry people; seriously angry. I went to the midnight screening of SUPER 8 and realized that 90% of the cast aren't even allowed to stay up that late. Let me summarize what this film is and then explain why I did indeed hate it. That's right; I hated this movie. SUPER 8 is nothing more (and I mean nothing more) than THE GOONIES meets E.T. meets every single coming-of-age kids' drama ever made. Now let me be clear: I love THE GOONIES. It's a great film because I knew I was getting a fun kid's movie. SUPER 8 was marketed as a ""giant creature destroying stuff"" movie. There's more sentimentality and schmaltzy emotion in SUPER 8 than in most romantic comedies. I had to double check to make sure Rob Reiner didn't direct this one. Let's get to the story.The film begins with a funeral. Little Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney) lost his mom in a factory accident. A steel girder turned her into a pile of goo. Joe's dad, Jackson Lamb (Kyle Chandler) is the small town's deputy and is a good candidate for the Worst Father of the Year award. Now keep in mind that all the kids in this film are in middle school yet act and think like adults. It's a total Spielbergian world here. Joe's helping his tubby friend Charles (Riley Griffiths) make a zombie film. One night at midnight (that's right; midnight ... are there no good parents in this entire town??) Joe, Charles, Preston (Zach Mills), Martin (Gabriel Basso), and Alice (Elle Fanning) all gather outside of town at the train station to film a scene. There's a horrendous train wreck which some thing survives, and it goes on a semi-killing spree in the town. First the electricity is knocked out, then people and pets go missing.The creature takes a back seat to the drama going on with the kids and Abrams doesn't miss any of the common coming-of-age/GOONIES/E.T. trappings. Does the main kid, Joe, go through some kind of trauma? Check. Does Joe have an estranged relationship with his father that gets reconciled with as much cheese as possible? Check. Does Joe have a sweet, innocent love interest? Check. Does his love interest, Alice, have an estranged relationship with her dad? Check. Is there a mystery that only the kids can solve because the parents are all ineffectual? Check. Do we have a funny, fat kid? Check. Is there an evil military dude. Check. Is there a semi-scary looking, misunderstood creature who's really just scared and is more ""human"" than the ""monstrous"" military guys tracking it down? Check. Yup; its all here, and when you add it all up there's nothing scary or horrifying in this entire film.The best thing going on here is the train wreck in the beginning. Abrams knows how to film a great wreck (i.e., the plane crash in the pilot of LOST) and the train wreck here is spectacular. But after that everything takes a back seat to the kid's, their problems, and their drama. I was also confused with the tone/setting of the film. It obviously takes place in the 1980's, but it feels as though it's set in the 1960's. The tone was all wrong.SUPER 8 is pure, 100% sappy schmaltz marketed as a genre film. Everything about this film is targeted at a young crowd and it blatantly and liberally rips off THE GOONIES and E.T. We even get floating bikes and a touching ending. Technically this movie is extremely well done. The acting is strong from the young cast and it's filmed beautifully. It's just the content that I hated. The story offers absolutely nothing new and what's worse, the movies SUPER 8 rips off are way more enjoyable. SUPER 8 will definitely find an audience but if you're looking for an edgy monster flick, SUPER 8 is definitely not for you. You never feel any of the kids, or even main adults, are ever in danger, and the only scares Abrams musters are from having a loud accent of music as something jumps out of a shadow.SUPER 8 is a huge disappointment and a rare miss by JJ Abrams ... a HUGE miss. Even though the credits assure is that SUPER 8 was written and directed by JJ Abrams, there's no doubt this is a Steven Spielberg film. If you're looking for a sugary kid's flick a la THE GOONIES, then go watch THE GOONIES. If you're looking for a disgustingly sentimental film like E.T, then go watch E.T. If you're looking for a giant creature film like CLOVERFIELD, then go watch CLOVERFIELD. But if you wanna be completely disappointed and feel let down after 12 months of hype and buzz, then SUPER 8 is what you're looking for. I hated this film.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A monster mystery adventure tethered to a coming of age, interpersonal maturation.","JJ Abrams likes keeping secrets. He has a penchant for keeping his film plots quiet. The director of the secretive disaster movie Cloverfield and creator of the TV series Lost, Abrams finds pleasure in making his audience unable to anticipate. ""I just feel like now that before the movie starts, I've been told almost everything,"" he says. With JJ, we're lucky we get anything .His latest installment Super 8 occurs in the rural town of Lillian, Ohio. The year is 1979, and Abrams makes us fully aware we are spending time in his boyhood era. He unleashes a time capsule of greatest hits like ""Don't Bring Me Down"" and ""My Sharona"" listened to on a newly purchased Walkman. The town's main street has the old-time effect branded onto its store signs and streetlights. News reports on Three-mile island make white noise and bounce off the wood-paneled kitchen walls. The scene is certainly set.Using some of this new technology is Charles (Riley Griffiths), who wields his 8mm camera around while gathering his rag-tag group of friends together for his Zombie movie which he plans to enter in a local competition. The main character, Charles's best friend and chief makeup artist, is Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney), a somber kid-artist who paints figurines and designs toy trains. His mother's earlier death at a steel mill heightens tension between his deputy father and also opens a relationship with Alice (Elle Fanning), an older girl who reluctantly signs on to play a part in Charles's movie.The allusions to Spielberg are evident and for a reason; he is the producer after all. The classic grouping of middle school friends seem omnipresent in Spielberg flicks, take The Goonies and E.T. Abrams combines the familiar collection of kids, mystery, and monsters and it syncs up well for the majority of the film. The plot follows a familiar road but the element of surprise and emotional correspondence give a tired sequence new life, for a while.In order to shoot ""The Case,"" the title of Charles's movie, Alice steals her dad's car and without a license drives them to an old train platform for a midnight scene. They begin rolling when a speeding train comes charging down the tracks and Charles, seeking ""production value"" decides to re-shoot the scene as the train blisters by. Then things get weird. A reckless truck soon crashes into the freighter that enacts an exaggerated domino-like effect of cars being tossed into the sky and returning to the earth smoldering with mysterious content. Shades of Michael Bay linger on into the fire-lit night .The group, filled with nerds and oddballs, like the pyrotechnic brace face that keeps fireworks in his backpack, struggles with keeping their twilight account secretive. The military soon bombards the quiet town with oppressive orders. Metal objects begin disappearing, dogs start fleeing the radius, and even some people go missing. Like the great child narratives, the adults are clueless, and the government is clearly hiding something from us. The young film makers are trapped in their heads; worried, determined, but opportunistic. Their small movie becomes the driving force in their quest to stay together, figure out the unknown, and in a less cliché way, find themselves.Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning bring this blossoming tale some young teen attraction and show their acting chops throughout. However, the relationships soon get sidetracked by the necessity of the monster's plot . Flickering lights and floating cars soon take over the foreground and Joe's stern father gets overshadowed by the military's growing presence. These camouflaged scenes become distracting to our main character's plight and become a beacon of questioning that is never torched properly. Inquiries into this mysterious origin are hinted at, but only serve to miss the point of this group story.The human element of this film is what glues these kids together. Besides the undeveloped, maternal sentimentality that occurs between young Joe and his deceased mother, the growing friendships and adapting household brings in a Stand By Me appeal where the innocent and curious place faith in untested collaboration. The destructive forces in Cloverfield certainly make their way into this film though, and the ""production value"" is sure to make Charles proud. Abrams puts a heavy dosage of suspense and fire-power that orchestrate into large noise. But this does not crescendo out of control and remains a monster mystery adventure tethered to a coming-of-age, interpersonal maturation.Though Spielberg's presence, sans a John Williams score, is noticeable, Super 8′s structure is injected with strong performances that refuel a unique group adventure. Abrams is unable to pull the two separate plots into complete harmony but they synchronize just enough; and just enough for Abrams is a whole lot more than anyone can ask for, at least this summer.Check out my site in its entirety at h t t p://field of films. word press. com",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Childhood through the ""Super 8"" mind","As I sat back in my chair, I could not help but return to a time of riding my BMX dirt bike, and being denied an opportunity to play Dungeons & Dragons with my older brothers. Super 8 hearkens back to a time where the imagination was not hindered by technology. This is a story of six middle school kids, making a horror flick within the backdrop of a small iron town in Ohio during the late seventies. The super 8 camera, these kids use to make their film, becomes the central character, that not only unites the kids, but captures the brooding antagonist, that eventually terrorizes this sleepy town.Just watching this film, I could not help but to feel that I was a eight year old, transfixed as Elliot was whisked away with ET, or frightened as Carol Ann announced that ""They're Here"" in Poltergeist. The cinematography, acting, and pacing lets me know just how much of a protégé of Steven Spielberg, JJ Abrams truly is. It is refreshing to see a Summer blockbuster movie concentrate more on story, characters, and suspense more than special effects. Don't get me wrong, as an animator, I enjoyed the animation and realism of the foreboding creature. But the monster and the effects became a secondary piece to the film as a whole.I think it's a wonderful change to revert to a style of film making, and even a period of time, where the imagination and creativity were king. When people inevitably become older, we always say that times were better when we were kids. In my biased opinion, I believe that applies to the style and story of this film. I just hope that the younger generations could unplug for a little while, and find at least some inspiration from this film.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Nostalgia for the midlifer,"Cloverfield meets Stephen King's It... granted... but I quite enjoyed the movie J.J. Abrams served us, maybe because my expectations weren't so high. Clearly you could see Stephen Spielberg's influence seeping through, but I wasn't bothered by this, because after all; it has been a while when we saw something good coming from him.Also it was wonderful to see all those little things I had forgotten about coming back to me, like the first time when the walkman with headphones came out to the public or when films/photos still needed to be developed in a store. Of course this has to do with my age, but these kinda things brought me right back to my own childhood and that's probably also the reason why this movie hit me on personal note I guess.All in all nostalgia for the ones who lived and seen the period before the digital age. 8/10Don't forget to watch the credits too!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Genuine movie magic for the first time in a long time.,"There are many reasons why I was destined to really hate Super 8. I have lost practically all interest in summer blockbusters. I have a deep hatred for Steven Spielberg. However, J.J. Abrams does something absolutely magical here. He creates a genuine spectacle, an experience that somehow feels familiar yet entirely unique. In a time where every other week we're seeing some diluted $150 million blockbuster, nothing feels genuinely epic anymore. Entire planets can be destroyed and it's hard to even fake interest, because it's all done over and over again. Each week is an attempt to up the ante from the last massive explosion-fest and at this point they're all just boring to me. People get confused when I claim that things like Transformers and Iron Man 2 just genuinely bore me to tears, but how could I not be bored when nothing can be a spectacle anymore. Somehow, some way, Abrams has done the impossible and made movies...magic, again.This picture is basically the epitome of the summer blockbuster, but Abrams makes it unique by essentially bringing it back to basics. He strips away the superheroes and the explosion after explosion peril and actually builds a film around it's characters. He creates this human drama, a coming-of-age story in the most interesting of circumstances, and then builds this alien blockbuster around it. Whereas all of these other big pictures are starting off with the explosions and then trying to add character filler to keep it going, Abrams starts at the ground floor by building real people and working outwards from there. In doing this, he creates an emotional drama with the kids in the picture and as a result all of the enormous action sequences actually feel epic because they feel so out of the ordinary. We're just focusing on the story of these children, first love and tested friendships, and then the unthinkable happens. And this time it's actually unthinkable, not just a run of the mill expectation.The train crash near the beginning of the film is the perfect example of this. When huge explosions of this nature occurred in films like Terminator Salvation or Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, I didn't blink an eye. I was legitimately bored because there was no surprise or out-of-this-world extravagance to it. But here we are just focusing on these kids telling a story and then this huge explosion occurs and they are thrust into the middle of a terrifying accident where their lives are on the line. I honestly can't remember the last time that I actually sat with my eyes open and my mouth dropped, stunned by the intensity of such an exciting action sequence. This film brought to me things that I never thought I could experience again; it made me feel like a kid one more time.It's obvious that Super 8 draws a lot from the Steven Spielberg pictures of the '70s and '80s, but I think Abrams is a much more skilled director than Spielberg ever was. Yes, he's only directed three films so I'm sure this comment will get a lot of flack, but I firmly believe it. This one film is a better creation than anything Spielberg has done, and I think the primary reason is because of what Abrams does with these characters. In building the story around these kids he makes it all feel so real. The sentimental moments don't feel like typical Hollywood schmaltz like they do with Spielberg's work, they feel genuine and therefore hit my heart pretty strong. Some of the moments between Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning (who gave two extraordinary performances for any actor, let alone children) honestly brought tears to my eyes. He creates real people here and therefore the stakes are genuine, the emotions are authentic and everything is a real life spectacle.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Nostalgic and very well told,"Some friends in a little town. A bunch of kids faced to a completely unimaginable situation. A small city isolated by a strange happening. The military taking over. The sweet smell of distant childhood as remembered by sensitive ones. A movie within a movie (or maybe ""a dream within a dream"", Poe dixit). Tell you something? Yeah, there are a few specialist on these matters. John Carpenter in ""Village of the Damned"", ""The Fog"", ""Christine"", Stephen King (""It"", ""The Stand"", ""The Body"", ""Duma Key"" and a million et ceteras) and Steven Spielberg (""Jaws"", ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"", ""E.T.""). And so on. All of them share a very personal view about the reality: the world is a strange, hostile place to live in, and the only way is the group, call it friendship, loyalty or love, but the group anyway.This movie is about just that: a bunch of friends, young kids in a journey of knowledge, a ritual of manhood, an unbelievable event that force them to grow up, to mature, to start giving value to thinks they never thought about before.J.J. Abrams (without any shame or guilt, because this film is just about this) develops a powerful tale of love and friendship among an apocalyptic chaos, unleashed in a small village by an unprecedented event. But the story isn't about the event, but our society and the way we raise our children.If you look carefully (or even casually at all), you'll quickly see that, smartly enough, Abrams switches parts from the very beginning: all the kids behavior like grownups, with decision and intelligent thinking, and all the adults do the very opposite: they are selfish, childish, totally unfocused on those things that really matters.And when the chaos menaces lives and the happiness of everyone, the one and only solution rises from beyond the hard feelings and confusion, and then the climax claims its terrain.Mr. Abrams gives his tribute to, yes, ""E.T."", yes, ""Stand by me"" and even ""Close Encounters"" as many editors correctly pointed out in other reviews, and, more noticeably, to John Carpenter (look for the underground sequence and tell me if you didn't expect to find Dr. Blair down there, if you know what I mean) and George Romero, all of them films, books and artists who share the same vision about life, collaboration and love. And, homage after homage in visuals, SFX and score, builds a movie of pure entertainment, a story of passion and emotion, and a big moral about the dangers of power and moral descent.The movie is a very enjoyable experience for all audiences, and a very spectacular one indeed, despite some over-the-top CGIs (the train, mainly).Embedded in this great script and direction, you will find some real gems: those two miracles of non-methodic (in the sense of not committing with Stanislavski-Grotowski Actor's Studio acting method), negative performances (the excellent and ever-focused child actors Elle Fanning and Joel Courtney), an amazing beauty (Amanda Michalka) and the promising future star (yes, we can foresee that) Riley Griffiths as the kid who directs the movie within the movie (which results you'll can appreciate along the end credits).Watch, also, for the miraculous Fanninng's performance in the train station, immediately previous to the train's entering.Worth seeing: You bet your life.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great Movie,"This will definitely become one of the surprise hit of summer, 20011. I haven't had so much fun watching a film since first seeing Close Encounters. Although, the movie's title can be quiet misleading, the film itself is a masterpiece. Totally fun, exciting, adventurous, and thrilling. The special effects are mind-blowing, the kid's characters were believable, and the script was written to kept even the most calm natured, on the edge of their seats. The movie is actually a story within a story, but it never loses its sense of reality blended in a very science fictional plot. It's early seventies setting has a sort of magical effect on the senses, a walk down memory lane with some of the hit songs played in the background. Do not cheat yourself. This is a must film for the whole family to see.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Elle Fann-tastic,"I would categorize this movie with the Goonies an ET. It has a similar style and feel. The characters really made the movie for me. Elle Fanning deserves awards and accolades galore, she was amazing. I am blown away that a child her age can act with such brevity and emotion! Super 8 combines comedy, suspense and action in a way that hints of classic Spielberg. I feel that Super 8 is probably not the best title, however, I'm not sure what a better one would be. I was entertained, the way summer blockbusters used to entertain before tasteless sex and ridiculous shock factor scenes became trendy. Super 8 is clever and exciting, but only time will tell if it will go down in history with the films in whose footsteps it closely follows. As for now, it was worth the money spent to see it in the theater, and that's good enough for me.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Nutshell Review: Super 8,"The first indication that this is a throwback and homage to science fiction of the 70s and 80s, is the Amblin logo that came up at the start. After all, Steven Spielberg had given the world Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and ET, two major alien films that had strong characterization and a compelling storyline filled with plenty of human drama, compared to these days when the attention is all focused on who can come up with the baddest looking aliens that can wreck havoc on Earth. Even Spielberg himself had a go with the modern update to War of the Worlds that failed to capture the charm of his earlier sci-fi films.So he took on the producing role, partnering with J.J. Abrams who took on writing and directing responsibilities for Super 8, in what I would deem very ET like, except for the fact that the alien encounter is anything but friendly to a certain extent, more like District 9 style where us humans basically like to, as far as the movies go, enslave anything that falls down from the sky, sending in the military might to overpower, and like Paul said it, exploiting all alien technology and capability before sending them for a lobotomy and autopsy. In case you're wondering, no this is not a Cloverfield prequel or sequel, since the net was abuzz with such speculation given its teasing trailer, and Abrams' own credits as producer of Matt Reeves' film.The story has to be kept under wraps, so what I'll do is to fawn over what worked. There will be quarters who may find it a tad too convenient in the way it ended, but I thought that simplicity is beauty - too often these days we're looking for that surprise ending or smart alecky gimmick, that something so effectively bringing the curtains down on a thrill ride get frowned upon, which is a pity because in essence the film reminds us of the days gone where such tricks need not be resorted to, so long as one had a solid story to tell, which is what Super 8 has in abundance in weaving closed loops in its narrative threads, with mystery, action, drama and romance all rolled into one superb summer blockbuster package.Then there's the casting of relative unknowns, and children at that, who did such a superb job they put their older, seasoned counterparts in the industry to shame. We don't see too many films these days where the protagonists are a group of children embarking on that huge adventure, or in this instance, indulging in their passion for, filmmaking! There's portly Charles (Riley Griffiths) the director and writer, his best chum Joe (Joel Courtney) the makeup artist who both have the same crush over their leading lady Alice (Elle Fanning) to form one romantic angle, and not forgetting lead actor Martin (Gabriel Basso), cameraman Preston (Zach Mills) and pyrotechnics and effects specialist Cary (Ryan Lee), all sharing incredible chemistry together as a team working toward a common goal in making a short film in their small town, only to stumble upon an aged old military secret that threatens their way of life.Adequately peppered with comedy balanced with that sense of mystery and tension throughout, J.J. Abrams leaves you consistently wanting more, feeding off nuggets of minute information bits that he reveals a little at a time. I thoroughly appreciated how everything need not be spelt out in verbose, allowing emotions to come through more genuinely as you feel for the characters involved, though leaving the pieces of the puzzle simple enough for anyone to put them all together. Then there's the tease of not showing you the threat, leaving things for the most parts to your imagination, before the inevitable show hand.Action sequences are what you'd come to expect from a summer film, with the tent pole being the spectacular train crash sequence that began with the little filmmakers wanting a little added production value to their film, which in itself - the train rolling by; anyone who had experienced something similar would attest to that relatively nerve wrecking moment - giving way to a larger scale disaster that made it literally rain metal. Other action moments weren't as big scaled as this one was, though no less crafted with subtlety that demonstrated some degree of confidence not to overindulge in the need for special effects shots, again adding to the mystique that the children and their town had to face.But credit will have to go to the trio of Joel Courtney, Riley Griffiths and Elle Fanning, who all did such a great job to anchor their roles. Dakota will probably be looking over her shoulders given her sister's performance in this film, while I'm pretty sure offers will start knocking on the doors of Joel and Riley as the next potential child actors that we will see more of in time to come, who together with the rest of the young cast had the weight of this film carried on their shoulders, if the film were to succeed it will have to depend on the believability of their banter, antics and chemistry, which as mentioned, were really excellent.Oh and don't head out the door once the end credits start to roll, especially if you're curious to know how the group's short film actually turned out to be. Easily one of the best, and potentially the favourite scene of many. At least I know it is for me! Highly recommended, and it waltzes its way into contention to be amongst the best this year had to offer.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Production values, man!  Production values!","Super 8 holds the almost unique position of being a big budget genre release this summer that is not a sequel, remake, or adaptation of a book or comic.(I know. I'm just as surprised as you are.) That said, it's easy to discern the roots of J.J. Abrams' latest project, even if one doesn't notice who's executive producing or what long-unused production company label is in the credits.It's basically the ultimate Valentine yet produced to the work directors like Steven Spielberg, Richard Donner, Joe Dante, and the like had a hand in, back in the late 70s and early 80s. Most specifically the ones that featured snarky but likable kids on a wild adventure.I think some people forget just what a revelation those films were. Released at a time when Disney and other purveyors of family entertainment produced toothless, faded films that people forgot about (if they even bothered to see them in the first place), these movies drew us in with their humor, their heartand the delicious sense of danger.We begin the film with a group of kids who want to win the upcoming Cleveland Super 8 film festival. They have the perfect idea for a movie: ZOMBIES! School is finally out for summer. They're refreshed and ready to make the best monster movie ever.I knew these kids. I used to be one. Sweet, geeky, bickering, goofy, and endearingly innocent.But, all isn't fun and games. Joe, the boy who budding director Chris chose to be their makeup guy, is still secretly mourning his mother, who died in a terrible accident a few months ago. His dad is the town sheriff and is very obviously overwhelmed with being the local law -and- a full-time father.To add spice, the girl who agreed to star in the film and drive them around at night is the daughter of the man indirectly responsible for the death of Joe's mom! It's all familiar, involving coming-of-age soap stuff.The young cast is excellent. They totally sell their friendship, their banter, their heartache, and their desire to do a cool monster movie.But, as things will, a monkey wrench is thrown in after about 20 minutes of youthful innocence and wistfulness. Sneaking off to the local railroad station for ""production values"", they witness a spectacular, terrifying train crash.A crash which releasesSOMETHING into their hometown. Something that wants very much to leave it, at any cost.And it becomes a new movie, with sinister military men, secret monsters, and the kids themselves getting in way over their heads in an attempt to figure out the truthand just possibly save their hometown and the world in the process.The slow reveal of the escaped alien was actually pretty cool. In fact, most of the more exciting scenes in the film are excellently done. I get the feeling many of these images were in J.J.'s head for a long time.On the level of being a nostalgic tribute to the late 70s/early 80s work of Spielberg, it works. It's perhaps one of the most well put together Valentines to those films I've ever seen.Unfortunately, it's never quite able to work on a level deeper than that. The emotional climax of the film is attempted, but they just can't seem to sell it the way it was sold in, say, E.T.. (Or to give a modern example, in almost every Pixar film since Toy Story 2.) I usually enjoy the work of Abrams. I definitely enjoyed this. But it's probably not quite what he wanted to accomplish.That said, the youthful cast is stellar, the eye candy action pieces are jaw-dropping, and at least a third of the film really is as mysterious and wistful as it wants to be. That's more than can be said for many attempts at creating a retro-classic.There are so many wonderful moments I want to spoil but won't. Be on the lookout for an oddball but beautifully touching lesson on zombie behavior. Look for the strange link between the eyes of a beloved, much missed mother and the gaze of a bizarre alien.Look for the way misunderstanding and fear can be replaced by joy and wonderment. Even after bad things happen.And definitely stick around during the credits, where as a bonus you'll get treated to the delights of the completed zombie film.(The first person to make a ""Hey, were there LENS FLARES?

Future modern classic for nostalgic Spielberg fans and newer viewers alike,"It's not for nothing I use apparently contradictory terms in the title. Super 8 is a throwback to those old Steven Spielberg's movies from the 70s/80s made with modern technology. It's not made by Spielberg (only produced) but it could have been made by him. The movie doesn't look old although it takes place in 1979. There's a palpable sense of nostalgia going on and we follow the tribulations of a group of film-making boys (and girl) as a spectacular and peculiar train crash changes their lives. It would be easy to reveal too much but I'll refrain myself. I hope myself that you know as little as possible before watching this.I'll just say that there are fantastical elements including the main one that is rather scary but ambiguous. In fact, I loved how Super 8 harked back to the old school of thought that showing less is more. This could be frustrating, but it wasn't for me because the movie was directed so expertly. In fact, I think that style of directing built up the suspense. You often see the effects but not the cause. The sound effects (especially during the train crash) were amazing and would deserve some kind of award. The special effects were seamless and my disbelief was never suspended because they looked fake or computer-generated. The boys acted quite naturally but the blonde girl was a definite stand-out. In one of the best moments, she play-acts an awkwardly written scene for the boy's amateur film and she's so good, she not only moves the boys but the viewers. The adult actors are mostly stoic but they do their job.The father-son relationship could have been a bit better as it didn't grab me very much. I loved how the story was told without sacrificing characterization. You're never lost and it just flows well. Kudos to the director J.J. Abrahms for doing such a stupendous job at recapturing the magic of the early Spielberg films. It does make us nostalgic in more ways than one, not only for that time period but for that kind of great film. I do also think that younger viewers will enjoy it, but it is rather scary in parts so it would be best for kids 10 and older. Lest I forget, besides the suspenseful moments, there's quite a bit of humour that makes us care about the characters or gives us a little breather. That Super 8 movie at the end is hilarious.Rating: 8 out 10 (Very good)",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Welcome Throwback to Early Spielberg Nostalgia!,"For baby boomers of the 60s, Super 8 is a nostalgic period piece that harks back to the early films of Spielberg. It's Close Encounters meets ET meets The Goonies but with an emotional heartbeat that lifts it above the usual summer blockbuster fare. The film begins with a bereavement which is an indication of its true intentions - a film about pain, loss, broken families and friendship - but wrapped around a fast paced story of an alien cover up that is both thrilling and humorous throughout. The spectacular early train crash, for example, must be seen and (especially) heard in IMAX format to be fully appreciated. The alien is well designed and pleasingly strange and unfamiliar. The three main child leads of Joel Courtney, Riley Griffiths and Elle Fanning deliver pitch perfect performances and in the case of Fanning has shown that she is even more talented than her precocious older sister, Dakota Fanning. An early scene in which Fanning is 'acting' in the Super 8 film will leave you awestruck in wonderment. Overall, Super 8 is not just the film of the summer, it's the film of the year so far. Only a young Spielberg at the height of his powers could have matched it.",,Anonymous,Mystery

Move Thee Reviews: Looking at the Adult World through the Children's Eyes,"The nostalgic trailer of Super 8 Directed by J. J. Abrams is reminiscent of E.T. and Cloverfield. The movie is a cocktail of sci-fi, comedy, family, romance, friendship, teenage growth, monsters and zombies. If you expect to watch a monster movie, you may be thrilled by the second half but disappointed by the first half as it slightly drags. If you intend to watch a family drama, it may not be a great success as the relationships between the fathers and their kids can be further developed.What surprises me most is that the children are perfectly cast. Joel Courtney is adorable and Elle Fanning, with her nuanced facial expressions, brings the audience one of the most engaging moments when her character acts as a detective's wife in a train station. While the two leads have a great chemistry, their friends are hilarious. It is also amusing to look at the adult world through the children's eyes. For instance, the kids act as a soldier, a zombie, a boss, etc. There is a thought provoking scene in which a boy's leg is injured because of a bomb explosion while the kids are still in costume and make-up. When the ""war"" becomes real, the kids are forced to grow up hastily. Indeed, Super 8 can be viewed as a coming-of-age comedy.The movie emphasizes the importance of letting go. Make sure you stick around during the closing credits. This is probably the BEST part of the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

This movie sucks,"This movie is typical of most movies that were made after the 90s. It is completely reliant on special effects, and lacks any kind of a story or plot. Anyone who says that the plot is easy to follow is lying! There is no plot to follow! This movie has no purpose at all.A few kids are making a movie for some project. While filming, there is a train derailment right next to them. It is not unrealistic either. Pickup trucks that run into trains, will always derail THE TRAIN, right (sarcasm people)? After the train derails, aliens and machines appear everywhere, destroying everything in the town.While this is going on, there is a feud between two of the kids' fathers, which totally has everything to do with why aliens are destroying everything. NOT! And that's it folks.The good thing about this review, is that IMDb cannot accuse me of posting a spoiler without warning, because there is no spoiler. This movie has no meaningful, or even exciting ending! It is not thought provoking at all! What concerns me, are that there are people who liked this movie. It really kind of offends me, to be a part of a generation that endorses and accepts ""movies"" of such a sub standard quality. Whatever happened to movies like E.T., Rain Man, A Few Good Men etc.Stephen Spielberg used to make good movies, but he has let me down lately.It is not often that you find movies made after the 90s that have good story lines, plots, climaxes and entertainment. They do get made every now and then(The Matrix, Avatar etc.), but they are rare.Come on Millenials. Lets stop giving these baby boomers weapons to hit us with.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Definitely could have been a lot better,For a film by two good storytellers (Spielberg and Abrams)this movie lacked a compelling story. The actors were very good I have to say they did the best they could with the material they had. It was slow and really didn't get going until well after the train derailed (not a spoiler since it's in every trailer). The human story was okay but the monster story sucked. On another note I wish that writers could find a way to write stories that didn't have unnecessary foul language in it. The way these young kids talked was ridiculous and really turned me off. This is a scary movie and really isn't appropriate for kids under ten and that's part of what's wrong with it. It should have been more ET and Close Encounters and less Lost. 6/10,6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
extraterrestrial,"Abrams film in uniform doses, combines the story of teenage first love and growing up with a monster-movie about how the train ran out of the container creepy and dangerous alien. Originally a completely different subjects, they finally successfully intertwined in an interesting and eventful script. The action takes place in the late seventies, where a group of kids writes a movie about zombies. Particularly curious viewers can wait until the end credits, when they finished work will be shown in full. Meanwhile, the above mentioned alien escapes from a train caught in a catastrophe, and now in a small town lost dogs, people, different things, and electronic devices, and a large group of soldiers occupied the territory under its control.Meticulously closing the frame escaped monster movie sincerely hopes to keep the suspense until the very end, and there is not quickly hurry to demonstrate solid plans for the creation in all its glory, regularly turning away, with a focus on individual limbs, and only occasionally allowing the establishment to consider. Agree whether a patient viewer on so many expectations - still a big issue, but apart from an escaped alien monster movie has something to please.Teenage story told in the context of events, regularly crawls to the front, but it is not eclipsed investigation to find and capture the monster in chrede associated mysterious events. Nevertheless, the babies are handled with their roles in the cast is not difficult uglyadet hints now known directors, but this whole men's team easily beats the gorgeous Elle Fanning, presenting the most colorful character with the most expressive expression. Still would not fall in love in such a protagonist, but that's only between their families turned Shakespeare's passion and mutual hatred, so that the new version of Romeo and Juliet has run off in secret to each other at night. And if a boy came out of a whole accommodating and creative, the Alley presents the heroine, a rebel, even able to steal a car.Adults same characters barely able to attract attention, nondescript military captain and a handful of parents have stood out so much boring and banal in its behavior, which can hardly somehow manifest themselves on the screen, but absolutely template framework papashka unsociable and cold-blooded warriors. In fact more of them and is not required, first be gradually transformed into a near and dear son of man, well deserved second punished for inhumanity, this picture Abrams copes, playing lifeless characters on static relationships.But the closer to the finale, the lost notes of romance and relationships in the young heroes. Replacing a potential first kiss scene in a terrible episode with a slap, completing a very cool meeting with the parents of a tiny touch of your fingers between the main characters, and all further retreat by intrigues, adventures of monsters, and things happening around the military action of the emotions and feelings, as if Abrams is aware that his characters may be too small for a serious love story, and started for the health of an interesting story, he immediately turns her into an instant, reborn in the romance of friendship, and the story of teenagers in a standoff outside threat.Yes, and the monster looks ten times worse than Cloverfield in appearance, though several times shorter. The creature stood out so terrible, dangerous and mnogorukoy that doubt, even in the presence of at least some intelligence in the head with a similar palate. Terrible creation is deservedly expose the threat to life, the desperate rush to justify violent actions and motives, and this duality is really not the best way affects the perception of the film.For a fair share of stones in the garden of the military, and those without pity and little animals inoculated from space are shown in the impartial light, as a much greater evil to the civilian population than the disorderly establishment escaped. And to complement this painting experiments and the cruelty of the visitor from other planets have been superfluous. But the deployed military force with a bunch of explosions and special effects completely delight in the final picture, yet the military is not for nothing in such abundance are presented in the plot. However, no final flight of the spacecraft, or destruction of military equipment, it is not as spectacular as equal to the initial crash of the train, which is only deserved admiration and applause!Concealing a regular appearance of wandering stranger, the film is not seldom creates a fair amount of tension and even the experience of some of the characters. The mystery plays here and there in favor of the circumstances, I wish only that the answer to all questions are not in a hurry, tying all of just too monotonous scene-teasers. The fact that at first aroused interest, gradually tiring, and even seemed to be extremely tense scene in the bus upside down, instead of the proper emotion is only an analogy with the much more terrible scenes of ""Jeepers Creepers 2.""Nostalgic, in many countries and quite smooth in structure to the ""Super 8"" attracts, despite its drawbacks, how serious would they have been. Picture deserves attention and looks with interest, though not in the same breath, with a fair amount of boredom and spots inhibiting the development of the plot scenes, but still leaving behind good memories and pleasant aftertaste. Abrams creation of producer Steven Spielberg came out just a good film, albeit without enthusiasm and willingness to reconsider, but the best choice for family viewing. Leaving a pleasant experience and earning interest of the audience, a film about an alien and the company of children is clearly worth a look.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Nothing super about it,"This was- and I don't take this claim lightly- one of the worst movies I've ever seen. After it was finally over, I rode home from the theatre in utter disbelief, feeling as though I needed a shower to cleanse the reeking resonance from myself. The one positive thing I have to say about the film is that the effects- at times (and mostly early on so that you don't walk out after twenty minutes)- were impressive. The plot is unoriginal and corny; a failing attempt at injecting the overdone ""aliens terrorize a small town"" movie with a bit of drama and depth. After an hour I was still waiting for a glimmer of improvement, only to be wildly disappointed. I am still awestruck that Steven Spielberg attached his name to such a tragedy as ""Super 8."" The only scary part of the whole experience is that this film somehow earned a stamp of approval from anybody, and the most heart-wrenching moment was when I remembered that I had paid to undergo such a painful viewing. Obviously I cannot say enough about the poor quality of ""Super 8."" I'd immediately refuse another showing even if I was bribed.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Mediocre. Unimpressive..Only an 8 if your 8 or have the mentality of an 8 yr old,"You can tell Spielberg was really going for an ET 2 here and you could say he achieved that fame(again) I guess. But to me, and to any intelligent adult this movie is just mediocre. It doesn't break any new ground in any of the genres it whips in and out of. I mean the acting is top notch, but thats to be expected in a gazillion dollar Hollywood movie like this. The characters are likable to an extent, but its just not all its hyped up to be. I have to say, I'm disappointed in the fact that so many people get all warm and fuzzy and jump on the bandwagon at these types of,low on the story, high on Popcorn action and explosions types movie.I understand that its nice to turn your brain off every once in awhile, but movies like this are what they are..100 million dollar Hollywood cotton candy, doesn't really matter who wrote it. Good for the kids, or a family night out, but thats about it.So if you love loud,silly over the top explosions then by all means go out and see this. The kids will love it I promise you that. Your average dimwitted adult may also praise this, but if your like me and like a little substance with your action, or a story with your movie then you can pass this one over until its on TV or cable.6 stars is an honest rating for a movie like this.

Stand By ME.T.,"I have been a sci-fi fan since I first laid eyes on a guy in an alien suit. But, it has been a few years since the genre really felt alive to me. These days, the genre has either forgetting it's roots or tried to hard to push the limits of CGI. Super 8, is the savior I have been waiting for.Super 8 is a truly amazing experience and to say that is a blend of many 80's kids Sci-Fi films is definitely an accurate speculation. However, I feel that the strongest comparison would be E.T. meets Stand By Me. The film has many memorable parts and to spoil them would be a crime so just trust me when I say that it is worth all time and money that you will spend to see it.Finally, watch out for the train scene because it will send your hearing in to a panic. For you Universal monster fans, keep an eye out for a Creature From The Black Lagoon action figure.

The glorious return of the Goonies,"A group of friends consisting of kids of about 12 years old works together to make a film. Using a Super 8 camera and whatever scenery they can find they attempt to put together their master piece so that they can send it in for a competition of sorts. Things get really interesting for them when they see something they shouldn't have seen during one of their sessions.And so the story rolls. Story wise this one isn't exceptional. It begins with people being at the wrong place at the wrong time and from that point on being the unwilling victim of sworn secrecy. Most of the things that happen make some kind of sense and that makes the story good enough.The way it is played out, carried on the shoulders of the children, is cool. Their way of acting is both natural and designed and this works wonders, especially as part of the film hinges on them making a film themselves so there's plenty of acting to be acting so to speak. Most of the adults feel to be at their place too.The first thing I was reminded of when seeing this film was The Goonies, a feeling that never went away during the rest of the film. That film had the same kind of touch to it, but it's a good touch so nothing lost there.All in all, surely worth a watch, even though it's based on a story that is a little too overused 7 out of 10 shots in the dark",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good sci-fi thriller! Something different for once!,"This movie is noteworthy because it's not a franchise movie or an adaptation, the cast are completely or mostly unknowns and the alien wasn't shown in the marketing.It takes place in the '70s in a small Ohio town. Several teens, five boys and one girl are making a Super 8 movie at a train station, a train crashes into a truck, an alien escapes and a few nasty, weird things occur. This movie is fun, compelling, touching and maybe scary. What I mean by ""maybe scary"" is I used to be a wimp when it comes to being scared in the theater, I would cover my ears when a horror movie trailer comes on or when a scary scene or moment is going on, I no longer do that, I will give the scary elements a chance to scare me.Everything about the movie is good. Don't worry, I won't spoil anything, especially not the alien. The teens were written realistically, they hang out, joke, curse and sometimes do what is right. There is enough humor to help entertain the audience, if there were hardly any, this movie wouldn't be as enjoyable.This movie is a homage to old Spielberg movies and it really works like that.

Super 8 - Not That Great,"This film is recommended.The film's title is a slight misnomer. Super 8 isn't super entertainment, but it is an enjoyable diversion. It does however have a compendium of, at least, 8 films in this one giant sci-fi kiddie adventure movie: ( In alphabetical order, Alien, The Fugitive, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T., The Goonies, Jurassic Park, Stand by Me, and War of the Worlds all quickly come to mind. ) Certain scenes in Super 8 pay direct homage ( or simply rip-off ) those original sources and many others, I'm sure.The film is so unoriginal and derivative. It's the summer of 1979. We know this by the nostalgic twinge of those lazy, hazy, crazy days of summers past with its hints of Walkmans, garish fashions, and unending pop oldies soundtrack. A group of teenagers are obsessed with making a zombie film with cheap but gory special effects on an Ed Wood budget. They have written, acted, and are filming their movie one night when an unexpected train crash ( the real film's most impressive big budget item ) halts their filming. Barely escaping injury, the Scooby-doo like gang soon realizes that strange occurrences are at work and they have witnessed the source of the town's problem. They also have the proof in the filmed footage from that eventful evening. The military immediately arrives and starts to cover-up the incident, but our intrepid youngsters will still try to save the town.The success of Super 8 rests on the small shoulders of its talented young actors who save the film from its sense of familiarity with their likable screen personas. The two young leads are especially strong: Joel Courtney plays Joe, a sad boy whose mother has passed away and whose deputy father is still grieving, and Elle Fanning is Alice, a pretty young thing who can't relate to her drunken father. Both Courtney and Fanning have a wonderful chemistry on screen. Riley Griffiths, Gabriel Basso, Ryan Lee and Zach Mills round out the rest of the team.Of course, the adults in the film are displayed as mere pawns and have no real personalities or any distinguishing traits. It is only the children that show any dimension, courage, or depth of character. The film's plot devices are simplistic and somewhat flawed, especially the investigation scene at the junior high school. The fact that these kids are never killed or severely injured with all the explosions and mayhem around them defies logic but keeps the film's PG-13 rating intact.Yet the film remains engrossing due to the solid direction of J. J. Abrams, although his script lacks any real complexity. Abrams knows how to set up his action sequences and really builds tension with his use of sound effects and concise editing techniques. The creature is rarely seen until the last third of the film (ala Jaws and Cloverfield ) and that element of surprise works very well, although it is a bit of a letdown when the creature is finally seen.Super 8 is still a fun time to be had, but just realize that it's nothing more or less than a well crafted children's movie masquerading as a grown-up thriller.

ET All Grown Up,"12 June 2011. The biggest problem with this movie is that ET may have grown up too much and the target audience of this movie is well...confusing. There are kids in this movie and in some ways ET forms a basis for it and there are the Goonies (1985) resemblances as well as the Stand By Me (1986) suggestions, yet there are also more juvenile and adult themes going on as well, including suggestive horror mutilations more commonly found in older teen films. There is a great special effects sequence reminiscent of The Fugitive (1993) and the close up shot making especially in the beginning sequences that confirm that a picture is worth a thousand words as the, brief non-verbal headshots used by J.J. Abrams, the director really captures the quality physical acting of the son, girl, and father in this movie. The storyline is so simple, yet the construction and development of the plot is presented in such a way as to geometrically expand the simplicity of the story in an amazing and compelling way. The relational conflicts in this movie are solid, disturbing, and yet well suited in the final product. The best comparison to Super 8 is that it is a bigger budget, more mainstream version of the hard to find Wavelength (1983) which is itself an overlooked sci fi classic. Super 8 is one of the best movies of the year and takes a lot from Jaws (1975) in its direction and style of presenting drama and thrills to the audience.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Not a cohesive towering feat, but dependable entertainment from great movie minds","Created by J.J. Abrams and produced by Steven Spielberg. That phrase says a lot. As more and more clues were revealed as to Abrams second secret film project, the mere presence of these two respected names began to connect dots in the minds of film fans. The first teaser — made before the film even began casting — implied aliens. No surprise there with Abrams' viral marketing hit ""Cloverfield"" and Spielberg's classic, ""E.T."" Yet the connection between those two films only grew as more information came out about ""Super 8."" A Super Bowl TV spot revealed child main characters in a late '70s setting, only a few years off from the actual release of ""E.T.,"" and the presence of a mysterious monster evoked ""Cloverfield."" Does ""Super 8"" burst with so much originality as to end those comparisons? No, but Abrams continues to prove he knows how to entertain an audience.To appropriately continue the juxtaposition, ""Super 8"" ultimately works as a scarier ""E.T."" for adults. To drop another Spielberg film into the mix, the monster attacks feel a lot like ""Jurassic Park"" although the monster itself possesses the same mystique as that of ""Cloverfield."" Yet alien/monster film is just one piece of the movie's identity. In all other senses, ""Super 8"" serves as a period piece, a look back at what it was like to be a kid growing up in the Midwest in 1979. The creature feature part helps bring life to the imagination of the main characters and turn that era into a tall tale setting of sorts.For Abrams, who would have been 13 in the summer of '79, this project is clearly personal. You cannot divorce the filmmaker from the film in this instance. He was undoubtedly one of the kids out there making movies on his Super 8 camera and the plot of this movie enacts a fantasy of his to some extent; what it would be like to actually capture footage of the events he once so desperately tried to create in his own home-spun features.The story follows Joe (Joel Courtney), who loses his mother in a construction accident a few months before the events of the film. He's a dedicated friend and make up artist to young filmmaker Charles (Riley Griffiths), who's making a movie on his Super 8 to enter into some Ohio film festival competition. Charles wants to film at a train station at midnight and he convinces his usual cast and crew of friends to indulge him, as well as Alice (Elle Fanning), who Joe becomes smitten with even before she arrives. While filming, a freight train comes by and suddenly a truck zooms onto the tracks and derails it. After narrowly escaping certain death, the truck driver warns them not to say a word of what happened, which gets tougher and tougher in the coming days as people, pets and electronic appliances disappear.""Super 8"" could've been a drama about kids with big imaginations making movies to avoid dealing with the harsh realities of their family lives — it might have even been better that way — but the big alien in the room quickly changes that. At times, the switch between coming- of-age story and sci-fi horror feels jarring, but both elements exhibit excellent craftsmanship independent of one another. Abrams simply doesn't sew them up into the most seamless of quilts.But maybe he doesn't need to. ""Super 8"" has a surprising amount of humor, a bit of effective suspense, cool action sequences (if you can brush aside the preposterousness of the inciting train derailment), realistic family drama and a few touching moments as well. Those are all winning ingredients, obviously, and ""Super 8"" is a worthwhile watch because of them, but a large through-line seems to be missing. Abrams' concept always held more weight than his story, and though the integration entertains completely, the transformation from concept to film was not as heavily scrutinized as it might in a project that's not its filmmaker's brain child.There's a slight air of disappointment, if for no other reason than because of the mammoth secret that Abrams kept from us and the reveal not being mind-numbing. Although ""Super 8"" remained a mystery up until its release, the plot itself has a much harder time remaining mysterious throughout the film. Once the kids uncover information of the monster's origin, the film loses all steam from a ""figure it out"" perspective and ""Super 8"" enters the realm of predictability, which you don't expect when you go see a film kept so tightly under lock and key.Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment logo and Abrams' Bad Robot stamp certainly suggest greatness, but better to realize that those talents imply a certain reliability more so than than ground-breaking cinema. Spielberg broke his ground; now he's producing ""Transformers"" and bad ""Indiana Jones"" sequels. Abrams has always been more of a television pioneer and did this once before with ""Cloverfield."" As such, ""Super 8"" is a film you can depend on for entertainment, one that's a product of successful films of the past, not a game changer that will move us into a new era of ""top secret"" filmmaking.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Mostly good,"First off, Elle Fanning at this age looks for the world like Emma Watson...which is fine with me. She is the most effective of the young cast members. The movie runs down at the 3/4 point when the characters vanish into the special effects. The conclusion has Spielberg written all over it, complete with people looking up in wonder. The writers haven't done enough with the moviemaking theme. Contrast this film with ""Blowup"" to see what I mean. All in all it is an okay horror flick with tons of lost potential. The title promises much, but the viewer is left unsatisfied. The title should be ""Chinese Food.""",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Great: 9.0,"Far and away the most hyped film of the year so far, J.J. Abrams' Super 8 has, I am happy to say, lived up to its all but insurmountable mountain of buzz that it has accrued, and done so with a grace and style rarely seen in summer blockbusters. The title comes from the old type of film found in portable video cameras, which are used by the main characters. These children, led by Elle Fanning as Alice and Joel Courtney as Joe, are filming a zombie movie for the Cleveland Super 8 Film Festival, and (as aspiring filmmakers, and as kids) want more ""production value"" in their film. Be careful what you wish for, right? As seen in the trailers, a pickup (somehow) derails the train they are shooting next to, and from the wreckage emerges...something I won't go into any more detail about (for fear of spoiling this movie for anyone who hasn't yet seen it. It is from here that Abrams truly shows his mastery of storytelling. The movie follows Joe as we see him in a variety of events and emotions: grief, terror, love, wonder. All of these things are what make Super 8 the best film of 2011 so far, and how they fit in so well with the suspense, and later on, effects-driven action. Yet, through all the explosions, killings, and mysteries surrounding the town of Lillian and its occurrences, Abrams manages to keep the film feeling distinctly human, and it is this fact that allows you to empathize with every major character, as each one is portrayed as their own human being, complete with inner light and inherent flaws that lie within us all. When this movie decides to bring the thing into the picture it does so in a very similar manner to the Abrams-produced Cloverfield, showing a bit at a time, and almost never giving you a good look at it. And when you do finally see it, it is always fleeting. Is this an attempt to heighten the mystery, or to keep people focused on the more worldly characters? I decided the answer was the former, but regardless, whichever you choose, you will leave satisfied. There seems to be a popular sentiment that Super 8 packs too many homages to older films into its 112 minute runtime. I caught some subtle but noticeable references to E.T., Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and Night of the Living Dead, among a few others. However, unlike other reviewers, I do not feel like these little things detracted from the film. Nor do I feel like they added to it; Abrams is a protege of Spielberg, and thusly, would probably create some shots that are so similar to ones found in some of Spielberg's earlier classics. Like Spielberg, Abrams manages to deftly weave two vastly different types of storylines into one extremely clever hybrid, with the strengths of both, and weaknesses of neither. If you are a fan of sci-fi thrillers, or of dramas that focus on the ever-changing ""human element"", you owe it to yourself to experience this incredibly unique thrill ride for yourself. You should not be disappointed.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I Think Super 8 Deserves More Love,"I tried seeing this film through the lens of those who don't like it. Truly. But I can't help it, I love it for what it is. Personal feelings aside though, I realize it is not perfect but I think it does delivers enough of what a film of this genre ought to and consequently feel it is unfair to put it completely in a tier below the films it is unabashedly giving homage too.Here's what Super 8 has going for it:
-The set up is immediately interesting (Goonies).
-The banter in the group of kids is charming and energetic (Stand By Me). After all, a film like this should be at its best when the entire group of kids is together and Super 8 is definitely that.
-The film doesn't over-show it's main event too early (Jaws).Pair those elements listed above with a fast moving plot, acceptable CGI, and a great musical score and I think you have yourself a coming-of-age sci-fi adventure winner.Admittedly, the ultimate pay off for the incredible set up doesn't have the level of 'wow' that it perhaps should have, choosing to go for a heartfelt climax over a spectacle-drive one (and yes, I suppose it's a little cheesy) but that's fine. Super 8 is a kids film after all.I don't think Super 8 gets enough credit for what it tries to accomplish. The film doesn't try to reinvent the wheel, instead, it is focused more on celebrating the films of its genre that have come before it; Super 8 is a love letter to some of our favourites from the 80s and it stands to sit amongst them.7.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The JJ Abrams Formula,"I'm as big of a Abrams fan as anyone but I am starting to find a formula that he, in my opinion needs to separate himself from. I noticed this with LOST and CLOVERFIELD specifically and now with SUPER 8. As you know in all three of these Abrams likes to keep it very secret and not tell you anything to build up the hype by producing very vague trailers. Then when you watch the movie its almost the same thing throughout the movie or show its all build up. This is cool like once in my opinion to really know nothing until the end and it would be okay if it were more frequent if the delivery was beyond par but in all these films the build up always far surpasses the delivery. The ending specifically in SUPER 8 and LOST are super weak and/or unoriginal with CLOVERFIELD the whole movie is just build up no attempt to deliver a concluding endings.I also am aware he is producer in those other concepts but I certainly think he has creative control. BUT!!! this still was a great film in many other ways, it was a great homage to Spielbergs earlier films. The kid actors did really well and had pretty witty lines that were constant. The action had great suspense so that's why I gave this film a 7 and the ending or final ""delivery"" I would give it somewhere between a 1 and 3 but had that been slightly more original or interesting I would of easily given this film a 9 or 10 but again the end was so weak to me that it ruined it by at least three stars.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Devoid of any thriller resonance, the movie treats intrigue the way porn movies treat sex, as a subject to be exploited.

An Homage to 1970s Horror/Sci-Fi Movies,"Coming from the same era as J. J. Abrams (I'm only a year younger than Abrams), I too, grew up using a Super-8 camera, as a kid in the 1970s. Super-8 (2011), is a tale of a bunch of kids in a tiny Ohio town, who in the late 1970s, while filming a zombie movie with their Super-8 camera, witness a train accident, which turns out to be a secret government transport. The thing they are carrying escapes, thus starts the mystery and the terror of Super-8 (2011). What is actually refreshing to see in this film, is the fact, that it is a straight horror/science fiction film. Abrams actually tears himself away from his normal, time continuum or gimmicky alternate universe stuff, that he usually cranks out. That is in no way a complaint. I am a huge J. J. Abrams fan, but it was nice to see him take-on a more straight-forward genre. Abrams captures the story well and creates an excellent representation of what the 1970s in Ohio looks like. On top of that, he executes a terrifying and sometimes cute (involving the non-scary moments), script, about a force of immense destruction.The pace of the story carries you along. It invokes the fear out of you, based on what the unknown is, while it still has time to cover all of the bases with character development. The acting is top notch, especially with the kids and the interaction between each of them. This is most observed with Riley Griffiths, as the breakout character, Charles. Elle Fanning's Alice, who is the youngest of the actors in the cast, radiates a maturity level in her character, that drives the energy of the rest of the cast. A subplot, involving the infatuation of Joe (Joel Courtney), for Alice, is very genuine. I saw, maybe one or two, tiny blemishes in Super-8 (2011). Also, I was slightly concerned with the creature effects too. However, these concerns are small and this film, is a suspenseful, sometimes terrifying movie. It keeps your attention from beginning to end. Don't let anyone tell you, that Super-8 (2011), is a scary E. T. knockoff movie. There is nothing in this film, found in the classic Spielberg E. T., plus there is a delicate message at the end of this film, that needs to be taken-in, as its own. For my money, Super-8 (2011), is a nice piece of work.PMTM Grade: 8.9 (A-) = 9 IMDB.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Huge Disappointment,"One thing is to create a good story which JJ clearly can do, another is to direct and make good movies out of them. I always thought MI3 sucked, just like MI1 and MI2 for that matter. So, when Star Trek came out, it was a good surprise to me, and started to consider JJ a director I should pay more attention to. Now, he made a dull, flat movie again, where even the story is empty, and don't know what to think of him again. The similarities with Spielberg exist, but only with the modern one, that in the last decade only managed to make half decent movies (except Munich, which is good), and not the 80's Spielberg, that would leave us in magic and wonder in almost every scene. I can't understand how it got such a high score at IMDb. Hope JJ does better next time",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Not a super 8, but I say it is a solid seven.","Went to this film hoping it would be a bit of a throwback type film of the 80's, the one's featuring a group of kids in a crazy situation. Basically something that is a bit like ""The Explorers"", ""Goonies"" and a couple of other movies. You know, the one's where the children are actually likable characters before the 90's came and made them brats who were always outwitting adults...'cough' home along 'cough'. This film I happily say did that, I enjoyed the kids and I can imagine a couple of them going on to have very solid movie careers. The movie was not perfect, however, which is why I give it only a seven rather than a higher score. The film is about a boy who has recently lost his mother, he and a group of boys are making a movie for one of them to enter into a super 8 film festival. They are making a zombie film and the boy who lost his mother does the makeup. He and his father are distant with each other, the father seemingly wants to send the boy away to a camp of some sort. Well one night while filming a scene for their movie at a train station a train comes barreling down the tracks. A truck seems to get on the tracks and the train gets derailed in glorious fashion. This is one of the highlights of the film, watching the children run as the train explodes and debris falls everywhere. Well there was something on this train that brings the military to town and the boys along with a girl who has ties to a person that the boy's father who is a deputy associates with the death of his mother end up having to unravel some of the mystery behind what was on the train and why the truck literally went on the tracks. It was good, however, I kind of wish the boy who lost his mother's friends were in it a bit more, at times they paid to much attention to the one kid and the others were good too. There seemed to be more development warranted as some of the scenes with the one boy and girl were a bit to much of a bummer. I also did not care for the conclusion all that much as it was a bit anti climatic as it was really good with the town under siege and the underground scene, but kind of ended with a whimper. I also wish all the kids got to play a bigger role during the last scenes as two got left behind to quickly. However, overall the film was enjoyable, however parents be warned. This is not a PG movie that barely became PG-13, I would say it is a PG-13 that likely came close to being rated R as it is not really overly bloody or anything of that nature, but there is quite a bit of language in this one. Funny, it is like the second film of 2011 to be rated PG-13 that I have seen that has had the F word in it. Probably more than the last two or three summers combined.

The monster part was less interesting, actually ,than the childhood adventures.Roger Ebert summed it nicely when he wrote, ""Super 8 is a wonderful film, nostalgia not for a time but for a style of film-making, when shell-shocked young audiences were told a story and not pounded over the head with aggressive action.

They soon realize that the circumstances surrounding it are supernatural in nature. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll just say that I enjoyed this science fiction thriller which functions much like an old 1950s monster movie. The film takes awhile before clicking together and making sense, and when it does it's a very rewarding ride. I appreciated that even though it utilizes heavy CG effects, these did not overpower the story. The characters are well-written, and we're able to invest some emotion in them. Even though the story depicts a savage and deadly giant monster (sort of echoing CLOVERFIELD), somehow we are able to feel sorry for it and sympathize with his goal as revealed later in the movie. Young actress Elle Fanning is the sister of Dakota Fanning (who I enjoyed in HIDE AND SEEK and WAR OF THE WORLDS), and it's plain to see that acting talent runs in their family. There didn't seem to be any real need to make the incidents occur in the retro period of the 1970s or to have them engulf a group of children filming their own home movie project, but as a fan of monster flicks and the '70s myself, this was an extra bonus for me to treasure. *** out of ****",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Excellently directed and great movie, even though it has some hiccups","Super 8 far exceeded my expectations. This movie is interesting because you either like half of the movie, or you like all of the movie. I know a lot of people who say only the first half was good and the second half wasn't, but for me: I love all of it.I will agree that Super 8 does not have the most original plot, but that doesn't mean it isn't an original movie. Super 8 purposefully uses a plot that resembles a Steven Spielberg movie from the 70s-80s. Super 8 is like Close encounters of the third kind, meets Cloverfield, meets E.T., meets the Goonies. Some people will say that makes it a rip-off, but then you entirely missed the purpose of the movie. The movie is making homage to those classic movies from 70s-80s while still being its own movie. I will mention that the movie is MUCH better the first time than the second time, because the first time is very mysterious while the second time is not mysterious. This review is based off my first time seeing.The acting in this movie is really good. I was shocked at how well the kids in this movie acted, and how well they actually acted like kids. They seemed very life-like and realistic, and also the kid love relationship in this movie was actually good and didn't seem lame.The effects are very good, and the movie has this constant blue lighting theme which is pretty cool to make it look like the camera is a little messed up. The lighting is very nice. The CGI is pretty good, and the train destruction scene was over the top amazing! Some people may say that the train wreck was unrealistic, but in reality it wasn't. Train wrecks do look like that, and seeing as how the train had explosives that also adds to it. The creature (I won't give away its appearance) was cool and fairly frightening. There were quite a few jump scares but they didn't seem lame or unneeded except for maybe one time.All in all an excellent movie that really pays tribute to the old movies, while still being great in its own sense. I am surprised at the excellent acting which actually makes up for any small problems.

"A good movie, but was expecting more.","SUPER 8I remember watching this when the movie was first released. I thought it was very average at the time... but now I have watched it again I thought it was better the second time around.The movie is about a group of kids that are trying to make a movie. One night they are filming on a train station when they witness a huge train crash... what they don't realise is that the train was carrying some alien creature that has now escaped.The story is quite good. What I like about it is it has a lot of different levels to it. There is not just the one story about the alien... there are other elements to this film. The relationships that the characters have towards one another are really good and add a lot to the film. The relationship of the children with their parents is a big part of it. These kids are going through other things in their lives other than the disaster going on around them.The film was shot to make it look like an older film than it is. It tried to feel like an 80s film... but failed mostly. There are moments that felt like it could have been made in the 80s. We have the hair, the cars, the soundtrack... but for some reason it is still missing something. I just can't put my finger on what it is. Maybe the effects are too good. I think if the effects were more 80s then it might have had the right atmosphere.The acting was good throughout from everyone. The movie stars Joel Courtney, Ryan Lee, Zach Mills, Riley Griffiths, Gabriel Basso, Ella Fanning, Kyle Chandler and Ron Eldard. All deserve a lot of credit, but the best performance by far came from Ella Fanning. She has a lot of talent just like her older sister. I always thought that children were terrible actors and mostly annoying, but the Fanning sisters were both amazing when they were little. I just hope that they continue on and become big stars. They deserve it.I was a little disappointed that we didn't see the alien sooner. I understand the suspense side of things and I agree with it in a lot of ways, but I did think that the alien could have been seen a bit more in the film. It also took the creature too long to even make it's first appearance in the film.The movie was directed by J. J. Abrams. So as you can imagine, there was a bit of lens flare... no wait, a lot of lens flare. It was crazy! At some points I thought it was ridiculous. On the bright side though... Steven Spielberg was involved in this film also. These guys work well together.I did like this film, but unfortunately I am not sure there was too much memorable in it. I can't guarantee that I will remember this film 1 year down the line. Only time will tell.I will give this film 6 out of 10.""Excuse me, can I have another order of fries?

"This isn't just 'Super 8'... It's 'E.T', 'Cloverfield', 'Jaws', 'Goonies' and many others mixed in","STORY: 8.9/10 VISUALS: 9.7/10 ACTING: 9/10 ENTERTAINMENT: 8.2/10 ORIGINALITY: 6.1/10Well, after reading that said above, you should pretty much know what to expect. This was written (and directed)by J.J Abrams (Lost, Star Trek). Steven Spielberg produced it. I thought that the story/script was great, even though there were a few violent jump-scenes and A LOT OF UNNECESSARY PROFANITY, most of it said by 12 year olds.The Visuals were great. I thought the train scene was very well done. My only regret is that they (MINOR SPOILER) showed the monster at the end. I know, YOU ALL WANTED TO SEE IT, but, as a director, you want to keep the audience wanting more.The Acting was great, especially with the kids (for some of them, it was their first movie). Not much to be said here.Now comes the part where people have really been complaining. Many people have been complaining that the film was unoriginal, and I agree. Before the film's release, people were saying things like 'Goonies 2'. Well, this is only true with the group of kids, no other relation to 'Goonies' story wise. But the two movies that relate to 'Super 8' the most are 'Cloverfield' (which Abrams produced) and 'E.T' (Which Speiberg directed). There also hints of other movies in there, like 'Jaws' (remember what I said about not wanting them to see the monster). Sure, this movie is not original, and probably not as good as those movies I just listed. Believe it or not, I actually haven't seen E.T or Jaws, but I have seen 'Cloverfield', and although 'Cloverfield' has a faster pace and stunning visuals, 'Super 8' has a better story that flows BY FAR.I really leave it up to you if you want to see this film or not. I liked it, but it's hard to say if you will. There have been a lot of mixed reviews about this movie, and I hoped that I just explained why.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Tedious ...,"This was just terrible. Apart from Fanning the kids were uniformly awful. The drunk dad and the cop dad were straight outta central casting.

"Expected so much, got so little","I first saw the teaser trailer with the train crash about 2 years ago: a project of J.J. Abrams and Steven Spielberg. I was really excited back then. Now, almost 2 years later, it was there! I grabbed the very first possibility to go and watch it. But when I left the theater I didn't know what to think. I tried to convince myself that it was good and my expectations were just too high. I had a day to think about it and this movie just wasn't good enough.First the plot. It's the same story like cloverfield, with some ET like scenes in it and other sci-fi alien movies we all seen in the past few decades. Of course it had something new to it, but it wasn't good enough.Second, when I go and see a movie I want to get entertained, I want to get dragged into the story or a character. But with this movie I was aware that I was in the theater all the time, I just couldn't get into it.And finally, there were some critical errors in the movie. Now normally I don't mind those and see past through them, but here they were just too obvious. And maybe you can see past through them, I really hope so, but for me it was another point why I didn't like it.So was there nothing good in the movie at all? Well, of course there were things that were good and entertaining. The plot had some nice things in it. But overall it all just wasn't what I expected.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Just about alright,"The movie could have been much better, but a few things weigh on the end result.The story isn't much really. Same old ship wrecked telepathic alien stuff.The lead actors are just not convincing enough. The acting was okay, but I didn't really care about any of them.As expected, a lot of scenes defy the laws of physics but then with the premise of this movie, is pardonable.The alien on the other hand was pretty cool.The animation was also pretty much up to the task.Overall, just about another movie which will be forgotten in a hurry.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Abrams and Spielberg...How could this be bad?,"Finally the highly anticipated ""Super 8"" movie has arrived, and for a monster movie...it does not disappoint.I emphasize the fact that I said ""for a monster movie it does not disappoint"". This does not mean that this movie is necessarily the best movie of 2011 in my opinion, nor does it mean that it is a given that it will win an Oscar. But in comparison to recent monster movies (""Cloverfield"" is one that comes to mind straight away) this is the best of the lot.The the cinematography and the CGI is excellent throughout the entire film. The acting is very solid (although melodramatic at times). Good acting performances from Joel Courtney and Kyle Chandler in particular.No the overall thing that really ruined this movie from being one of the great monster style movie was the ending. I strongly recommend watching the first 100 minutes of this movie, and then after that walk out because I can guarantee that you will be disappointed (I know I was).But apart from the ending the only thing that I had an issue with about this movie was the fact that the acting was overdone and too melodramatic at times, but this isn't a huge issue really.I give this movie a 7/10, it is definitely the best monster movie of recent times and it is definitely worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

One for the kids,"J.J. Abrams pays homage to all of Spielberg's early movies with this mix of the Goonies and, er, an alien invasion movie.One of the most nasty aliens possible lands in a small American town - nasty largely because of its intense desire to grab people from behind at night time. First we see its back, moving quickly amongst the darkness then we see the odd arm, wrapping itself around a hapless victim's neck. Every now and again you see a leg - possibly - it's normally too dark to see.Anyway, the grabby-grabbity alien is running amok in a small town grabbing people like they were the last Nike trainer on the shelf, but, luckily, the U.S. Army is there to save everyone. Only they don't. Their masses of tanks and guns are pretty useless against something big that likes to grab people. However, humanity is saved by six (ish) plucky, nerdy kids who have a knack for not being grabbed (and if they are they can be rescued later) and a love of using cheap fireworks as weapons.I grew up with the Goonies and I still watch it, largely for nostalgia values. If it was released today I probably wouldn't bother with it.Super 8 didn't do much for me. It was too dark and it was only on the 1 hour 32 minutes mark did you find the alien has a face (while its grabbing someone). However, judging by the rest of the reviews, I'm clearly in the minority here. Most people seem to love it. I can only assume they're twelve year old boys. This film is rated 12A and never before has the rating been so applicable. If you want a better opinion of the film, ask a twelve year old boy as that's clearly who this film is aimed for. Give me Sigourney Weaver in a power-loader suit any day.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Super 8: The Super Combo Delivers Best of the Year,"One is a legend in the movie industry, the other is the current hot ticket with a winning streak not seen in a long, long time. Sometimes when teams like this are paired up, the expectations can be unbearable and completely fantastical, but J.J. Abrams and Steven Spielberg are not ones to break under the pressure of expectations. The stage was set perfectly for them and they delivered brilliantly with an homage to each other's previous works and the simple storytelling styles of film classics gone by.Super 8 surrounds a group of movie loving misfits who find their town the unwilling center of a government takeover after a terrible and deadly train accident. While filming their own Super 8 movie for a local festival, they bear witness to the escape of something unexplainable, setting up a quest the kids must all rise to complete or watch their friends, families and entire town get erased from the map.Jeff Goldsmith, the Q&A master behind the popular podcast The Q&A with Jeff Goldsmith sent out this tweet after screening this new summer throwback:""I just saw Super 8. Wanna know the guarded ""secret"" behind it? Abrams uses plenty of screen time to develop characters you'll care about. (@yogoldsmith)""As usual, Jeff nailed it on the head. Above and beyond all the other things that done right in the making of this film, it is the writing and careful execution of creating characters that are human, real and inherently lovable. Super 8 brings back the youthful purity of classics like E.T., The Goonies and Stand by Me, something the movie industry has been woefully lacking in the last few years. The story gently reels you in until you almost look at their story as your own, a memory being perfectly played out they way you wish it happened to you.Then comes the picture perfect casting, where I was compelled instantly by the innocence of Joel Courtney (as Joe Lamb), who is the first young actor since Patrick Fugit in Almost Famous to truly capture that wide- eyed stare into the possible purity of the future. Another factor connecting the audience to Courtney was our shared need to care for and protect the young damsel in distress, Elle Fanning (playing Alice Dainard). Fanning is the epitome of the first girl we all fell in love with in elementary school and she holds the audience in the palm of her hand throughout every scene. Not to be outdone, Riley Griffiths (playing Charles, the young film director), taps into the other side of the coin, the best friend who always wanted to be the hero, but never quite made it to center stage.Behind the camera, Abrams and Spielberg may have just cemented themselves as the ultimate dynamic duo. Spielberg is still a legend in Hollywood and has incredibly well tuned story senses, but some of his recent efforts (Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, War of the Worlds) have been slightly off from his previous greatness. Abrams, on the other hand, is still a relative newcomer to the big screen (only directing Mission Impossible III and Star Trek), but has proved himself a near master of the current form, grown on the sensibilities of a changing and ever adapting crowd. Abrams took this story and crafted it into a beautiful homage to the man sitting right next to him. Super 8 is a throwback to Spielberg's younger days, giving a whole new generation of movie watchers a glimpse into what others grew up with in the late 70's and early 80's. The balance of character development, action sequences and well-paced comedy beats really gives this film a perfect blend for nearly every audience member.The End of the Page recommendation: Super 8 is a perfectly crafted summer blockbuster. It just doesn't get better, at least not this year.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Don't judge a book by it's cover they say.,"Super 8Super 8... What kind of a movie would one expect, reading the title while never heard anything else about it. With the current superhero-movie exploitation that dominates our cinemas, it's very easy to make a link towards that genre. it's what I thought at first, something among the likes of ""Heroes"" meets ""The Fantastic 4"".The only thing I heard about it before watching, was that it was directed by Steven Spielberg (you know, that epic director who just seems he can't make a bad film.) and the word ""Sci-fi"" was associated with it. Steven Spielberg and Sci-fi... Now - I was born in the late 80's and grew up with sci-fi films alike ""ET"", ""The Goonies"", ""Close Encounters Of The Third Kind"" and ""The Iron Giant"" (And ""Predator"" and ""Aliens"" of course, but let's just keep on track here). I remember, as a youngster, sitting in my living room wearing my pajamas's, putting in video-cassettes of those films in the VCR. I loved those movies. They had a certain friendly mood in them and delivered a great atmosphere.""Super 8"" reminded me of those movies.This is classic Sci-fi Spielberg, like it could have been made in the late '80s or mid '90s.The soundtrack is very good, reminded me a bit of ""Invaders From Mars"". Very moody and fantasy-like. It's being used well in every scene too. Some scenes involve illogical behavior and dialog here and there. But you're too busy enjoying and being carried away with it. It has some scary parts every now and then, but nothing really to keep your kid away from the TV-screen (well, except your Amish or so - ow wait, they don't watch TV) I'd give it a 7/10 and would watch it again.Don't judge a book by it's cover?

Super 8 is this year's Inception,"Super 8 was an excellent movie. It's not your typical alien movie where some monster runs around blowing crap up, this one actually has a story. I think that J. J. Abrams is getting better and better. His Star Trek reboot was an instant classic and he did a FANTASTIC job with this film. Steven Spielberg was outstanding as usual. This movie doesn't have star power, but part of what made this film work was the chemistry between the cast members (particulary between Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning). The cast members in this film are incredibly talented. So if you add J. J. Abrams plus Steven Spielberg, plus a good plot, script, special effects and cast, what do you get?.......A Truly OUTSTANDING FILM. Did I mention that this film is mysterious, action packed, dramatic, sometimes scary, and funny? All of these components add up to make this worthwhile and very entertaining.

Almost something special,"Super 8 is a movie about a bunch of kids making a zombie movie, which takes a crazy left turn as they witness a truck driven by one of their teachers crash into a train. The train carries some grey rubik's cube things as well as *something* scary.Soon, the small town the are in start experiencing things like power outages, missing dogs, stolen items. The Air Force is there because the train supposedly carried items for them, but the deputy doesn't think it all adds up.About 2/3s of the movie is just captivating. The kids are all pretty good in their roles not only seeming like genuine kids, but also, when filming their super 8 zombie movie, they genuinely seem like kids trying to make a kid directed movie. I think about myself trying to act like that at that age and I don't think I'd be able to do it.The story unfolds in a manner that keeps you interested, with layer after layer adding mystery. I don't know exactly when it started to unravel, but at some point it seemed to lose it's magic and just turn into another alien movie. And it's too bad too as Super 8 could have been something special. As it is, it's still a solid Friday night theater movie (though I saw it at home on a Monday afternoon). I do wonder what it could have been.Oh, and a couple of subplots did seem superfluous, such as the mother's death (no spoiler as it happens right at the beginning) and the large family of one of the friends. The locket thing at the end was also a little bit eye-rolly.7/10, starting as an 8/10 movie but dropping to 7/10 when all was said and done.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"So many good elements, so little story","From the day I first saw the trailer for Super 8, I longed to see this film. Having grown up on Spielberg, from Duel to Jaws to Close Encounters to Schindlers List, his genius is without equal. As a fan of JJ Abrams, especially Lost and Cloverfield, I went to the theater tonight expecting to walk out in slack jawed awe.I walked out slack jawed, but only feeling disappointment. This film is essentially E.T. without the charm. A weak story line with more holes than a Swiss cheese factory, some truly insipid dialog, and character structure extracted straight from a night school screen writing class.There are bright spots. The kids were superb actors, every one. The sets were gorgeous. The CGI impressive. Some hearty chuckles, especially the Sheriff's warning that Sony Walkmans were the start of a ""slippery slope."" I even enjoyed seeing an AMC Pacer get rear-ended by a Buick.Beyond that, I felt like I was watching a highlight reel of Spielberg's trademarks: Richard Dreyfuss' noisy family scene from Close Encounters is replicated in shameless detail. People being pulled away screaming by an unseen beast, low camera angles with yawning skies, and 12 year olds far smarter than the adults.It may be worth 3 bucks for a rental. It's not worth 20 at the theater.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Sort of ET meets Close Encounters meets ALIEN,"Even though this film was written and directed by J.J. Abrahms, the film oozes with Spielberg-ness. The film centers around a group of kids who have much more insight and wisdom than the adults, much like ET. The military branch of the US Government moves in, trying to hide whats really happening, much like Close Encounter of the Third Kind. And there's a large hulking space creature that I guess is not quite as malicious as the creature from Alien but he's tearing up a small town. As you'll see, some of the creature's victims are treated similarly to Alien.The film involves a group of kids of junior high school age in 1979 shooting their own zombie-horror flick; one of whom has just lost his mother. The director Charles (played very convincingly by the young and talented Riley Griffiths), a sort of 12-year-old throwback to Orson Welles, replete with pipe, is the obsessed and ambition filmmaker doing everything he can to make a great film. He is constantly speaking of ""production value"". My guess is his character may have been somewhat based on the young Steven Spielberg who pressed his friends into little film projects shot with his super-8 camera back in the 1950's. The two other characters which emerge as the main focus are Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney) and Alice Dainard (Elle Fanning) two people thrust together because of their involvement with the film project who become somewhat intimate in a way that only 12-year-old's can. A supporting character of note has to be Cary, played by Ryan Lee, who carries around fire crackers just to make the older folk cringe.The group is shooting a scene at a train station with the boy main character and the only girl in the movie. Their production literally becomes derailed by a train wreck which obliterates everything in sight, not to mention the station, although the super-8 camera which continued to film was surprisingly untouched! Of course, this is not just a train derailment: the whole train looks like it was in the middle of the front lines in WWII. A man in a busted up pick-up, looking half-dead, who may have intentionally derailed the train, tells the kids to run for their lives. The kids escape in their car, which was also surprisingly untouched, before the military guys show up with flash-lights and guns.The story then moves on several fronts: the mystery of the train wreck, Charles' obsession with completing his movie, and the relationship between Joe and Alice and their parents. Eventually, when more of the mystery is revealed, the film becomes largely about a kind of reconciliation between the two kids and their parents. At a certain point, the movie-making aspect takes a back seat to the relationships of the two kids and the two adults. It seemed like Charles, the director, at one point, seems more like a supporting character.Although I definitely enjoyed this film, largely because of the believability of the kids which is first-rate by any standard, I was frustrated on a couple of points. I thought the movie was trying to do too many things given its parameters. To me, the relationship between the two main kid characters and their parents distracted away from the really interesting idea about the kids trying to make their movie. Also, I thought there would be a lot more about the footage which was gotten at the train wreck.The one character who I felt was slightly under-developed was Charles, the kid director. His screen time was sacrificed in order to develop more about the adult relationships, which I found less interesting, some of which seemed just a touch cliché. I wanted to know more about Charles, why he was shooting his films and other information. Only late in the film do we learn more about him and why he was engaging in this project.Two stories which are very similar to this film, Spielberg's ET and Stephen King's IT, focus almost exclusively on the kids, who they are, and what they are trying to accomplish. If a story begins about a group of kids, I think it is better for the story to stay on them rather getting off on tangents. Super-8 started out that way, but then took a bit of a side turn and focused more on a couple of the adult characters. I was sort of expecting the kids to be on the lead and in the forefront for most of the story, and I wanted them to be the ones who solve the mystery without intervention from dear-old dad. Still, a very enjoyable movie, and the acting is first-rate to take you all the way. One surprise is at the end during the credits, which was actually my favorite part of the film, but I won't give it away!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Goes out with a wimper,"Overall this movie is above average but nothing special, with a few scenes that are actually great that are marred by bad choices script and exposition wise.The set-up for the creature is pretty great but is often interrupted by some weak 'mundane' storylines such as an half assed romance plot and some family drama.From the point the creature is actually fully 'unveiled' and the drama is gone the movie takes a plunge in quality, meaning the third act is worse than the first two.Pair this up with some average acting across the board and a really disappointing ending and you get something that initially gets you hooked but ends up disappointing.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Small town kids, the military and a train with puzzling cargo","""Super 8"" is a popcorn blockbuster that acts as a light drama, mystery and thriller, though one that's all about shameless homage to past films and late '70s pop culture in which it takes place. It's a something's-on-the-loose film with the ""something"" hiding in the background and adolescent nostalgia out to play in the foreground. It racks up blatant nods, such as '50s giant monster films, George Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead,"" and even Spielberg classics like ""The Goonies"" and ""Jurassic Park."" It's done purposely to bring out fun references for sentimental history buffs, as well as keeps cinemaphiles busy with trivia, who might otherwise be ready to call foul at the first retread.A motley crew of early teen filmmakers have various talents that range from bossy director, special make-up effects wizard, lead actor, pretty actress to the over-charged demolitions expert. Apart from the recent accidental death of Joe's, the make-up effects kid, mother, they live in a normally quiet town and keep themselves busy filming make-believe zombies. While on location for their super 8 movie in the dead of night, they solely witness a massive train wreck involving a truck with a person they know. The hurt man gives them a grave warning to stay away. Shaken up, they keep to themselves but as soon as the Air Force troops show to clean up, some bizarre things occur and it's up to the temp Sheriff, after the current went missing, and our little friends to find out the truth and take matters into their own hands.Due to items and people disappearing out of the blue, the town feels under siege and holds a meeting but things aren't making sense apart from thinking it's the Russkies. The stand-in Sheriff sees a conspiracy closer to home as our own military refuses to say exactly what's in the cargo of the trains. It took too long to actually unveil the big mystery and eventually begins to lose some of its grasp when it initially began with thrills due to blocking your view point to show abrupt disappearing acts of civilians and property during wee night hours. The constant question is: What does it all mean? Not to mention that it better be a heck of a hot item when it's fully unsheathed: one that awes and glimmers and is saved last for hopefully good reason.Pushing aside the mayhem and conspiratorial overtones, Joe and Alice, the actress from their movie, form a forbidden love due to their dads having beef, as well as some light drama with regret over the mother's death and growing pains with adapting were injected to make it more personal and dramatic than continually pulse-pounding. To lighten the load even more, there are some relatable jokes and good times shown with being an adolescent during the summer. The young actors portraying the roles have chemistry and managed to be candid and entertaining without being naturally annoying. It hearkens back to that good ol' period when you didn't always see the big picture of adulthood enough not to worry about the future instead of the now--which at present is both just so scary and astonishing.""Super 8"" has thrilling orchestras mixed with contemporary tunes of the era. This has jarring sounds, finely-tuned CGI to show over-the-top action and big explosions to knock your hat off, except they're more spread out than in the previews. It hinted how much power and leeway Big Brother has over its citizens and visitors to the point of black-and-white, closed-minded villainy. They attempted a quick wrap up by throwing out some forced sympathy for the now revealed mysterious entity despite massive property damage and trauma, as the justification for what's happening isn't entirely its fault. Though it would be like only watching the endings of ""King Kong"" and ""Frankenstein,"" which did a similar ""made bad by society"" mock up, where the rest of the film showed evolution and gradually built up to genuine sparks of feeling. ""Super 8"" tried to jam-pack the experience with it all--some concentrated on, some not--and it felt like important answers were swept under the rug, as the tone shifts back again to the town people being just so relieved that it's all finally over and that the event brought them closer together.

"SUPER 8 Gets A ""10""","One of the things that make certain summers at the movies something more than just an endless stream of special effects blockbusters that promise a lot of bang for your buck, but in the end seem to offer precious little in the way of substance, is that sometimes there is that special kind of ""blockbuster"" that has everything you could want, and something more. SUPER 8, from writer/director J.J. Abrams, who directed the 2009 STAR TREK and 2006's MISSION IMPOSSIBLE III, is certainly one of those films for the summer of 2011. Abrams got a lot of help in bringing this film to fruition thanks to the generosity of his mentor Steven Spielberg; and while some will inevitably compare certain aspects of SUPER 8 to Spielberg's own directorial efforts, but the comparisons are just in the way that Abrams seems to understand that special effects alone do not a great movie make.Instead of going with a big-name cast, Abrams went with comparative unknowns, most of whom were young kids. The film is set in a small Ohio town during the summer of 1979. Several kids, including Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning, are in the process of making a zombie horror flick using Super 8-millimeter Kodak film when, one night, they witness a violent train wreck that involves a truck being driven by their biology teacher (Glynn Turman). The accident is caught on camera, and they really think nothing of ituntil the Air Force mysteriously moves in to seal the accident scene. Turman warns the kids that if they tell anyone about this ""incident"", they and their parents may suffer some consequences too horrible to contemplate. The local police, led by Chandler, get precious little cooperation from the Air Force guys, including Noah Emmerich, and there's a good reason why. which is revealed step by step and not all at once. This is a film where a certain amount of brainpower and thought is required, even with a young cast in charge.Abrams clearly doesn't make things easy by setting this film back in 1979, nor should he. There are no Blue Tooths, Blackberrys, IPods, the Internet, or digital cameras; instead, the means of communication are traditional telephones, citizens band radios, and the titular Super 8-millimeter camera that the kids use--this, and the sight of souped up and loud Trans-Ams. Abrams does utilize several elements of his mentor's films CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND and E.T., in the way things go haywire and the power goes out with the aliens' presence (the aliens remain mostly shadow figures until the climax). And as happens in E.T., the military and the law seem to be depicted in a much more sinister light than the aliens themselves (even with all the mayhem being caused), and the kids, including Fanning (who looks like a dead ringer for a grown-up Drew Barrymore), are far more sympathetic. However, he is wise not to be so overtly slavish of his mentor.The presence of such great 1979 hits as ""Heart Of Glass"" (by Blondie) and ""My Sharona"" (by the Knack) amidst Giacchino's dramatic score give us a good feel of what it was like back in those days. And while it is tempting in a film of this nature to hype up the special effects work, all of which is extremely good, the effects themselves don't swamp the movie. Even if the alien story part of the film is pretty much part-and-parcel of special effects blockbusters, it is what Abrams does with this plot that makes SUPER 8 more than just another high-budget blockbuster; it is a film worthy of comparisons to Spielberg himself.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Cloverfield meets E.T,"I want to start of by saying that I, even though I know I should never have, had huge expectations for this movie due to the people involved with it and all the hype for it. Therefore I now have mixed feelings about the result of the movie. Whilst Abrams and Spielberg have proved themselves to be masterful many times, it seems like this co-work panned out a little bit out of focus. It's like someone in charge couldn't agree on if they were doing a E.T sequel or a Cloverfield sequel.Super 8, to me, is at it's best when it has that mysterious Cloverfield/Lost tone and not the E.T storytelling where characters literally tell every answer to every question you're having as a viewer. Whenever that happens in this film, it ruins the excitement for the mysterious plot and main villain's purpose. It's like someone forgot that a well-done mysterious movie is exciting because it's mysterious, however that happened.It's not a bad movie, it's enjoyable, but it could have been so much more if they would have left parts of it mysterious and unsolved.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A fine example of nostalgic filmmaking,"Time to return to a more glorious, beautiful, and empowering time of filmmaking. Super 8 is a nostalgic sci-fi film highly reminiscent of Steven Spielberg's 80's classics like E.T.: The Extra Terrestrial, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and even Jaws. It's the story of a group of kids who live in a small town spending their days shooting movies with the super 8 camera. One night a train derails and very mysterious things being to happen around the town. Electrical appliances begin to disappear, dogs run away, the power around the town goes out constantly. Things get even stranger when the military arrives and it then becomes obvious that a serious situation has arisen. The film does an excellent job at reminding us what the Summer blockbuster used to be like and just how well film can captivate our imaginations and cultivate a sense of wonder in our hearts.Super 8 tells the kind of story we can easily recognize, follow, and still fall in love with. The film starts out as a mystery before we get to learn any of what is truly going on. We get plenty of vague clues that keep our senses sharp and our interest alive. Then when things begin to get answered the wonder and imagination take over and bewilder our minds with immaculate visuals. It's always nice when an engaging story follows through from beginning to end making sure to deliver a satisfying beginning, middle, and end. There are moments along the way that tend to drag the film down a little bit and there are certain character relationships that don't seem to be going anywhere towards the middle of the film. Thankfully it all pays off by the end and what Super 8 gives us is all very satisfying.The film's story reminds us of this simpler time of cinema, but so does the filmmaking. J.J. Abrams is an incredibly dedicated man and it is obvious that he wanted to make Super 8 in a very specific style that pleased himself and his audience of all ages. He keeps this nostalgia alive through beautiful cinematography that reflects the sweeping grandeur of the classic blockbusters we know and love today. Abrams doesn't rely on the shaky cam or an overdose of quick cuts and jumpy edits. He shoots the film with grace that excites and also mystifies. There are some awesome shots that capture a very pure vision that Abrams wanted to put forth in Super 8, making it a film with a lot of life and very high spirits.Overall Super 8 is a great movie that is incredibly fun. The story, while faltering at times, is a joy to watch unfold and all of the technical work on the film is magnificent. The film has a great look and feel to it that just forces you to fall in love with it. You can't help but enjoy all the characters, especially with some fantastic child actors playing these excellent roles, and the film is incredibly exciting with almost non-stop action for the entire final act. Super 8 isn't a masterpiece or anything, but it certainly reminds us why we love going to the movies and it relives a great time for filmmaking. This could easily be one of the best releases this summer.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"If you seen Cloverfield, don't bother with this one.","Beginning with the good aspects of this film, I have to say I was surprised by the cast. The kids do a good job and, even if I wasn't expecting anything good from Elle Fanning (don't know why), she did proved me wrong and did a brilliant job.Having said that, it's hard to defend this film. The narrative is full of holes and it's very predictable, even annoying. Bits like the one where a lighter doesn't work until the very last moment are simply stupid at this point in time because we've all seen it in a lot of movies and we know what's going to happen. And that's just one example in many others. It's like they think we're stupid. The story is a bit dated and adds nothing to the genre and, worst of all, it's very badly worked. As for the rest, it's competent as any decent Hollywood film, but it doesn't stand out in any way, making it banal.If you seen Cloverfield, and I loved that movie, don't bother with this one. It'll just make you angry.6/10 (and I'm being nice)",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
enormously disappointing,"I wish I could give this zero stars. The first fifteen minutes were pretty good. The the train crashes and the whole movie just falls apart, bit by bit. I left to get a drink refill, and when I was re-entering the theater a man was leaving, mumbling, ""worst movie ever..."" I thought he was being too harsh, but by the end, I agree.If you've seen ET, The Goonies, and War of the Worlds, then you've already seen Super 8. It's bits and pieces of other movies, chewed up and glued back together. There is not one iota of originality in this whole sorry film. The last five minutes will leave you vomiting into your shoes.This movie would be maybe 5/10 if it weren't for it's POTENTIAL!

Unremarkable Movie In Every Way.... Blah.,"This is a rather unremarkable movie in every way. The pacing was poor and the effects far below average but what really hurts this film is the fact that everything feels forced. You can actually feel the creators of the film try to inject humor or sentimentality where there's no room or where such things aren't earned or warranted. Even the drama feels forced and the danger not very palpable. Trying to tie the loss of a mother or the guilt of an alcoholic to a creature feature may seem like it adds emotional depth but when it's done wrong, it just comes across as shallow. Toss in an evil military presence and dumb as dirt town folk and I'm not sure even the creators of the film knew what they wanted this movie to be about. I was somewhat interested as to the outcome as a viewer so, I guess the movie did it's job but, again, does so in a completely unremarkable way.",,Anonymous,Mystery
A 7 not an 8..,"Not out in the United Kingdom just yet but people will be seeing a lot of 'high-praise' reviews before it hits cinemas on August 5th. I neither liked or disliked this brave attempt at re-living family orientated entertainment. It had that 80's vibe to it but its actual feelings and outcomes were inconsistent at best. Was it trying to be a modern take on E.T. or The Goonies, perhaps a hybrid of both, perhaps it wasn't trying to be anything other than a summer slice of entertainment. And it does this well, especially the first half hour. A magnificent but scary train crash near the start which sets the films plot going is a brilliant piece of film-making and the whole thing is shot pro-actively by JJ.Abrams, if only Mr.Spielberg could have been bothered to put his 2 pence worth in. just like with the last installment of Indianna Jones, he is running out of integrity and a batch of fresh ideas. Super 8 is passable stuff, i would'nt not recommend it, the kid actors are all terrific and lift the film from potential drowsiness, Elle Fanning, struggling with a secret, and the obligatory 'fat' kid being very good. It can not be easy to capture the essence and the trials and tribulations of growing up. I might have preferred this if i was a kid myself, technically i am not, but it did remind me of being a late teen and messing around with film scripts and trying to perform a film called ZombieMaster, but thats another story. The Monster in this was always in the shadows, and that actually became a side issue for a long time while they focused on bringing out the characters a little more, which is no bad thing(but in a summer blockbuster, some may tire of the pacing). The film also ends on a bit of a bummer with a far too obvious, and corny finish. So after seeing the nifty trailer and reading some exciting early reviews, its nothing more than a walk the lines, airy bit of fun with a couple of noteworthy performances and scenes. Kudos to the kids though!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
okay 7 for super 8....,"now, when i heard about this movie,i desperately wanted to see this film. mainly because of it's 'distinguished' story line.But this movie highly disappointed me because the entire story was divided into two parts which hardly interconnected physically or emotionally in the entire movie.First of all the cast i.e. the kids in the movie did not care a bit about the alien creature.The kids seem to be messed up in their own businesses rather than pay attention to the strange incidents happening in the town.the creature was given an entirely supporting role in the movie rather than being the hot topic of the film!! so the kids and the alien never interacted in the entire movie!! they pretty much did'nt care about each other.This is where the movie is flawed,right in the core.(The last stunt by the kid giving his locket to the creature does not count as an interaction,because it did'nt make sense). However i gave this movie a 7 because of it's amazing cast.The kids truly made the movie a fun to watch.Amazing acting skills,good humour,good execution.The entire credit goes to the cast and the direction.(Especially Elle,definitely better than her elder sister). One time watch ,which i recommend mainly because of the cast and the little creepiness which the movie adds.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Sometimes a movie should just be fun.      Super fun,This film was a lot of fun. I don't know if it matters if you see it on the IMAX screen but I did and I loved it. The train wreck scene on IMAX was incredible. To me this movie is a B+. It may not be the next E.T. but it certainly has a lot of entertainment value to it. If I had any complaints it would be with the ending but even that doesn't ruin this movie also I don't think this is a movie for very young children. There is some dirty language and a few scenes that are a bit too dark for the very young but the film is rated PG13. This is not the best movie ever but it's pretty damn good. It's worth the price of the ticket. Very well acted by the young cast of virtual unknowns. It has lots of jumps and surprises at certain points and is lighthearted at other time. I can't speak for everyone but I saw it opening weekend and the theater that I was at was packed and no one walked out during the film. The most common review that I have read and agree with about Super 8 is that this isa great summer movie. Get the popcorn and grab a seat.,8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Outstanding young actors carry affectionate tribute,"It's 1979, E.L.O. and The Knack are on the transistor radio and the Walkman, Three Mile Island is on the TV, but five young teenagers escape from school at the start of the summer vacation with nothing on their mind except finishing their zombie home movie, shot on a Super 8 movie camera. Well, not quite: one of them fancies the pretty blonde daughter of the local bad boy, and – having added the character of a wife for the zombie-hunting detective – asks one of the others to persuade her to join the crew.They assemble at the local train station at midnight to shoot the tearful wife begging her detective husband not to leave her. A real-life train thunders its way toward the station, and the team, eager to embrace the concept of 'production values', spring into action for a take. But a truck suddenly appears on the track, driving straight for the train.What follows sees the town experiencing mysterious vanishings of machines then people, the military taking a close interest in the train wreck and something very nasty in the woods, before an ending that well, more on that later.Produced by Steve Spielberg but written and directed by JJ Abrams, Super 8 is essentially a tribute to that far-off golden summer, when Abrams would have been thirteen himself. It's a tribute, too, to the small-town American values that Spielberg, of course, championed, to old-school movie making before digital age, and to friendship, and love (old and new), loss and letting go.Perhaps something more original could reasonably have been expected from Abrams, creator of Alias, Lost and Cloverfield; certainly much of the film's plot will be familiar to fans of Poltergeist, The Goonies, Explorers and all of those kids' adventure films of the mid-eighties. There are many inconsistencies, and many very very lucky co-incidences that keep things moving along. The adult performances are only adequate and the ending will be not at all unfamiliar to anyone who saw a certain Big Film of 1982.But it would be churlish to complain, and here's why.There are some neat nods to film-making techniques and tropes, such as the scientists' documentary footage that screams of fifties B-movies. In an echo of both Cloverfield and Spielberg's War of the Worlds, there are some inevitable 9/11 references and there is some blood and guts. Just as Spielberg portrayed this milieu and these emotions straight and without cynicism, so to does Abrams; there is nothing ironic or spiteful about the relationships depicted and the teenagers are each carefully drawn. Importantly, though, and to recognise that things do change in a generation, these teenagers are smart, snappy and modern, without being unpleasant or super-saccharine.Critically, the acting of every one of the six friends is, quite simply, superb. Joel Courtney is the quiet Joe, grieving for his mother but too confined by his father's reaction to the loss; Riley Griffiths is ballsy Charles, putative film mogul whose love for the girl nearly spoils things; Gabriel Basso is Martin, whose reactions as events spiral into an abyss shows real, genuine fear and pain; Ryan Lee is talkative firestarter Cary; and Zach Mills is world-weary Preston, with whom things are always safe. Improvisation shows in some of the sequences, and everyone gets their moment.It's Elle Fanning, however, as that Girl – Alice – who really shines.She delivers an exceptional performance throughout the film, but in two scenes in particular is absolutely heartbreaking. Both are enhanced by the sensitivity and skills of Abrams' direction. Early on, when the friends rehearse the film-within-the-film's station farewell scene, Abrams conjures a magical moment of young love emergent as, at the end of the take, all five of the boys are surprised to find lumps in their throats and the need for excuses to look away, the better to wipe their eyes. In contrast, when Alice later confesses her personal link to Joe's mother's death, it is made all the more powerful by the simplicity of its staging, Alice facing only the flickering screen showing Joe's father's home movies whilst Joe sits silently a little apart from her. I challenge anyone not to shed a tear at either scene, played to the hilt by an actress who was just twelve when the film was made.As if that wasn't enough to recommend it, don't miss the end credits. You don't get any outtakes or sneak peaks or dance numbers; but what you do get is The Case, the complete film-within-the-film that the characters started making at the beginning, with all the wise innocence you'd expect. It's wonderful.For all its flaws, this film's heart is absolutely in the right place, and if the direction and writing are a little lacking from their incendiary best at times, I think we can allow that.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Abrams evokes some of that old Spielberg magic,"On the poster for ""Super 8"" you'll see producer Steven Spielberg's name featured just as prominently as director J.J. Abrams'. That's the first indication that this movie seeks to recapture some of the magic behind past Spielberg offerings like ""E.T."" & ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"". While the movie falls a bit short of those classics it does indeed provide a pretty rewarding cinematic experience.The story is set in a small Ohio town in the summer of 1979, where a group of friends making a super 8 movie become witnesses to a catastrophic train wreck. They suspect that the crash was not an accident and soon the actions of Air Force personnel seem to confirm those suspicions. As strange events begin to occur the local deputy attempts to get to the bottom of the mystery and so do those who witnessed the initial crash.The movie includes little in the way of recognizable names & faces but that's no distraction. Newcomer Joel Courtney does just fine in his first film and young Elle Fanning gives an effective performance as well. Meanwhile, Kyle Chandler is stalwart as the father/deputy and I could even tolerate Ron Eldard, who's high on my list of least favourite actors.Abrams does double duty as director and writer and he does pretty well on both counts. His script definitely isn't perfect, though. The last act has been rightly criticized and some have also taken issue with his fairly obvious nods to Spielberg (but not me). Imperfections aside, I think that Abrams captures the spirit of vintage Spielberg better than anyone else (including Spielberg) has done for years. The period feel is also well done, benefiting from detailed production design and a nifty, period-specific soundtrack.All that being said, I don't blame some people for being disappointed, given that the ending isn't up to the same standard as the rest of the movie. However, the film's strengths make it worthwhile as a blockbuster that harks back to movies with more substance than today's offerings concerning battling robots and the like.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Next Summer, It Arrives.","Unlike many recent movie trailers where the marketers think it's a fantastic idea to spoil 97.6% of a film in its trailer, SUPER 8's marketing has been really old school. The trailers have been really mysterious, relying on intrigue to get the movie goers' butts in the theater seats, which help both the cases of the film and the movie goers because SUPER 8 is one of those films where you want to see it with knowing as little information about the film as possible. The mystery is what makes viewing SUPER 8 fun and exciting. And I have to say, SUPER 8 is one of the most joyous experiences I've ever had in a theater! THIS is how you make a great summer film.Saying that, what distinguishes SUPER 8 from most summer blockbusters (or contemporary films altogether) is this: The film tells a story in which we care for the characters in it. Sure, you can have explosions exploding every minute and add as many car chases as you want, but it's nothing if the audience doesn't care for the characters trying to survive or succeed their goal by the end of the film. I mean, that's what distinguishes good films from bad films, isn't it? The film is also masterfully told by director JJ Abrams revealing bits and pieces of the mystery at a time until the third act in which all is solved. And to top it off, the film also has pitch perfect pacing. Oh, and let's not forget about Michael Giacchino's excellent score. He really doesn't disappoint us here.While watching SUPER 8, one gets the feeling of many early Steven Spielberg 1980s classics. This is no coincidence seeing that JJ Abrams wanted to make a film as a homage of all the films he loved seeing when he was a kid, which may include ET, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, and STAND BY ME. And no, SUPER 8 doesn't reek of overly affection of the films that homage evolves to blatant copying. They're noticeable but subtle enough that they aren't a distraction. Abram's affection for these films also bring a sense of nostalgia (""the good ol' days"") and innocence, which is enhanced by having kids be the focus of the film. There's something genuine and heartfelt about SUPER 8 that many other films don't have, and it's Abram's love for filmmaking that makes SUPER 8 feel really human.It's obvious when I say that the young actors did a terrific job in here. Every single one of them were wisely chosen, including the film's protagonist, played by Joel Courtney. Even though this is his first film, you wouldn't think that when you see SUPER 8. He's perfectly casted, providing emotional depth to his character, and he's capable of carrying the film on his shoulders. There's also Elle Fanning, the sister of the more well known Dakota Fanning, and she acts well alongside Courtney. Ryan Lee is a scene stealer, providing some of the film's biggest laughs. And yes, there are a lot of laughs in the film. Riley Griffiths is also up to the task, with SUPER 8 also being his first film. The last two kids in the group, Gabriel Basso and Zach Mills, aren't as prominent, but they're just as good as the rest of the gang. Kyle Chandler, one of the very few adult actors that has some screen time, is pretty good as well.Overall, SUPER 8 provides an ORIGINAL(!!) emotional story, great performances by the young actors, an exciting sense of adventure, and exhilarating action scenes, resulting in one of the best feelings I've had in a movie theater and one of the best films I've ever seen. Director JJ Abrams has done it again, giving people another reason why he's one of the best new directors to look out for. EVERYONE should go out and watch SUPER 8 if you like great films. Also, stay during the end credits for a great surprise. 9.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
What the camera and the spider 8,"This is an interesting sci fi drama written and directed by J. J. Abrams, who also co-produced through his company Bad Robot. Abrams is Executive Producer of the Bad Robot TV series FRINGE (2008-2013, see my review), which is a highly superior sci fi series. This film is aimed at the family market, which is hardly surprising, as it is produced by Stephen Spielberg. The main characters are kids, and they are mostly highly amusing. The lead girl is Elle Fanning, younger sister of Dakota Fanning. She is an excellent actress, extremely attractive, and has the advantage of speaking clearly and not mumbling like her sister does. The lead boy is Joel Courtney, a highly likable young fellow with big sensitive eyes, who should go a long way. He plays Tom Sawyer in TOM SAWYER & HUCKLEBERRY FINN, which has just completed shooting, so we look forward to seeing him in that when it is released in 2013. I would say he is perfect for Tom Sawyer, and will be as good as or better than Jackie Coogan was in the 1930 production of TOM SAWYER (see my review). This film features an alien who is an intelligent arachnoid, a giant creature like a spider, with six legs and an ugly face, who wants to go home, but the US Air Force have kept him captive since his spaceship crashed in 1958, and they won't let him go. (Spielberg certainly does like the marooned ET motif.) The film features the most spectacular train crash I have ever seen on screen, and if you like train crashes, I believe nobody ever spent more money on one. The film has superior special effects throughout. The story is based on a group of kids in a California town who want to make a school film about zombies on 'super 8', the film used in home movie celluloid cameras. (This film is set in a time apparently meant to be the 1970s, before video cameras existed.) While shooting a scene at a small deserted train station one night, the kids get more than they bargained for, because a train roars by which then crashes and explodes, letting loose the alien creature, who then stalks the land. However, this is a film intended for family entertainment, so the shocks and horrors are restrained enough for kids to take. One surprise treat is that we see the kids' zombie film over the final credits, and it is funnier than the main film itself.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"A film with a mighty big heart, and every inch in the right place. A modern classic in the making and amongst the year's best.","As summer marches on and the remakes, reboots and adaptations continue to fill our silver screens, we are treated to the occasional little gem and this year's big-budget yet kind hearted feature comes in the form of J.J. Abrams' Super 8.Set in the small fictitious town of Lillian, Ohio, in 1979, Super 8 follows Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney) and his group of friends making a zombie film on a Super 8 camera. After convincing Alice (Elle Fanning) to get involved with the project, the group sets off to continue movie-making. During a shoot, a devastating train crash occurs, leaving mountains of burning rubble and debris. Suddenly something unexplainable bursts from the fiery ruins and sets its heart on causing havoc to the town. The group decides to pursue this strange mystery villain and aims to save Lillian from this threat.Super 8 mixes 80s sci-fi classics E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind.Super 8 mixes sci-fi classics E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind.Many have compared this picture to film director and producer Steven Spielberg's earlier works including E.T: The Extra-Terrestrial (1982) and Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) and other 80s escapist pictures such as The Goonies (1985). Some critics also have accused Super 8 of being a carbon-copy of Spielberg's films.Granted there are similarities between this picture and some of the above, but Super 8 should be compared to actor, director, producer, writer Rob Reiner's masterpiece Stand By Me (1986) – although the film lacks any Sci-Fi element, Super 8 is about friendship, about life and learning through experience; the group of boys set out to find a body and consequently find themselves along the way.The film's life lives with its characters. The public follows the group of children throughout and finds comfort in their presence. As with many films where children lead, the group is slightly type-cast (the fat one, the geeky one, the brave one, the mad one and so on), but the type-casting and formatting ends there. Thankfully Abrams knows the importance of character and development. Each member of the group is rounded, dimensional and interesting, as well as being frequently funny and effortlessly charming. Director JJ Abrams' fantastic script gives the group believable and naturalistic dialogue, so yes the kids do swear, quite a bit actually but that's how youngsters talk.Super 8 has been dubbed a family film too by some. I'd slightly argue against this – there are certain themes and messages here that are clearly aimed for the family audience: imagination, wonder, exploration and so forth, but there is also a lot of 'adult' material, and I don't just mean the language. A key narrative theme throughout is loss; the film opens with the funeral of Joe's mother and ideas of loss and misplacement are heavily implied throughout – even everyone's dogs run away. The film is also 'quite' scary and violent in places; there's no gore and just a very tiny amount of blood but the first hour is weighted in tension and suspense, something that may either terrify or bore smaller viewers. I would not see any particular harm in letting an under 12 watch it, just maybe not if they are under 8 or 9.As well as a brilliant group of characters and a cracking script, the film also sports some wonderful cinematography and breath-taking special effects. The train crash is incredible and one of 2011's best CGI (Computer-Generated Imagery) sequences - the epic pyrotechnics, flying carriages and deafening sounds make it a stand-out scene in this grand work. What is even better about the CGI is that there is very little of it. After the train, there isn't much more catastrophic action until the picture's climax, but filling that void is easy due to just how good the young actors are. The picture's duration simply flies by.Every performance is strong with Fanning and Riley Griffiths, who plays Charles Kaznyk (the fat one), being the show-stoppers. The pair bring charisma, skill and productiveness to their roles. Courtney is also great as Joe and does very well with carrying the emotional sequences as well as the escapist elements.Super 8 is certainly a homage rather than a 'suck-up'; it's a homage to simpler times, better cinema and the sense of awe and magic that swept through youth. If any film is going to embrace and bear-hug your inner child for 112 minutes, it's this. Abrams has crafted some unforgettable characters, a gripping and often tense environment and has breathed life back into retro science-fiction.Verdict: ●●●●● Read more on www.theupcoming.co.uk",,Anonymous,Mystery

Although on its surface a sci-fi film, it has warm, satisfying character development reminiscent of ""Stand By Me"". Elle Fanning turns in a performance with remarkable depth.

"A solid, though flawed, homage","Set in the 1980s, a group of friends are witness to a horrific train crash while filming a movie on their Super 8 camera. That sets into motion a chain of events involving the military, strange disappearances, and something very supernatural. It is left up to the kids to save the day.That, in short, is what 'Super 8' is about. It sounds like your typical PG science fiction movie aimed at teenagers and parents looking for a decent movie to watch. Thankfully, this JJ Abrams-directed movie is so much more than that. Foremost than anything else, 'Super 8' is an homage to the Spielberg classics of the eighties, and Abrams has deliberately copy-and-pasted that formula here.Of that formula, what Abrams has emulated the best is directing young actors. What made Spielberg films like 'ET' and 'The Goonies' so enjoyable was the chemistry between the young cast; it's the same here. The kids are the best thing about the movie – you're immediately drawn to them and root for them throughout. Joel Courtney (Joe), Elle Fanning (Alice) and Riley Griffiths (Charles) are the standouts, the performances seem to come so easily and naturally to them. Look in particular at Fanning's first 'acting' scene. It's brilliant.Unfortunately, the rest of the film is a bit of a letdown. Not because its rubbish, necessarily, but because nothing else in the film matches up to the joy of watching those kids act. The scenes with Kyle Chandler (as Joe's dad), the military, and other scenes with adults, they're quite dull and uninteresting. Similarly, the supernatural aspect of the film feels really rushed and unconvincing. I moved through the film just waiting for the kids to come back on screen. The actual story seems to get in the way, and that shouldn't be the case. There are some spectacular special effects though, especially the train crash at the beginning of the movie.To expect anybody – even someone as good as JJ Abrams – to come up with a movie that matches those eighties' Spielberg classics would be unfair. And, in all fairness, Abrams makes a good crack of it. While it could be better, I think 'Super 8' should be appreciated as a love letter. A love letter to the joy of filmmaking; a love letter to nostalgia; and mainly, a love letter to Steven Spielberg and what he brought to cinema.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Spielberg 2.0,"The more I think about ""Super 8,"" the more disappointed with the movie I get. By no means was it a terrible film but it did try to pass itself off as a homage to Spielberg classics we all grew up with and still enjoy. When you're setting the bar that high you better know you're going to reach it. Sadly, while the film may have been directed by J.J. Abrams, an obvious and laudable choice for the undertaking, Super 8 is a good film, not the experience I was hoping for.The film follows the grief stricken Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney), his Deputy Sheriff father (Kyle Chandler) and his small group of young troublemaking friends who are trying to make a cheap zombie flick with a super 8 camera. Joe and his hardworking father have become overwhelmed by the death of the family matriarch only a few short months ago and both are introduced as distant. Meanwhile Joe's best friend Charles (Riley Griffith) has become convinced that his film would have more resonance if a love interest was added (oh how cleverly they break the fourth wall). He then recruits Sally (Elle Fanning), the young and very cute daughter of the town drunk who also has friction with Deputy Lamb. They sneak off to the train station to shoot a pivotal scene and witness a terrific train derailment. Out of the wreckage a mysterious creature escapes into the nearby woods and shortly afterward, strange things start to happen around town. Metallic parts and then people start to disappear as the army descends on Anytown U.S.A.. The kids however are on the case.Everything in this film is filled to the brim with top of the line special effects and old fashioned storytelling. But while the story is told coherently it does seem to run on a mechanical heart. Take for example the opening sequence. Most of the characters gather at Mrs. Lamb's wake where an altercation occurs between Joe and Sally's fathers. What is wrong with this scene? Nothing really, but the fact that you know and I know this scene was meant to coax us to emotionally invest in the main character just feels unnatural and heartless. Its almost like padding until we get to the good stuff. The same is true with most scenes meant to evoke anything other than suspense. In another pivotal scene Joe tells his father he hates him. We've seen it before, we know we've seen it before yet its there because it has to be. The filmmakers seem to be asking ""why bother making it interesting?"" I blame this partially on the writing which bares its mechanics like so much exposed wiring. The stereotypical patterns of exposition, set up, foreshadowing etc. all appear with the same obviousness and lack of enchantment. I just couldn't help but thinking, ""I should be scared here, I should be sad here, I should be laughing here"" instead of ""I am, sad, happy or on the edge of my seat."" The only time I genuinely lost myself was during the train crash which managed to send tingles down my spine despite having seen it on the trailer countless times.Maybe one of the reasons, I couldn't get into it was the cinematography that J.J. Abrams constantly employs. While the light flairs and tracking shots worked to give ""Star Trek"" a glossy veneer, it was too distracting in ""Super 8"". Or maybe it was the fact that a lot of characters acted as plot devices rather than real people with motivations. Or maybe it was the unsubtle military bashing.Either way, I still enjoyed myself. The characters are fun, the story is told well and it did capture the moment, if only for a few minutes. Comparing ""Super 8"" to, say ""Close Encounters"" is like comparing The Beatles to U2; both may be good and some may even enjoy the new over the old, but its just not the same. You lose some of the flair and raw originality with every new generation and when you get down to it, its more imitation than re-imagination.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Super to the 8th Degree,Super 8 is a movie of amazing quality. When the original trailer came out last year the shortage of content within the trailer baffled many viewers as to what exactly what this movie is about. Throughout this year the Super 8 trailers have continued to gain the interest of many but shadow the movies overall story. This story happens to be one of the most greatly adapted tales since ET. This picture is also filled with spectacular jump moments to keep you on your toes throughout the movie. This wondrous movie itself is filled with mystery so as the movie progresses you must put what you've already seen together with what you have just seen at certain points to understand the movie. Overall Super 8 is one the most classically and successfully designed films in recent history. This movie is not to be missed. I personally give Super 8 a 10 out of 10 for it's unique design and it's hair-raising storyline.,10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Stick around for the credits.,"J. J. Abrams' ode to 80s child-driven mysteries like 'The Goonies (1985)' and family-oriented sci-fi like 'E. T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982)' focuses on a bunch of friends who somehow survive a horrific train wreck while shooting a low-budget B-movie. Soon, they find their real lives inhabited by a monster much more deadly than anything they've created with backyard special effects. The feature is a fairly fun ride throughout, with a relatively strong thematic underpinning and a group of mostly likeable lead characters. Though the group dynamic mostly involves the director character shouting at his crew, there are some believable and enjoyable interactions between the kids that make good use of the rare moments of quiet the film affords them. The relationship between the protagonist and his crush is rather well conceived because of the generational trauma they've inherited, an against-the-odds blossoming romance that seeks to prove that the mistakes of your parents shouldn't define your life (even if they sometimes do). The picture captures the atmosphere of its inspirations well, especially when it comes to its score - which sounds very much like something John Williams would compose. It also has a strong grasp on its suspense sequences, keeping its creature offscreen for as long as possible and instead using pure filmmaking to convey its tangible actions. When it does show up onscreen, it's a bit of a bland mess that blends with the background. It's decent enough for what it is, but the design itself is far less compelling than the way it's utilised in those early scenes in which it doesn't fully appear. The story is similar, in a way; its mysteries as far more compelling than its answers, but not so much because its mysteries are particularly enthralling as because its answers are sort of... not there? Well, they technically are, but they're so generic that they don't really feel like answers at all. This all leads to a rather wet ending that makes you realise its characters haven't really had a say in the plot's events. It also attempts to be emotionally affecting, but it skews towards an aspect of the flick's theming that hasn't been focused on all that much and feels a bit off because of it. Still, this is an entertaining experience overall. It's a well-made and enjoyable monster movie with convincing special effects, a dependable cast and a charming end-credits sequence.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"""Super 8"" is a perfect 11","If you want greatness and real power and heart in one summer movie? Well, with a smart and moving script,fast-paced direction and superior visuals,producer Steven Spielberg and writer/director J.J Abrams's ""Super 8"" delivers a powerful ""yes"". From the first minute to the last, this is pure movie heaven.It's about a group of children who makes a film on a super 8 camera. One night, while filming, they see a train crash and it unleashes a secret creature that brings terror to the town.Abrams helps keep the audience in their seats with his fast-timing and sharp direction and a wise and smart script that keep the viewers guessing. Cinematographer Larry Fong help gives the film its stunning and impressive images. The visual effects from the team at Industrial Light and Magic is a wonder to behold.Elle Fanning and newcomer Joel Courtney respectively give bright and wonderful performances as the leads, Alice and Joe. Kyle Chandler {TV's ""Friday Night Lights""} is good as Joe's father, Jackson. Ron Eldard, who plays Annie's father, Louis, gives a great and standout performance that's worth deserving of an Oscar nomination.The film's ending reminded me of another Spielberg film, ""Close Encounters of The Third Kind"". They both give a message that no matter who you are, no matter what happens, you still need the strength to live.This is one summer movie that let you hold on and never let go. Come next year, ""Super 8"" will hopefully become one of the 10 Oscar nominees for Best picture. Don't walk. Run to the box office now.My pick: Green light {See It}",,Anonymous,Mystery
Love letter to the early Spielberg films,"What if E.T. had been caught by government agents and was then experimented upon for years before managing to escape? Okay, sure, that's not the exact story here, but it tells you the style and mood the film is going for. Or would have gone for, had Spielberg decided to make his legendary film with such a story back in the 80s. In many ways this film feels and acts like a retelling of that movie, even having Spielberg working on it as its producer.And for the most part, it works. The story this time around is that a bunch of kids are looking to shoot a movie of their own for a film competition. One of them, Charles (Riley Griffiths), is a budding director, mad about stories and cameras, while the main character of the film, Joe (Joel Courtney), works as his special effects and makeup guy. They even manage to convince a cute girl from school, Alice (Elle Fanning), to act in their film. Then things take a turn for the weirder when they witness a train crash while shooting a train station scene. And before they know it, their small town is swarming with military and odd things start happening all around.Very classic Spielberg, with bits and pieces of Stephen King thrown in for added flavour. But I mean that in a good way. It feels nostalgic, like something we haven't seen in decades, but which still feels instantly familiar and comforting. Sure its depiction of American small town life is very idyllic and romanticized, but it still deals with darker themes as well, with Alice coming from a rougher part of town and with Joe's problems with his dad, who's both absent and over-protective at the same time.Unfortunately, while the film has the style and mood down pat, I'm not a huge fan of the story. A truly great film often works because you can identify with all the characters, no matter how strange or twisted they are. E.T. was very sympathetic and identifiable, but you could understand the point of view of the government agents as well. Not so much here. The antagonists are very unlikable, or aren't given any screen time for us to understand them. They're simply there because the film needs a villain, a monster for the kids to overcome. Sure, there are attempts by the script to make the villains more justified in their actions, but it's once again a case of telling, not showing, which makes it way less effective.Still, I do like all the kid characters and most of the townsfolk are enjoyable as well. The film honestly looks amazing, has a good soundtrack and even story is by no means bad. It just doesn't quite live up to the films it's paying homage to.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Super 7,"There are parts of this I really loved. I think JJ gets that 80s vibe really well. He's a director that seems like he just loves movies and wants to pay homage to things and I totally appreciate that. JJ has a style though that is very much his own and I find it rarely resonates with me in the way I would like it to. It's not just the lens flares, though oh my god the lens flares could stop at any time JJ! There's just something about the way he films his movies that has me feeling so close to loving them and yet not quite reaching that point. Super 8 fits right into that window of an idea I liked, a screenplay and direction that seemed solid but I couldn't help but wonder if I would like it more had someone else directed it.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Fun, Funny, full of holes","If one is looking for reasons not to like Super 8 there's plenty available. Most notably, at different times of the movie you really have to be willing to suspend disbelief to keep your head in it. For example, a car runs head on with a train. The crash causes the best train wreak that anyone has ever created on film. The train is derailed and its cars fly in every direction banging and bouncing and...it's quite dramatic. But then the guy in the car that hit the train is not only still in one piece in his car, he's alive and able to talk. Sorry, but in real life that guy would have eaten the steering wheel and the engine. There's also plenty of other parts that are tough to swallow. But the truth is the movie is so enjoyable that I, for one, was completely willing and wanting to suspend disbelief. The kids that starred in it were perfectly cast and did a superb job. It is a perfect Summer kick off movie, reminiscent of ET, Back to the Future, and The Goonies.Popcorn eating fun at its best.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
JJ Abrams 'phones home' a winner,"JJ Abrams holds school on how to properly ""rip off"" a genre. You just feel the electricity of E.T. running through the kids, the neighborhoods, and right on through to yourself.Aside from a few seemingly needless plot holes, this movie works. Everything works, from the core plot (small shift-shaping cubes that that can form into anything) to the seamless effects, to the nothing-short-of-brilliant acting by the child actors.Fasten your seat belts with regard to the sprouting acting career of 14 year old Elle Fanning. This young lady was born to the profession. Her moving, and at the same time disturbing performance in 'Phoebe in Wonderland' at age 8 blew my mind. One of my favorite scenes in this film is when Elle turns from a human being into a ghoul in one single shot. At the top of the shot she is simply wearing face paint in a closeup. When prompted, she turns her head down, her eyes up... and without even changing expressions transforms into a scary monster. Chilling. You go Elle!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
JJ Abrams makes his update of The Goonies.,"I knew nothing about Super 8 going in aside from the trailer, that JJ Abrams made it and that Steven Spielberg was somehow involved. Since watching the film I have seen a JJ Abrams interview and read a review that totally gave a major plot development away.I will try not to do that here, as I think I would be pretty p*ssed if someone gave away such information prior to me watching it Super 8 is set on the cusp of the 80s in a small town in the United States named Lillian. In the opening moments we can see that there has been an accident in a local steel mill, moments later we learn it was the mother of Joe, a local boy (I would say 'teen' but he is really still a 'boy').With the summer break arriving and both Joe and his policeman father still coming to grips with the unexpected passing, Dad thinks Joe would be well served spending his free time at a youth camp.Joe decides he'd rather commit his summer to helping his portly budding director chum as he finishes up his homemade zombie opus. Joe will be on makeup and special effects duties.So unbeknownst to Dad, Joe and five other local kids head off in the late evening to complete some scenes, the unexpected inclusion of young Alice only sweetens the deal for Joe When the filming of the first big scene of the night is interrupted by a massive train crash that occurs within metres of the 'set', the course of the entire summer is instantly changed. And probably their lives whatever.I might digress here by saying that the train crash is so spectacular and action packed that it seems determined to subvert the very laws of science and nature. For almost two minutes after the initial impact carriages and debris are still hurtling about the place, always perilously close to one kid or another.But with no-one hurt (!) the shaken sextet gather up their stuff and head home hoping that the approaching vehicles saw them, and more importantly that their parents were aware that they were even out of the house.The train wreck is understandably all over the news the next day in Lillian, but the kids swear that they will not tell a soul that they were there, nor that they saw one of their teachers at the scene and strongly suspect he had something to do with it.I'll leave the exposition there, but can inform you that the how/why/what/where and who's? are all answered in the ensuing hour or so.The secret to enjoying Super 8 to the fullest is understanding what it is aiming to be. In my opinion this is a film that aspires to be a 21st Century equivalent to The Goonies, a light, fun and most of all non-confrontational film for kids.Super 8 is perhaps less focused, less creative than The Goonies, and features many big explosions and other noisy distractions near the end, but it has no real violence nor truly scary scenes, and no sex or profanity to speak of.Like The Goonies it isn't really that hilarious or even action packed, but it moves along at a swift pace and never causes you to check your watch or even look away. Super 8 is hardly Die Hard, The Last Boy Scout, Bad Boys or even Aliens, but you could do a lot worse. (And I didn't name Bad Boys because I think it is good I don't.) Final Rating – 7 / 10. An action film with 'other' elements to keep the younger lads content, with a sort-of romantic subplot building to make sure the girls don't leave.I'd much rather lil Billy n Bessie spent a couple hours watching Super 8 than the latest Saw knock-off or Saw itself for that matter.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Super Film!,"I think ""Super 8"" deserves the praise that it has been given for this film was refreshing from many films out there now. However, i'm not one of those cynical people who say ""finally, a good movie amongst sequels, reboots and comic book movies"" because I love all of those but I do agree that it is still refreshing and has more focus on character than many films. ""Super 8"" owes it's praise to the casting, especially of the children who have an amazing chemistry and keep you amused all the way through...even in the actiony moments. Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney) was like the leading man of the group, he was the most normal, likable and has the most substance in back story. But then there is the goofy and humorous Cary (Ryan Lee) who always carries fireworks. Also there is the wuss of the pack Martin (Gabriel Basso), the bossy director Charles (Riley Griffis) and the list goes on. Point is, each character is unique and individual yet they manage to dwell really well together, allowing to conjure up many laughs even in the intense moments. That's what made this film special, because it was from the point of view of kids instead of from the military or grown ups and in the scary moments you could laugh because of the humour of the children. This was a good film, but maybe the ending was a bit weak. Not bad but a bit weak compared to the amazing suspense and steady pace of the film. It doesn't spoil the film though. Stay for the credits because they show the short film the kids are trying to make in the film and it is really funny. The language is an issue, as a Christian the blaspheming (about 5 times) was offencive and inappropriate especially coming mainly from Charles. But there were no sexual scenes which was good. Overall, a really good film with great characters and a great story. Enjoy!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"And I just knew then that I was there, that I existed.","Super 8 is written and directed by J. J. Abrams. It stars Joel Courtney, Elle Fanning, Kyle Chandler, Ron Eldard and Riley Griffiths. Music is scored by Michael Giacchino and cinematography by Larry Fong. The film tells the story of a group of young teenagers in Lillian, Ohio, 1979, who are filming their own Super 8 zombie movie when a train derails and crashes, releasing an unknown being into their midst. As the town is threatened and mysteries start to mount up, the youngsters must come to terms with not only that, but also growing up mentally and physically.It's feels nigh on impossible to come across a review for Super 8 that doesn't contain the name Spielberg. With the film overtly Spiebergian in themes and production, and the bearded maestro of the film geek masses on producer duties here, his name hangs over Abrams' movie like a watchful father figure. If that bothers Abrams, or indeed if it detracts from the quality of his movie? Then that's up for debate by those not enamoured with Spielberg's movies of the late 70s and early 80s. But to my mind it's a blessing, a triumph of sorts to be mentioned in the same breath as the beard and those wonderful movies of his. Part homage, part nostalgia harking, Super 8 is still one great, sweet and affecting J.J. Abrams movie.Abrams himself is on record as saying that Super 8 is born out of two movie ideas he had, this while also being drawn from his own recollections in childhood, and the two movie idea shows. It's very much a two part picture in structure, part Stand by Me coming of ager, part Goonie like monster hunt. Nothing wrong with that, mind. However, with that comes some form of irritation to those who venture in expecting a big ole alien attack movie. Oh for sure he exists, and he is big and mean, although he has just cause, but the creature is not the centre piece of the movie. It's the human characters that form the basis of Super 8, be it the kids adjusting to their changing emotions and hormones, or the single parent fathers coming to terms with absence of love and grief, Super 8 is brimming with human heart. Yet never is it schmaltzy.PRODUCTION VALUE!Aided by Fong's warm metallic hued photography and Giacchino's beautiful heart tugging score (both energised in Blu-ray), Super 8 always carries a magical mysticism to it. The warm glow of nostalgia cloaks the proceedings, never cloying, always smile inducing, offering comfort as the narrative deals out observations about the need to let go while playing out as a deft, if unsubtle, meditation on grief and growing pains. The cast do wonders for their director, Fanning and Courtney are exemplary, so much raw emotion and energy, it's unfussy and believable acting. Griffith's, too, is wonderful as the booming voiced wannabe director, a tender nod of the head to the many young amateur directors out there; of which Abrams was once one himself. While Eldard and Chandler as the two fathers are most affecting, the pangs of juggling single parenting with loss are deeply portrayed.Of the director himself? He crafts it with care and precision, a knowing of the pulse beat of the thematics to drive it forward. His attention to period details are admirable, from the dialogue sparks involving Walkman's and Soviet paranoia, to the items located within the bedrooms and houses of our young protagonists, he is a man who knows his late 70s and early 80s onions. Spielberg was far from finished as a film maker of note at the time of Super 8's release, but it did feel then that the torch was deftly being passed sideways. After the excellence of Star Trek he followed up with this most delightful of movies, where Abrams showed in his work a love of cinema that's wholly infectious. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Solid Sci-Fi Thriller,"Super 8 is one of those Spielberg films that he didn't direct, but yet you can easily see his imprint on it. J.J Abrams did a great job directing this mystery thriller with an unbelievably young cast. I was quite surprised at the talent of the core 5 actors who are filming a Super 8 movie and end up coming across an Alien like attack. Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning give believable performances but at times the romance did feel a little too cliché. Overall it's a thrilling experience that makes you remember some of the great Sci-Fi flicks of the past.With Abrams and Spielberg at the helm I would have thought there would be more star power at the core of this film. But I guess if you think about Close Encounters of the Third Kind, that had virtually all unknown actors at the time. I would have liked to see a little bit more of the actual monster/alien in the 2 hour running time. I did feel like the ending resolution to the Alien was a tad out of place. But I did like the story of Joe losing his mom and basically trying to get over her throughout the film. But at the same time I think in order for us all to feel the emotional impact they wanted us to feel.It was refreshing to see a blockbuster movie led by basically an all under 15 year old cast. You just don't get to see that in Hollywood these days. Even with some of its gory moments, I think this is a movie that can be enjoyed by an entire family. Now can Abrams get Spielberg to help him direct one of the new Star Wars films?

Elle Fanning, and Kyle Chandler do an amazing job performing their awe stricken roles! Along with that there's a lot of cool tricks going on, like how there's a movie in a movie, and a lot of comedy which makes fun of movies themselves(clever;).Super 8 does almost everything well, from the ""production value"" (you'll understand after you watch it), to the 1980's cinematography, to the acting, and to the directing. Which even though the film states is all Abrahms, you can really feel a pull sometimes back in forth between scenes that Abrams company may have done, or scenes that Spielberg may have done.The films becomes a little slow in the middle, but it's nowhere as slow as with most movies that do this, the rest is just so good that it's noticeable.Overall this film is completely re-watchable, and I think almost anybody could enjoy it.

Absolutely nothing new here,"Yes! It is one part 'Cloverfield' with a dollop of 'ET' and a dash of 'Goonies'. Now, if it was a bad movie then the vultures could gather and shred this corpse. It wasn't a bad movie. But, it is far from original in any respect and, unfortunately, it began to be a let-down, plot-wise, toward the end as you witnessed all of the formulaic elements come together and merge into an ending that tries so hard to compel a tear from the viewer's eye. There's no surprises. It's almost thought provoking -- just barely -- yet it tsunamis any morals away by the time the alien makes his(her?) final exit. I suppose if you like good sci-fi with entrenched morals you could always go watch an old Outer Limits. You won't find it here. Still, the acting is excellent, the special-effects are top-notch....in fact, the movie is very well made. But, we've been down this road before...and we'll likely be going down it again. It's inevitable. I don't mind. A little originality would be a nice surprise. I do think ""they're"" running out of ideas for alien configurations, though. There is a long build-up before you get to see it and then it's >groan<. More convoluted spins on ideas already beat to death.

1979 is back,"The plot of J.J. Abrams's ""Super 8"" is quite clear, and it is equally clear that the movie takes a lot of cues from producer Steven Spielberg's movies ""Close Encounters with the Third Kind"" and ""E.T."". But there's more that I interpret. The movie is set in 1979, when my parents' generation was approximately the age that my generation is now. Both years had seen a previous decade of cynicism. This year's Arab Spring is analogous to the Iranian Revolution that year, and the news clip about Three Mile Island brings to mind Fukushima. And of course, both years saw the economy faring poorly.Of course, that's probably all a coincidence. The movie itself brings up good points about government cover-ups, while also showing kids having the most fun possible. Without a doubt I would have loved to participate in the making of that zombie flick.As yet I haven't seen any other of J.J. Abrams's work.

I think it all comes to deceptiveness of this film. There are well-made movies and poorly made movies, but deceptiveness is a unique characteristic that runs across these lines.A deceptive movie is a hollow, empty movie that pretends to have a depth and a substance that in fact it does not possess. A deceptive movie (just like a deceptive person) gives empty promises, false hopes and expectations to the unsuspecting viewers. By the end of a deceptive movie, its poor victims find the promises unfulfilled, the expectations crushed, and the hopes lost in vain.""Super 8"" promised a big, exciting, and enjoyable Mystery. Not only the promised mystery turns out to be somewhat predictable and not very impressive, but it also comes forth as underdeveloped and superficial.The movie fails to find the right balance between the two very different stories: a sci-fi mystery story and a story of the middle school students shooting a Super 8 film for a festival in Cleveland. Ideally, these two stories are supposed to nicely complement each other and to be smoothly and intricately intertwined. In the sad reality of ""Super 8"", they do not blend and keep fighting with each other for the screen time throughout the movie.The constant switches between the two main stories quickly become disrupting for the movie flow. First, the movie would immerse us in a tricky and nostalgic world of the teenage relationships and even hint for some depth and character development, and then it would almost abruptly switch gears and go into a hard-core sci-fi action/mystery mode. It would almost succeed in making us excited about the sci-fi part only to quickly switch back to the twists and turns of the teenage relationships saga.As a result, both plot lines lack depth and remain superficial and underdeveloped.""Super 8"" makes a significant effort to re-create a look and feel of a small American town in the late 1970s. It makes us believe that the time setting of the movie has a purpose, significance, and that it will play a role in the movie by somehow anchoring the events. This impression, however, turns out to be false. The plot can be easily moved ten, twenty, thirty years forward in time with some minor modifications. The only ones who would suffer from that would be a small group of nostalgic fans of the ""Super 8"" motion picture film format.Moreover, while the movie does a remarkably good job at recreating all the minor details of the time, it fails to breathe life into its perfect, but soulless, artificial creation.Almost everything in the movie is an over-used cliché: a group of teenagers with the predictable characters and relationships, a sheriff of a small town and his heroic deputy, a quirky town folk, a rogue, but noble scientist that fights a caricature military villain. Last, but not the least is the disappointing, underdeveloped so-called ""mystery"" that looks like it has been compiled from some past movies featuring similar ""mysteries"".Overall, there is a lot of technical professionalism, thoroughness, and attention to detail in ""Super 8"", but not so much heart or depth.In some movies, a good acting redeems the lack of depth or the deficiencies of the plot. Unfortunately, that is not the case for ""Super 8"" with its mostly mediocre acting. The only bright spot in the cast are some of the teenage actors, and especially Elle Fanning! Her sincere, deep, and versatile performance easily wins the audience.In conclusion, the movie does not do justice for J.J. Abrams who as we very well know is quite capable of creating such gems as ""Star Trek"" (2009). In ""Super 8"", however, there seems to be much more of Steven Spielberg, who produced it, than of J.J. Abrams who wrote it and directed it. In my opinion, this is a classic example when a too heavy influence of the producer not only does not benefit the movie, but also makes it quite shallower and quite less original than it potentially could have been.knowyourmovie.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Super 8 is the reason why I see the movies,"Super 8 is not what the trailers build it up as—another science-fiction end of the world scenario. J.J. Abrams has something much more unique and surprising in mind. Abrams focus is not the visual effects; they are actually kept to a minimum, but rather the characters and the plot. I did not recognize any of the actors, but all of them perform flawlessly, especially the kids. They are so amusing to watch on the big screen, as well as engaging. When they laugh, you laugh with them. When they are in danger, you feel that anxiety. When they are in pain, you feel it—and it hurts. If there was a best ensemble cast award, this feature should win it. If I had to pick the best of all of the actors, it would Elle Fanning—though very unlikely, she deserves an Oscar for her performance.I will admit that J.J. Abrams seemed to borrow some elements of other films, such as: E.T., War of the Worlds, The Goonies, Signs, and Transformers. Even so, this film stands as its own and it is not a ripoff, like some of the more newer sci-fi releases. It is a creative and a special film to watch. Abrams even ties in some powerful symbolism and themes into this film without getting preachy—I will not give these or the story away, for they are that good. One thing that some people may not like about this film is how loud the sound design is. It is really loud, particularly with the jump moments and a train crash sequence. I personally don't like deafening sound in theaters, but this technique by the sound designers and editors fits the film perfectly—the movie would not have had such an impact without this approach.In short, ""Super 8"" is the reason why I see movies. It has believable, compelling performances, sublime film-making, a creative story, and it is well-paced. There is also plenty of action, suspense, drama, and humor. This film is also beautifully photographed, with awesome sound, and Michael Giacchino's best score to date. If you have lost faith in Hollywood's release of movies, see Super 8. J.J. Abrams has a shot to revive the film industry from the dumper that it has been heading in for the last decade.Rating: ****/****",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Excellent story, plot, characters","I saw this film, careful to go in not knowing too much about it. And it's not my intention to ruin things for anyone else by explaining it all here. This is a great Summer film, and a film with enough explosions and scares to keep a broad audience on their toes. Yet there is a great script, and an original plot that is not that common to the expected Summer Blockbuster.I know the director is keen to point out that it is not a Spielberg homage, but you can not avoid drawing comparisons. However, if you were a painter, would the odd influence or comparison to Da Vinci be all that bad? The influence as I see it, is on great casting, fabulous details in the development of the supporting cast, and a plot that honestly leaves the audience guessing until the final reel. Hats off to the writer/director, and hopefully he wont mind passing a little of this appreciation on to the Executive Producer.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Seemingly misunderstood by many,"I'm surprised at the many negative reviews here. My only guess is that those people weren't in synch with what the film was trying to accomplish, which I think it did incredibly successfully.Its a specific genre piece almost as niched as a grindhouse film - and if you aren't in that groove, then you won't enjoy it as much as those who are. And that genre is ""Spielberg eighties"".The monster in the film is a red herring - a catalyst that drives many other stories elements forward and together.The film is really about growing up and letting go (of the past, of grief, of regret, of grudges). I noticed many subtle moments where characters are either forced to, or choose, to let go of something. The way that these moments are interwoven with the story are brilliant.If you're in synch with Spielberg style nostalgia, then there's a lot to appreciate in this film. If you're part of the soulless CGI Facebook generation, then you probably won't find it.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Passable,"Super 8 is a pretty average film. On a technical level, it's fantastic. The set design was fantastic throughout the film; the caves underneath the town in particular looked really great. They were dingy, wet, and dark. The train station also stuck out to me as very well designed and it was clear early on the guy in charge of set design knew what he was doing. The lighting was great but there were a few scenes where it felt wrong. The lighting in the cave scene as a whole looked good but the lighting on the characters was not that great. It seemed pretty obvious that there was an artificial light source pointed at their faces constantly, seeing as how their faces managed to never leave the light at all. The cinematography, as far as I was concerned, was about as good as it could get. Some of the shots that stuck out included the scene where the kids were talking on the phone and Abrams used these really creatively framed shots from the floor that allowed the camera to capture everything in the scene on both ends without the camera moving at all, which I thought was pretty great. There was also a panning shot during a driving scene where the camera followed the car from the sidewalk, giving the viewer the feeling that they're standing there on the sidewalk themselves watching it drive by. That was really cool. All in all, well made on the technical level.As far as characters and acting, again this movie shines. The actors are great for the most part (Elle Fanning was flat and seemed like she was bored throughout the entire movie). When characters needed to be emotional (except for Elle's) the acting and writing always supported the scene. The children's dialogue was actually incredibly well written. I didn't really expect them all to be written too well, but the dialogue was consistently great with a few rough spots here and there. They all felt like real kids and their chemistry together works well enough for me to safely say the actors were very well directed and aside from Elle Fanning, every actor did pretty well. They weren't perfect, but no movie is anyways, of course.I also have to comment before I get to the story that the tone and setting are established incredibly well. There's only one scene in the entire movie that had tone whiplash, and that was mostly due to a necessary transition for the plot. The time of the movie was actually established without the movie telling me anything. As I watched it, I observed the music playing and all the timely posters and set pieces to guess the time period the movie was set in. I guessed late 70s-early 80s. And sure enough, the movie took place in 1979. The fact that I could guess so accurately without it being told to me is a testament to how well Abrams conveyed the time period and the universe. Again, it isn't absolutely perfect. For most of the first act it felt like Abrams was beating me over the head with it, but overall I liked it.Now to talk about the story. I'll be blunt: it wasn't very good. Character motivations were sometimes unclear or forced due to the movie skimming over some of the plot lines in the movie, and there are some really obvious errors in conversations transferring from scene to scene that are so jarring I'm stunned Abrams didn't notice or think about them. The movie brushes over a few really overused clichés such as the overworked cop who is told by his superior to take a break (which has been done a million times by the way), and there are frequent lines that make absolutely no sense in context with what was just said. It almost seems like characters forget things that happened 2 seconds ago due to the uneven screenplay at times. I say at times because these moments aren't that frequent, but they did still bother me. What weighed heavily on the film and dragged it down more than anything though were the plethora of plot holes and errors in logic that pile up quickly. I'm not going to list them because I want this to be spoiler free, but let's just say my notes were littered with these script writing errors and leave it at that.In conclusion, Super 8 is a great movie on a technical level. The acting is pretty good, and the dialogue is excellent. Unfortunately, the story is rather poor and is in my opinion the weakest aspect of the film. Even though I'm giving it a 6 I want to emphasize that this is a good film. It just has a lot of flaws in its narrative weighing it down.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
works as a tribute film,"This very much reminded me of those early Stephen Spielberg films or Stephen King books/movies from the 80's. Its basically an homage to those (Goonies, E.T, Stand By Me) even going so far as to take place in 1979.We follow a group of friends (including the obligatory fat kid) in small town Ohio as they attempt to film an amateur movie for a school project. While filming they witness a train derailment (big special effects here and pretty cool) and then an otherworldly force begins to stalk their town. Of course it's only the kids that know what's really going on as the army descends and adults scramble.I'd be curious to see what the young adult crowd thought of this? It didn't do much for me. I don't know though, I can still watch ET and feel the magic, the magic was missing here. As a tribute film however this works just fine.

"Not much of a story, but it was told in an incredible way","The story telling was great. It was set up in such a way that gets you interested. The backdrop of the kids making a movie was a fantastic idea. The kids were great. If not for anything else, it was good to watch a film about a bunch of kids hanging out and making a movie together, and about how they dealt with their personal problems as well as a much more serious situation. I especially loved the performance of Joel Courtney, who played the protagonist. Elle Fanning and Riley Griffiths did a splendid job too. The other kids weren't as important, but I loved watching even them.I enjoyed the way the story unfolded. The mystery element was done very well, because I had no idea what was going on, and I really wanted to find out. There were moments when I was gripping my seat and covering my eyes. I enjoyed how the other worldly elements slowly blended into everyday life.All of that being said, once the mystery unfolded my reaction was ""Seriously?"" And my final thoughts about the movie sum up to ""Meh"". The fist half was worth it perhaps, but I felt let down when we found out what was really going on, and also the ending made no sense at all.To those who are thinking of going to watch this - I'm sure kids will like this (given the PG 13 rating, I suppose I mean older kids), and it also depends on what type of movie you like. I'm not much into Mystery/Sci-fi/Thrillers, so maybe I was let down because of having no experience with this genre. However, make sure you stay for the credits because they actually play the movie the kids put together, and that was hilarious!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"See it on the ""BIG"" screen","As we grow older and hopefully wiser we seem to look back to our past as ""simpler"" times. A time of innocence. It is during this ""simpler"" time, 1979, when Charles (Riley Griffiths) - a want-to-be director, enlists the aid of his junior high friends to make a ""Super 8"" movie. His dream is to enter his movie in an upcoming contest and of course win fame and fortune. It is during the filming of an all important scene when Joe (Joel Courtney) notices a white pick-up truck enter the path of a speeding freight train. As the kids run for cover, the camera is left running and films the entire crash. The train disaster unleashes a secret that has been kept from the American public since 1958. The arrival of the military and their very hush hush demeanor has the town deputy looking for answers.The group of young filmmakers continue on and when the original role of super 8 film is returned from the lab (remember when you had to wait for film to be developed?), Joe and Charles get a look at why the military has occupied the peaceful burg of Lillian, Ohio.Government conspiracy, man's inhumanity to anything different than ourselves, rivalry between friends, young love and most of all being able to let go of your past to grow and move into the future are all explored during the 112 minute run time.This film is definitely worth a trip to the theater to see on the big screen. The special effects would loose some of their impact - even on those 55"" and 60"" full HD TV's.The ""secret"" is kept hidden enough to keep the audience guessing and ads to some ""shock"" moments that may make you jump.Overall and enjoyable film - rated PG-13 the film could be disturbing to some younger viewers - I recommend you go see this one.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Familiar but very entertaining,"As a producer, Stephen Spielberg tends to leave his mark on films in a way other producers don't. Movies like Poltergeist and Back to the Future were so Spielbergian that one could assume he directed them.Super 8 is very much a Spielberg production. Even more, it is a 1980s Spielberg production, with the radiant light, sweeping orchestral score and plucky but fairly realistic children that distinguished many of his 80s films.Pure popcorn entertainment, Super 8 efficiently delivers excitement, adventure and a smidgen of romance amidst aliens and untrustworthy military men. Emotions are touched lightly, but never deeply enough to halt the smooth flow of the movie.The result is pleasantly familiar. It is a movie that I would have liked if I were still a teenager, but that I still totally connect with today (unlike a lot of movies about kids that are too flashy and modern to connect with an old fogey like me).Is it a great movie? No. I wouldn't even say it was particularly memorable, and it certainly has all sorts of plot holes and inconsistencies. And yet, while I was watching it I was completely enjoying myself.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Decent 7,"Super 8 is a decent movie which is surprising for a J.J. Abrams film. The movie starts out as a homage to Spielberg's Stand By Me. The children are very good in the movie and they are the best part of the entire production. The interaction is well done and the acting is good. While Abrams tries, in the beginning, to be a ""real"" director, it works and the movie is a nice change of pace. When Abrams starts to become J.J. Abrams again, the movie fails. Once Abrams gets his hand on the action/sci-fi part of the movie, he makes another blow-up everything, Transformers-wanna-be. The last ten minutes blow-up the nice work that the beginning of the film had. It is ashame that Abrams has to revert back to being Abrams at the end of the picture.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not there yet,"The movie has a nice touch to it. Bringing a few good friends as kids kinda remind me of the old movie Stand By Me. But that's where the good ends. The suspense built around how the monster/alien looks like is dragged far too long. At the moment I caught a glimpse of the alien, I waited a little more to see how it looks like. And the wait became too long. I can only see how the alien looks like near the end of the film, which spoils the suspense.Steven Spielberg is getting old I guess. But on the plus side, the alien effects are pretty good. Appears authentic. But there are scenes where it does not make sense. for example, after the boy rescue the girl, if I were them, i'd be running away from the like hell. But no, they decided to chat and hug first. Meh.

Amazing acting and directing.,"Let's just not avoid it, the story is at most average for a Sci-Fi. It's ET and alien horror hybrid. They just don't fit together. The surprise is, you just don't care!In my opinion the story is intentionally like this, because it is only the secondary line in this film, and it's just necessary to have one. The main plot is about a bunch of children, the friendship between them, and a beautiful love story. There is a lot of personal crisis, mainly the ones that would prevent their love, and the role of the main story about the alien is just serves the good environment for their character development.The characters, their story, and the acting is just beautiful, and the directing makes it even better! And the beautiful acting gets another twist, because they make a movie inside the movie, where they have different roles, and they play that personality through their main one... this just cannot be written down, you have to see it to understand.Sadly the main source of negative reviews is that this film is categorized as Sci-Fi, and they concentrate about the main story line, which is secondary here. As a Sci-Fi I couldn't give 10/10, but as a film, it deserves even more, like an Oscar! This film is just the complete opposite of Skyline: That being an average-good Sci-Fi in a bad movie, while this is an average-bad Sci-Fi in an excellent movie!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
With Super Eight J.J. Abrams Proves He Has Not Lost His Touch,"The new sci-fi thriller, Super Eight, proves that writer/director J.J. Abrams has not ""Lost"" his touch. Super Eight was advertised in an extremely risky fashion – neither the movie poster nor the movie trailer divulge anything substantial about the film itself – indicating that Abrams and executive producer, Steven Spielberg, had faith that the movie would stand for itself. In short: their gamble paid off.Super Eight reminds viewers what's missing from most of the big budget, CGI-laden Hollywood movies of today – emotion. Due to a poignant combination of phenomenal acting and impeccable scripting, the on screen emotions seem organic and genuine – transforming the seemingly implausible sci-fi film into a believable, emotional roller coaster for the viewers.Abrams' admiration for his mentor/coworker, Steven Spielberg is palpable in the movies' nostalgic atmosphere. The story takes place in 1979, long before cell phones and YouTube gave every kid the opportunity to make ""movies."" It also happens to be the period in which Spielberg captured the imagination of moviegoers around the world with the impassioned films that made his career legendary: Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E.T. The Extra Terrestrial. Despite the clear links between Super Eight and Spielberg's' movies Super 8 never feels old, stale, or recycled in any way.Although the movie may not satisfy the disgusting CGI-thirst of the younger (okay, fine, my) generation, the movie brings back the emotional, enjoyable elements of older movies. Absent are the effects of the surrealistic, 21st century, Avatar sci-fi movies, and the repulsive influence of the Apatow generation. Super Eight is a movie that reminds viewers, especially older viewers, of the power of film. This film brings viewers back twenty or thirty years to a time when filmmaking was about much more than nukes and nudity.",,Anonymous,Mystery
A good movie with some stupid scenes,"after I watched this movie I was really amazed of it I mean this movie is awesome . but there were some stupid scenes that will never happens in real life that annoyed me like1- when the black guy got hit by a train and he survived I said ""WHAT"" I mean even superman himself can't survive such a hit2-when the alien abducted that old police man in the beginning of the movie then later at the end of the movie the kids founded him alive after about at least 4 days since he got kidnapped3- when the kids decided to go back to the city and fight both of the army and that alien monster at the same time then free all the hostages of the alien and escape later . my opinion is THEY ARE ONLY 13 YEARS OLD HOW THE HELL THEY WILL DO ALL OF THAT 13 YEARS OLD KIDS ARE NOT THAT BRAVE AT ALL I KNOW THAT THIS IS A SCI-FI MOVIE BUT THAT PART OF THE STORY WAS REALLY SUPER STUPID4- when the alien catches the little boy and was about to eat him the little boy said something stupid to the alien I think he said you can live or you can do it or something like that and then because of what he said the monster released him . my opinion is if the monster can't speak English he will not be able to understand English to let the boy go and probably will eat him",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Too much JJ, not enough Steven","Super 8 is partly about growing up and partly about aliens. J.J. Abrams directed it, and Steven Spielberg produced. I expected a sentimental but exciting coming of age tale, derived somewhat from E.T. and from movies like Stand by Me. Then I remembered that J.J. Abrams was involved.The year is 1979. A group of kids, making their own movie using a Super 8 camera, are present when a freight train crashes in their town. But the train's carrying some odd-behaving cargo, and soon the kids are swept up in an alphabet soup of conspiracy, mystery, death, unhealed emotional wounds, and love. You can see Spielberg's fingerprints on the sweet stuff, but the heavy lifting falls, unfortunately, to Abrams, who here gives us an unofficial follow-up to his last over-hyped ball of fire, Cloverfield.You see, Super 8 is really two movies. One is sort of your standard something-is-amiss-in-a-small-town-and-the-military-is-hushing-it-up plot. The other is a more subtle, gentle look at growing and departing relationships, of loves past and present. And that's sort of where the problem lies for me; although the two genres can mesh well, here one part works very well and the other is a pile of predictability.The protagonist is young Joe (Joel Courtney), best friends with Charles (Riley Griffiths). Joe's mom was killed in an accident at the local plant, an event that has had quite the effect on Joe and his relationship with his dad, the town's deputy. As you might guess, Joe's dad has grown distant with the loss of his wife, which he blames on the town drunk, leaving poor Joe sort of rudderless. That's one of the reasons he pals around with Charles and the rest of his friends, to escape.The boys are making a movie with Charles as the director, and they ask one of their classmates, Alice (Elle Fanning) to play the female lead. Charles secretly likes Alice, but it becomes clear she has an eye for modest, unassuming Joe, who does makeup and lighting. At any rate, while they are filming near an old train station, a speeding train passes them by, then derails. After the kids emerge from the wreckage relatively unscathed, they recover their film.Of course, the train wasn't carrying ordinary cargo, as the film soon proves. But what is it? This is where the influence of Cloverfield kicks in. Abrams tries hard not to show us the creature in its entirety until near the end of the movie, but that didn't make it any scarier. The shots of the alien were amateurish, sometimes ridiculously staged as if straight out of a particularly poor B movie from 1953. I know the innocence of youth was a recurring theme, but I expected to be jumping a lot more than I was. In fact, here's an example of just shoddy filmmaking: there would be this intense, suspense-inducing music playing while the camera focused on one character, then sudden silence. And then, wouldn't you know it, an attack out of nowhere. No sir, didn't see that coming! So the exciting action scenes lacked a lot, like panache, creativity, chills, and even logic. Here's another example. During the trainwreck scene, the kids flee as debris rains all around them. Not just pieces of wood but rather entire cars, huge chunks of metal, and so on. They're never hit. All this stuff flying around, and they may as well have been in the perpetual center of a giant tornado. Sure, you have to suspend your disbelief, but there were a few howler scenes in this movie that really sort of forced you to metaphorically unhinge your jaw in order to properly suspend said disbelief.The real upside to the movie, though, is the group of kids: they're a terrific, convincing lot. Luckily, we don't get stereotypical kids, like The Fat One or The Brain or The Slob, etc. Each isn't terribly defined, but they're not meant to be, and they're still memorable in their own way. They exist less as window dressing and more as a running color commentary on their various relationships.Fanning is terrific as Alice. I almost didn't recognize her; at this age, she looks like a young Martha Plimpton, and if Ms. Fanning ever reads this, I mean that as praise. In a few scenes, she's playing a girl playing an actress, and she nails it. I have to believe it's not easy pretending to be something you're not anyway, so pretending to pretend just doubles the difficulty.Spielberg's touch is evident in the way the kids relate to each other and to adults; there are no cardboard caricatures, just honest characters. We see the wonderment and guileless glee that most of us had in grade school. We see kids being kids, in awe and curious but not terrified of the world around them.Spielberg's contribution works; Abrams' doesn't. If you liked Cloverfield and its poorly edited action scenes, this will be your bag. The bad guys are obvious, the impetus for the creature's existence is clear, and it's all telegraphed well ahead of time. They must have spent a fortune in CGI, mucking up what might have been a tender growing-up story set against an alien-invasion backdrop.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Abrams does Spielberg. With the help of Spielberg,"OK. So im gonna let you all know right now. This is easily in my top 10 movies of all time. A group that includes The Shawshank redemption and The Dark Knight, Pretty good company huh? JJ. Abrams, whom until Start Trek in 09' had slipped under my radar, has created a movie with the look and feel of all the 80's Spielberg classics, without losing his own voice as the director. People that complain about the slow decline in movie magic this past decade with trash like TRON:LEGACY,BLACK SWAN & THE SAW SERIES will rejoice in the news that this is as awe inspiring, scary, heart warming and adrenaline fuelled as all your favourites, some it even out does. The sheer class of the production is incredible, the way the director has made you feel every bit as involved in the aspiring love interest betweem the two young main characters and the importance of unravelling the mystery surrounding the strange occurrences in the small town in Ohio, is a triumph in every respect of the word. The characters, of which there are a lot, all have their own back stories and character arcs, are made as human in this film as any in the past. The cast in this movie is incredible, especially Elle Fanning, good luck keeping your eyes off her in every single frame she is in! Super 8 is the reason the clichéd ""you'll laugh, you'll cry"" slogan was created to help decribe the emotions you will feel on this ""hell of a ride"".

A Powerhouse Movie That Doesn't Avoid Tenderness,"Though this film rings of Spielberg in action - fantasy mixed with the magic of kids' imagination and camaraderie - SUPER 8 is a very entertaining film. It is a movie within a movie - a nice twist on reality versus illusion - and the writer/director JJ Abrams has the keen idea of show the intended movie made by the kids at the end of the film during the credits. it works very well.The story involves Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney) and a group of youngsters getting together to make a super 8 film of their own writing and acting and production and films: Riley Griffiths (as writer/director Charles), Ryan Lee as the zombie obsessed Cary, Gabriel Basso as Martin, Zach Mills as Preston, and Elle Fanning as Alice Dainerd. As the youngsters struggle with their film we learn of town troubles - such as Joe's dad, policeman Jackson Lamb (Kyle Chandler) and his concern with the town troublemaker Louis Dainerd (Ron Eldard) who is Alice's Dad - until everything changes as while on location at the train stop the youngster's film a bizarre train crash with a truck driven by a wise but somewhat scary science teacher. It becomes evident that there is more to the incident than meets the eye and as the youngsters realize that there is present among them a creature form space the speed of events wallops to a wild climax. In the end the Youngsters are the ones who relate to the possibilities of fantasy being real and the story ends with an uplifting sense of understanding.Placed in the year 1979 in Ohio the film manages to capture the flavor of the times and the fears of the people (could all this be a Soviet attack?!) to a tee. Joel Courtney is outstanding in his role and the supporting cast is excellent.Grady Harp",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

When the train crashes the scenes are superb, this really makes you tense, hoping that the kids survive.Spilberg is a master of making the best films.BRILLIANT FILM!!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Enjoyable throwback to the Spielbergian films of the 70's and 80's,"Cor blimey! Spielberg's in box must be filling up incredibly with spunk stained love letters of late. This offering from J. J. Abrams (also produced by the bearded Jew of populist cinema), is a homage to the early, great movies such as Close Encounters of the Third Kind ( 1977), Jaws (1975), and particularly E. T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982). Whilst I would usually go into a tirade about the references to Spielberg, I just am unable to do it with this often charming film. It displays the best elements of these earlier, very iconic offerings.Super 8 focuses on a bunch of kids who are making their very own zombie film. The film is set in 1979 (proper Spielbergian suburban environment), hence the use of super 8 film instead of the later video. One late night the gang go out at midnight to film a scene. On this night a train is hit by a car and they capture this on film after the camera is knocked down in the action of fleeing. What they later discover, is that the film captured something non-human climbing from the wreckage. The Air Force come into town after this occurrence, and so begins a series of strange events: People and dogs disappearing; electrical and motorised goods also disappearing. I am going to point out one thing that bugged me (and it happened at the start it kinda stayed with me). At the crash site, one of the kids, Joe (Joel Courtney), picks up an unidentified object, that Charles (Riley Griffiths) comments on as resembling a Rubik's cube. Pedantic alert!!! Whilst the Rubik's cube was invented in 1974, it was not patented in the US of A until 1980!The child performances are actually rather good too. Particularly Elle Fanning, who plays Alice, and brings the film a much needed emotional edge. She is second to Joe, who before the film begins lost his mother in a milling accident. Alice's father is the local drunk and trouble maker.I was expecting not to like this film so much, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. It has all of it's military and authoritative nuances that are lifted directly from the 1970's aesthetic of Spielberg, it also has his knack for basic, yet interesting familial surroundings. I was thinking that it was a stylistic decision to not show the alien/monster so much, but on seeing it, I think it was a case of, like the monster in Cloverfield (2008), it's just a bit s**t.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Missing the point...,"Despite the startling number of negative reviews, the movie was one of the best I have seen in a long time. Yes, the basic story has been done before and yes you have to pay attention to catch the subtle lines and follow the story, but that by no means makes it a bad movie. The effects were amazing, the story included a layer of depth that was truly intriguing, the acting was PHENOMENAL, the music was perfect, and, most of all, I didn't feel like I was constantly being preached a lesson on morality as these movies typically do. Yes, it's there, but it's not right in your face weighing you down constantly.Bottom line: Excellent CGI Extremely Convincing Acting Flawless music Decent though somewhat cliché story Well worth the $10",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Entertaining despite all the plot flaws.,"The child actors in this film are fantastic, especially Riley Griffiths as the 'director' Charles Kaznyk. It is essentially two stories in one: the kids making a film for a contest and trying to find production value; and the quest by the military to capture an escaped alien. Although brilliantly done, there are a number of flaws. The train crash sequence is absolutely brilliant, but it seems too incredible that no one got hurt during all this. Also, despite all the chaos and explosions, the camera is still found exactly where they left it. And with containers and debris raining all over, their car is still left intact - not a scratch! This is simply not believable. And then they simply drive off - the tires would surely be punctured by all that debris.I found the ending also too much of an E.T-ish happy ending. The creature in 'Super 8' is a destructive killing machine, yet at the end the sentiment is ""ahh, he just wants to go home"". Uhm, not believable. It would have been great to see a climatic battle at the end with the military killing the monster. The ending is not suited for this film. Nevertheless, it is still an enjoyable, action packed, thrilling adventure.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
So much potential......,"When JJ Abrams makes films, I either like them or don't like them. There doesn't seem to be a happy medium. A bit like with his recent attempt at a Star Trek movie, which I didn't like.Now when you add Spielberg as well, I seem to have a similar reaction to his movies as well. Either he makes a masterpiece (I.E. Indiana Jones, ET, The Goonies, Hook) or he makes a movie that leaves you feeling that the hours spent watching that film could have been spent doing something more productive.Unfortunately, this movie hits the latter of the two. Now if we didn't have previous movies to go by, this would probably be a decent movie. But like what has been mentioned in previous comments, we've seen these kind of movie plots and characters many times before and in some cases done a lot better as well.This is all down to personal opinion at the end of the day so if you haven't seen this movie, then please go and watch it and make up your own mind.As I stated in my title, this movie had a lot of potential to be the new Goonies & ET movie of this century. Unfortunately it took all the elements of those movies, gave you the impression (in trailers) that it was going to be like Cloverfield, only to slap you in the face and give you something that doesn't even do either Director's names any justice at all.Both Abrams and Spielberg can make outstanding movies. The ones they have made will be a part of many peoples lives for many years to come. Even with the new generation of kids, who I'm which will be sure to see the classics like ET, Goonies, Indiana Jones.Like one reviewer said, if you want to see any movie that brings back that magic, then go watch them again. Nothing will ever beat the originals in my opinion.At the moment in the movie industry, all we seem to get is Reboots, Prequals, Sequels to a movie that hasn't been done in over 10 years (IE Rocky, Die Hard etc), Origin movies and comic books to movies. Countless times we see this kind of thing being done and only about 1-2 out of 10 seem to bring anything new and original.I will admit I have seen a lot worse out there and I did manage to get through the entire movie without turning away. However the 1/10 is the rating against Spielberg/Abrams best work in comparison....",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Super 8: Elle Fanning, America's Sweetheart","The delightful movie ""Super 8"" takes place during the summer of 1979 in the fictional suburban town of Lilian, Ohio, centering around a group of engaging eighth graders fascinated with writing and directing a bare-bones ""zombie"" movie. Armed with little more than a single Super 8 camera, a single spot light with props and costumes ""borrowed"" from their parents' closets our intrepid group of young thespians soldier on. Stay seated at the end of the movie because for what provides us with a charming sense of closure, we are treated to a viewing of the actual completed short ""zombie"" movie as the credits roll.""Super 8,"" directed by JJ Abrams and produced by Steven Spielberg, is seen through the eyes of our young protagonist, Joe (Joel Courtney) and opens with the (unseen) accidental death of his mother. The only significant adult role is that of Joe's emotionally remote widowed father (Kyle Chandler) too caught up in his own grief and dedication to his job as the town's Deputy Sheriff to even think about his new role as a single parent.Joe is a quiet, rather normal thirteen year old boy, whose hobby is assembling and painting model trains. It is his knowledge of painting his trains makes him the natural choice one to take on the role as the ""make-up"" artist. The object of Joe's affection is the lovely Alice (Elle Fanning,) a beautiful young girl who begrudgingly accepts Joe's invitation to play the female lead role in the boys' ""bare-bones"" production, but clearly enjoys the attention of playing the leading lady, as she slowly, yet inevitably, grows to return Joe's adolescent affection. Alice is also the only child of an emotionally distant single dad played by Ron Eldard (who coincidentally lost his mother in a crash when he was a child,) In one of the of the movies most charming moments Joe delicately applies make-up to Alice's enticingly beautiful, yet totally innocent, face. She is also the only significant female role in the entire movie. In addition to Alice, we meet Charlie (Riley Griffiths) who is the director and driving force behind the making of this distinctly amateurish ""zombie"" movie, that he hopes to enter in a local film competition. Rounding out their gang is the perpetually frightened ""leading man"" Martin (Gabriel Basso), the endearingly adorable cinematographer/pyromaniac, Cary (Ryan Lee) who carries a backpack full of homemade firecrackers as well as a mouth full of braces, and Preston (Zach Mills) who is basically just hanging out with his buddies.What makes ""Super 8"" unmistakably Spielbergian, is that at the heart of an engrossing adventure film about a violent train crash, and the havoc, fear and panic created by the existence of an unseen alien monster hidden on the derailed train, is a very charming, poignant story of friendship, loyalty and young love,I thoroughly enjoyed this film, but although JJ Abrams is listed as the sole director, when was the last time you saw a movie poster that included the producers name in the same size font as the directors? Interestingly enough, in the opening credits, both JJ Abrams ""Bad Robot"" logo appears right after Steven Spielberg's ""Amblin"" production logo. Any fan of televisions hit shows ""Felicity,"" ""Alias,"" ""Lost"" or ""Fringe"" can tell you that the ""Bad Robot"" logo is a childlike sketched red robot head, hiding in black weeds in the light of a huge gray moon. Amblin's logo needs less description, it is a simple black and white sketch of ET and Eliot flying across an enormous white moon. Hmmmmmm.It's certainly no insult to Mr. Abrams that ""Super 8"" seems like a finely tuned jigsaw puzzle of Mr. Spielberg's most enduring films including ""E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial,"" ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark,"" ""Close Encounters Of The Third Kind,"" ""Jaws,"" and ""Jurassic Park"" (whose logo is a sketch of the head of a huge red dinosaur in the shadow of an enormous white moon.) We can only hope that JJ carries on in the master's groundbreaking footsteps.Parenthetically, I find it interesting that Spielberg is credited as the Executive Producer of this summers' enormously successful, yet entirely soulless, box office smash, ""Transformers: Dark Of The Moon."" Not only had the greatest director of our lifetime been the Executive Producer of all three ""Transformers"" movies, which get discernibly worse with every sequel, but he has just added the same title to the completely inconsequential tribute to Sylvester Stallone ""Real Steel."" Between Spielberg's Executive Producing choices and Tom Hanks' bloated, absurdly unfunny, instantly forgettable ""Larry Crowne,"" I'm truly starting to get worried about these two extraordinary talents. With extraordinary talent, comes extraordinary responsibility to your audience. Come on guys...we've grown to expect far more from both of you.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Not Really Super,"I really try to like this movie because it was directed by JJ Abrams and I like his movies and all the stuff he produces, but this time I still can't help but feel barely disappointed.Synopsis: Unexplained events occurred in the small town after the train crash incident while a group of friend accidentally tapes the whole occurrence.I was expecting a whole lot more from this. But the story itself was very shallow and is the major letdown though I still think it is a great production. But in my account - the story itself count for more than 50% of greatness in movie, that is why I'm so disappointed.The story become very cliché after a while and by the time you met the reason of all the mystery you will end up feeling disappointed especially if you have seen Cloverfield. But in Cloverfield it was new at that time. This is like a repetition but a kiddo version. Even though it was suppose to be like friends bonding and all; I don't really feel connected with the characters.The casting and acting was in fact brilliant considering they are very young and new to the industry. Especially Elle Fanning, she was awesome. The rest of the cast also did the good job, but with the limited screen time they are the one we don't care.The set look great and have this mystifying experience. The mood and tone is very well delivered and cleverly shot with absolutely great lighting.Overall, the movie is still very much entertaining but wasn't living up to the expectation. I still think this will be really enjoyed by kids of age 7-15, or grownup that already have kids.Recommendation: Still - Yes, Have Low Expectation And You Might Enjoy It.Rating: 6/10 (Grade: C+)",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Super Hype,"After being inundated with favorable reviews and comparison to E.T. and some of Spielberg's early work, I thought I was going to see a great movie.This movie is mediocre.

Feels like Goonies, meets E.T and with a brief Close Encounter.This is a good movie, but you leave the theater feeling that you didn't get the full story.

"I hate to sound mixed about a film I did enjoy, but I do feel there are two stories, meant to be separated, going on here","I must confess that despite my affection for some of J.J. Abrams' other films, I was not all that eager and looking forward to ""Super 8."" Chiefly, because I had intensely disliked his last monster-on-the-loose picture, ""Cloverfield."" My hopes were heightened when I learned of Steven Spielberg's involvement in this new picture, and when I learned of the premise, and most of all, when I learned that it was going to be filmed in traditional movie-making format, not the ""found footage"" mockumentary techniques in which Mr. Abrams' first monster movie was made. But uneven as it is, and although it contains an action scene more idiotic than almost anything in Michael Bay's ""Transformers"" movies, ""Super 8"" is a perfectly enjoyable movie, although I do feel that the credit for that goes more to its producer than its director.Like 1982's ""Poltergeist,"" another Spielberg film directed by somebody else, ""Super 8"" has the fingerprints of its producer stamped all over it. Clearly, it has J.J. Abrams' directing style, but the soul and spirit of this movie is that of vintage Steven Spielberg movies such as ""E.T."" and, more particularly, ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind."" It's almost surprising that Mr. Spielberg didn't make this movie in the 1970s, since it really is a tribute to two things that he embellished in as a kid: science-fiction spectacles and making movies on Super 8 film.For those who do no remember, Super 8 film was the precursor to the home-video camera. Footage was shot on actual film, which had to be taken to a developer and processed, and then run through a projector in order to be seen. Here's the premise. It is the 1970s and some junior high kids are putting together a home-made movie for a film contest. In it we've got the ambitious young director who wants to be the next George A. Romero, the do-goodie best friend, the pyromaniac (who provides their special effects), and the pretty upperclasswoman whom two of the boys are vying over. Following a train wreck - which I will discuss in great detail later - a series of mysterious killings are taking place around their home town as they make their movie. The government steps in, family drama escalates into mayhem, and to add on top of that, there is a giant animal running loose in the countryside.In ""Jaws,"" we didn't see even so much as the shark's dorsal fin until the first hour was up; I didn't clock it, but it seemed that three-quarters of ""Super 8"" was gone by before we catch a glimpse of this new critter, whose identity I will keep secret. The technique, though a little overdone with a few too many attack sequences that essentially just replay one another, is efficiently-done and builds up the suspense quite nicely. But I have to be honest, the creature subplot is the least-interesting element of the movie.What really commanded my attention was the drama, particularly because of these fleshed-out characters. The children are amazingly well-played by fresh young talents such as Elle Fanning, Joel Courtney, and Riley Griffith. The movie captures the spirit of youth, particularly the preteen first-feelings of affection that all of us can too plainly remember, even if we don't want to admit to them. Subplots dealing with the parents, and their back stories, are also well-handled. So as I was watching ""Super 8,"" I kept wondering to myself 'Why couldn't the story be more about these people than that thing smashing in the hoods of cars?' They are so interesting, recalling the warm feelings of Mr. Spielberg's ""E.T."" The creature is an interesting creation in and of itself, but I do wish that it could have been saved for another movie. As someone who delved into making movies as a child (I would always throw fits whenever my VHS camcorder ran out of tape), the scenes with the kids making their movie were extremely captivating. It's something any aspiring or accomplished filmmaker can relate to.The film, uneven as it is, is worth seeing. The only really dreadful thing in it is the train wreck that I mentioned above. It is early on, and had me fretting that I was in for a Michael Bay movie. A train is driving along, when a pickup truck crosses the tracks. The two collide and the train, which must have been made of nitro-glycerin, goes up in flames. Entire cars start raining from the sky without end, so much that the entire set must have contained at least fifty cars and the explosion got to each and every one of them. On and on it goes, with cars pummeling into the ground without end, and yet the children, who are standing right next to the tracks at the moment of impact, are not harmed, and the driver of the pickup is only a little worse off.Enough on that, though. ""Super 8"" is a most charming movie that uses nostalgia to its hilt. But again, comparing and contrasting my interest in the characters versus my interest in the creature running amok between scenes, I kept on wondering what sort of film this really wanted to be. Was Mr. Abrams more interested in making a monster movie? Or was Mr. Spielberg more interested in making another inner-child film? Or was it vice versa? Who wanted to do what? I hate to sound mixed about a film that I did enjoy, but I do feel there are two separate stories going on here. And one is more interesting than the other.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A very good sci/fi thriller that fans of Cloverfield will love.  Could have been a little shorter and been better though. I say B+,"""Do not speak of this or else you and your parents will die."" When a group of kids set out to film a scene for a movie they want to submit to a contest they witness a train crash. When the man that caused it gives them a warning and people start disappearing they begin to investigate further. This is a difficult movie to review. Much like ""Cloverfield"" the preview gives nothing away, and I don't want to ruin anything or give too much away. I will say though that you can really tell that this is a JJ Abrams movie, and Spielberg's ideas are all over this as well. I would have to say that this is a pretty good mix of ""Cloverfield"" and ""Stand By Me"" with a steadier camera and more tense. The biggest problem with this movie to me is that it was too slow in some parts. Trying to put too much in the movie it takes a lot of repetition and long drawn out exposition scenes which hurt the flow of the movie to me. If they simplified it just a little or had more faith in the viewer it would have been much better then it was. On the other hand this was much much better then I was expecting. Overall, a tense and entertaining thriller that is definitely worth a watch. It was just a few tweaks from being a classic. I give it a B+.Would I watch again? - I don't think I will.*Also try - Cloverfield & Skyline",,Anonymous,Mystery
"""Super 8"" is just ""8"", or in this case 7","Not since ""Where the Wild Things Are"" have I left a movie scratching my head saying, ""What's wrong with me?"". I have read what ""Super 8"" was supposed to be and the description and hype didn't quite match up with what was ultimately brought to the screen. Other comments have included anachronisms of bicycles, backpacks, automobiles, etc. Hey, one nice touch I did recognize was the retro logo/sign of Seven-Eleven. The turning point/payoff between the protagonist and the antagonist came really late in the film and came rather out of the blue without much preparation in the plot development. And the ending - voilà! - and it's done in a literal manner of seconds. I think the film relied heavily on Stand By Me and Alien, products of the 70's, neither of which, if I'm not mistaken, were Spielberg films. It did, however, include large doses of 1941 and War of the Worlds - neither of which were Spielberg classics.

Something of everything,"moviestoenjoy.wordpress.comSuper 8 feels like a déjà vu from its beginning to its end. That's probably caused by the fact that the movie has something of everything. It's a thriller, a drama, a horror movie, a Sci-Fi one. As said, it has something of everything.Super 8 tells the story of a group of kids, who, while trying to make a movie, witness a train crash. From this moment on, everything in that little town starts to change, people start disappearing, and some secret military base is created. You can easily identify every character's personality; you have the depressed cop who lost his wife (Kyle Chandler), the drunken dad (Ron Eldard), the two teens who fall in forbidden love (Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning), the heartless military general who cares only about getting the job done (Noah Emmerich) and many other usual characters.J.J. Adam's direction was really good, with the production of Spielberg and other good producers. The film is well crafted, the blood, the explosions, the everything.The kids performance was excellent, out acting every single adult in the movie. But, Elle Fanning stole every scene she was in, delivering us a brilliant and pretty surprising performance. The acting in general was satisfying, the supporting cast did a good job.As a fan of Sci-Fi films, I enjoyed this one. It's not one of the best I've seen, but it's good enough to be watched.

My new favourite movie,"I loved this movie so much that I created an IMDb account just so I could write a review. This movie is full of great action and effects, mystery and intrigue, but what makes it so much better than many recent movies with similar themes is that it is full of heart, and characters that you really care about. The entire thing is laced with emotion that, at several points, you can really feel in your heart, and this is helped along by the beautiful soundtrack.Elle Fanning's performance makes me think that she is set for an Oscar one day (she's less annoying than her sister, let's put it that way), and although child actors are often extremely annoying, this certainly wasn't the case in this movie.What I found especially enjoyable about this movie was all of the allusions and references to some of Spielberg's greatest early work (Close Encounters, ET). Of course, he was the producer, but this is not a lazy copy. Although you can predict some of the main plot points, there is not a moment of this film that is boring, with each individual scene throwing up a surprise, stunning action, snappy dialogue, or emotion.I think this is a movie that most people will like.

Super 8 - Elements of greatness,"I really wanted to like Super 8, I really did. I wasn't following it's production avidly, however, I have been impressed by J.J. Abrams previous works and seeing that he has proved himself to be able to do a monster movie very well (Cloverfield) I felt he would conquer this ""unknown creature"" tale as well.During the first half of the movie I was kept interested. There is a definite nostalgic feel to the film with its setting and its young gang of characters - highly reminiscent of ""The Goonies"" as many people have already pointed out. Albeit the over the top CGI fest of an accident scene that you are more likely to laugh at than suspend your disbelief over, the first half was suspenseful and you really felt like the foundations of something epic were being laid.Yes this is a cliché ridden movie, however, Abrams technique of keeping the creature hidden but uncomfortably close that he did so well in ""Cloverfield"" builds great suspense.During the second half of the film everything changes. The cliché hill is now a mountain, the plot holes are now caverns, the suspense is hard to find. It almost feels like it was too rushed and culminated in an unsatisfying unoriginal ending.I think the main problem with Super 8 is that it tried to do far too many things and thus could not do a single one of them greatly. If you are a fan of monster movies or alien movies - then this movie is not for you, do not waste your money. The unknown creatures origin is still unknown, many details glossed over and the creature design uninspired. Many claim that this movie wasn't about the monster, but for many of us it certainly was marketed in that way.The coming of age story presented to us has been done before. I understand Abrams was making a homage to Spielberg but it was too much, there was nothing that you cannot see coming and the only child actor that is believable is Elle Fanning.Thus Super 8 fails on both accounts of trying to be a creature feature or a coming of age story. This isn't a bad movie, it is just not a good one. The calibre of people behind this project hinted at something greater but it ended up being an ordinary movie. I wouldn't suggest watching this in the cinema, save your money and watch it on TV when it's available.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Like ET + Close Encounters + Alien all in one,"It's worth seeing on the big screen, but I have to admit I expected a bit more from JJ and Stevie Boy. Nice period touches that give you the look and feel of 1979. Couple that with the teenage cast and you have something that will attract older and younger audiences (that is, making more money for JJ and Stevie). The plot would have been just as effective in any other time period; I just saw the temporal placement as a worn-out way to maximize the age range of the audience.I just had one little ""nit-pick"" that only a ham radio operator would notice. In the movie was shown an old (circa 1960) Heathkit Seneca that was being used to intercept the shortwave transmissions from the ""gub-mint"" guys. The problem is that the Seneca was a transmitter only, not a receiver. A similar mistake was made in the movie ""Frequency"" where the main character was using a Heath SB-301 to talk across time to his father. Guess what? The SB-301 is a receiver, not a transmitter. I know; I have one in my basement.At least ham radio got a favorable moment in the movie when the older man stepped forward at the town meeting.The movie overall is well worth seeing, but don't expect to be blown away by the plot.

"Interesting, to say the least.","After a while of movies, witnessing Aliens, Predators, E.T, and a well made assortment of creature ideas to be brought along, I have to say, I thoroughly enjoyed this. A movie granted, that it may terrify ones child, but it can also inspire them, but the movie appeals to all ages. A crafty execution, for a movie worth seeing is how one could put this into a category. Feeling up for adventure, mystery, and trying to solve out what just might be there lurking in the dark, view this movie. It gives a different perspective on how one will put themselves into an Alien's situation, and find the time to get to know these relatable characters. All in all, even the acting met par, and what could be expected, the children were outstanding.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Not Original, but satisfying!","J.J. Abrams' ""Super 8"" is a film that revolves around a group of children who enjoy filming home-made movies. During one of their scenes, a train crashes in the background and the children are thrown into a mystery that comes crashing along with the freighter. The central themes in this story are friendship and letting go.In my opinion, the cast of this film (Joel Courtney, Riley Griffiths, Zach Mills, Gabriel Basso, Ryan Lee, and Elle Fanning) couldn't have done a better job. A buzz word that keeps coming to mind when I think of this little gang is chemistry. The chemistry the children have on screen makes the entire plot, no matter how implausible, feel believable. I really had an enjoyable time watching the group interact with each other and there was never a dull moment among the friends. You see the typical bickering and name calling we all were apart of as children, but beyond that you see a lot of great emotion from these characters that feels completely authentic.Now, the number one knock on this film that I've heard so far is that it is too much like Spielberg's old films. This is a true statement and you probably will get a ""Goonies"" style vibe, but don't let that take away from this movie at all. If this movie would have came out years ago, we'd be calling it an instant classic, and not because of its effects. I feel like this film gets harshly critiqued because it's not completely original. In my opinion, that was the whole point of the entire process of making ""Super 8"". Abrams wanted to pay homage to one of his all-time favorite directors, and I can't personally pan this movie because of that fact. Because of the lack of originality we can't rank it above the old greats it's paying tribute to, but is that what makes a film enjoyable? Just because it's not original doesn't mean we should disregard it entirely. This is a great movie for children, if you don't mind a few curse words here and there, and adults alike. For children, I think this movie is a great way to bring some of the old film style of Spielberg to their eyes, without having to revert back to movies like ""ET"", that can be considered outdated visually.All in all this is a fun, exciting film that had me interested and on the edge of my seat the entire ride. If originality is a huge factor for you, I wouldn't recommend this film but if you're just out to see a good flick that stars some pretty talented kids, this is for you. If I had to pick one knock on this film, it's that it could have held its own without the need for the sci-fi element but that doesn't take very much away from it at all.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
JJ Abrams + Steven Spielberg = ROCKS..!!!,"Super 8 is a JJ Abram's ambitious project. how is it so..? well for start this film was so AMAZING..!!! for the first time since E.T (1982)we all finally see an Alien with ""Human Heart"" ,movie again in this film. the storyline plot is so to the point but very effectively entertaining and make the audience feel curious and can't wait what happen next. as a producer in this film, we all could see the ""Spielberg's element"" in this movie such as: the very big orchestra music, a brief shot with clear explanation and not to mention, the feel frightened but exciting experience like in many Spielberg's movie.JJ Abrams itself was so brilliant. he use his disaster maker talent in this movie amazingly.. just like his previous work in Armageddon (1998) and Cloverfield (2008), in this movie we can see all the crazy explosive and accident + the disaster which pictured perfect by him very perfectly.the cast itself are all amazing especially Dakota's sister, Elle Fanning. she lived up the Fanning sister legacy's by acting brilliantly in this movie. and don't forget the main cast/ main protagonist in this film, Joe Lamb which played perfectly by a newcomer, Joel Courtney.. overall, i give this film 10/10, 5/5 by that i'm very recommended this movie to all of u the movie fans especially, for those of u who loves the sci-fi film..",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Like it for its nostalgia, cuteness, or possible aliens","Building a film out of nostalgia is exactly what ""Super 8"" is. Nostalgia for the Steven Spielberg films from the '80s, jokes about the '70s, and the pure joy that Spielberg and Abrams would have had for filmmaking as young boys. A movie about movie making. It might also be about aliens.We start by getting to know our six young protagonists and the love they have for making a movie. As Charles always says, ""Production value is key."" In the real world, I can't imagine production value is a concern anymore for Abrams. The budget for this movie is $50 million and it shows with trains crashing, over and over again, and cars flying through the air, over and over again. From there we go to the main Hollywood story which involves a teenage love story, strange occurrences in the town with dogs missing, and a mysterious Government cover-up. Hint: It might involve aliens.I liked ""Super 8"" because I like nostalgia. The jokes about the '70s were quite funny (I could be wrong, it might not be aliens, but the Russians!). Kids making a low-budget zombie movie is funny, especially when all six of them can actually act. If you ignore the whole Government conspiracy angle, then everything was quite cute, even the possible aliens.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Lives Up To Classic Spielberg Hype,"Marketed as reminiscent of ""old Spielberg"", Super 8 does not disappoint. Our Nashville audience even went as far as to give applause during the credits. Was it as good as ""E.T.""? It was better. Was it as good as ""Back to the Future""? No. Set your expectations right in between the two, except that the screenplay most assuredly includes contemporary advancements in profanity, puking, and other ""modernizations"". Moreover, if you're not partial to ear shattering volume and startling sequences that make you jump (a little) you might want to wait for the DVD. For those of you wanting Citizen Kane, Thelma and Louise, Iron Man 2, Borat, Anger Management, The Piano, The 10 Commandments, New Jack City, or Father of the Bride, stay home. I would give this movie a 10 as a date for mature couples, a 10 for pre-teens, a 7 for teens, a 6 for young singles, and a 9 for young couples.

"Ponderous man, Ponderous","If you want to be bored out of your minds, if you want to watch a bunch of kid actors with all the skill and aplomb of a fifth grade rendition of Macbeth i suggest you find that fifth grade rendition of Macbeth rather then watch this colossal waste of time.Its suppose to be a homage to Steven Spielberg but it succeeds only in making us appreciate Steven all the more. It has none of Stevens movie sense and seems to have been directed by a bunch of high school film geeks.You continue watching it only to see just how bad it can get, its like watching somebody in a hole just keep digging, when you think it can't get anymore ridiculous it does.There is a reason why the list of movies centered around a pack of twelve years old is slim, its because 12 years olds can't act, and if they can they certainly have no emotional gravitas, so its almost impossible for them to hold a movie together, after a while like all kids they get very annoying-and the thought of 12 year olds being so brave is nonsense . After a while the audience begins to secretly hope that the Creature eats the kids. But we never get that satisfaction -the creature only seems to eat a bunch of old fat white guys.After not too long you lose all interest in everything happening -its so silly and uninteresting, it makes you hate it in a special way-its the kind of movie you wouldn't watch again if somebody paid you.I suggest you slap ""close encounters of the third kind,"" in the DVD player, if you want to see some real entertainment.But this movie may have a good use as an insomnia aide-if you need such a thing.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A great piece of nostalgia that reminds viewers where modern sci-fi came from,"Super 8 takes us back to a style of film making that has been long forgotten. Things like camera flare, charming child characters, camera glare, and certain types of camera tricks have been done away with in the modern film making era. This movie goes back to the fundamental style of film making in the 1970s and 80s that inspired J.J. Abrams to become a film maker. Abrams claimed that this film was heavily inspired by the Spielberg sci-fi movies he grew up on and to ensure that this style is felt Spielberg himself produces the movie. The other thing about this movie that has peaked the interest of film goers is the secrecy and mystery surrounding the film. Abrams has always had a habit of keeping his projects under wraps because he wants the audience to be surprised whenever they see the film. This film has held a lot of promise for a lot of different people due to the talent on the project and the the exciting mystery surrounding Super 8. Can Super 8 meet these expectations or will the film fall flat and deliver an unmemorable; unoriginal experience for audiences?Check out the rest of my review on my film blog http://mastersfilmreview.wordpress.com/2011/06/13/super-8-review/",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Even during scary parts their antics had the audience and myself in stitches! Really reminded me of the Goonies with a sci-fi edge to it. Not to mention that for most kids who were between 12-15 in the 80's the whole thing felt authentic, I think most of us had the same toys and into the same thing as these kids. I was expecting a fun sci-fi film but they gave it a bit of a trip down memory lane, playing with our parents Super 8 camera making goofy movies.

"The overall product is wonderfully nostalgic, while successfully being its own work of art.","J.J. Abrams has released his first complete brain-child, something completely his own. Well, sort of. For a long time he's had the idea and the characters for a movie about a group of kids making movies in the early 70′s. This was not enough to bring people into the theaters, or to hold a serious plot. So, this second idea of a monster movie, which Abrams also has had in his pocket for a while, was thrown into the melting pot, and Super 8 was born. The combination of the two ideas is actually pretty obvious while watching the movie. It's almost one half characters, one half monsters. But the synchronization and blending of the two was done well enough not to detract from the actual movie.Something about the story and production of the movie that has gotten a lot of attention from critics is the comparison and similarity of this movie to classic Steven Spielberg movies like E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Firstly, the people are right. The camera work and angles, the similar story idea about a kid and an alien, and other aspects really are very similar to said movies. But the last time I checked, those were incredible movies, and this follows suite. It is like a band covering another, and doing it well enough to be called their own. That's the best analogy I can make. Secondly, while very similar in some areas, it sets itself apart with it's new-age effects, and I think the characters are immensely deeper than those of movies past.If there is one thing that made this movie as good as it was, it was the cast, the group of kids specifically. Most of them had not seen much work, so finding such a great combination of people is awesome to see. These kids were incredible. They bring thoughts of The Goonies, a pack of friends that are just an absolute joy to watch go through some crazy adventures. These kids' on-screen presence was palpable, begging to be called perfect. Joel Courtney, the new-coming lead role, was great. You can feel both his pain and his compassion throughout. His cast of movie- making buddies, with Riley Griffiths playing the control freak director, Ryan Lee playing the wacky pyromaniac and Gabriel Basso playing the quirky actor, are virtually a non-fictional group of friends making movies together. Last, but definitely not least, we have the enchanting Elle Fanning, who from her first time being on-screen in this movie, completely blew me out of the water. She is an older kid brought into the gang's movie to play the leading actress, and even her in-movie acting is insane. Since her role in Somewhere, which I thought she killed, she seems so much more mature and grown up. She is so lovely and adorable, much more-so than her sister, who is nothing to scoff at herself, I can only wait patiently to see what her extremely young career can blossom into. Kyle Chandler also turns in a very solid role as Courtney's absent, mourning father.As far as the actual monster goes, there are some holes that can be punched in it's story-line, but as a whole it does its job to thrill, and even scare us and put us on the edge of our seats. There is more I'd like to say, but that is flirty with spoiler territory, so I won't get into it. There is also the ending of the movie, which I thought left questions unanswered, and maybe wanting a little bit more, but won't take too much shine from the whole thing.One specific scene I was very excited for was the train crashing scene. Abrams and Spielberg both said in an interview that they loved the idea of doing their own trail derailing scene in a movie someday, and it really shows in the early part of this movie. The crash scene itself is spectacular, awe-inspiring. The other effects are great as well, with a typical Abrams monster, that you get to see a lot more of than Cloverfield.As a side note, I was really hoping that the soundtrack would match the potential of the visuals of the movie, but I think it was a little disappointing. Probably the only forgettable thing about the entire movie, which is a great thing to say.Be sure to stay for the credits!My RatingSuper 8 is almost a tribute to movies of its own in-story time, with a near perfect cast and characters, and delicious looking special effects. While the meshing of two ideas, characters and a monster, struggles at points, and the ending is slightly disappointing, the overall product is wonderfully nostalgic, while successfully being its own work of art.Find all of my reviews at robpg.wordpress.com",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

This film proves you don't need plastic surgery to feel young again.,"If you haven't seen it yet, don't be fooled by the trailers or TV spots. It's not about the 'thing'. That's why 'Super 8' let me down in the well established subplot. The mystery that had the most hype around it was let down by an ending that was rushed and didn't match the superb, first three quarters. Then again, though this subplot of the story was the most focused on, that didn't matter, cause there were so many other things to love about this throwback to old Spielberg.The characters were well developed throughout the entire film. Joel Courtney, who plays the protagonist Joe, had never acted before. And look at the performance he put up! The real star however is Elle Fanning, who plays Alice. She does tremendously within the diversity of the film. The other children and Kyle Chandler, who plays Joe's father Jackson, were all fantastic too. The contribution of these actors who are not so high profile was a highlight of this movie.Aside from the monster and blowing up of crap, what I adored was adventure, something that every kid wanted back when there wasn't Call of Duty. The story of the protagonists provokes great memories that we all had. Also, there is a human element that is delivered through Joe and Jackson's point of view. Which I wouldn't want to spoil.Finally, don't let the ending get you down. Super 8 does in fact lives up to its anticipated monster mayhem. The attacks were extremely frightening, especially the intense bus scene. We cannot forget the stunning, unforgettable train crash that is by far the greatest action sequence this year.Overall, this film started off like a masterpiece, but you should have particular expectations in order to enjoy it for all it has.Be prepared for a scary, funny, touching, action-packed movie that will make you feel young all over again.

Shows Why We Love Movies,"This film will remind you why we love movies--it is entertaining from start to finish. It's suspenseful, scary, funny, and even heart-warming. The child actors are unbelievably good, particularly the star-crossed youngsters at the center of the group of friends making the Super 8 movie. Be sure to stay for the final credits so that you can see their movie at the end of the film. The sense of place and time achieved by the filmmakers is awesome--supposed to be Ohio; looked like southwestern Pennsylvania's old industrial areas to me; credits identified the locations as West Virginia--so yeah, right ballpark in the Old Rustbelt of the country. I also liked the fact that there were no ""big stars"" at the helm of this movie, though I know Kyle Chandler is a TV favorite--the casting added to the impact as the film was an ensemble effort, not, for example, a Tom Cruise vehicle. Also interesting was the use of African American actors in key supporting roles as both heroes (the science teacher) and villains (the military men). I was also pleased with the way information about the characters and their interrelationships wasn't spelled out for the viewer, but unfolded gradually over the course of the film. I'm not a fan of special effects and all the previews shown with this ""action film"" are not things I would see, but in this film, as in ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes,"" I'm a believer. In both cases, there is a genuine story at the heart, not just things blowing up. But when they do explode or catch fire or whatever, they're great!See ""Super 8"" on the big screen as it is meant to be seen.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The similarities go deeper... with a gruff but decent sheriff, single parent, and an industrial military complex baddie to muddy the waters.So, the easy thing to say here, is that if you're a fan of ""Stranger Things,"" (especially the first season), you'll like this movie.

Super 80s Spielberg homage (sorry...),"Really captured the feeling of those early Spielberg family films - the constantly moving camera, soundtrack, setting, bunch of kids and subject matter were all spot on. Moreover, the story was told in a confident, self-assured way, which felt comfortable and nostalgic, yet still fresh - and not at all 'wannabe', which could have been a danger. Even the CGI was good.There were one or two problems: the teenage daughter was way too hyper and unbelievable - in fact that whole family was too big and a tad underdeveloped - and some of the 'friendship' aspects of the storyline could have played out a little more (one of them in particular).But those are relatively minor gripes, and the general feeling of the piece won me over.

Are we being drugged, something added to our drinking water that is dumbing the population to the point of enjoying mediocrity? Seems to me that all you need is nice special effects and explosions to impress the public. I cant wait to see a one and a half hour movie about fireworks, it would be a best seller",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great movie,Great movie and a recommended watch.Realize this is a sci fi flick and life issues from a kid's perspective. Don't expect a hardcore adult sci fi trying to say something about life like Surrogates or Minority Report. That's where the negative reviews come from. It's not the film's fault it's the viewers expecting something different than what the film was meant to be.As for people comparing this to ET or Goonies.....I don't know what they are smoking. It isn't like either of those fun kid's flicks. Super 8 is much more serious and darker by far. Yes it is about a group of kids and you can see Spielberg's camera touch but that is where the similarity ends. It's a great show but a lot different. Watch this with only the expectation of seeing some kids trying to deal with some serious life issues and coming upon an unexpected event in the midst of it. The special effects are great and the mystery critter actually appears in about the last 1/3 of the show which is a substantial amount despite some reviewer's claims otherwise(apparently they can't count).,9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Stand by me mixed with some SF elements...,"I liked this movie, even it offers nothing not much new and all of it's parts can be found in former movies (Stand by me, ET or soft alien monster movies)It has a charm. The child actors, especially the two main characters are acting fine, and the movie making scenes are fun, this part clearly brings the Stand by me feeling. (Don't miss the end of the movie, there is some surprise there.)Unfortunately the story is slim, the supporting characters are cliché (mean USAF officer who finally gets his punishment, strict but warm hearted father(s), mysterious professor etc), but the CGI parts are done well.If you want to see a true sci-fi, or an exciting thriller (as IMDb classification indicates) than this is not for You, but if you liked Stand by me, or you like movies where child actors get the spotlight (mixed with some good CGI effects), than you should not miss this.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Horrible movie,"I'm really frustrated hearing how much people loved this movie, even people who are supposed to know movies. I heard a local critic say it was the best movie of the summer to date which left me baffled. I got absolutely nothing from it. It was like every other monster/alien movie had sex and this was the retarded baby that was born as a result. It starts out intriguing but then jumps the shark probably 30 minutes in. From there it just keeps getting worse and worse and is capped off with one of, if not the worst movie endings I have ever seen. Abrams was on The Dailey Show and basically admitted that they threw this piece of crap together from beginning (story development) to end in less than a year which explains a lot.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An adventurous sci-fi flick featuring young stars in the making,"On the whole, Super 8 is a fun, exciting experience for anyone from nerds to jocks, teens to adults (note the certificate) and film gurus to bored families. I thought the plot, while somewhat generic when compared to similar films, was sound, had its moments and was adequate in terms of the balance between action and drama. The CGI, too, was good to the point that it was convincing, and I thought the acting, especially by the younger members of the cast, stood out among films in this genre as being very good. Joel Courtney is impressive as the troubled Joe Lamb, Elle Fanning is excellent as the equally troubled Alice Dainard, and the rest of the child cast contribute to the humour and drama shared within the group of kids with their quirky personalities and funny one-liners. Generally a great family film (watch out for one use of the 'f' word) that will be enjoyed by all who watch it. So I give a relatively -super 8/10 for Super 8.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

charmingly entertaining,"The assessment of whether any film is good or bad is very simple for me: I just apply my golden rule 'did it carry me out of my own reality.' Not for me the analytical approach: was the story line sufficient?. the directoral approach effective? the action scenes technically efficient? the acting superlative? I have no need of such ego-driven parameters that cause me to trip and stumble out of the imagined world into which I have willingly walked.When I pay my time (and money) to watch a film I simply want to be transported into a 'believable virtual world' of someone else's imagination. I simply want to be 'entertained', which is the real definition of the exercise in which I am involved.This film performed this task admirably. It was thoroughly entertaining. If it had any spots or pimples they were in places of it's anatomy that I did not trouble to look. I was too busy being entertained and enjoying it and there were no aspects of it's menu that gave me mental or emotional indigestion at any point in my consumption.Charmingly entertaining!",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"A Nice, old fashioned movie","I was pleasantly surprised with ""Super 8."" Mainly because it is not a remake, or sequel, and even if it is on familiar turf, approaches its subject in an old fashioned and humorous way.Flick follows some teenage kids who are attempting too make a movie with their ""super 8"" camera in the 70's, only too witness a train crash and get a climse off the mysterious creature that was on-board. Trying too keep quiet about this thing, soon strange stuff starts happening around the whole town, so they get caught up in events even further.Though there is action and special effects, the film is more mysterious and likes keeping things hidden in the dark, working better as a drama. What goes on between the characters in normal everyday life is focused on just as much as the weird stuff that's happening, making it a movie that works on many levels, and it was nice too see a reasonably different alien movie looked at through the eyes off the kids over the adults for a change. Something I can't really think off having been done successfully in years.The ""Aliens"" motives are questionable. One minute its killing people, the next it's tying them up, then later just looking at them, then letting them go. Still, a nice film, that'll have you sitting back down during the credits, and not too wait for some teaser at the end, but too see another short but hilarious movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
J.J. Abrams does it again!,"As you might expect, J. J. Abrams has churned out another exhilarating experience with solid entertainment. Imagine, if you will, a combination of The Goonies + Cloverfield and you will get Super 8, the story of a young boy and his friends that witness a creature escaping a crashed military train while filming with a super 8 camera. As I heard an audience member say after the screening, J. J. Abrams put his fingerprint on this movie, then smeared it all over. The mysterious creature is only glimpsed a handful of times during the first half of the film, and the story will keep you constantly guessing and engaged. With the aid of some fantastic special effects, Super 8 will no doubt be one of the most exciting films of this summer, additionally offering a nostalgic reminder of the times of Spielberg's E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. So the bottom line is: Super 8 is good, and if you're watching it as a J. J. Abrams fan, you're in for a real treat.But the film is not without its flaws. Within this young cast you can sense a lot of rising stars but that's just it. They're still ""rising"". It is a common problem to have some amateur acting with kids. The story is not entirely original either. However, these are only minor complaints against the movie. The main issue with Super 8 is that it can't decide what it wants to be. Is it a coming-of-age drama? Is it an alien action film? Is it horror mystery? Alien and horror and mystery genres can mix quite nicely, but unfortunately coming-of-age not so much. One aspect of the film focuses on the adventure of kids in a rural town while another focuses on a violently rampaging alien. The result is a schizophrenic jumble of genres that has you shifting uncomfortably in your seat at the idea of kids watching certain scenes. For this reason, I STRONGLY caution adults taking their kids to see this movie. Super 8 had more blood, cursing, and blatant drug references than any movie I have seen in a while. IT's a bit like walking into Kick-ass expecting a child's movie. In my honest opinion Super 8 should have been rated R, but Abrams was careful when pushing the limits of PG-13 rules. Indeed, this movie was a wonderful throwback to the days of E.T., but perhaps should only be viewed by those who watched E.T. when it came out. Don't forget that the Abrams touch is violent, as well as mysterious! 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Scary, humorous, poignant and full of heart.","From J.J. Abrams, the man who brought us the labyrinth TV show ""Lost"" and the superbly revamped Star Trek, comes the sort of adventure that Spielberg would've made in his early days. It's not surprising then that the legendary filmmaker was a producer on Super 8 as well as someone who Abrams admits was a massive influence not only on this film, but his whole career. Following a group of teenaged mates in small town America in '79 who are trying to make a DIY zombie flick but become embroiled in a military operation gone astray, Super 8 is scary, humorous, affecting, adrenaline-pumping and poignant, whilst boasting an absolute bucket-load of heart. Abrams' meticulously selected youthful cast are pitch-perfect too, all of them balancing naivety and strength with measured care. Do yourself – and your kids – a favour; seek out time to see Super 8 these holidays.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A mix of everything classic,"From online buzz, from friends hammering it in my head, from Super Bowl ads, to theater previews, I've seen the trailer for Super 8 about fifteen times. Short versions, long versions, two to three minute versions, I was sick of it. I said I didn't want to see it and ignored previews of it in theaters. That changed when I read reviews. I heard it was a seventies, eighties homage in a way and Abrams and Spielberg work wonders.If I would've ignored this film and saw it on DVD, as planned, I would've been angry and ashamed of myself. Super 8 officially earns my pick as my favorite film of 2011 at the halfway mark. We are halfway through another year of movies and Super 8 has outdone itself and certainly showed off more than I could've imagined.One of my favorite J.J. Abrams' films is the forgotten Joy Ride. he produced/wrote the film which I found heavily enjoyable and mark it as one of my favorite horror films. He sure knew how to develop the characters and conduct them in a believable fashion rather than having them be cliché protagonists. We got backstory and we got action. Enough to keep my intrigued the whole ride.Super 8 is a film where I'd prefer discussing my feelings about it rather than the plot itself. I'll explain it simplistically so nothing is ruined; a group of tweens in the summer of 1979 are making their own short film on a Super 8 camera. During the filming of a train scene, they witness a horrible and vicious train accident that causes a major derail for the gigantic train and nearly ends the lives of the kids.Now the town is being faced with something beyond anyone's expectations. Dogs disappear and the military's presence disrupts the town's natural flow. I refuse to go further than that. I knew all of that before going into it. Don't let yourself know more than that, if that.As for the film, it's one of the most electrifying and riveting experiences I've had the movies in recent years. Maybe it's because the film's protagonist, young teens like I mentioned, have the same interests as me. Girls and movies. I think the most heart-warming thing about Super 8 is it knows where it came from. It doesn't rely on 3D technology or poorly done CGI to make a film. CGI is used, but in the most effective and proper way since District 9.The film is a main homage to films like Close Encounters, E.T., The Goonies, Gremlins, Jaws, and other science fiction films done by Spielberg himself. It even resembles that of a drive in film you'd catch on a late Saturday in the seventies. It is done like it would be in 1979 minus the computer animation.The kid actors made the film. I loved the male lead Joel Courtney and the female lead Elle Fanning, Dakota Fanning's little sister. Both play the roles with authentic and believable reactions to this extremely massive event taking place. The music only adds to some of the scenes in the film that are still done with dead on tonality and effective camera work, props to J.J. Abrams, again.Super 8's ending can spark criticism. I wasn't a favorite of it, but I really believe it's because both Abrams and Spielberg couldn't think of an effective way to conclude a film like this. I will give it the benefit of the doubt and hope the DVD will receive an alternate ending or two to assure more satisfaction. Regardless, this is an amazing action film that blends a perfect mix of comedy, drama, coming of age, apocalyptic, science-fiction, and numerous other genres to make one indescribable film. It's something that needs to be witnessed on the big screen.Starring: Joel Courtney, Elle Fanning, and Kyle Chandler. Directed by: J.J. Abrams.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Super 8 derails all the infantile movie-making of explosion artists and delivers a nostalgic return to the subtleties of cinema.,"Super 8 derails all the infantile movie-making of explosion artists and delivers a nostalgic return to the subtleties of cinema.In retrospect, it's funny to think that Steven Spielberg was condemned by many of his contemporaries during the '70s and '80s, that movies of such material merit were criticized of stripping Hollywood of its depth and reducing substance to spectacle. We can only laugh at at the thought of what those same detractors would think of filmmakers like Michael Bay. But Spielberg was, and still is, far from a simple manufacturer of parlour tricks; he was a master storyteller, capable of photographing our most closeted fears and intimate imaginations. Produced by Amblin Entertainment and Bad Robot Productions, and distributed by Paramount, J.J Abrams now aims to pay tribute to the man, his method, and its magic.In a run-of-the-mill Spielbergian suburbia in 1979, Joel Courtney is Joe Lamb, a timid kid with an estranged father (Kyle Chandler), a recently deceased mother, and a fat filmmaker for a friend (Riley Griffiths). When they're not at school, Joe and the aforesaid weighty Charles make movies and talk movies. Accompanied by their two buddies and the intimidating companionship of a young belle (Elle Fanning), the adolescent Hollywood aspirants take to the night to shoot their 8mm zombie flick.Super 8's first act is pure pleasure and a joy for the juvenile in all of us especially for those of us who made movies when we were a kid. Pressed for time in the late hours of the night, telling your friends to shut up and stop screwing around because you're running out of film, arguing for twenty minutes about whether to go for a close-up or a medium it's impossible to suppress a smile.Cue all hell breaking loose. A speeding train springs from its tracks in a massive crash and, unbeknownst to the crew, a perverse E.T. frees itself from one of the cars, setting into motion the military occupancy of the small Ohio town. The rest of the runtime centres on many of Super 8's characters coming to grips with unresolved family issues, notably the Spielberg-trademark of fathers and their sons, and a straightforward 'damsel-in-distress' finale.Closer to the third kind beings of Encounters than the central titular alien in the Extra-Terrestrial, the creature in Super 8 is more of a MacGuffin monster. It doesn't play a real role except to act as a catalyst for the maturation of Joe, his friends, and their families. It drives the plot forward like a chauffeur not really there, and you don't really care you just want to get to where you're headed. This excuses the fact that the alien is not nearly as memorable as notable others, although Abrams does well in adhering to the principle of what you don't see is more frightening than what you do see, as blurring and obscure angles prevent you from almost never having a clear view of the monster, making it all the more menacing.From a technical standpoint, Super 8 is a virtuoso comparable with the works of the maestro it models. Whether it's the mechanical madness of a tank crushing the innocence of a child's playground, or the seldom shot of a silhouette against the skyline, the images here compliment, rather than dominate the established world. Frankness forgiven, I've said it once and I'll say it again movies with balls are nothing without heart. The explosive images employed here are powerful because Abrams understands the principle that we don't give two f**** about a propane tank exploding we care about the people that the blast could harm. Of course speaking of our director, what would an Abrams film be without a hundred lens flares, except that this time the visual device is actually relevant, continually reminding you that you're watching a movie and that's what this one's all about.The awe and wonder of Super 8's legendary producer trump the cheap cookie-cutter 'blow it up and they'll keep entertained' strategy. Its monster forges these people by being, rather than interacting. Understand this it's not E.T. or Close Encounters it doesn't quite match the sentimentality of those films. Nor does it wield the same amount of scriptwriting focus – I felt as though J.J. was working to too many things instead of one sole objective – but it undeniably possesses the heart of its producer's predecessors, and similarly challenges its heroes to grow up and yet stay young. It tributes Spielberg, the frustrating fun of amateur film-making, but more than anything, it tributes imagination once again And the power of ideas over imagery.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Stupendous disaster/coming of age/action/horror/thriller/romance/comedy movie,"I love sci-fi. And I think J.J. Abrams is a genius. So this review might not be the most unbiased one I've ever written. If you're expecting objective help here as to whether you should see this movie, look elsewhere because this is just gonna sing its praises.It is awesome.I've never given a film 10/10 before because surely that would indicate that the film is perfect. But watching this has made me reevaluate the scoring system. Is it perfect? No. Did it provide me with two hours of perfect cinema? You're a darn tootin'.Oh, it's so awesome.From the initial scene where a steel worker resets the ""Days since accident"" board, through to the final scene I was hooked.

Horrible, ignorant people will say that the movie is riddled with clichés and the penultimate dénouement is lack lustre, but I say pooh to them. The sheer love and reverence that went into making the film seeps out of the celluloid (whether its Super 8 or high tech digital film) and embraces us with a carefree abandon that makes us want to be children again.

Super 8 (2011),"During the summer of 1979, a group of friends witness a train crash and investigate subsequent unexplained events in their small town.Super 8 follows a group of kids (yes, they ride bikes) who are making a film for a film festival - and yes, it is shot on Super 8 film. One night while working on their film at a train station, a spectacular train wreck happens - this crash is the highlight of the film, it is amazing. After the train wreck things are amiss in the small town that they live in. The Air Force arrives and a cover up begins.There is a story-line in the film that follows the main character Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney) and him dealing with the death of his mother. This eventually ties in with another character and their father. This story line is the one used by Abrams (who wrote this film) for the emotional punch. The story line about the train wreck, Air Force and the strange creature is for the ; I must add is for the superb action.Super 8 is a love letter to Steven Spielberg (who also served as an executive producer on this flick) from J.J. Abrams. It is made with a keen eye to replicate Spielberg's visuals from his early days. The film pays a lot of homage to Spielberg and that is one of this films greatest aspects.I learned a bit about J.J. Abrams as I watched the Blu-rays special features . Super 8 is all about celebrating the past, from its early-80's time period setting to the subject matter that motivates the celebratory heart of the film itself. J.J. Abrams is thanking the Romero's and Spielberg's and Lucas's and Carpenters of the world with a cinematic love letter, a celluloid portrayal of who he was and what their influence did to cause him to become what he is today.I thoroughly enjoyed this entertaining film . The kids that make up the group are all fantastic. Elle Fanning is especially good in the film.

Super 8...  worst movie of this year !!!,"SPOILER ALERT ALL OVER This is a movie I wanted to see. I am regretful. Premise sound good: A bunch of kids, doing a home made movie witness a train wreck which eventually will unfold a mystery. Movie starts well but quickly wears his charm out. Abrams use - and abuse of - all the frights and startles written in the ""scary movie"" book while he tries - in vain - to create some suspense in his own screenplay. Because screenplay is where the big problem lies... There is no background story to explain the main characters interaction, much less their parents. In top of that the creature's story is also severely under developed and we have to settle to some takes showing it trapped in some kid of laboratory taken out of a 50's B movie. We will not know how the thing crashed its ship, how these inept military guys were able to keep it trapped, how Dr. Woodward was able to know the exact route of the train - and don't tell me is telepathic connection. Also how is possible that this derailment takes about two minutes in screen - do these guys know anything about basic physics ? - but most of all: HOW IS POSSIBLE DR WOODWARD SURVIVES A FULL FRONTAL CRASH AGAINST A TRAIN WITH HALF OF HIS TRUCK'S CAB AND JUST MINOR INJURIES ?I also will not say anything about the military showing in the scene just two minutes after the crash happened - great transportation - or about the late appearance of the creature, or the guns firing it selves or about the creature killing everybody but the main character (oh !...telepathy).

This is one awesome movie.,"I love this movie! Since I enjoyed CLOVERFIELD, I know I will enjoy this movie. These kids are shooting a Super-8 movie and they get interrupted by a horrible event that results in chaos and terror. The film pays homage to Steven Spielberg's film like CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF A THIRD KIND, E.T., THE GOONIES (not a film directed by him, but he got involved in it), JURASSIC PARK, and the 2005 remake of WAR OF THE WORLDS. You'll laugh. You'll cry. You'll wonder why (and get some scares along the way). Now let me spend the rest of the review on why I liked it (specifically). I have been reading articles about special effects pioneers. When they were young, great movies with special effects inspired them an they were passionate to make their own special effects films and find out how they were done. They were reading movie-related books and magazines like ""Famous Monsters of Filmland"", ""Cinemagic"", and ""Super-8 Film-Maker"". When one of the characters were working on the film, I was amazed by the equipment the used. They ranged from rinky-dink to clunky. Going back, when the pioneers read that stuff, they began to experiment and master the techniques and try to perfect it. They end up making up their own films based on, or inspired by the films they saw. Why did I point that up? Well, I would like to point out the following recommendations for those who enjoyed this movie. These TV shows: MOVIE MAGIC (1993-1998) MEGA MOVIE MAGIC (1998-2000) CINEMA SECRETS (1999-2002) These DVDs: EQUINOX (1967/70) MONSTER-KID HOME MOVIES (2005) Trust me you would love it. If the movie is released on DVD, well then, watch it and some extras like the commentary.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
JJ Abrams Does It Again,"While I think Abrams is an excellent writer and producer, I believe his real gift is directing. Following up a masterful job on Star Trek, Abrams does it again with a whole different setting and story in Super 8.I've seen some reviews of this movie that call it boring or slow. Well, if all you want is explosions and noise, Abrams isn't that kind of storyteller. This film lets you know its going to be about emotions, relationships and characters from the very opening and it doesn't stop there.I'm also frustrated by some reviews about poor acting. I couldn't disagree more. I thought all of the acting was fantastic. Even some of the characters like the Kaznyks who barely had any lines nailed the emotion right every time. When it comes to the kids, I think they were all wonderfully acted but none better than Elle Fanning. Wow can that kid act. Her scene at the train station in their movie was a good first glimpse of her talent, but the scene where she confessed about her dad and Joe's mom's death was amazing. That's a lot of emotion for a teenager to show.All in all, I felt this was an incredibly well done movie. If you want a Godzilla deal or a Michael Bay explosion-riddled mess, this isn't your movie. But if you like films that focus on characters and a well told story, go see Super 8. This is the kind of masterpiece Hollywood needs more of.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
This Movie Was More Than Super!,"This was a great watch, I saw this in the cinema, imagine it.. watching a movie in the cinema about making a movie for cinema, truly an iconic experience. The cast are great and as far as the story goes they hit the nail right on the head.Spielberg was born to me these type of movies, I've been die hard fan of his since his eighties classics, the man knows how to entertain. This movie will have uou built up in some scenes and laughing at the others, some may not like this but I truly loved it, I thought it was fantastic.Highly recommend!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"If you don't go to the movies often, add this to your list of movies to see!!!","I was able to see Super 8 in Imax yesterday evening. This movie captures all emotions. The actors are well casted and did a great job. Yes there is a train crash, yes there is a monster, but there is so much more to this movie. Fear, humor, sadness, excitement.....It's all there. Of course for those who go who really want to see what came out of the train that night, you will definitely get an in depth look. It's not like in Cloverfield, which I also love, where you have an idea of what the monster looks like and he's in and out of focus.It's funny, it's intense, and it makes you appreciate the value of human life. MUST SEE!!!",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not so perfect 10/10,"This film isn't a 10/10 film then again neither is the Goonies or e.t but I have to give it this score purely because its got so much going on yet it does not confuse it just entertains with ease, I quote Goonies and e.t because this film is very reminiscent of those 80's adventure films however it is scarier but not so much that children would have nightmares. I found the acting very good there's a scene with Elle Fanning at the train station that I thought was amazing plus I like her so much more then her annoying sister(sorry), The new comer Joel Courtney was very good not amazing but could definitely go on to be a successful actor there was a few not so good moments wasn't sold with Fanning's in film father and a few of the friends where a bit amateur but I forgive because they are young and still quite amateur. So props to everyone that made the film I 97% enjoyed it the 3% would of preferred a little more character based film time than some of the pointless but brilliant action.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

An unbalanced mix of Scary/Silly & Deep/Shallow,"There are some great moments near the beginning of this dense script where you feel that Spielberg Magic. Like Drew Barrymore in ""E.T."", Elle Fanning stands out as a young talent. When there is subtly in the storytelling of the coming-of-age dimension of this film, you feel grounded in a solid drama. Natural based humour around goofy teenagers works to start with. But then a way too convoluted conspiracy develops with no chance of making sense. Here is where the large wish list of ideas that Spielberg and Abrams dreamed up begin to dismantle the momentum that we the audience had invested in for the first 45 minutes or so. Gone now is the magic as a poorly written B-movie monster horror flick invades the town.""Strange"" things begin to happen all over town with such over-the-top silliness and randomness that the storytellers make their fatal flaw. You throw so many ""mysterious"" incidents at the audience with such succession that we no longer can keep track of what the clues are supposed to mean and begin to no longer care. Thankfully the mostly solid acting is able to drag you through the nonsensical military invasion going on in the town. We have the troubled father of Fanning's character Alice. At one point he has a deep emotional impact upon the backstory, but then is clumsily written into being involved with defeating the bad guys.There is a Jekyll/Hyde dichotomy to this movie. At one point you feel it could be a better take on an M. Night Shyamalan film take can convincingly bring terror into the domestic environment (like ""Sixth Sense""). Other times, it feels like a too silly to be taken seriously ""Goonies"" type of adventure. Which brings us to the monster that is supposed to be the big scary killer lurking behind the scenes. (Not a spoiler here) It turns out the monster is too fake to be believable. There is ""Jurassic Park"" inspired monster attack that makes up the final act that just does not have the same impact. Abrams' ""Cloverfield"" was much better at creating a chilling dark creature that could make you jump. In that film there is a smaller insect-like alien that lurks in a subway that is genuinely terrifying. Nothing in ""Super 8"" comes close to that level of chills. Which leaves only the thrills, and the train wreck that is a centerpiece of the film does a good job of it. The extended train disaster launches large train cars into the air at frightening speeds with monster sound effects as they crash and explode with summer popcorn movie splendor (especially in Imax).This movie gets a mild thumbs up for all the positive intentions of Abrams' script. He is a disciple of Spielberg, and it is good to see that other filmmakers can recreate the old school magic, as he does here literally by creating 1970's homages to Spielberg movies. This includes overlapping dialogue of hyper teenagers, sweeping crane shots of bicycles through middle class neighbourhoods, a John Williams style score, Vilmos Zsigmond style lensing, and attention to little details in the kids environment. All of this works well, and I applaud Abrams for displaying his knowledge of the Spielbergisms. Unfortunately that also includes the gimmicks that Spielberg adores so much. In the third act, all the characters become chess pieces as they race around to witness and discover some very implausible stuff that helps reveal the big conspiracy. By then however, there are large military trucks taking over the town, and eventually the lamest looking battle scenes that all but remove any subtlety that began so quietly at the beginning. Despite this, we are hauled through a great deal of relationship melodrama that feels like remnants of one of Abrams TV dramas. The second act gets especially bogged down in emotional situations that at that point do little but destroy the momentum of the impending danger of the sometimes forgotten monster on the loose.I give it a slightly favourable 6 out of 10 since there was nothing bad enough in the clunky storytelling that turned it into a Tony Scott-like embarrassment.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great Film,"This movie had me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire film. I kept wondering what was going to happen next. I really connected with the characters. When they were sad, I felt sad. When they were happy, I felt happy. Spielberg took many elements from E.T. and put it into this movie. It has a great moral, funny lines, frightening scenes, and a lot of excitement. I highly recommend this to any comedy, horror, science fiction, and Steven Spielberg fans. It takes place in the late 70's, so a lot of adults from that time can really connect with with the pop culture that took place in that time. Also, teenagers can relate with the kids in the movie, because the kids face similar problems that teenagers deal with. Besides the fact of being chased by a scary alien. This movie is great for ages 12 and up. Please take the time and see this movie. The Abrams and Spielberg team work great. And they did a great job in making this film awesome.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
simply amazing and easy to connect with,"im gonna start out with saying that i don't ever really go see movies twice.....with that being said, i went and saw this 3 times,..thats how good it was. i was very surprised since due to the trailer i though it was going to suck,...im so glad i was wrong.the visual effects are amazing, the acting and directing are superb, and they shot it in a way to where the audience could really connect to the story.the suspense, the action, the stories, the emotion,...it all really hit me hard and i got sooooooooo into it.for me, the kids made the movie. plain and simple. without them, this would have been your typical ""oh hey! lets go do some sci/fi action!"" kind of movie. J.J. Abbrams did a fantastic job of writing for these kids, and they did an even better job of playing it out. the banter that goes back and forth will make you laugh pretty hard, without a doubt, unless your one of those hard core critics that nobody likes.this film is without a doubt, a SOLID 10. i actually want to go see it a 4th time to be honest, the fact that its only a 7.7 is appalling.

Fantastic Story that goes deeper than a Monster Movie,"Absolutely wonderful. This movie goes back to the weeks just before I was born. The TMI scare (the power plant just miles away from where I grew up in PA) is even mentioned on the news in one early scene.While I may not have been alive at the time of the events depicted in the movie, this took me back to that era. I have three older brothers and a sister that would have been the ages of the kids. Watching this made me miss the early 80's and the hope and purity life had in store. Back when movies like The Goonies, Labyrinth, Return of the Jedi, and E.T. were ""the"" movies to see.So thanks to JJ Abrams and all the rest of the folks involved for making a movie like this. The lack of angsty teenagers, gadget obsessed kids, and the expression ""social media,"" made this movie a great escape.Now about the movie itself. The acting in this movie by the child leads was phenomenal. Joel Courtney knocked his performance out of the park. He was the heart and soul of this movie. The story line between him and his father (Kyle Chandler) was fantastic. Their scenes ranged from powerful, to subtle. All moving.Elle Fanning has the potential to be an incredible actress. In fact, she already is. See ""The Nines,"" or ""Phoebe in Wonderland,"" if you want more proof beside ""Super 8."" The other kids were all just as good. They reminded me of kids I knew growing up. It was as if Abrams found a group of friends like mine, in a town like mine, and just happened to catch them in the moment of this huge event.All aspects of this movie are top notch stuff. The editing, fx, sound, score, acting, directing and everything else is excellent.Super 8 is the movie that has taken me on the best overall experience so far this summer. As much as I'm looking forward to Transformers 3, the final Harry Potter, and a few others, I think this one has taken my memory and imagination to a special place.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"A Gem in a Coal Mine, Anyone who does not like this should grow up!","Sorry for being so harsh, but this film should be rated R for mature audiences only. Why? Not for content, but for target marketing. This film is not for lazy bucket-heads (again, sorry for being so harsh) who watch movies like transformers 2 or Final Destination, and think it is cinematic masterpiece. This is a family movie! This (even being a monster movie) contains moments that Destination fans call ""cheesy"". Destination movies do one thing right, what George Meleis designed films to do, take your mind, and inflict it with emotions. A movie's greatness is determined by how much it changes and/or forces emotions. Final Destination does this with fear, but Super 8 does it with way more that Gory shots (there is ONE in the feature) but does it with scenes that are so emotional that it seems to reach out and whack your brain, (Michael's score helps allot with this). These scenes are what make Destination fan's feel it is cheesy. So if you are a Destination fan, DO NOT RATE THIS MOVIE!!! It was not made for you, it was made for human beings. (Again, sorry for being so harsh)Also Spielberg fans are enraged that Steven put his name on this one. People are complaining that it is EXACTLY like his old films, well this is a quote from the good man: ""This isn't a Spielberg movie, this is an Abrams movie, his past films are all not fully his, but this is, he is just unleashing his creativity that happens to be allot like mine"" THAT WAS BY STEVEN Spielberg!!! This is JJ ABRAMS movie, so if you don't want to see a movie that is LIKE a Spielberg Don't WATCH OR RATE THIS MOVIE! IT IS NOT FOR YOU!!! This movie is truly a gem, and in a world full of coal it is an ease on the mind JJ Abrams knew this, and so did Steven, that's why they made it.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
This Super-(8)-GARBAGE gets 8+ rating on IMDb!,"Several other reviewers have aptly said what all I want to say about this pathetic excuse of a movie. The movie is boring, stupid & an utter thrash. Why SS would associate himself with it, we might never know.The story meanders along slowly. The scenes are SUPER clichéd. You just know whats going to happen next. Majority of the film is in dark. Its annoying just like the other one produced by JJ, Cloverfield. The monster is always in the dark & we only get to see its glimpses & when we do its so frickin ugly that that in itself is a huge turn-off.I don't know what people see in such stupid film-making that the rating goes 8+. I hope it will settle around a number that it truly deserves.This isn't homage to Spielberg. Its an insult. SS classics not only had a good story & great direction but the monsters/aliens/dinosaurs were also ""visible"" in broad day light. Shooting in dark with few cut scenes of the ""selling-point"" of your movie is worst kind of film-making.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

It also came with terror scenes which i love to watch. This movie had a incredible story line that i couldn't stop talking about for days. I recommended that everyone should see a fantastic movie like this, i doubt you will be disappointed. In conclusion I say that this is another success by Speilburg and Abrams.

Entertaining if you don't take it too seriously,"If you watch this movie as an independent, stand-alone kind of thing and/or you take it too seriously you probably are not going to like it. But if you approach it with nostalgia for family style movies of the late 70s and early 80s, I think you will like it. It's made in that style, as an homage to those movies certain of us watched and loved as kids. Yes, it intentionally has elements in it from Spielberg films - that is part of the fun, to pick out where you see those moments and remember them fondly. If you love Spielberg films, count this as yet another one that you may not have seen. Is it cheesy? Yes. Does it make perfect sense? No. Just like other movies of that time period. I'm confused that people say it has no plot. It does. Are there holes or unexplained things in it? Sure. Does it seem like they wanted to cram in as many scenes that would remind you of other movies that they could? Absolutely. From a nostalgic point of view, I enjoyed watching this movie. I especially enjoyed the end during the credits, I was hoping we would get to see that part. If you are a fan of Stranger Things, I think you will like this, I kept thinking how this was very similar to that. Just don't take it too seriously. I'm pretty sure you're not meant to. It's a fun romp with purposely over-the-top special effects and 80's style cliched script and characters. I probably will watch again to find references I missed this time.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Pooper 8,"Something strange is happening in a small town after a train derails . What was supposed to be a nostalgic look at the lives of a few middle schoolers in 1979 turns out to be the biggest movie non event of the year. Something is not right in this movie that fails for three reasons. First, it is entirely too much like the old ""Twilight Zone"" and ""Outer Limits"" TV shows. Secondly, the predictability factor manifests itself from the beginning. You know exactly what is going to happen before it even does. You just sit there and viola! It happens. Third is the ""Lets use every cliché from every sci-fi movie ever made"" factor.Self explanatory. The no name cast doesn't have one character you even care about. They look too clean, too polished,and too plastic just like animatronics at a Disney World attraction.And yes, they all have what I like to call the ""Spielberg Look""- you know, that dazed, glazed facial expression that was so prominent in ""ET"". If this turkey bears a resemblance to ""Close Encounters"", ""War of the Worlds"", ""ET"", ""Cloverfield"", and ""The Goonies"", thats the idea. There isn't an original idea anywhere in this mess. Its as if director Abrams was told to make a homage to early Spielberg films by Spielberg himself, and thats exactly what he did. Film does have its moments, but they are few and very far between. Film tries to be nostalgic, but 70s nostalgia? A great decade! Disco, Jimmy Carter, the looming Iran hostage crisis, inflation, oil crisses, unemployment, polyester, etc, etc. Kinda of sounds like today, doesn't it? I can go on and on but, dear reader, I think you get the point. This film has the cheesiest ending since ""Indiana Jones and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"",and the schmaltz in the last two minutes or so seems to have been applied with a trowel.As is, just alright for eight year old kids or undemanding viewers. However, adults who are looking for something with some brains and intelligence should go to another multiplex. However, you gotta admit that Spielberg is pretty smart. He just bought himself a 300 foot long yacht that cost over 200 million dollars.Mediocrity is its own reward,but to call this film mediocre is to praise it to high heaven. This film represents everything that is wrong with today's filmmaking and movies. Save your 11 bucks and the trip to the multiplex. It will be available on DVD before the summers over.Mark my words, you'll see.

Renewed Memories,"Moments are captured and touch our heart. They can be as banal and nostalgic as a human touch or remembering your closed one, but if captured in an emotive manner would reflect accurately with the audience mood and emotions. For such emotions we have our usual critics, who would make a movie look like some rehash trying to cash in on audience nostalgia. But they are wrong this time around. To discard this summer's big movie ticket 'Super 8' as 'E.T on steroids' or some others gag insults is plain ignorance and bias to their own false sense of nostalgia and pride for those eighties memorable Spielberg movies. The movie that takes its audience back in the seventies along with memories of E.T, Close Encounter of the third kind and Goonies surely was lapped up by the young audience of eighties over the past few weeks, but was also appreciated by the new generation.Mr. JJ Abrams latest monster thriller (with a pretty similar looking monster from Cloverfield) takes you back to the seventies small town America, where a recent work place tragedy has unsettled the family equations of a father son duo. The work place tragedy takes the life of Joe Lamb's mother (Joel Courtney), which complicates his relation with his very seventies Hollywood father Jackson Lamb (Kyle Chandler) who is the town deputy sheriff. Joe has a healthy bunch of friends that adds a certain childish charm to the movie.As the summer vacation starts, Joe begins to dedicate his entire summer holidays to help finish a short zombie movie that is being made by his friend Charles. His excitement about the movie grows further with the involvement of Alice (Elle Fanning), though his father is excited neither about him wasting his summer making monster movies or his friendship with Alice.During their first night of shooting with Alice at the local railway station, the zombie movie takes a turn for something very grim and real, as a military train is deliberately derailed by the local school professor. As Joe and his friends run for their lives they live the super 8 cameras and equipment stranded at the destroyed station. As they flee from the scene of tragedy they gather their equipment before the military arrives. Flustered and scared by the whole event they decide to not speak about it to anyone.As the news of the crash spreads Jackson tries to find out what was in the cargo that was derailed, but the military personal do not let any details known to him during his visit. But soon the deputy realizes the town has a much bigger problem than the crash train to deal with, as the town witnesses' sudden disappearance of electrical appliances along with human's vanishing.As the paranoia about the events related to the crash spreads over the town, the deputy takes the matter into his own hand and tries to know more about the crash through intercepting military frequencies. Through the military intercepts Jackson uncovers that the armed forces are planning to begin operation 'Walking Distance' inside their town Lillian. What he does not realize is that the military is ready to go at any extent to keep their motives secret and hence further pays the prize.While the military is busy finding their lost asset before the locals find out, Joe and his friends use the chaotic scenes around the town as production values for their movie. As their movie shoot progresses there is a blooming romance between Joe and Alice that has stern opposition of their respective father, due to the families entangled past related to the death of Joe's mother.While all emotional drama is being played out, the military's biggest secret, the alien monster is on the loose and the military is finding it difficult to trace and capture him. While the alien is nowhere to be seen by anyone, Joe and Charles have the Super 8 camera that has captured the footage from the accident that will uncover the mystery surrounding the train accident. The search and the eventual rescue of the alien by Joe and his friends becomes a joyride that was not witnessed by this generation on the silver screen.Super 8, time after time give a shout out to its inspiration i.e. 'E.T' and 'Close Encounter of the Third Kind', something that will be appreciated by the fans of those movies. But what truly strikes a chord with the audience is the emotional relation Joe has with his Mother which Mr. Abrams successfully binds with the film's final conclusion.The maker uses all the clichés available to spike the emotions around the drama and succeeds to avoid and possible trappings. The music is another high note that is used passionately around the evolving scenes. Super 8 has successfully recreated the magic of the seventies and has given further impetus to Spielberg's brand of movies.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Wish they never stopped making kids movies like this.....,"Funny that Abrams is working with Spielberg.....seeing that i consider JJ to be the next Stephen. But has Abrams ever created an idea on his own? Every single movie he has directed has been from someone else's hand. He has proved that he can direct one hell of a movie, but can he create one out of thin air? Remember those old late 70's early 80's kid movies? Ex: ""Stand By Me"", ""Goonies"" ext. This movie really strikes a cord with those. Not in the adventure sense, well....that too......but the comparison that i'm trying to make is the overall presence of these main characters and the dialog they exchange with each other. The humorous cussing and funny scenarios....it fits right in with those classic films that we all remember. And it made me think.....Why aren't kids movies like this anymore? It was a nice trip down memory lane for any film geek.As far as story lines, the movie is pretty damn solid. It has that certain Spielberg vibe to it with a little JJ spice thrown in. I mean come on, a bunch of kids filming an amateur zombie flick and witness a train crash carrying contents from Area 51.....you couldn't ask for a better summer movie set-up. But i know most people walking into this will think that everything is about discovering this creature......much like ""Stand By Me"" with the body, and the treasure with ""The Goonies"". But if you understand those movies, you will also know that there is a much deeper subtext. With ""Super 8"", it's got a lot more heart. I wouldn't say it has more heart that ""Stand By Me"", but it comes pretty damn close, and that in itself is a big compliment.But what really sells this story are the characters. The kids in this crack me up like you wouldn't believe. And oh my god.....Elle Fanning just made her sister look stupid with her talent.But the transitions between the adults and the kids are great. Each one is entertaining, and there is always something physically going on to keep your attention. From beginning to end, the movie does not stop moving.And next we move onto the alien, which i have been dying to see for over a year now. I won't go into too much detail, but it's really similar to the ""Cloverfield"" monster, just a smaller version. The back story behind this creature is pretty cool, i really wish they could have gone into more detail. They give you enough to wet your hands, but i wanted a full bath. The cool aspect they did with the creature is to the same effect of ""Jaws"". You don't really see the entire thing until all hell breaks loose, which comes somewhere in the third act.I know most nerds like myself will dislike the ending, but i however enjoyed it. It wasn't cheesy or over the top......it fit nice and snug with the rest of the movie.Bottom Line.....i know it will take a couple of days for this movie to fully sink into my brain, because like i said before, once it starts, it doesn't stop. But judging from what i just experienced, they really don't make summer movies like this anymore. It's a nice trip down memory lane with the nostalgia. The characters are all enjoyable. The Sci-Fi aspect is really cool. The action is top notch. Everything a summer movie should be. I just wish every kids movie was like this......because 20 years ago.....it was.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"10 years later, Super 8 still holds up as a film.","Sometime during November 2011, my dad rented Super 8 at the nearest 7-Eleven's Redbox (Blockbuster was no more) and we watched it that night. I will never forget the nostalgia I got when watching the film, and I'll never forget that first viewing.Released in 2011, Super 8 tells the story of a group of friends in 1979 who come together to shoot a homemade monster movie, but tensions rise when a train (carrying Alien cargo) crashes as they're filming a scene for the movie. I'm not going to spoil the rest of the film beyond that, because it's one of those films you just see for yourself.The story is a mix between a science fiction narrative (a darker version of 1982's E. T.) and a drama about coping with loss. It's almost like Lilo and Stitch in that you have a broken family intertwining with an alien race arriving on earth. It's a very consistent and cohesive narrative with a few fun twists and jokes. The characters are lovable at best and ""just there"" at worst. You have Joe Lamb (portrayed by Joel Courtney) and his father Jack, the Deputy of the police department, who are trying to move on after the loss of Elizabeth, Joe's mother/Jack's wife. This subplot works and it develops their characters. You have Alice Dainard (portrayed by Elle Fanning), who is Joe's love interest and his best friend Charles Kaznyk (portrayed by Riley Griffiths) who is making the zombie movie. The other kids are somewhat one dimensional and are just there, but their acting and dialog isn't bad. At best, it's really good and gives life to the characters, particularly Joe, Alice, Charles, Jack, and Glynn Turman's Dr. Thomas Woodward.The editing is decent and special effects are heavy on CGI, not all of which looks realistic, but it's okay. This being a JJ Abrams film, there's too much use of the lens flare (like in Star Trek 2009). That being said, the cinematography is pretty crisp and it compliments the rest of the narrative's tone. It takes ideas and tropes from Steven Spielberg's classic films and breathes new life into them. In fact, Spielberg was a producer on the film, and as a result the film stands there with Gremlins (1984), The Goonies (1985), Close Encounters Of The Third Kind (1977), and ect. The fact that this movie was released five years before Stranger Things (2016) makes it all the more fascinating.In conclusion, it's officially been TEN YEARS since the release of this Super 8, and it still holds up as a science fiction classic.

I wasn't sure what to expect, since from the trailers, it looks like a ""monster-attacking"" movie, but I thought they wouldn't use kids as main characters if it's just like that.So, anyways, after about half an hour, I realized that this is going to be a good movie (or at least the type of movie that I will enjoy). The reason is, first, there is a fair amount of character building, which I think is always a key element of good movie. Second, the performance of these kids are amazing, especially the girl (you will see when you watch it). And also, the music gives this movie a big boost.You will probability say some of the scene doesn't make sense, like, ""I will never do this"", or, ""how can he do that"", that might drag you away for a couple of second from enjoying it. That's why I would rather call this movie a fairy tale (with a lot of modern filming technologies). It actually recalls me when I watched ""Stand by me"" a while ago, it is really just watching these kids doing their adventure and you feel like you are a kid again.I guess I said enough about it, you have to watch it yourself. But if you expect this to be a summer blockbuster with a lot of monsters and explosions, this might not be the right movie for you. I'm just a movie goer, I watch all kinds of movies and I enjoyed this one. I think it's this summer's best one up to now. It would be a good movie for a family to watch too.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Just another CGI treat without a solid story.,"The trailers for this movie initially made me watch it, and I had high expectations to the movie, given the facts that it was Abrams and Spielberg who made the movie. And now that I have seen the movie I am left with a bit of a hollow sensation.Sure the movie was awesome in special effects and CGIs, nothing spared here, and it was an interesting thrill ride to watch. However, the story in itself was a tad too much of something that you have seen before. Think ""The Goonies"", ""E.T."" and ""Battle Los Angeles"", then you pretty much have the end result that is ""Super 8"". I am sure this movie can be watched by people of all ages, but I am left with a nagging sensation that it was perhaps intended for a younger audience.The story is about some kind of alien creature stranded on Earth, being experimented on by the American army, and all he wants to do is just to go home. Gee, haven't we seen this before? Say, in ""Paul"" to mention but a single movie. And of course someone wants to help the creature to go home. And a handful of young movie making teenagers are caught in the midst of the chaotic events, as is the peaceful town of Lilian. This is basically the story.What I didn't like about the movie was that a lot of it was shot during night or in really dark conditions, hiding most of the alien creature in most shots. I don't want to watch a movie like that, I prefer to see the details, not just given dark silhouettes and having to guess my way to the rest. So for me, this overall dark setting of the movie was dragging the enjoyment down quite a lot.The acting in the movie was good, both from the adult actors and actresses, as well as the young ones.I am sad to say that this movie is just yet another movie that lives high on CGI effects, dazzling and thralling us with its effects, such as movies like ""Skyline"" and ""Monsters"". It was lacking depth and a more solid foundation for its storyline. Everything here was just a remake of things seen before in other movies already.However, I am sure that ""Super 8"" will captivate and spellbind a large group of young viewers, in the same way that ""E.T."" did back in the day when I was a young kid. I was just hoping for a bit more...",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The best and worst from those boomer directors,"They can't write kids, and never evolved in how they write kids. Boys are always cartoonish, girls are always grumpy and ridiculously, pointlessly unlikeable. It made me think in the first act - why is that girl even participating in the movie the boys want to make if she's gonna be all grumpy and annoying about it? Oh yeah, because
J. J. Abrams can't write girls, can't really write boys, and never bothered to even attempt to improve in that area.It's a pretty generic It-style movie about teenagers, of course based in the ""old days"" when J. J. Abrams and Spielberg were kids, kind of having an adventure.And it does have its strengths. The kids are GREAT actors, greatly cast, except for the girl, who either sucks as an actor or - what I assume is more likely -
J. J. Abrams sucks as a writer of girls, always doing those two cliches - she's unlikeable and grumpy, and all the boys (or at least the main one) are cartoonishly thirsting over her. This is, like, in every
J. J. Abrams or Spielberg movie. Jeez, learn to evolve a bit.And that whole lack of evolution is what hurts this movie the most. Great child actors aside, it's a bit generic. And longer than it needs to be.However, near the end, things clicked. I liked the ending. I liked the two dads getting closure, I like the kids' characters evolving.It's a movie worth watching. In fact, it's easily one of the best movies in the last decade. It's actually feel-good, has great acting, a bit of comedy, a lot of adventure, and a looooot of sci-fi weirdness.My only gripe is that the ending - which was extremely powerful and wonderful - felt a bit rushed. I would've liked a little prologue, telling the viewer where those characters went after this adventure, but there was none. Just a pretty beautiful, yet barebones ending.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Well Made film that reminds us of CLASSIC Spielberg time period / Our childhood.,"Good movie. Maybe great to the younger generation who do not know of the classic Spielberg I grew up with.Maybe.Maybe J.J. Abrams is REALLY GOOD at paying homage to other ideas/directors/writers. I would be more impressed with his own idea.Maybe he just knows/wants to make money, and instead of pissing people off he get's Spielberg to produce a movie which is a WELL MADE - little bits of -E.T.-JAWS-CLOSE ENCOUNTERS-(with a little touch of M. Knight Shamalan) Also his last movie was Star Trek. Again done very well. Makes me wonder. Well Done.Even with the NEAT TIED UP ENDING it was enjoyable to watch.Brings back memories of my life in the cinema when I was a child. And for that I am grateful.Now J.J. Abrams.

Finally Something Fresh!!!,"The theme of ""aliens"" have been tainted much in modern cinema such as in the abysmal Skyline and the mediocre Battle:LA. Even Steven Spielberg had spoilt his latest Indiana Jones installment with aliens. This theme has reached its overdose and keeps on firing at all of the wrong directions.Thankfully, director J.J. Abrams saved the theme gloriously with this film. With an interesting plot, a fresh band of young (very potential) actors and great special effects, J.J. Abrams have unleashed one of the greatest aliens films easily in this decade.The story is told very similar to 1980s Steven Spielberg alien films (ET & Close Encounters Of The Third Kind) where suspense play a large role to keep the viewers hooked.Therefore, I strongly recommend to give this movie a go and exit the cinema with a brand new feeling that has been missing in the films lately. Also, like Inception, the lesser you know before you watch the movie...the better.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"""Production Value!""","'Super 8' was my first film from 2011, and it was a fantastic place to start the year. The film's teaser trailer enigmatically promised something along the lines of 'Cloverfield (2008)' (which I still haven't seen), but the second trailer was pure Spielbergian nostalgia – not surprising, given the ""Amblin Entertainment"" logo that opens the film. But what really distinguishes 'Super 8' is its love of filmmaking. The story is set in 1979, when director J.J. Abrams was just a kid, and probably running around with his own Super 8 camera. The film's characters are a group of children who spend their free time making a hokey amateur zombie detective thriller, though their equipment still looks more professional than that in my latest filmmaking project. A massive train derailment, a huge military presence in the town, and an ominous entity on the loose, cannot dampen their enthusiasm for completing the film. To each new turn-of-events, the boy directing the film (played by first-timer Riley Griffiths) keeps getting excited and exclaiming ""production value!"", which was funny until I remembered I did the same thing when the annual Festival blocked off my town's main street in 2009. All of the child actors (including Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning) are impressive, given that they're carrying the entire film on their little shoulders. And, of course, be sure to stick around for the final credits.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

If you did not love it then it means that you watch too many movies,"I think that people who failed to appreciate the excellence of Super 8 have wasted too much of their lives watching too many movies such as the Goonies for example, and did not succeed in being born at the optimal time that would facilitate their appreciation of the overwhelmingly beautiful cinematography. I mean I saw this as utterly beautiful and loved the heck out of the touching acting story, the friendship, the level of humor in using some familiar clichés in the behaviors of the characters. I wish I could tell the spoiler but here is a hint - a famous 70s toy that turns into a famous 70s movie flying thing.

Super Great!!,"Super 8. If like me you loved the movies of the 80s, this will be one for you. If not, you will still love it. It's like a cross between The Goonies and Cloverfield. One of the best Sci-fi films released in while. If you are not into sci-fi, I still think you will enjoy it. Set in the summer of '79, in and around the small fictional town of Lillian, Ohio. The films focus is on a group of kids are making a school film. During which something happens that changes everything for them and their town for ever.Now, I have looked at what some on here have said and I can not believe the overall rating is just 7.6! If you want constant sci-fi action, stick to Star Wars. The is a brilliantly written and made film and has no need to rush through it.Fun, dramatic, special effects...This film has one of, if not THE best Special Effect moments in many years. The Train Crash. I was actually sat there, open mouthed going ""wow"" while watching it.Most of the acting in this film is done by young teenagers such Joel Courtney and Riley Griffiths, their first ever big screen roles and were great as they all were. The most known, to me, adult actor was Kyle Chandler who plays Deputy Sheriff Jackson Lamb. He is probably best know for his staring role in the series 'Early Edition'. His acting, as always, was spot on.To end, if I have to suggest a film to watch made in 2011, it will be this one.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Just awful,"All I can do is add to what's already been said: anyone looking for a monster movie should look elsewhere. This Cloverfield isn't, a film that I enjoyed. This is a homage to Spielberg, in particular to his films of the 80s. If you are not a fan of this cinema, you better stay away. This combines films that I watched back in the day (The Goonies, E.T., etc.) but have not seen since given that I don't care at all about them, finding them sticky, formulaic and stereotyped. I never particularly enjoyed films about life seen through the eyes of a kid, which is what a lot of Spielberg's cinema in the 80s was: I'd rather watch his films when he finally decided to address the adult audiences, notwithstanding its many problems. This is not grand or fun cinema as Abrams obviously thinks it is. Once you fail to get hooked you start noticing the startling mistakes and gaps, including the absurd train collision, the monster which you wait all film to see, the inevitable love story, the melodramatic crap about the father and his girlfriend's father, and the annoying kids. At some time I just ff over scenes between the kid and the girl and scenes between the kids so I missed a big chunk of the second half of this tremendously long, insufferable film.

Although clearly inspired and paying homage to movies like the Goonies, ET, and Close Encounters, the themes and production are woven together in a fun, engaging way. All of the actors are enjoyable in their parts, and I loved the very 'Stand By Me' vibe of the kids on a journey. The whole 'kids coming of age, giant mystery, the government is after them' plot, though common enough from other films, is fun and a bit surprising in the twists and turns it takes, particularly when compared to modern films that plot by the numbers. The pacing, the acting, the special effects, and the atmosphere of the film were all top notch. I highly recommend the film to anyone who liked the eighties movies I mentioned.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the few Abrams movies that is great!,"Let me just start by saying I despise Abrams work... most of it anyway, I find him to be unoriginal which for me makes things boring. Especially if you rip off a story that has been done better before in the past.This movie felt genuine(ish). It had some Goonies vibes meets ET meets Invaders from Mars. Overall this felt like it was doing it's own thing. It also had a Speilberg quality to it which is probably another reason I like this movie so much. Abrams directed and wrote it but Speilberg had influence and it comes through.The acting was great all the kids were fantastic. There was enough character development that you feel for the characters. The tension in the movie starts quickly and builds until the end. There is a tiny bit of gore in a scene where there is an alien eating a body part and some people are hanging from the walls (I think most of them were alive). It is a quick scene and not much is visible but it could be disturbing to people like my sensitive 6yr old.This reminds me of the old sci fi movies where the aliens land and the army steps in as the bad guys and chase down the alien (the goodish guy). Would recommend this to anyone.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Just an homage to Spielberg,"Think ET, Stand By Me (or Goonies) and Cloverfield in a bad mash-up. Kids' bikes galore, evil army men, misunderstood monster, saccharin dialog.

I knew I was in trouble when the train wreck went on and on and on after hitting a pickup truck. The only good parts were when the girl was rehearsing her part for the kid's movie; she was excellent. Oh, and I liked the attempt at not using all Hollywood brats, although the kid with braces looked like he had the bumper off a '65 Caddy in his mouth.

Best film of the summer by far.,"""I've seen it... nobody believes me..."" ""I believe you."" If E.T., Cloverfield, and The Goonies had a baby, this would be it. Plot: In 1979, A group of young friends filming a zombie movie for the local film festival witness a horrific train crash near their small town. Afterwards strange things begin happening. People go missing, dogs run away only to be found in the next county, and electronic appliances are stolen. Things get more strange when the military shows up. The friends along with one of the friend's father, a sheriff's deputy begin to realize that that was no ordinary train crash. Director J.J Abrams once again shows that he is one of the best directors in Hollywood. Keep in mind that this the guy who actually got me to like Star Trek. This isn't just a monster movie but a coming-of-age movie as well. It has elements of a drama as well as elements of a classic sci-fi/ monster movie. The main character, Joe Lamb, lost his mother in an industrial accident four months before the events of the film and still hasn't let go. His father, a sheriff's deputy hasn't really let go either. Unlike most movie nowadays, I actually cared about the characters. Each is well developed. Heck, even the monster has more character depth than most of the characters in some of the movies released this year. As for the acting, I thought it was pretty good except for Ron Eldard, who while not bad, just isn't as good as the rest of the actors. I have got to say I was impressed with Elle Fanning. I loved her performance in Sofia Coppola's Somewhere and she does just as good if not better in this. I really do think she has the potential to outshine her older sister. While there are many references to Steven Spielberg's(who produced this movie) earlier films such as E.T. and Jaws, Super 8 is a movie that stands on it's own. I'll be very surprised if this doesn't get nominated for any Oscars. This is without a doubt the best film of the summer and I'll be first in line to by it on Blu-Ray the day it comes out. Until then I'd gladly pay another 10 bucks to go see it again which I have no doubt that I will. Total Score: 9.2/10",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
some boys trying to make afilm,"Super 8, derivative and disappointing at its best, can be summarized using elements from the other sci-fi/thrillers that Spielberg either directed, produced, or exec-produced.Some annoying kids find a map (Goonies) – including a fat kid who likes to eat (Goonies) – and they come up against the military which is trying to track down an alien on the loose (E.T.).The creature has created issues for the townsfolk who express concern at a meeting with the sheriff (Jaws) and they eventually have to evacuate because of a made-up disaster (Close Encounters).The alien, who is a really a spider (Arachnaphobia) that has been collecting items so that he can get home (E.T.), has the ability to make a psychic connection with humans (Close Encounters). One of the kids has a seemingly useless obsession that winds up helping to save the day in a climactic sequence (fireworks here and inventions in the Goonies) however the creature is much too smart to fall for such a trick (Jaws - ""he's either very smart or very stupid""). An old guy, who is an expert on this creature (Jaws) winds up dying while the army shoots through the town and tanks roll (War of the Worlds).Then the characters put the story together in one long expositional scene and we are not really sure how they figured it all out (Minority Report). It seems the monster is really a misunderstood good guy (Goonies) who makes a connection with our hero (ET, Close Encounters) and then flies home (E.T), but not before a lot of missing people are returned (Close Encounters) and lots of appliances fly around (Poltergeist",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Super 8 is superb!!!,"I just watched it this afternoon!It surpassed my expectations which was heightened by the trailer. The trailer made me curious as to whether this was a sci-fi movie or a monster flick. There might be a lot of holes in the storyline but cinematic-ally the script was awesome as it kept me riveted to my seat. J J Abrams is turning into one of the greats of the cinematic medium. The concept/premise of the movie is nothing new but its the treatment that makes it such a delight.We have a bunch of youngsters who are student filmmakers. While shooting a scene from their ""zombie flick"" they witness a train crash(that much you might have garnered from the trailer). The rest i leave it for you to watch as i might give away the storyline...The strength of the movie is the young cast who puts in a superb performance..I loved them especially because most of them are completely unknown and fresh. That made them totally believable. We all know the Fannings can act. This movie has something in it for both teenagers as well as adults. The teen romance, loss of loved one, horrifying disappearances, military cover up...the list goes on. Its a good film to study if you are a budding script writer.

"Expected greatness, and I got it","When I told my mom about Super 8, I mentioned it was probably one of my favorite movies of the past several years. Then, I had her watch it. Her reaction was particularly funny, because she was thinking period drama, and Super 8 may be a period piece (1979) and it may be a drama (if a Science Fiction one), but it was certainly not what she meant...Super 8 was a huge dose of nostalgia for the great movies I grew up with.

Our heroes are a young filmmaker and his friends who are working on a zombie movie.Like all sci-fi films, a suspension of one's disbelief is necessary - the train crash scene, while exciting and done really well, was so unrealistic in cause and effect, that one has to view it through a child's eyes.Super 8 has some action, several scares, impressive special effects, a little bit of pre-teen romance, and some fabulous one-liners.Written and directed by J J Abrams and Produced by Stephen Spielberg, I was expecting greatness, and I was not disappointed.Oh, and if you're wondering, my mom thought the movie was really good, too.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Goonies 2000 (tried but failed),I was not impressed with this film. It seemed to have no idea what it wanted to be. Was it an adult horror film with blood and gore or was it a PG kids adventure film like the Goonies? I still have no clue at times it was kids stuff and at times there was blood and horror. I found the story slow and at times pointless especially the whole sub plot about the hero's mom - seriously what was the point in this it added nothing to the movie at all. If you want a monster horror watch Cloverfield if you want kids adventure with mild peril then the Goonies ... no idea which audience this was pitched at.

Another classic Spielberg/Abrams film,"In a mix of nostalgia, humor, and emotion, Super 8 hits the mark with another classic from J.J. Abrams.

The film is set in 1979, with a group of teenage boys with a ""Goonies"" feel. Joel Courtney, debuting his acting career as a lead character, is definitely inexperienced with acting but manages to channel his awkwardness into a fantastic pre-teenage character.

Very enjoyable.,"There was a lot of anticipation for this film following the success of J.J. Abrams previous monster movie Cloverfield (2008). I really enjoyed Cloverfield and was looking forward to this and fortunately it didn't disappoint.The film is set in 1979 and starts out by introducing a group of kids making a zombie movie. Late at night they go to a train station to film some scenes in time with when a train passes. A few seconds later there is one of the best train crashes ever put to film. A creature escapes and the children realise that there is a cover up going on.Using a cast of young unknown actors works really well for this film. It gives the film a feel similar to Goonies (1985) and Stand By Me (1986). The young actors are great in this, come to think about it everyone is great in this. It is hard to find a stand out performance. I was torn between Elle Fanning as Alice Dainhard and Joel Courtney as Joen Lamb. I decided to go with Joel Courtney as it is his first acting role and acts like a veteran.The effects in this are as you would expect, incredible. It is a CGI heavy film but you hardly notice as the effects blend seamlessly with real life.This has a brilliant cast, amazing effects and a good story. But for some reason I felt something was missing. I feel the story was what let it down. As I said it is a good story but not a great one. It gets a little predictable and cliché. When the film ended I wanted more, not for the film to keep going but more story. There are so many small stories in this that it seems cramped. This is a Sci-Fi/Thriller but there was a lot of drama added into the film and for me it felt too much. I would have loved to see a film with the young actors just focusing on them. They have a great story without the monster and I found myself more interested in their lives and then the monster would arrive on screen and change the pace of the film. During these parts there was nothing that you haven't seen before in monster movies.This is a good film and it is very enjoyable to watch. Keep watching the end credits as you get to see the kids zombie movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Unexplainable events unfold after a train wreck happened at a small town.,"I gave the movie 2 stars to give credit to the OK acting of the characters. Move past that and you get nothing but hype and fluff. You would think that any movie with the name Steven Spielberg attached to it would at the very least return your invested time and money without the profit of having a mind-blowing good time. This one will make you feel like you've been scammed.The trailer looked promising even without it showing a shadow of the creature. That draws you in. But like a cat, your curiosity will kill you. The film is shallow and tries really hard to pump your heart with the hopes of making you jump off your ergonomic cinema chairs.

The 8 must stand for B - SUPERB,"I was really excited about seeing this film as with many movie fans Spielberg is the man.I use IMDb regularly to check whether a film is worth watching and after reading through some of the reviews I started to be put off this film.In some respects I was glad I did this as it only made it better. I don't want to ruin the film for any person who is thinking about watching it. But all I can say is if you love E.T. and the innocence, happiness and excitement that goes with it watch this film.The bad reviews on here motivated me to write a review.

Best action movie with kids I've seen in a long time,"Films with kids tend to fail as they try to cater for the kids and parents market.Some succeed because they are based on serious issues.The majority that fail do so because they apply a safe level of action so as not to frighten off the younger viewer.This film, in the main, does a brilliant job of involving kids as the main characters but having plot that's not too saccharine and includes a few tender moments as well.Yes there are a couple of clichéd moments but by and large this had me rivetted right through to the end.There were a few gentle twists throughout and added to that some very realistic special effects.Don't be put off by the average age of the main characters.Really pleasantly surprised.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Fun, well made genre flick","Ah yes, the ""kids on bikes"" variety of movie, practically a genre unto itself. J. J. Abrams' approach to this feature is obvious, especially with Steven Spielberg lending his assistance as producer. Hearkening to pieces like 'Stand by me,' 'E. T.,' or 'The Goonies,' with plentiful details to establish the late 70s setting, this may be a little more slick in terms of production values, but the intent carries through in the execution. One perhaps wishes that there were more practical effects instead of computer-generated visuals, yet as one would expect with Abrams involved, the digital creations are so well done that they blend very well into the filmed footage. Part and parcel with the youthful characters, there are definite instances of (believably) juvenile dialogue, and overexcited yelling that's a bit off-putting - though on the other hand, it's to the immense credit of the young cast that their skill readily shines through despite the most overcharged moments. Fresh-faced Joel Courtney, then only fifteen, made a very strong debut as protagonist Joe; more impressive still, without a doubt, is Elle Fanning, who has continued time and again to prove her immense, versatile skill in a wide range of roles, and there's no mistaking why this was such a breakout role for her. All such qualities are what first catch our attention about 'Super 8,' and are possibly the chief highlights, but they're hardly alone. This may not be an absolutely essential must-see, but it's very well done, and well worth checking out for anyone with an interest in the genre or in the careers of those involved.The benefits of a bigger budget, and developments in film-making technology, are seen most readily in the effects, but they come across in most other regards, too. The editing and cinematography are extra smart and snappy (sometimes too much so for its own good); Abrams' direction of many scenes blurs the line between honest homage, simple mimicry, and earnest original take on the genre, and I think this is the case with Michael Giacchino's score, too - which is hardly to badmouth such qualities, but there's a certain measure of variation. Despite such marginal unevenness, I don't think there's any arguing that across the board this is wonderfully well done; every stunt, effect, and action sequence is executed with superb finesse. The creature design is outstanding (and the accompanying sound effects); the production design and art direction are terrific, lending considerably to the look and feel of small-town Lillian, and the genre thrills. If to a lesser extent given lesser importance or prominence, much the same could be said of the hair, makeup, and costume design.There are familiar strains in Abrams' screenplay: a group of kids who stumble onto something much bigger and more disturbing; adults who are in turn oblivious, complicit, or less helpful despite their best efforts; conspiracies afoot. Even in light of such factors, by and large I think the writing is a blast. The main weakness I see in it is that some scenes are just entirely too busy for their own good, and when this happens the result feels a little common, and tawdrily over the top. (This is true in the last act especially). I would also note that at some moments, intended to be more heartfelt, these feel a tad too on the nose, becoming slightly maudlin and subsequently artificial. Yet for any faults one might observe, this might well be one of the best things Abrams has done to date. The characters are real and believable, as is the dialogue; though not each and every one is perfect, scenes are sharp and engaging in and of themselves as they build the whole. And as the narrative comes together, substantial consideration was given to slowly and naturally fleshing out the creature, the primary characters and the town they live in, what the creature has been doing and how various parties react to it, and so on. It would be wrong-headed to call this perfect in any regard, but after excellent word of mouth in the past several years, I'm so pleased to watch 'Super 8' for myself and see just how good it really is.While decidedly more violent than those pictures from which it takes inspiration, the storytelling in particular is so steady and well minded that I don't think it's unfair to say that this might well appeal to anyone who enjoys those antecedent works. Whether as writer, director, or producer, Abrams has had more than a few ups and downs in his career, but all told this surely stands as a major high point. It's not necessarily so striking as to utterly demand viewership, but is nonetheless absolutely deserving on its own merits. Recommendable above all for fans of those involved, 'Super 8' is a fun, satisfying sci-fi flick, and well worth anyone's time.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
How to become a bad director,"To say this was a disappointment is an understatement, the story was boring and so was the camera work. It seems to be an ongoing theme with US films in recent years, dumping loads of cash on effects and fancy camera work and somehow that will make up for god awful stories.As others have stated it's basically a rip from The Gonnies which is a far better film. I can say that the acting of the young cast was very good and considering how bad the script it's the only plus part of the whole film.I think we will see the same thing happen to J.J. Abrams as we have seen with M. Night Shyamalan, basically it seems they were lucky with the first few projects they directed and now they are just trying to be clever with pointless stories.Hey you guys! Surely there must be better material out there, your audience isn't as dumb as you might think and we expect better!",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Definitely a Super Film!,"I absolutely loved this film! I don't know if it's because I love all things 80's. How good the chemistry and friendship came across between the 4 main young actors. The creepy and pretty well done alien or the fact that it's essentially a love letter to most Steven Spielberg movies with a bit of Stephen King in there.Also loved the fact they were filming a movie within a movie!It felt like a combo of E. T., Stand By Me, IT and Stranger Things but obviously this was pre Stranger Things. So if you love any of those films / Series, you'll love this!The overall flow of the film was perfect with parts of the mystery being unveiled at just the right time.The only reason I gave it a 9/10 is because I felt the performances from both Ron Eldard and Kyle Chandler was pretty weak but I've never thought Kyle Chandler was very good at acting. Ron Eldard could have toned things down a bit. It felt like he was overacting.Other than that, it's a fantastic family watch maybe for kids 10+ though.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A fine piece of nostalgia,"Minus the computer generated visual effects, and if the credits at the end were lopped off, you might think that Super 8 was made in the late 1970s or early 1980s and was directed by Steven Spielberg. However, while Spielberg is a producer on the film, he did not direct it, that task was handled by J.J. Abrams, but the film plays like a love letter to many of Spielberg's best known works from that era. This isn't a soulless imitation, though, for Super 8 manages to recapture what made those films work well, delivering the audience back to a time, for many of us, of cinematic innocence.Set in 1979 in a small town in Ohio, we are introduced to Joe (Joel Courtney), Charles (Riley Griffiths), Cary (Ryan Lee), Preston (Zach Mills) and Martin (Gabriel Basso), middle school friends working on Charles Super 8 film for entry into a contest. Late one night, driven to a location by Alice (Ellie Fanning), the daughter of a man believed responsible, to an extent, for the recent death of Joe's mother at a nearby factory, the kids manage to capture footage of an immense train crash just outside town. The crash appears to have been instigated by their Biology teacher, Mr. Woodward (Glynn Turman), and the site is quickly overrun by military officials, led by Nelic (Noah Emmerich), who begins a cleanup and encampment in the town that proves worrisome to Joe's father, Jackson (Kyle Chandler), a deputy in the town. When mysterious things begin happening (power flickering, pets disappearing, engines missing out of cars), followed by disappearances of townspeople, Jackson suspects there is more to the situation than the army is revealing.In the midst of these happenings, Charles is trying to finish his movie, but Joe can't help but be pulled into the search for the truth of what is happening as well, while at the same time experiencing a budding young romance taking shape between him and Alice, complicated by their individual fathers not wanting the two kids to intermingle due to the accident at the mill.Super 8 pays homage to so many films that Spielberg either directed, such as E.T.: The Extra Terrestrial and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, or films that he had a hand in producing, including The Goonies, but not just by utilizing plot or character elements. No, Super 8 goes the extra mile, to the point that visual and auditory components feel ripped right from that period of time. Individual shots, especially those of the city below and the stars in the sky, match the feel of similar shots from Close Encounters; the lighting, film stock, all of it just oozes respect for those well loved films of that era. Even Michael Giachinno's score echoes the work of John Williams. Giachinno is an exceptional craftsman who has proved able to meld his work with the styles of other composers, and with Super 8 he has worked his magic once again, capturing the heart of the music in Spielberg's earlier works. None of this has the feel of a crass rip-off; it is all assembled with a deep felt love of those films from that period, and works beautifully.One element that Abrams has also managed to capture is the very ""ordinariness"" of the characters. These are not superheroes, top trained military operatives or mathematical whizzes. They are average, small town boys, girls and adults, and they very much reflect the audience, much as Spielberg did often in that same era. Abrams has also assembled a fine cast, especially the very capable child actors, led by Courtney and Fanning, who have strong chemistry between them from their first scenes together, and it builds into a sweet, innocent romance that is effectively realized throughout the running time. The other boys also feel as if they are good friends, filled with a degree of curiousness and fear at appropriate times. The adult characters aren't ignored, focusing especially on Jackson, a man who is somewhat lost without his wife and not sure how to raise his son on his own, while also juggling the responsibilities of trying to figure out what is going on in the town. Chandler gives a strong performance, showing both the hard and soft of Jackson appropriately.If there is one element that doesn't quite work in Super 8, it is the central mystery of the film, most specifically its payoff. The ""monster"" of Super 8 is well-handled early in the proceedings, Abrams again taking a page from the book of Spielberg, specifically Jaws in this case, taking care to not reveal the central antagonist, keeping it in the shadows for the most part. But as the film builds to its climax, the revelations about the creature, and its eventual full reveal, are somewhat underwhelming, and the degree of emotional resonance with this part of the story is limp, at best.That being said, overall, Super 8 is successful, filling you with a strong sense of nostalgia for an era, and a subset of work by a particular filmmaker, gone by. In a time when directors and writers seem to be constantly trying to cram more and more noise, frenetic action, and jump cut editing into movies, a refreshing look back at when that wasn't the case is welcome, and enjoyed.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Waste of time and money,"I took my 20 year old son for Father's Day. This flick was so awful, in the middle he asked ME if we could leave. I have seen many awful movies, but this was the worst. Stupid, boring, and ear shattering. Too bad they spent so much money making it. The writers used the plots in many scenes which reminded me of those we have all seen over the past 4 decades. Been there-done that. The young people did a good acting job, but the adults seemed to overplay their roles in a stereotypically heartless and robotic style.

Abrams + Spielberg - Spielberg.,"This is a great, very interesting and different film.Original, fresh, valiant, a classic movie concept which grants entertainment for all the family, ironically a concept that was lost in time, at least, 20 years ago. Trust me, this film if full of magic.What I want to say is that this movie has enough mature content for being considered ""just for kids"" and, in the other hand, it has the necessary sense of humor and limits in visual violence in order to satisfy the youngest without boring the adults.The direction is awesome. Everything is well fitted, the camera is always well located, the sense of rhythm is brilliant, but it's in the work with actors, specially with the youngest where Abrams does his best.In my opinion, casting unknown actors has been a triumph. Elle Fanning actually is an incoming superstar, but the other children are totally unknown for the average public, and all of them do an incredible work. It seems that they aren't acting, trust me.The setting in latest 70's USA small town is also a good point. Perfect costume, location and make-up that help you getting into the movie.About the plot... the story is OK, the dialogues are well built, sometimes brilliant and funny, but there are few (always in my opinion) mistakes that didn't satisfy me at all.As I've said before, this is a great film, but it's not, unfortunately, an immortal, masterpiece, all-time classic, and I'll try to explain why: -First of all, I have to say, that if I were 12-14 years old I would give this film a 10 out of 10, but I actually have 31, and my duty is to be, as much as I can, objective.-Abrams's work is unbeatable, I can't say anything else, but there is the Spielberg factor. Spielberg is ""the master"", the director and producer who has never done a bad film, but also an artist with some bad habits that he can't avoid and his touch can be sensed in the entire movie.Then, if you mix Abrams and Spielberg's magical touch, the result is a true masterpiece, but if you add the last one's bad habits, which are clearly shown in the film's last ten minutes and some story's weak points ( I thinks that it's is unnecessary to spoil anything, just watch it and you'll see that those little flaws are clear) the result is a great film, sometimes outstanding, but never perfect.In conclusion, an excellent and fresh film, not perfect just for few details, but always recommendable for the entire family. One of this year's best films, much better than the average level of our days filming. And the most important thing: don't forget it, this movie recovers a style from a time where the cinema was magic.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Engaging, suspsenful, and quite funny- but a bummer final act","Although at times it seems to have a great premise, and a great story throughout, Super 8 loses its full potential by the end credits. The first 2/3 of the film are incredibly entertaining, suspenseful, and quite funny. However, by the films final act, the tone seems to shift, and all together, it just feels flat. The acting throughout the film is pretty solid, with Elle Fanning providing the best performance from the kids and the adults. The cinematography is quite brilliant, and the special effects are truly terrific. I was not a huge fan of how the film ended, but unlike those who despised the film for being an unoriginal homage to Spielberg, I simply didn't think it was very impactful. The last 20 or so minutes of the film felt pretty dull, and I began to lose interest, which kinda bummed me out. Abrams, who directed, produced, and wrote the film, seems to have a problem finding a true end to the work he seeks out to accomplish, and every time he attempts to do, it seems to be one of 2 things- a cliffhanger, or a lousy ending. In the end however, Abram's vision for most of the film is certainly a very entertaining and thrilling ride. It's sci-fi antics and suspense are very entertaining to watch, even if it loses its way from time to time.

So that's how it feels like to be 12 again.,"Brevity is the soul of wit so I'll be brief. Super 8 isn't a very original piece. It feels like composite of Spielberg's early works with liberal serving of 'The Goonies' with a side of 'Cloverfield'. Plot is pretty standard family problems, story told many times before. But what this film does is work. Acting is solid, characters believable, action exciting, jokes funny. This movie made me smile all the way home. J.J.

If you're after that elusive feeling you had when watching 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' that's your best choice.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Excellent Story, although...","I've been a fan of JJ Abrams for a while now, since his Mission Impossible 3 revitalized the franchise from the slow-mo,dove-flying movie made by John Woo in MI:2, and his 2009 rendition of Star Trek.This was his own story, not a sequel nor a reboot... and I have to say that this was a most excellent story with fantastic acting by the top two actors, Joel Courtney (Joe) and Elle Fanning (Alice), both of whom are children; they're well supported by Joe's best friend, Charles (Riley Griffiths) and Cary, Martin and Preston. Adult acting, though supporting, was well done by Kyle Chandler (who playes Joe's Dad) and Ron Eldard (who plays Alice's Dad). Though the critics have said that JJ Abrams takes several pages out of Executive Producer Steven Spielberg's past movies on sci-fi and centering on children, I don't really care. This is a great movie for these times, and he balances things out pretty well. The story has a good solid base, the acting superb, the emotions (be it sorrow, glee, excitement, fear) were truly felt, there were appropriate sprinkles of humor, and the action/special effects scenes were top notch.My only qualm or reservation about this movie is that it left me wondering how the ending could have been better; I mean there are quick cuts of a creature of some kind (er, ET?), but I wish there was more closure there; there were questions unanswered (why was it collecting, what was its objective, etc.-- sorry I don't want to spoil it so I cannot elaborate more). Perhaps there was too much set up that I was anticipating more when the creature was revealed. Maybe another few more minutes to give a proper ending...Anyway, the ending doesn't take away much from the movie (except my rating it a 9 instead of a 10).",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It is so derivative that Spielberg fans should sue for grand theft,"The best thing that can be said about J.J. Abrams Super 8 is that it reminds us of the memorable science fiction films of the 80s that touched our lives. There is nothing in Super 8, however, that even touches those seminal movies. In the immortal words of Yogi Berra, it is ""déjà vu all over again"" but without the same touching and tender story, wit and charm, feeling of magic, beautiful score, or memorable performances. It is obvious right from start that enhanced CGI effects, loud explosions, frightening monsters, fake emotions, and dysfunctional families do not take the place of heart and soul, but, of course, we know that in today's Hollywood schlock factory, heart and soul do not bring in the big bucks.Set in suburbia (where else?) in 1979 (Lillian, Ohio to be exact), young teen Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney) lives with his father (Kyle Chandler), a deputy police officer. Both are trying to overcome the effects of the death of Joe's mother in a recent accident. During the lazy summer, Joe and his friends Charles (Riley Griffiths) Martin (Gabriel Basso), Cary (Ryan Lee), and Preston (Zach Mills) are attempting shoot a short zombie film with Charles' Super 8 camera. The biggest reason Joe agrees to do it, however, is because of his attraction to 14-year-old Alice Dainard (Elle Fanning) who is playing the wife of the film's hero. Though Courtney and Fanning do a more than creditable job, the other teens are mostly one-dimensional stock characters without any authentic interactions. They are terrific at screaming and yelling, however, and saying ""Oh! My God"" with a shocked look plastered on their faces.The film begins to get its focus when a freight train passing through the area where they are filming is derailed by a pick-up truck driving on the same track. The ensuing train crash is the best since ""The Fugitive"" but it is so overblown that it looks like the train was hit by a nuclear missile, rather than a pick-up truck. This is only the start of the mayhem. People and animals disappear including the Lamb's pet dog Lucy, appliances and machine parts are stolen, and a variety of other mysteries abound. Of course, the townsfolk demand answers from the police, but the military that arrives to cordon off the area reveal nothing. Of course, if we trust the military to solve anything, we are on shaky ground to begin with.Speculation is ripe, however, and one of the brightest members of the community is convinced that the Russkies are behind everything. Abrams cleverly withholds what the fuss is all about until three-quarters of the film is over. By that time, most viewers have either had a coronary from the unbearable suspense, their children are running up and down the aisles, unhinged by terror, and the rest of the audience have either gone deaf from the explosions, fallen asleep, or left the theater.Abrams can't make up his mind if he wants the culprit to be cute and cuddly (though with a very big face) or a demolition expert because his feelings were hurt. The ultimate explanation is so ridiculous that if I gave it away, it would cause hysterical laughter. In any case, we know that the kids will turn out to be super brave, super lucky, or the rest of the bunch, super stupid. If you are gutsy enough to make it to the ending, you will think you are in a time warp watching an early Spielberg film. It is so derivative that Spielberg fans should sue for grand theft. Oh, wait - Spielberg is listed as the producer. He ought to sue himself for crimes against humanity.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Enjoy! Great fun!,"It's tough to review a film that is produced by Steven Spielberg, looks exactly like most early Spielberg films looked and yet not be directed by him. I would like to say that this is as much a J. J. Abrams film as Poltergeist was a Tobe Hooper film, who never made another film even close to the quality of that one, but Abrams had his own cred when he made Super 8, so I can only guess this Spielbergian copy is more or less a tribute to Spielberg's style. In any event, this is no masterpiece, but I love an awful lot of this little film. The first 20 minutes or so are awesome and so is the young cast. The rest is lots of fun as well, but it perhaps runs down a little. But, again, the young cast! They are all wonderful, but Joel Courtney, in his film debut no less, and Elle Fanning are simply perfect. Riley Griffiths is also a fun joy in his one and only film role?!

A bit of a disappointing combination,"To put it bluntly, you expect more from a movie when it's being advertised as a major product of JJ Abrams and Steven Spielberg.There were some good one liners in the movie, and I enjoyed the kids, but overall the whole thing was lackluster and I'm still trying to figure out what the climax was supposed to be. Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning along with the other kids in the film were cast well, but their story line alone could have been developed into its own entity (minus the alien).Visually it was pretty good to watch.

While some wanted new stuff I expected a mix of everything which made mainstream cinema amazing in the last decades. It is funny and sad, loud and quiet. It is about family and friendship. About growing up and becoming an adult. The late 70s setting is implemented outstandingly. Characters are great.

I, on the other hand, will label it as 'crap'. It is just another brainless Hollywood production created off a sub-par script that is marketed behind some big names in Abrams and Spielberg.I knew it was heading in a bad direction after watching the way-over-the-top train crash scene. Ugh. If you are someone who doesn't care about movies at least making an attempt at realism, this won't bother you. If you are one whom likes an attempt at realism this whole movie will bother you.Their are MANY themes and sub-plots to this movie, but none of these parallel movie lines are developed enough for the viewer to actually care. The acting is good which makes at least some of the relationships work well, but not enough to overcome the 'lameness' of it all.There is an attempt at some suspense and mystery by not revealing 'the mystery' for a while...and this attempt falls flat on its face. No pay-off whatsoever. None.And then of course there is the ending of the movie. The entire time I was watching the last scene I wanted to continually punch myself in the face for actually paying to see this crap.

"Super, 8 out of 10","Sometimes it's just nice to watch a simple, well made, well acted, well written film.Nothing about Super 8 blew me away, in fact I was actually a little disappointed in the SFX for the train crash given J.J.Abrams stellar work on the Star Trek prequel, however SFX would never make or break a film for me. My one reservation going into the film would have been about the quality of the kids' acting playing the leads given they would capture most of the screen time but I was pleasantly surprised, all of them did really excellent jobs and were very watchable, I can see solid box office careers for some of them.The story was interesting enough and sufficiently well written that there were no points in the film where I had to suspend my disbelief. (although I do have a particularly high tolerance for fantastical story lines). Super 8 is an incredibly well made film that I can see being shown on TV networks regularly in coming decades. Quality entertainment for all ages.Finally, I never judge a film on trailers but generally on the poster as I like to go into the cinema not knowing exactly what is going to happen, I think Super 8 is a film which definitely benefits from not knowing too much about it before seeing it.Thoroughly recommended for all movie watchers.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An action film with emotion.,"When we look at the limited genre of stylized action films, there are few that really take us into another world. Super 8 is a rare breed of action film that engages us on an emotional level along with a visual one. What I really like about it is how personal this is to director Abrams. Abrams is engaging in parody, which he is no stranger to, but this is his finest film yet with a plot that makes sense during the action scenes. He's got nothing on Spielberg(who produced this), but he does manage to succeed in terms of fluid storytelling, American charm, and enthralling visuals.

"Review Of ""Super 8""","""Super 8"" is a 2011 film directed by J.J. Abrams and starring Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning. The film follows the story of a group of kids who witness a train crash in the summer of 1979 and investigate the paranormal events of the that it has on this town. Well to be blatantly and frankly honest - I observed almost no problems in this movie whatsoever. The problems that I did observe are so trivial and insignificant that I'm not even going to waste my energy going over them. When I saw previews for this film, I saw that the prominent characters in it were mostly middle schoolers. Now, movies like this can go either one of two ways for me. One - the kids in this movie are so obnoxious as crap I don't even want to watch anymore. Two - the kids in this movie are portrayed in an enjoyable and original manner, that I can find myself relating to wholeheartedly. As you may have guessed the kids in ""Super 8"" are portrayed in the latter form. I found every child in this movie to be either hilarious or almost hauntingly familiar. In doing this, Abrams excels at portraying all of the interesting feelings and thoughts that go along with being a kid. The set pieces in this film are unbelievably breathtaking. I mean, the train crash in this movie is so astonishing, words can't even do it justice. I mean instead of saying ""train crash"" I could say ""TRAIN CRASH :D"" and that doesn't even depict the amount of intensity involved with this scene. . .yeah. The soundtrack by Michael Giacchino is incredibly diverse in emotions - it's scary, breathtaking, and thrilling all at once. The film in and of itself is a roller-coaster of emotions too. There were parts in this film where I couldn't stop laughing. Then there were parts where tension drew out like a blade. There were scenes that pulled at my heartstrings. I honestly can't say that for many of the films that have come out this year. All in all, I felt that ""Super 8"" was an almost relentlessly entertaining thrill ride. I can now see why Steven Spielberg wanted to be attached to this superbly thought out project.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
For 12 year old kids and brain dead adults,"I'll keep it simple. If you are in the same age group as the main stars (the kids) in the movie, then you'll probably love it. If you're an adult who goes to the movies once a year, then you'll probably thinks it's okay. If you're an adult regular moviegoer with more than half a brain then you'll hate it.

It's funny what a little 'education' will do for a critic,"I think it's quite possible that people who get educated in theatrical entertainment (ie: directing/acting/producing) and are possibly emotionally touched by the 'avant-guarde' just don't seem to get movies like this.They want to say they're drivel, derivative, etc... they want to say 'this has been done before', 'nothing new', 'nothing ties the plot together' - all I can say 'WHATEVER' Yes this movie is like ET, Goonies, Sandlot, Iron Giant, etc., etc., etc.So what? It's entertaining. It's an 'homage' to Spielberg. This movie does it's job, and does it well. The kids are a decent group of actors and they're engaging to watch.Could some things have been done better? Yes, all movies are like that... but opinions are like a-holes.... everybody's got one. Including me.Plunk down you money, grab your popcorn, and don't take yourself, or this movie too seriously, and get entertained for just shy of two hours. If movie like SPHERE (which completely sucked) can get a 5.7, then this movie deserves much more than that.Take the ride, check this movie out. It's sci-fi fun, and filmed well.

A Sci-Fi Goonies,"The child actors are fantastic in Super 8. I've seen the movie several times, and I'm always blown away at how great every one of them performs.
There's a magical quality to the movie. It does a great job of capturing the lives and emotions these kids are going through. The adventure they undertake is a great mystery that slowly unveils itself throughout the story. Several reviewers hate the ending, but I thought everything worked.
The movie is filled with a sense of innocence and wonder in the face of some truly scary scenes.

Spielbergian bliss as interpreted by J.J. Abrams,"Few films evoke a time and a place well. Fewer still hone that evocation with a style of film-making that gives shape and context to that time and place.""Super 8"" is such a film. Set in the late '70s in a small Ohio steel town, it focuses almost entirely on a small group of kids who are intent on making a zombie movie in and around the town.The emotional core is formed from the very first scene by the accidental death of the protagonist's mother at the steel mill. Joe, played by a superb Joel Courtney, was a mama's boy and his father, a town deputy - another superb casting with the great Kyle Chandler - is out of his depth in the parenting department.Summer vacation starts and Joe follows around and helps his best friend Charles, a budding director, make a zombie movie. They shoot around town then find themselves late at night shooting at a deserted train station. While shooting something unfolds behind them - a massive, unexplained train derailment. In the midst of the derailment, the Super 8 camera falls over and records the crash. It records something unknown escaping from a rail car . . .. . . thus begins the movie's mystery that unfolds steadily throughout. To say much more is to give away the plot, which never wavers to hold your attention. It's pretty much edge of your seat suspense beginning to end.The wonderful Elle Fanning as Alice has Joe deeply infatuated. Alice has her own family issues including a drunken father who wants her to stay away from Joe, which of course she doesn't. Her mother, having escaped her father, is not around.All of the young cast is great and Riley Griffiths as Joe's best buddy Charles really stands out.""Super 8"" works so potently as a film of place and time and style for the following reasons: One, the dialogue is genuine - this is how kids talk, especially of that era (though the use of ""douche"" an an insult felt like an anachronism more suited to today); two, the group of friends are real and interact in a manner that's not contrived or forced; three, the friends are unique, if somewhat cookie-cutter in their differences - for example, one is the pyromaniac (yep I had one of those friends and I got into trouble a number of times with him!), one is the scaredy cat barfer, one the ""fat kid"" who overcompensates by being bossy, one the total nerd (yep, had one of those friends too), and one the sensitive artist type (that was probably me); and, lastly, it works because it feels exactly like a movie set in that era should feel.It's unsurprising Stephen Spielberg was involved in the making of ""Super 8"" because it feels almost exactly like one of his movies from the '70-early '80s- the closest probably being ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" but you can probably throw ""Jaws"" and ""E.T."" in there as well. J.J. Abrams is effectively making a Spielberg movie with a little help from his idol but putting his sure hand on the wheel to give it his unique vision.It's impossible for a child of the '70s such as myself to not love ""Super 8."" To avoid total hagiography on measure it has its formulaic moments but through my lens it appears almost pitch-perfect in characterization, casting, look, feel, and dialogue. The acting is incredibly good and the young actors who are at the core of the movie have to take most of the credit for that, especially Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning. Hearing them talk and watching their interplay it was nothing less than time travel back to my youth. On their faces I saw a lot of the same faces of the kids I grew up with.People who were born in the '80s, '90s and beyond may not have quite the same appreciation for the era, but ""Super 8"" certainly works brilliantly as a gripping, suspenseful action/quasi-sci-fi movie and it has a level of innocence and charm and a tinge of nostalgia that is usually missing from the pure action popcorn movies of today.""Super 8"" is not to be missed.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Direction was amazing, great plot, suspense was good too. And the acting..........well I was surprised to see such gud actors in those kids. They were superb.Another positive thing about the movie was it's script. It was good too. I was simply glued to the movie till the end. Clearly someone knows how to make a movie nowadays. I still don't know why this movie wasn't given much publicity before it's release even though it was a Spielberg production!!

Yes, the beginning of the movie is a lot of fun, you wonder what the thing is, what's going on, etc., etc. But about 3/4 of the way through it's revealed that it is... again... a stupid alien. Don't get me wrong, I like alien movies. But come on! If you're going to make yet another alien movie in your long line of alien movies at least come up with something original. Tell me if you've heard this one: alien crash lands on earth, alien is held against his will by the evil military people, alien longs to go home, and in the end he does. Only, in this movie he does it with no fanfare, no climax, just him climbing in some ship and taking off. Guys, it's bad. It's a bad movie. And the fact that people have given this thing 7 stars is really, really sad. I guess I shouldn't be surprised in a society that gets wet from watching American Idol for the 1000th time.

"Think Jurassic Park crossed with ET and the Goonies, which are all good references.","Set in Ohio 1979, childhood friends Joe (Courtney), Cary (Lee), Preston (Mills), Charles (Griffiths), Martin (Basso) & Alice (Fanning) set out to make a Zombie film using their much prized Super 8 camera.Whilst nighttime filming at the local railway station, a pick up truck unexpectedly drives down the track into the path of an oncoming train.No ordinary train but a Airforce locomotive carrying something they would rather no-one gets to see. By the time the colossal, spectacular and very long explosion subsides, there is not much left, apart from a still running camera and plenty of terrified children.What emerges from the train is the point of the movie, so no spoilers here. Just think small time town, mild horror and the local police deputy doing his best to keep the town safe and calm, sound familiar? It should, within moments most audiences will recognize the influence of Spielberg who produced this J.J. Abraham's (Star Trek) directed film. The period detail, children in distress, extensive use of sound effects to signpost incoming danger, you would be hard pressed to miss the references.This is not a criticism, early Spielberg films were massively popular and with the added benefit of state of the art effects, this takes the original concept and if anything improves on what came before.Joe's father (Chandler) is the deputy in question, at odds with his neighbour and father of Alice, following the death of his wife at the steel mill, which is neatly sketched out in the opening scene. Broken families, another early Spielberg trademark.The children are good, acting naturally and the dialogue is believable. In between effects there are some well drawn quiet character driven scenes, notably the practice scene before the crash and when Joe carefully turns Alice into a Zombie with his homemade make up kit. Proof that you can care about characters in between exploding tanks & trains. The period setting is great, with ELO and other topical bands punctuating the soundtrack.There is a stand out sequence aboard a bus which is classic ""Jurassic Park"" and together with a electrical pole repair scene, almost cries out for a John Williams penned music score. Abraham's wisely keeps his creature hidden for most of the film and yet shows creativity when finally the reveal is made. The writers also manage a satisfactory ending, just when you start to wonder how this will all turn out.Initial trailers indicated a monster movie with subsequent clips revealing the film skewed much younger, focusing on it's young protagonists. The finished films achieves both, enough jump scares and peril coupled with a well sketched coming of age story. Joel Courtney is a good find, carefully showing wonder, terror and an inner resolve whilst facing an even greater terror, talking to Alice, the girl he fancies. Ellen Fanning showing her sister Dakota did not steal all the acting genes.Make sure you stay for the credits where the fruits of all that amateur filming are shown in all their glory. Always fascinating to see actors acting badly, which is good acting in itself.SummaryIf you are looking for a summary, think Jurassic Park crossed with ET and the Goonies, which are all good references.Add some fine child performances, lots of explosions and scares for older children and you have an easy recommendation, go see it.http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A New American Classic,"""Super 8"" is a magical film. While an homage to the ultra-classic science fiction and child adventure films of the 70s and 80s (e.g., ""E.T."", Close Encounters of the Third Kind"", ""Stand by Me"", and ""The Goonies""), ""Super 8"" manages to blaze a new trail and emerge from the shadows of similar frameworks. The production value, setting, acting, plot build-up, character development, and action rivals all of the films it represents.The replication of the 70s is done with masterful precision. The houses, the costumes, the cars, the lingo, and the props are meticulously taken care of. The settings are tight-lit and sometimes claustrophobic (when they need to be). This is Spielberg doing what Spielberg does best....setting the mood.J.J. Abrams and Spielberg get the best performances out of children I have seen in a long, long time. These kids are amazingly convincing at every turn. Not since ""The Sixth Sense"" have I been so moved by a child. Every actor in ""Super 8"" shows professionalism and real talent. Every one of them carries his or her own weight on set. Coming of age stories can sometimes be extremely melodramatic and pointless, but here the acting is first rate.The plot moves at a slow and steady pace. Every character is fleshed out and all the subplots intertwine with each other perfectly. The writing is crafted with care and the plot devices are constructed around good ideas. Mystery and excitement permeates the entire piece.The train scene is breathtaking and is the best action scene in a science-fiction movie in recent memory. After that, the action doesn't really pick up until the final act. Instead, you are given clues and intriguing plot elements that piece together the exhilarating conclusion. One the action begins again, it keep you on the edge of your seat and glued to the screen like well-thought-out action scenes should. Movies like ""Transformers"" overload your frontal lobe with so many nauseating action scenes that you are numbed by the end. ""Super 8"", on the other hand, crafts well-timed and well-executed action sequences that come to fruition based on the context of the plot. It mixes action, drama, and sci-fi so awesomely that you are never bored by any of these elements.""Super 8"" is a new American classic. If you enjoy nostalgia or the brilliant sci-fi films that defined a generation, get ready to be blown away. This film was obviously made by two men that have mighty respect for the time it represents. It belongs in the same category of classic as the films it seeks to connect with. A time in the film industry where plot, characters, and build-up mattered. Spielberg has done it again! Abrams has proved himself worthy of Hollywood. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A dazzling science-fiction spectacle blooming with stunning special effects and enthralling Spielberg nostalgia,"J.J Abrams's Super 8 is not just a film that feasts the eyes with chord-striking special effects and visuals, it is also a love letter to the nostalgic days of Steven Spielberg classics such as'E.T: The Extra Terrestrial' and 'Close Encounters of The Third Kind'. This investment is greatly paid by the collaboration of visionary director Abrams and acclaimed Hollywood mogul Steven Spielberg who serves as the producer behind this summer spectacle. Channeling with both emotionally resonating storytelling and a powerful surplus of visuals that echoes the style of the aforementioned films, the influence of Spielberg's works definitely bleeds through. Although Abrams incorporates plenty of elements that defuse it's originality, it is difficult not to admire what a dazzling vision he delivers in this science-fiction piece. Set in 1979 in a fictional town of Lillian, Ohio, this film focuses on 14-year old Joe Lamb (played by Joel Courtney), a young lad coping with the loss of his mother who was killed in a train accident. With his relationship with his deputy father Jackson (played by Kyle Chandler) grown distant, Joe escapes his grief by filming monster movies with his friends Charles (played by Riley Griffiths), Cary (played by Ryan Lee), Martin (played by Gabriel Basso), and Preston (played by Zach Mills). Later joining the group is Alice Dainard (played by Elle Fanning) who's mother was also killed in the accident. While filming their Super 8 film at an abandoned train station, the children witness a horrific train crash that not devastates the train station, but leads to some unnatural events that begin to threaten the town.The leverage of Steven Spielberg's classic works is greatly sprinkled throughout the picture, from the emotionally stimulating narrative, to the eye-striking scenery. Abrams and Spielberg both effectively captures the innocence of childhood through the story that not only echoes the vibrant atmosphere of 'E.T' but also their passion of filmmaking that grew on them as children. The premise follows the lead character as he escapes into a world of filmmaking in the wake of the tragedy that struck him and his father, and emotional tax it puts on their relationship serves as the emotional crux of the story. He ends up finding levity in making short films with his rag-tag team of friends who's fun in greatly disrupted by when a bombastic train crash, a scene that kicks off the movie's special effects mayhem. With train cars blowing up and crashing in every direction, this scene not only exhibits Abrams's astonishing talent for effects but sets the whole mystery plot in motion for the terrifying chaos that is about to come. As the story advances, chaos lurks throughout the picture, and Abrams successfully delivers a hodgepodge of suspense-ridden thrills and stimulating visuals that keeps the story moving. In the final act, which pays a heavy homage to one of Spielberg's most acclaimed films, Abrams's visionary style greatly pays off. While some may argue that the film towers nostalgia over substance and plot, it is hard to ignore the ambition that Abrams brings to the table. As for the performances, the young actors do a swell job in their roles as do the adults in their slightly more minor roles, none of which truly stand out.Super 8 is a dazzling science-fiction spectacle that grips with exhilarating special effects, visual imagery, and an emotionally touching narrative that strikes at the heart. Most importantly, the film also makes an enthralling achievement at reminding people what it was like to be child. In conclusion, this cinematic achievement inspires hope for another Abrams/Spielberg collaboration.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Joel Courtney carries the movie well for a boy his age. The rest of the children are a great supporting cast.If I had to complain about some of the performances it would be on some of the adults.

The worst thing Spielberg has created since A.I.,"Super 8 is a science-fiction thriller directed by JJ Abrams and produced by Steven Spielberg. The movie centers around a group of young friends who witness a train crash that leads to a series of inexplicable events occurring in their small town. The film was released in 2011 and received mixed reviews from critics and audiences alike. While some praised the film's homage to Spielberg's classic style of storytelling, others criticized its lack of originality and weak character development. Here, we will discuss why the latter group may consider Super 8 to be a bad movie.One of the main criticisms of Super 8 is its reliance on established tropes and clichés in the sci-fi genre. The film's plot revolves around a mysterious, otherworldly creature that is being held captive by the US Military, who seeks to use it for its own means. This is a familiar setup that has been used in countless other movies, such as ET or the X-Files. While there is nothing inherently wrong with utilizing these tropes, Super 8 does not bring anything new or original to the table. As a result, the film fails to distinguish itself from similar movies in the genre.Another issue with Super 8 is its weak characterization. Despite being the film's main focus, the young protagonists are never fully developed beyond their initial archetypes. The film's attempts at giving them more depth and complexity fall flat, as they come across as shallow and one-dimensional. Additionally, their relationships with one another feel superficial, which undercuts the emotional impact of the story's more poignant moments. Compared to Spielberg's earlier works like Stand By Me or The Goonies, which also centered around groups of young friends, Super 8 falls short in terms of fleshing out its characters.Furthermore, the film's pacing can be uneven, with some scenes feeling dragged out while others feel rushed. The first act of the movie spends a lot of time establishing the group of friends and their relationships with one another, but this comes at the expense of the film's overall narrative momentum. Once the train crash occurs, the pacing picks up considerably, but there are still moments where the film seems to be treading water. Perhaps the film would have benefited from a tighter, more streamlined script.Lastly, the movie's climax is underwhelming, failing to pay off the buildup that came before it. Without giving away any spoilers, the resolution feels messy and unsatisfying, leaving viewers with more questions than answers. There are no real consequences or lasting impact from the events of the movie, making it ultimately forgettable.In conclusion, while Super 8 may have its merits, the movie falls short in several key areas that would make it a critique for some audiences. It may not be a bad movie per se, but it fails to live up to the hype generated by its talented cast and crew, and ultimately comes across as a middling entry in a crowded genre. While the film may have nostalgic appeal for those who grew up with Spielberg's earlier works, it is difficult to recommend it to anyone looking for an original and engaging sci-fi thriller.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Future of Filmmaking Hinges on THIS Movie!,"Movie lovers, we are at a crossroad, and nothing shy of the future of filmmaking hangs in the balance. Call me a forecaster of doom if you will, but ask the record-industry of the precarious point the movie industry now finds itself. In Super 8 we have a bridge to the future which hails from movie-making past; a connection to an open door of variety and comedy and emotion that we had better not be too dull to see, less we lose it forever.Super 8 is more than just the excellent thrill ride that others have so adequately described in this forum. It's a break from the rut that the industry is slippery sliding its way into. A movie that actually delivers more than it's trailer promises. And one that rises above the super-trailer-formula-for-success that appears crucial to survive the increasingly difficult and competitive battle to claim your entertainment dollars.In our times, and in a darkening future looming on the horizon, movies do not need a good story, they just have to have a great promotional trailer and solid first two weekends at the box office to cover the investment. Anything that can be sufficiently hyped qualifies as entertainment in that sad world. But Super 8 seeks to stem the tide. Not only did it eschew the wham-bam super-trailer--it was more curiosity invoking than anything else--but the strength move was in its story! With layers of intrigue and plot angle like you get from a first rate novel, it will stands up well on small screens, and works for adults and children alike. The great books that became movies in the 70s had that. The outstanding screenplays of the 50s had that. And if we have any sense at all, we'll rush out and see this movie in droves and encourage others to create great cinema. Movie-going is depending on you, GO!",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Good But Not in the Way You'd Expect,"Super 8 (2011)*** (out of 4)A cross between THE GOONIES and a 50s sci-fi movie, SUPER 8 tells the story of a group of kids in 1979 who are making their own zombie movie via a super 8 camera. Everything is going fine until one night they capture a train derailment and soon the military moves into their town and starts to take things over. No one can get any answers but it appears one of the school teachers knows a secret that the government wants to keep from everyone. With a director like J.J. Abrams and a producer like Steven Spielberg you know there would be something good and that's exactly what we're given, although I think the film falls well short of being a great picture. I'm shocked to say this but I think the movie works best as a character development more than a monster or action movie. I think the best thing going for the film is the relationship between our main hero Joe (Joel Courtney) and Alice (Elle Fanning). The two of them are connected through a tragedy and the way this place out was quite touching and the minor romance between the two was a lot better than some of the big-budget romantic comedies that get released each year. The way both characters and their fathers develop made for a very interesting movie and it's not something you typical see in a film like this. It also doesn't hurt that the performances are so strong. The kid actors all do a very good job in their parts as does Kyle Chandler and Ron Eldard as the parents. Another strong thing is that they capture the 1970s very well and I'd almost say this film feels exactly like a movie from that period and especially some of the made-for-TV movies that were scaring kids at the time. There are a few problems with the film and one of them is that there's really no suspense or drama. The film plays everything very safe and I'd say it plays things way too safe because you never feel as if any of our main characters are in trouble. Another problem is that the film runs about ten-minutes too long and when you consider how the movie ends you can't help but think some of the stuff leading up to it could have been cut. Finally, the monster in the movie really doesn't work and when the big reveal happens I must say that I was letdown. With that said, SUPER 8 is still worth viewing for fans of the genre but I think what really makes the film work are the characters.",,Anonymous,Mystery

Super 8 is a perfect 10,"JJ Abrams' 'Super 8' is an unabashed homage to the 70s, Spielberg and the kind of cinema he helped to create. But it's not merely a fan film or a copycat. It stands very much on its own two feet. It's clear that Abrams--a child of the 70s--has an affinity for the era, and that love saturates every frame.I was born in 1974, grew up in Ohio not far from the film's fictional Lillian, and I too was into model kits, sci-fi and all the rest, so naturally 'Super 8' was in my wheelhouse. But watching it in the years since its release, with my own Mother having passed in the interim, it has taken on a whole new meaning.Great performances and humor and heart to spare.

The reason why we go to movies...,"I have always been a huge fan of the summer movie season, often watching and re-watching trailers for the sure fire hits in order to get myself more and more excited for their releases.

For the first time that I can remember, I walked into the theater with zero knowledge of what to expect and I can honestly say that I walked away wholly surprised and completely satisfied.J.J. Abrams has never been one to disappoint for me (Lost, Cloverfield, Star Trek)but there was no way to anticipate the power behind this film.

Delightful nostalgia,"In 2010, amidst the flood of adaptations that filled the blockbuster season, Christopher Nolan's Inception stood out for being not only an effective thriller, but more importantly for being one of the few original concept tent-pole releases of the year. This year you may hear similar things about JJ Abrams' Super 8, but please do not be fooled. Super 8 is in fact arguably the most derivative film of the year, but for people of a certain generation who grew up on 80s family adventure films, it really is a rare treat. Working from the template perfected by executive producer Steven Spielberg in films such as Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and E.T., Abrams delivers a sweet, nostalgic, and often frightening film unlike anything seen in cinemas for many years.While there is a lot to enjoy in many contemporary blockbusters, it takes a film like Super 8 to highlight the absence of a crucial ingredient in modern movies: heart. Most summer films released over the past decade have certainly been big on action set-pieces and visual effects, but everything else about them seems distressingly interchangeable. There's a lone male hero. A love interest. A problem to be solved. And in many cases a kiss at the end. There's no denying that it's a successful formula (the box office numbers speak for themselves), but it is somewhat fleeting success. It really is a great shame that what people will remember about the films of the early 21st century is the style rather than the substance. In Jaws, it's not the shark itself we remember so much as the pursuit of the shark and interactions between Brody, Hooper and Quint. In E.T., it's the relationship between Elliott and the titular alien. Super 8 is Abrams' love-letter to that period in cinema, and keen eyed viewers will undoubtedly spot many homages to films such as Stand By Me, The Goonies, and most obviously the early work of his mentor Spielberg. The film is rich with sentimentality, keenly addressing childhood issues of friendship, ambition, problems with parents, and first love. The adults in the film (including a great performance from Kyle Chandler) are all crucial to keep the narrative moving, but the beauty of Super 8 comes from its focus on the perspective of the kids. They're a rag-tag bunch of largely unknown young actors who all do a terrific job (especially the freakishly talented Elle Fanning), and Abrams wisely allows the camera to linger on small character moments rather than simply jumping from one set-piece to the next as so often happens nowadays. Allowing development of these characters makes them seem all the more real, and when things get nasty (which they do), there's genuine fear about what's going to happen to these youngsters. Abrams ratchets up the tension with scream-inducing (at least in my screening) jump scares, and opts to keep the threat hidden for the majority of the film, another nice Spielbergian touch. Super 8 really is a masterpiece of tone.I guess I haven't really mentioned the plot in this review, but this is a film about emotion, harking back to a time where the plot was merely a foundation on which to build authentic character relationships. But yes, ostensibly Super 8 is a monster movie, and unfortunately Abrams fumbles at the goal line as the film draws to a close, hampered by the necessity to finish the monster story. As with any creature feature, the monster is merely a frightening manifestation of a bigger issue facing the characters, and Abrams' attempt at pathos comes off as a little clunky. But where a lesser film would perhaps be ruined by such an obvious emotional climax, Abrams' heartfelt handling of the characters in the film's build-up allows some forgiveness. Super 8 is never going to be the highest grosser of the year, but it warms the soul to know that this type of filmmaking is still around, and hopefully the film will find an audience with today's young and young-at-heart. Now if you'll excuse me, I feel a strong desire to watch Close Encounters.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"I love Spielberg, and I love Super 8","This movie follows what I believe to be one of the most important rules when making a sci-fi monster movie: no matter how large and impressive the monster is, the characters have to come first. This is something Spielberg is known for. This movie has been described as a ""love letter to Spielberg,"" but it is enough of its own movie to stand alone. The main character Joe is a perfect unlikely hero, and his friends are loyal and never come across as simple sidekicks. Joel Courtney is impressive in this movie. He has a way of looking both brave and terrified; a skill that cannot be taught. It is clear that both Spielberg and Abrams put a lot of themselves into Super 8, and the result is pure entertainment.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Goonies Meets Cloverfield,"This is one of the summer's strongest entries and well worth seeing. The kids are for the most part great, and it's even more amazing when you consider that some of them are in their first feature film. Spielberg's influence is very evident and the alien monster looks so much like the one from Cloverfield that I began to wonder if there were unstated connections between the two films. In any case, I like both films, but this one is the better. It obviously had a larger budget and thankfully left out the shaky hand-held camera techniques.If you like science fiction films that intend to tug at your heart strings, this is a don't miss film. It's not perfect but never fails to hold your attention and make sense.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I can't believe the movie I've just seen,"A NOTE: No way I would spoil that movie for you..You're safe, go on.Super 8 is one of the most beautifully crafted movies I have ever seen and I can't believe it..I am overwhelmed and I was just NOT expecting it. This is a movie about pureness and love, relationships, friendship, science fiction yes sure, psychological and physical violence, AND compassion. It takes you to a journey from the worst to the most compelling behaviors of Man. It tells you how good and how bad can we, humans, all be or become. The special effects are from another World. The music keeps you going and fits every one second. The acting, especially from the kids is impeccable, to say the least and so moving. The atmosphere is breathtaking at all times, there is not one dull moment in this movie. Everything flows so perfectly that it just gets you going on and on, you're dizzy, moved, scared, you're crying and smiling, you're amazed...At a certain point you get so involved in the movie that you realize you know everything about every one of these character's lives and you get surprisingly moved (""what's going one here!??"") by how every separate, but not that separate, story develops, you are THERE. You see yourself, and it gets you thinking, mirroring with your own actions, considering how you're going to live your tomorrow. A movie that *moves* you like that, is Cinema in all its splendor.It is missing one only thing, one star. This director, he had to realize: the OST HAD to be ""The Suburbs"", by the Arcade Fire :)",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
So ET and Cloverfield walk into a bar and.........,"Anyone familiar with Director J.J. Abrams' re-visioning of Star Trek should, by now, be annoyingly familiar with his cloying love of lens flare. He's even admitted in interviews to going overboard with the gimmick. So it's all the more surprising that in Super 8 – his collaboration with Steven Spielberg who served as Producer – that the icon who gave us Jaws and Close Encounters didn't crack the whip and reign in flare boy.How much does Abrams love lens flare? Well, If you want to get totally plastered before the first reel spins out, invite friends over for a Star Trek drinking game where everybody takes a shot whenever there's lens flare. Super 8 isn't much different except that unlike Star Trek, you might survive an alcohol overdose until the final act, but all that's saying is that Abrams has learnt to pace himself, from a drinking game perspective.Seriously, there are entire sequences that break the ""fourth wall"" by having so much damn lens flare that I found myself wondering why the scenes weren't re-shot. After all, Spielberg was cracking the whip here.As for the story, without giving away copious spoilers, suffice to say it's what anybody would achieve if they took both men's most iconic films, ET in the case of Spielberg, and Cloverfield for Abrams, and had a team of re-writers blend the two together.You can read the plot synopsis online, but since you're here, the story involves a small group of kids who, in the late '70s, are devoted to making a zombie film using the then cheap and popular Super 8 film stock. While filming a key scene, they witness the derailment of an Air Force train carrying mysterious cargo. The result of the spectacular crash is that a critter of uncertain intelligence and power is released into the countryside, with the US Army rolling in to contain the townsfolk and generally act as the baddies. Viewers familiar with Spielberg and Abrams' sci-fi and monster flicks can fill in the blanks.In spite of the hype and the pedigrees behind it, Super 8 isn't a bad movie, but it isn't a stand out either. It's basically like drinking a cocktail composed of the essence of Abrams and Spielberg. It goes down easy but leaves a lingering taste of ""meh"" in your mouth afterwards. When it comes to cocktails, however, my only lament is that I didn't bring a flask of booze. It would have made the popcorn go down easier every time there was lens flare.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"A disappointing mix of E.T., Alien and Close Encounters","I wanted to love Super 8. It was well shot. The period music & score were fine. Special effects: good. But the messy & predictable script fails to make you care enough for the characters. At the start, the lead character and family deal with the death of his mother. An old trope we've seen too many times (along with the tired storyline of the military hiding secrets). The actors do the best they can with the material.Super 8 doesn't have enough gore to please horror fans. Not enough science to please sci-fi fans. Not enough moments of fun & humor to offset an overly serious script. Too many plot holes. Countless events unexplained, especially at the end.Super 8 was just okay. I was disappointed.

Had High Expectations... However Ultimately Disappointed!,"*** This Review May Contain Spoilers***Having loved Lost and most of Steven Spielberg's movies, I decided to take a chance on Super 8. What I did like about the film was the screen presence of Joel Courtney, and I thought his acting carried the picture. He is certainly destined to be a big star. I was just not impressed with the storyline that much, and I thought there was a lack of creativity with the alien. Aliens in recent movies have shown no originality. This one is no exception. The one dimensional character i.e. the fat kid was totally annoying, unlike most fat kids in movies, they are usually funny. This one felt like fingernails on a blackboard every time he was on screen. Elle Fanning was OK, but even her performance was lackluster. I just would not recommend this film for adults, maybe for middle schoolers and freshmen in high school. All in all I was extremely disappointed with the film. I would not recommend it to my friends, and I tried to talk my daughter out of seeing it, but she went anyway. Looking forward to JJ Abrams' next effort, hopefully it will be better.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Quality entertainment for everyone.,"In a small town in Ohio, a group of kids are making a zombie flick using an 8mm camera. During their shooting, a train is derailed and something escapes. Odd things start happening around the town and the military arrive to cover up a government secret.Told through the eyes of young kids, Super 8, which is also set in the late 70's, will instantly feel nostalgic. That's the one word I've been hearing thrown around when people describe this film. Spielberg is the producer, so people instantly make a connection between this film and his previous works. The underlying feeling is there, but this film has much more to offer than just nostalgia.In the first few scenes, we know the main character has lost someone in his life. It's always hard to convey something has happened without any dialogue, this film tells us so much with so little. The main character is missing something from his life, will this adventure be able to fill that hole? Will he be able to let go of the things that are holding him back in the past? He has a crush on this cute girl, who just so happens to be in the film they are shooting. Their relationship is cute to watch grow, from awkwardness, to understanding, to needing. They are kids, so their relationship isn't based on lust, which most romantic comedies and blockbuster films will be about this year. Instead, it's an innocence that makes the relationship spark.Abrams manages to invoke the same feelings we all had when we watched Spielberg films as kids, yet he is able to keep his own creative touch in tact. It never feels like a rip-off, or even a homage. Instead it feels like it belongs with those films, side by side. The mystery behind this film is what fuels the fire. Leading up to the release, all we know about it was that it was a monster flick of some kind. A companion piece to Abrams produced film Cloverfield maybe?Elle Fanning, plays the young Alice, who is the object of Joe's affection. Joe is played by newcomer Joel Courtney. Both do a great job in their roles, Fanning more so, who I enjoy more than her famous sister, Dakota. I would have loved a bit more bickering and interaction between the kids though. The film is more of a family centric piece. The relationship between Joe and his father, the Deputy, is less than perfect. We are given so many answers at the beginning of the film and later on we are revealed the questions. A film that manages to ignite many mysteries that resolves them later is great in my book.The climax of the film is a little less than stellar. It ends on a more family friendly note than what one might hope. Then again, this is ""Spielberg"" right? Super 8 is full of thrilling sequences and charming performances. It will grab your inner child (for those of us who grew up with Spielberg films) and get him/her cheering. Super 8, with some minor problems is one of the best films this year. Abrams is a talented guy, which we already knew from Star Trek. Here he shows us he attention to detail and how much he admires the craft.Super 8 is indeed super and it gets an 8 from me.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Super 8 - horror-able,"Super 8 is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. What was the point? The seventies are over and Spielberg was in his 20's unknowingly making classics. Trying to go back and copy successes of those bygone days.....why? To cash in once again? Well, here's the deal: Those of us who are old enough to remember the 70's were 35 years younger and just as naive as Spielberg. But, it's 2011 and we have witnessed the evolution of the sci-fi genre (and I must say it's one of my favorites and has come a long way, particularly with the MARVEL classics and the sophistication with which they have been transformed to the screen). Poor me, having gotten sucked into buy a ticket. The movie made no sense (I could list about 25 scenes which were gratuitous, senseless, and poorly executed). I think anyone with an IQ below 78 might enjoy it. Elle, get a real job, because your sister has it all over you and her choices are far above yours, and please get your teeth fixed.

***The E.T. of the 21st century... spellbindingly super*** http://themoviemaven.posterous.com,"The ""E.T."" of the 21st century.Growing up overseas, I never saw the original ""E.T."" But I had the pleasure of seeing the 2002's remake. ""Super 8"" is a reminiscence of that, with a homage to ""Jurassic Park."" I saw it a couple of weeks ago, but due to a variety of factors, I wasn't able to write a review around that time. It may not be an instant classic, but ""Super 8"" has a magical quality. It stays fresh in my mind as one of the best movies of the year.If you're not a fan of ""Cloverfield,"" fear not, ""Super 8"" is nothing like the shaky docu-style film. While both share the director, J.J. Abrams, that's where the similarity stops. It's also worlds beyond Spielberg's own ""War of the Worlds"" (starring Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning). Inspired by Spielberg (acting as producer here), ""Super 8"" has all the footprints of an old-fashioned kids' adventure, family movie.Set in 1979 Ohio, the story opens with several kids (Joel Courtney, Elle Fanning, Riley Griffiths, Ryan Lee, Zach Mills, Gabriel Basso), filming an amateur movie with a Super 8 camera in front of an old train station. They witness and survive the impact of a horrifically breathtaking freight train crash, which is derailed by a pick-up truck driven by a familiar face. Almost immediately the U.S. Air Force (led by Noah Emmerich) swarm in and sweep around the area, recovering tons of small white-cubed materials from the train. They continually roam around and even set up makeshift camps in town.Not long after the town begins to experience strange occurrences. Pets running and found many miles away, people mysteriously disappearing, pools of blood streaming through, random power outage, electrical interference, neighborhood posts destroyed, loud scary noises in the dark. And during the Cold War era, suspicion gravitates toward the Soviet Union. Little did they know that something far sinister lurks in the background, threatening the lives of everyone. A pandora box has been opened.The filmmakers did a super job in keeping ""Super 8"" under wrap and thus raises the ""shock and awe"" value. ""Super 8"" is a throwback to a nostalgic era - rotary telephone, walkman, camera film - filled with memories of childhood friendships and the wonders of exploration and discovery about the world. The kids are the true stars here. Relatively unknown, they're a talented bunch. Ellen Fanning is especially stunning. The natural interconnectedness yet underscored by distinct personalities create an authentic innocence and camaraderie.The strength of ""Super 8"" lies in the execution. It's executed exceptionally well that every moment is precious... The ambiance is just right that you could literally feel the chill in the air. With spectacular cinematography, special effects, sound editing, it's tense and thrilling.And the story is the draw. It's purely poignant, sweet and funny. It's a story about a boy's grief, coping with the loss of his mother, and dealing with his overprotective father and the town's sheriff (Kyle Chandler). It's also a coming-of-age story, interlinked with genuine interactions among friends.Perfectly paced, the suspense builds gradually and keeps its momentum until its heartwarming ending. Stay through the closing credits roll for a special treat. ""Super 8"" is spellbindingly super.The MovieMaven (http://themoviemaven.posterous.com)",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A great blockbuster for the cinematic summer of 2011,"""Super 8"" is a very creative science-fiction movie that can be seen as an homage to the works of Steven Spielberg such as ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"", ""E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial"" or ""The Goonies"". The movie is not only set in the end of the seventies and the beginning of the eighties but also inspired by the movies, the music and the technical discoveries of that time which gives a nostalgic charm to the movie which distinguishes it from other comparable adventure movies starring young actors and the classic inspirations mentioned above.Even though the story focuses on the adventures of a bunch of friends in a rather unknown and isolated small town in the middle of nowhere in the United States of America, this movie could also please to a lot of adults because of the classic influences, the nostalgic factors and a couple of surprisingly well done special effects and even a few rather brutal fighting scenes. I would like to underline the high budget that was perfectly used in this technically perfect movie as well as the brilliant acting of all actors and especially the young stars like the charismatic and authentic main male actor Joel Courtney and the very charming and breathtaking Elle Fanning that interact in a great way. Their relation is credible, dramatic and romantic and they are one of the best young actor couples I have ever seen in the history of cinema.The story integrates everything a good adventure blockbuster needs to be a success for this year's cinematic summer: credible and diversified personalities, philosophically touched emotional topics such as first love, friendship and loss, some mysterious events that keep the tension high until the end and reserve some light surprises, some good humour, a lot of dramatic emotions, many and well crafted but not too overwhelming action scenes, many tension filled passages and a typically Hollywood ending.The only thing that I might criticize is that the makers of the movie didn't always seem to know if they want to address to a younger or an older public and even though both public could appreciate this movie, there are a few flaws: the shooting and killing scenes in the bus are way too brutal for young children while the somewhat stereotypical ending waters the movie down and may seem ridiculous to many adults. The only other negative point is the fact that the homage automatically copies a lot from the initial movies and isn't that original and fresh anymore.But in the end this is well crafted entertainment for old and young with a multitude of influences and a stunningly great acting that is only watered down by a childish ending after many mature and intense moments. After many weak cinematic months, this is finally a very well done movie for the whole family.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Disappointing,"I'm sorry to have to contradict the first review but I did not get as much out of this movie as they did and in fact I would not recommend it all. It was a loud hash of a movie which was all over the place. It has elements of all the movies he mentions i suppose and I could not help noticing all the gestures to earlier films but it was very long, not pacey at all and the trailer is probably the best part of it. Maybe its trying too hard to pay homage, develop character and suspense,and tell a story which holds together. It didn't work for me. I saw X-men 1st class a few days ago and enjoyed it far more and in fact could watch it and Thor again no problem.

[8.1] Big bad ET?!,"That's a production which would have been much better as a 5-6 episode series than a ~1:50h movie.
The runtime passed quickly without much development, explanations and true storyline.To its credit, it has great special effects and VFX, some good emotional acting by the kids and especially Elle Fanning and that's about it.
The movie lacks in strong screenplay and development; the mentioned engulf all its positive sides on the balance plate; A double pity; of which a big one for its unrealistic and not believable ending.

Brilliant family movie,"I absolutely loved Super 8. The movie strongly (and purposely) evokes reminiscences of classic teenage adventures like The Goonies, ET and Explorers. I've read a lot of criticism about Super 8, and i think it comes basically from two problems people have with it. First, they expected something different. Probably something more akin to Cloverfield, which this movie isn't. It's a teenage adventure story, suitable for all family, much like the aforementioned classic teen flicks, so don't expect anything different or otherwise you will be disappointed. Second, this is a movie directed in the style of the 80s teenage adventures, so it obviously requires a lot of suspension of disbelief. It's easy to point at the fact that some parts of the plot aren't realistic, like a train derailing because of of a pickup, but that's the style of the kind of movies Super 8 is homaging and is inspired to. Those movies come from an era of ingenuity the audience seem to have lost by growing up. It's not a fault of the movie if you weren't able to grow up keeping that ingenuity and became, well, cynical and disillusioned. So, i recommend STRONGLY this movie to everyone who like adventure movies full of ingenuity and magic, aimed at a younger audience. Conversely, stay away from it if you are looking for something realistic, dark and original, because those are 3 things this movie doesn't even want to be. And it's not a fault, despite many people don't get it. The director and producer very clearly wanted it to be like it is. A movie from another time when cinema had less angst and not everything needed to be gritty and overly complex.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

It is a movie I wouldn't turn off. Not as much as say, bigger movies that can run in the background all day like a Tombstone, but I do like the reality of 4 letter words being used by the kids. That is how it is..quit kidding yourself in the timeout world..but especially in 1979. It was raw and real back then. Even the radio played nasty lyrics The Knack's ""Good Girls Don't"".lol.

A Spielbergian Adventure from His Biggest Fan,"I stopped caring so much about SUPER 8 some time before it ever came to theaters. It wasn't that I didn't expect great things from J.J. Abrams. I know he's good for a fun movie, but the trailers never really grabbed my attention. Sure the teaser was interesting, with the ""mystery"" bursting out from behind the sealed door of an Air Force train car. But it wasn't hard to guess what was coming out from behind that door; combine the mystery-less mystery with the fact that I don't have the same nostalgia for Steven Spielberg's 80's films, and SUPER 8 was destined not to have the same impact on me as it had on many others. The film is about a group of children in the late 70's putting together a zombie movie on super 8mm film for a local film festival. Joe (Joel Courtney) lost his mother to an industrial accident four months earlier, and tensions rise when he directing friend invites Alice Dainard (Ellie Fanning) to act in his film. Alice is the daughter of the man believed responsible for the death of Joe's mom and, despite this awkward tension that exists between their two fathers, emotions begin to develop between the two of them. Oh, and the town is terrorized by a mysterious creature of unknown origin. It's more of a B-story, despite what original trailers insinuated. While filming a scene for their zombie film, the friends witness a train derailment that releases the creature into their small town and eventually become involved in their own investigation.This movie really is about the kids first, and the creature second. That's fine, I guess. I just wish the filmmakers' early marketing efforts hadn't been about the beast's escape from the Air Force cargo train. Once the full trailer was released and I saw the actual scope of the movie, my interested began to fade. I was still interested in seeing it, but I wasn't in any rush. I normally hate children actors (some leftover resentment for Jake Lloyd's performance in STAR WARS EPISODE I, I suppose), but there are occasions where a child performer/cast will come along that makes me eat my words. This is one of them. It could just be proof of J.J. Abrams skill as a director that he's able to utilize kids so well, but the stars of this movie do a pretty excellent job (some more than others). You would never guess this is Joel Courtney's first feature role, and Riley Griffiths proves to be more than comfortable in front of the camera (even if he can be annoying at timesproduction value!!). The real strength in the group is Ellie Fanning as Alice Dainard. It must be something in the Fanning blood, but apparently they make fantastic child actors. She's got emotional power in her performance that stands out amongst her lesser castmates, and it's obvious she's going to have a successful future just as her sister had.This movie just didn't click with me. I was born in the 80's, so I wasn't really old enough to appreciate the Spielberg films that Abrams is goings nuts over here. I was too young for CLOSE ENCOUNTERS and, even as a kid, I never cared for E.T. I didn't see the Spielberg-produced GOONIES until years later (loved it though). So the homage that makes up the core of Abram's SUPER 8 just didn't resonate with me. I still enjoyed SUPER 8, quite a bit. It's just not what I'd spent months anticipating after seeing the teaser trailer. I wanted another good sci-fi movie, not a coming-of-age drama that just so happened to feature an alien plot. It's an incredibly well-done movie and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it, but I guess my lingering disappointment has given me a slight bias. It looks and feels like a mid-80s era Spielberg family/adventure film and, in that respect, Abrams nailed it. It just failed to really stay with me after leaving the theater and when I tried thinking back to the best movies I saw over the summer of 2011, despite how good this movie was, I'd completely forgotten about it. It was a fun sci-fi adventure with a great heart, and the final act of the film where the entire creature storyline kicks into gear is fun. I'm just glad Abrams got it out of his system so we can move on to STAR TREK 2 or whatever new project he's got up his sleeve.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Lackluster Remix of Spielberg Classics,"Call it a homage if you want. This nostalgia-bait retrospective remixes the Steve Spielberg classics of the late 1970s and 1980s, including The Goonies, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E. T., and Jaws. The look and feel of the movie, at least in the early going, successfully recapture Spielberg's classic style.The problem is that Super 8 muddles its sources without much apparent thought or care. The result is a movie that doesn't seem to know what it wants to be other than an exercise in throwback window-dressing. The character interactions are inauthentic.

10 out of 8,"A superlative film from J.J. Abrams, clearly channelling the work of producer the fabulous Mr. Spielberg, Super 8 takes the joyfully freewheeling sensibility of ET and brings a darker more adult tone to a story that borrows several themes from Earth-bound Science Fiction, but Abrams takes these and makes them his own. Hinging the story around the youngsters shooting a movie is a clever and affecting touch, evoking memories of childhood dreams in the audience, and the young stars have a great chemistry that makes the whole premise engrossing. But it would not work so well if the adult performances did not anchor events in the 'real' world of grown-up cares and concerns, and good turns from Kyle Chandler and Ron Elard do just that, especially in the opening scenes where the film's emotional level is established. The youngsters are not upstaged however and the leading lights of the cast-within-a-cast, Joel Courtney, Elle Fanning and Riley Griffiths are entirely believable, but it is Fanning who steals the show in the key train wreck scene, which is fraught with tension and excitement even before the train arrives and, like a certain scene in David Lynch's 'Mulholland Drive' featuring Naomi Watts, is a highly effective illustration of what proper acting looks like. Super 8 is essential viewing for fans of Abrams, Spielberg or just plain wonderful movies.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Fantastic!,"I cannot believe I waited this long to finally seen J.J. Abram's Super 8.The film brings to mind all of those classic sci-fi kids' films that are built upon mystery. It has so many things going for it. It has mystery, but it also has a real connection with its audience. I was fully connected with the characters, and the action sequences were amazing (the highlight being the train wreck in the beginning). This feels through and through like a film Spielberg would have made two decades ago.I also want to talk about the great performances from the kids. Seriously, they drive the plot. I want to specifically talk about Joel Courtney. He expresses so much with his performance so subtly. Not once did he feel awkward. He was able to give a very professional performance full of feeling.Like I said, Super 8 also brings back the nostalgia from when we were kids. Many films have tried to do this, but in all honesty, I don't remember any recent film that has succeeded quite like this. Super 8 is a charming, very entertaining, and completely satisfying science-fiction film that is sure to stay among the 10 best of the year.",,Anonymous,Mystery
How have I not watched this?,Add a bit of ET. And Close Encounters. And Alien. And a few dashes of Night of the Living Dead. Plus a couple of pinches of The Thing. Mix it until thoroughly blended.

"No E.T., But Still Good","The subject and people behind ""Super 8"" made me look forward to it very much. I was hoping that it would be like ""E.T."" and other Steven Spielberg movies. After seeing it, I don't think that its quality matches ""E.T."", but it's still good. ""Super 8"" is directed by J.J. Abrams, and co-produced by Steven Spielberg. It is science fiction, and it has a decent sense of adventure. One of the reasons why I like ""E.T."" better is that some of this movie's scenes were too loud and chaotic. The bike chase at the end of ""E.T."" is thrilling, and one of the reasons why is because there's just the right amount of things going on that you really get involved with what's happening to the characters. Sometimes ""Super 8"" contained too much chaos. Michael Giacchino (""Star Trek"",""Up"")composed the music, so it was pretty good, although I wish the movie had a recognizable theme. With a few exceptions, not many movies these days have musical themes. The suspense was good, and the acting wasn't bad. I think that the movie lacked a good chase scene, which would have made it more fun. Overall, I liked it, and I guess if I were asked, I would see it again.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Stale.,"Tt was like gauging on rusk. You keep on going, but uncomfortably too soon toward the end, you realise it's all the same.Take away the monsters and kids it's a tacky self effacing nod to a 'film' no one really cares too much about. But a blockbuster?The plot is too thin for microwave use. I was bored by the 'cruelly treated alien from halfway and utterly disappointed by the lack of plot twist 'at any point'.No acting that I could discern was less than superb. The direction (such as it was pointed) was superb. Most was superb other than the overall product.The soundtrack was excellent.5/10.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Very entertaining!,"JJ and Spielberg deliver a master piece! The story contains so many different emotions, from sad parts to crazy action and thriller. I really love the mystery between the cops and the US Navy. I feel like every piece of the film was a mystery, till the end when everything came together. Also, as a filmmaker, I loved how this group of boys wants to create movies and they use whatever they have on hand. They luck out with some pretty sick locations due to the crazy events that occur in their town. There are some scenes in the film that made me instantly think of Jurassic Park, which is pretty cool. The VFX and cinematography looked great considering it's from 2011. I'm not giving it a 10 because I have some unanswered questions and because the ending wasn't great. I feel like the ending should have been longer. I definitely recommend this film to anyone that wants to be entertained with action, explosions, and thriller.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of Abrams' Best Films,"After having watched this film, I can't say that I really have a whole lot of issues with it. Much of the film is pretty flawless in my eyes. The child actors are great, some of whom have gone on to have big careers, there is some really clever humor in the film, while also being able to remain serious and intense, and the plot of the film itself is so well executed, and does a good job at putting some clever spins on what would normally be considered to be a pretty basic plot. The two biggest stars to come out of this film were Joel Courtney, and Elle Fanning, and they also happen to be the two main characters. Courtney went on to star in the Netflix film series The Kissing Booth, which is among their more popular films, while Fanning went on to star in films such as, The Beguiled, Maleficent, and All The Bright Places, just to name a few. This film also happens to star one of my favorite actors, Kyle Chandler, who is best known for his role in the TV show Friday Night Lights. He plays the father in this film, and definitely does a great job like he always does. One other thing worth pointing out is that this film is directed by J.J. Abrams, who is known for directing several other installments in massive science fiction franchises. He has directed two of the newer Star Trek films, as well as two of the newer Star Wars films. He has also directed one of the Mission Impossible films, so he has quite a track record. He has also been a producer on over seventy other projects, however I think that this film is one of his best works, and is definitely a great hidden gem.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Derivative, but still really good","J.J. Abrams aims to make an homage to Spielberg (who co-produced) in this summer blockbuster. The homaging is pretty rampant, and you'll catch references not just to Spileberg's films (mostly Close Encounters, E.T. and The Goonies, which he produced), but to Carpenter's The Thing, Romero's The Crazies and Night of the Living Dead, Bong's The Host and Abrams' own Cloverfield (which he produced and co-wrote). All of this can make the film, at times, seem derivative, but, amazingly, it mostly works. The reason is the cast. The protagonists are a group of kids who are making a film. Newcomer Joel Courtney is the son of a local deputy (Kyle Chandler). Elle Fanning is the slightly older girl who is newly joining the group as the film's star (of course, she becomes Chandler's love interest). The other kids are played by Riley Griffiths, Gabriel Basso, Zach Mills and Ryan Lee (particularly memorable as the kid obsessed with explosives). While they're filming their zombie movie, they witness a horrific train derailment that releases something mysterious into their small Ohio town. The air force (led by Noah Emmerich) arrives shortly thereafter to investigate the weird goings-on which are disrupting the town. The film is nothing original, but those kids are so wonderful they make the film thoroughly enjoyable. Abrams also knows how to build a set-piece, although, occasionally, he goes over the top. The film is funny when it needs to be, and it can be very scary at times, too. This is certainly a very enjoyable time at the movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Disappointing, plain, predictable story","I expected a lot more from an Abrams film. Maybe that was my problem.Anyone who has seen Abrams' other movies or TV shows knows what to expect. Twist endings every episode, surprise character revelations and cliff hangers. Super 8 delivered absolutely none of that, instead replacing it with a very normal, predictable ending that most people will figure out after a short time into the film.The movie tries to pull off what Cloverfield did: an obscured, unidentified alien that nobody sees and lives to tell about. However, it falls flat on it's face for two reasons; this time, the alien has an agenda instead of just being on a rampage, and the military proves to be a much bigger threat than the monster does.Another gripe is that - and this surprised me, because, again, an Abrams movie - were plot holes you could drive trucks through (or, in this case, trains). For the sake of not having this tagged as containing spoilers, I won't go into detail, but I'll just say they are obvious if you think about it after the movie.However, the children were (mostly) interesting characters that I liked. Other than the ""lead"" character, all of them had quirky little problems that made them fun to listen to and watch. In addition, all the children are amazing actors and I look forward to seeing them in better movies sometime down the line.I understand that this movie is less about the monster, more about the characters but that doesn't save it because the actual development behind the characters is boring and as predictable as the monster plot.Overall, I was disappointed. The plot lacked any real substance that mattered and beneath all the hype and speculation was a plain alien movie that everyone has seen before. Definitely not Abram's proudest moment, and anyone expecting to enter Super 8 and find the usual things that Abrams brings to a movie will be extremely unsatisfied.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Reawakens the nostalgia of classic Spielberg.,"This movie's got my heartbeat running away. Beating like a drum, and it's coming your way. Can't you hear that.Boom ba-doom-boom. Boom ba-doom-boom, baby. Super 8. Boom ba-doom-boom. Boom ba-doom-boom, baby. Super 8.Now that that little tick is out of my system, let's get to the review.Super 8, writer/director J.J. Abrams' nostalgic love letter to vintage Spielberg, centers on a young boy named Joe (Played by Joel Courtney), who has recently lost his dear mother, and has a rocky relationship with his father, the local police deputy (Played by Kyle Chandler). He's part of a group of kids filming a home zombie movie to enter into a local contest. But their plans go awry when a mysterious train crash occurs, and the local government is sent in to keep things quiet. Eventually, disappearances happen across town, the culprit being a creature that barely anyone knows about.Abrams is very gleeful in the way he integrates these old styles of storytelling. And while the format is basic, he makes up for that with how he uses those elements. He likes to sprinkle in bits of humor and action, but the one thing I praise him for most is that he doesn't lose his focus. He makes sure there's a strong, beating heart beneath the surface. It's also worth noting that the movie's ending is the best ending I've seen all year, so far.What about the cast? They are exceptional. The teen actors and adult actors are quite good. Joel Courtney gives a very nuanced, quietly emotional performance as Joe, especially when acting alongside Joe's love interest, Alice, played gently, and terrifically by Elle Fanning. The chemistry between these two put the adorable rating off the charts.Technically, the film is also very well designed. The editing by Mary Jo Markey and Maryann Brandon is right on the nose, and the VFX of Industrial Light ad Magic are quite lively. I have even higher praise for the sound. I was quite thrilled by the work of my two absolute favorite sound designers, the legendary Ben Burtt and Gary Rydstrom, and Michael Giacchino's John Williams/Jerry Goldsmith influenced score is enough to make one's heart soar.All in all, Super 8 is a wonderful experience, and I give it ***1/2 out of ****",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A fun and enjoyable throwback to old 80's movies with a CGI injection,"Do you remember your childhood? Carefree days spent with your friends, sleepovers, using inappropriate language when you really should know better and, in the case of Super 8, fending off an alien invasion with your mates.Super 8 is J.J Abrams' first attempt at a non-franchise movie. After cutting his teeth with the excellent Mission Impossible 3 and introducing Star Trek to the younger generation, Abrams was given the chance to make a film that was much more personal to him, and it shines through.The plot deals with a group of young friends who are trying to finish their movie during the summer holidays. Whilst shooting a pivotal scene, the boys (and girl) are witness to one of the most spectacular train crashes ever committed to film, with the remainder of the movie dealing with the mysterious cargo aboard. It would be an unfair spoiler to divulge the rest of the story, suffice it to say that Abrams manages to weave a compelling, but not entirely flawless, monster movie.At the time of its release, Abrams made no secret of his admiration for Steven Spielberg, even going so far as to bring him on board as producer, and so it comes as no surprise that Super 8 often feels like an homage to classics like E.T and Close Encounters Of The Third Kind. There are a number of Spielbergian traits such as the absent father, the story told from a kid's perspective and the tantalising glimpses of the train's cargo, all contributing to a stellar first half.Unfortunately, the wheels come off a little once the cargo is revealed. Abrams sacrifices character development for blockbuster thrills and, on more than one occasion, potential pitfalls are sidestepped just a little too easily. In the end, it feels like a hybrid of two very different movies. On the one hand, we have a nostalgic coming of age tale and on the other, an old fashioned monster movie. It doesn't quite manage to merge the two genres into a unique whole, but it does offer some truly outstanding visuals (the train crash being a particular highlight), one or two tear jerking moments and, in the case of the kids, the most enjoyable gang of adolescents since Stand By Me.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Other reviews have said it all.....,"this is basically Goonies meets ET. The film centers around several young teens whom are making a zombie movie and witness a train wreck and accidentally capture some amazing video footage. The military comes in to clean up the train wreck and soon overtakes the town. Also weird things start to happen in the town, like all the dogs run away and microwaves and car engines go missing.The kids know the man whom caused the wreck because he was one of their teachers (BTW how did the teacher survive that, it wouldn't be possible). They find these old videos he had stashed that tell the whole story and what they are up against. So, it's up to them to save one of their own.One thing I didn't get is when the kids are running through the neighborhood, what are all those tanks shooting at. Too much was going on in those scenes.FINAL VERDICT: OK, but not really good enough to recommend.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Another hit for J.J. Abrams,"There are lots of great reviews for this film, so I'm not going to say much. I suspect that everyone has compared it to E.T., and that's very true -- even in the scariest places, Abrams has managed to infuse both the sweetness and humor.However, I have a hint for those of you who haven't seen it (and perhaps some who have). Find a copy of the _original_ version of Close Encounters and watch it carefully. It's worth it for the small homage that Abrams has included to that wonderful film. Just sayin'.I think that Abrams has become a worthy successor to Steven Spielberg, something which we've increasingly needed as Spielberg has turned more toward production and mentoring younger directors. However, I hope that these two continue collaborating for a long time to come.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

There is only one J.J. Abrams!,"Super 8 was one of the most anticipated films of 2011 but like with any film with high exception there is the risk becoming a major disappointment. Luckily it delivered and is both a highly entertaining film and has a heart.Set in the late 1970s in the town of a Lillian, Ohio, Joe Lamb (Joel Courntney) is a 13-year-old boy whom mother dies in a work place accident. His father (Kyle Chandler) is the Deputy Sheriff of the town and obviously struggling with the lost of his wife and having to care for his son. Joe's friend Charles (Riley Griffiths) is directing a zombie film, wanting to ever it into a film festival. Joe helps his friend and one night they film at a train station with Alice Dainard (Elle Franning) and the rest of their crew when a truck drives into a train and derails it. Quickly strange things happens in the town; dogs runaway, people disappear and there are power cuts. The military rolls into town. But whilst all this goes on the teens attempt to complete their film and Joe and Alice become closer.J.J. Abrams is a highly skilled writer and director and modelled his career on Steven Spielberg, not a bad model. But unlike say M. Night Shyamalan who did the same thing Abrams is able to vary his style. Whilst Super 8 is an entertaining, first pace film, Abrams made sure that the family and human drama was central to his film. We got to know his characters and their issues. We basically see the mystery and the events through the eyes of children and original people some unusual is happening. Some critics have compared Super 8 to Spielberg's early films, which makes sense because of his influence on the director and produced it, but I personally was reminded by of Stephen King stories, a group of original kids who get cause in some extraordinary event. There was fast paced action, the train clash was a really well made sequence, but the social drama was also interesting, whether it was Joe and his father having to face up to their relationship, the investigation by the police or Joe and Alice's budding relationship.Abrams was able to make his film a success without the need to cast big name actors. His young cast were skilled and natural, they actually felt like they were ordinary kids, not what some Hollywood hack thinks what they are like. They are made out to be individuals, they are slightly nerdy but Abrams avoided the clichés of cliques and bullies. The adults too are made out to be normal, ordinary people trying to cope with their domestic issues and affects on their communities.Super 8 is not perfect, there is a bit too much comic relief involving the characters for its own good and there are a few clichés: but it still a whether movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Super Bad,"A group of stereotypical teenagers accidentally discovers something really bad. Although directed by Abrams, it has all the earmarks of a Spielberg film, as it is focused on kids in peril and borrows bits and pieces from the likes of ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" ""The Goonies,"" and ""E.T."" Abrams shows that he can match Spielberg when it comes to mind-numbingly stupid movies. The film starts off as merely bad but ends up being utterly ridiculous. Apparently the alien here is not of the friendly variety from ""Close Encounters"" and ""E.T.,"" as this one sucks electricity out of the town, kills people, causes dogs to go bonkers, and causes stuff to explode.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Turns dumber and more pretentious the closer to the finish-line it gets,"J. J. Abrams takes us vividly back to a colourful and enticing small-town 1970s in the opening part of his film Super 8 - a fascinating coming-off-age drama and nostalgia trip which, too soon and too relentlessly, mutates into an insipid monster sci-fi with all of that genre's most hackneyed plot elements and developments. Despite the fact that he has written some great characters and reminisces about teenage life in such impressive fashion that it could and should have been the basis for a fine film, Abrams eventually falls into the same trap as so many American genre films of later years has; trading his film's real qualities for genre-bound noise and violence. The intention was possibly to satisfy studio demands by making sure his younger audience would be impressed by all the effects. Or perhaps he just didn't have any more creativity or subtleness left in his bag and had to borrow the spirit and ending from his producer Steven Spielberg's thirty year old classic E. T.Regardless, Super 8 turns dumber and more pretentious the closer to the finish-line it gets, and Michael Giacchino's overly pompous musical score is like a chewy piece of meat which becomes more and more impossible to swallow. And as if that wasn't enough, the neverending concluding scene turns out to be one of the most vainglorious of its kind on this side of The Return of the King. The warm and insightful acting by the kids and some really fun moments are what upholds this loose cannon of a could-have-been.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Enough unique elements to make it a must see but not enough to make it a classic,"Super 8 (2011) is a JJ Abrams gem that I originally saw in theatres, is in my DVD collection and that I recently rewatched on HBOMAX. The storyline follows a group of kids in the Midwest filming a horror movie. One night while filming a big scene a train 🚂 crashes and something escapes. They feel responsible for the accident so they don't tell anyone what they saw but when animals and people start disappearing around town they feel they should figure out what is behind the disappearances.As previously referenced this movie is written and directed by JJ Abrams (Lost) and stars Elle Fanning (The Neon Demon), AJ Michalka (The Lovely Bones), Kyle Chandler (Argo), Jessica Tuck (True Blood), Ron Eldard (Drop Dead Fred) and Glynn Turman (Cooley High).This movie has a classic Steven Spielberg/Stranger Things feel to it with teenage coming of age elements where you're almost bought more into the characters and their sub plots than the main storyline. The family dynamics are well established and fairly sad. The special effects are out of this world, especially the train crash scene. The military sequences are well executed also. However, a lot of this movie was too dark for me and the creature was just okay. I will give this credit for having a solid ending and the overall execution is worthwhile.Overall, this is a solid addition to the science fiction genre that has enough unique elements to make it a must see but not enough to make it a classic. I would score this a solid 7.5-8/10 and strongly recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A Nice Throwback to Spielberg!,"Super 8, which have been kept secretly under wraps until it's release date, shows why J.J Abrams is a master director with talent. He knows how to tell an effective story in blockbuster format and has a good use for special effects. In this particular story, I loved how he used tension and how he kept the audience guessing on what kind of monster we will be seeing. This reminded me of 2008's Cloverfield which was set up almost the same way.This film is about a group of kids who are filming a movie on location near railroad tracks. They happen to witness a disastrous train wreck which leads to the involvement of the Army. Now this Ohio town and residents will begin to see strange things happening. What could this be?The cast is not well-known but they all do a great job. Elle Fanning, the younger sister of Dakota, really brought herself to the eyes of the public. Kyle Chandler is also good as the town's cop who wants answers.Overall, this is a well-made throwback or homage to the early Spielberg classics. I got a sense of E.T, Close Encounters, and the Goonies while watching this film. This film has some good action, a very realistic train crash scene, and surprisingly some comedy. Despite all that, I was slightly let down. I was expecting this film to be a 10/10 film based on what everyone has been telling me. I don't think it's that good but it's just a good summer blockbuster. I rate this film 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great Movie!!!!!,"Having just come from watching Transformers which was supposed to be the summer blockbuster I appreciate super 8 even more now.There was great acting by very young actors, a great story within the story and a real connection to the creature in this film. At the end you were rooting for the alien which means that through the film the audience was able to attach emotionally.I found the main characters to be funny but perhaps too brave for their age since, given the somewhat introverted personality of the lead he continued to show a lot more resolve and grit that would be expected from a 10/11 year old boy who makes model trains and does make up ...Very little to criticise on this film ...

JJ Abrams's Metafictional Ourobouros,"Bear with me, because this might get complicated.""Super 8"" is a film by JJ Abrams, the director of all those forgettable Star Wars and Mission Impossible movies. It's about a group of kids in a small town in 1970-something who witness some strange shenanigans involving a train wreck, a monster, and sinister military operations.The kids are making their own movie, with a Super 8 camera, a fan-film apparently inspired by George Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead."" In this fan-film, or film-within-a-film, the kids play adults, as kids do when they shoot their own movies. They deliver stilted, implausible dialogue while ostensibly behaving like grown-ups.But ""Super 8"" is itself a fan-film, one made by JJ Abrams and clearly inspired by the early work of Steven Spielberg -- ""Close Encounters"" and ""E. T."" in particular. The kids in Abrams's movie also seem to be playing adults: they deliver stilted, implausible dialogue, and pretend to act like grown-ups, all the while carrying on the illusion of making their film-within-a-film.It's hard to say whether this tail-eating act of nostalgia was intentional. If it was, it's a triumph of metafiction, an homage to movie-making and cinema magic. If it wasn't, it's just a clumsy reflection of JJ's childhood favorites, rife with bad dialogue, obnoxious lens flare, and manipulative editing. The child actors, Elle Fanning among them, are more like stand-ins for characters in a Spielberg movie, rather than actual children.Perhaps, in the not-too-distant future, the next generation of filmmakers, inspired by ""Super 8"", will make their own referential paean to the early work of JJ Abrams: a movie about adults making a movie about children who are making a movie about grown-ups who will all, hopefully, be eaten by zombies.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Too Mature for Kids, Too Childish for Adults","First of all, I was impressed by the acting of the kids in this movie. Simply amazing. However, everything else left me less-than-impressed.The plot was one-dimensional and predictable. The directing was predictable...in the sense that by the use of sound and camera angles you knew what was coming because it has been done so many times before.The premise of the film was suitable for children, and it would have been a great kids' movie if it weren't for the unnecessary mature language and themes.But the intense scenes and action aren't enough to hold an adult's attention, so there is a very narrow demographic that would enjoy this film.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Especially Great for Spielberg Fans & Baby Boomers!,"It's rare that a film comes along about kids and has a science fiction touch yet communicates the joys and the frustrations of growing up than Super 8.Super 8 was apparently billed as a disaster film with aliens, etc. In truth, it's not about the alien at all. It's about kids growing up in a rural town, trying to do something special with themselves.My Impressions: The film starts out with a funeral. A child loses his mother early on. A man comes over and is immediately thrown out of the house! Right here you wonder what the heck is going on! We find out soon enough. I think I found the story within the story of what Abrams was trying to do. It's semi-autobiographical. Spielberg and Abrams were both into making films as kids and it stuck.The actual filmmaking was fun to see: they set up with funky scripts, a zombie who just would not stay dead, and a kid who wanted ""production value"" in all his shots! However, a train wreck, a fallen camera and an Area 51 scientist who also happened to be their science teacher changed all that.The train wreck special effects were amazing and horrific. The look on the love-struck kid when he thought Alice was dead was heart-touching.Favorite Scenes: Father's Faith: Without giving too much away, our hero discovers a film that was made with his mother when he was growing up. Alice sits with him in his room as the power comes on. The scenes project and Alice begins to cry, realizing that if her father took that shift at the steel mill that day, the tragic accident that took his mother ""should have"" taken her father.The theme of dysfunctional parents that actually do love their children and overcoming that dysfunctional was great to see.Amateur Horror Film: During the credits we actually get to see the full film that the kids were making, right down to the pipe and the armchair, the zombie and the chemical plant, etc. Fun to watch! I actually did something like this myself when I was 17 or so.Music! The memories of the late 70s came back to me. The music and the excitement are really great.Hackneyed Themes: Yes there were some ""I've seen this before"" themes of government abuse, secrets, abducting the alien (!), it escapes, the misunderstood scientist, the innocent children that make it right while the adults are clueless.But it's HOW Abrams and Spielberg put these themes together, with a few twists (the fathers' involvement) and the success these filmmakers did in recreating the time period, the attitudes, the 1950s horror alien invasion Grade B style, that makes this film so charming.Bottom Line: There are some scenes where the kids swear like truck drivers; it's not a lot but parents should know. Highly recommend this film, especially for those who grew up in the 70s, enjoyed Journey and Blondie, and loved the film E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial. The trailers make believe this film is a typical invasion story. That's done on purpose. It's a coming of age story that is charming in its execution. Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"No Ella Fanning, and the movie could be just unbearable!","I'll be brief on this. Super 8 starts very promising, introduces the characters and their relationship very well, and then starts going down a hill from the moment the famous train scene takes place; and this is what frustrates you even more than all those several clichés that Mr.Abrams cooks for you throughout the whole length of the movie. With such a descending trend, you could rightfully expect to see a lame predictable ending where the bad guys would die and the killer monsters would probably become the victims of society and get the freedom they are deserved! oh my oh! I don't remember any other movie like that before!However, I should admit that one absolutely positive point of the movie is Elle Fanning's acting which blew my mind, and made me reconsider my initially very low rate for this movie. She plays the role of the Alice so hilariously that I completely forgot she was 13 (younger when she was casted for the film apparently) I'm so sure that during the next decade there'll be at least one real young superstar left in Hollywood whose films are worth watching just because of her act; same for her older sister, hopefully. Other casts are just OK. the boys manage to present their characters believable and funny enough that you could ignore all the scenario problems. Kyle Chandler which has always been my favorite actor, plays the role of Joe's father, and as I said earlier, like others, has managed to present this character very well. A recently widowed husband who has a bit of problems handling his wife's death. But unfortunately, as the movies goes forward/downward, Chandler's efforts to keep the strong act becomes pale and useless. The visual effects are not bad, but not outstanding either. In fact, at some point, you feel that you're being fed with just too much of it. There were moments that I absolutely had no idea why there were massive explosions, and heavy destruction. The only reason could be that they wanted to heat up their lame story through the use of stupid noisy distractions until the director would come up with his next spontaneous idea! could it be anything else? I doubt so!Some say that the ending was so moving that it made them cry. Well, I'd say I could cry there with them too, but not because of my emotional state, but because of such a lame way the movie wound up, and that you still can find people out there giving 10 out of 10 for it. Not to be judgmental, but how do they spend their time watching movies at all?!",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
This Is What We Go To The Movies For!,"When I went to see Super 8 I had pretty high expextations for this movie. Sitting in the theater I felt like I was watching one of Steven Spielberg's classics, like E.T., etc. The movie is fast paced, intense, and nostalgic but still managed to stay on topic. The movie was sprinkled with heartfelt moments. It shows the bonds of family and friendship. Leaving the film I had the story stuck in my head and for the next week I couldn't get it off my mind. So finally I made the decision to go see it again. Watching it for the second time I loved it even more. Films like this show that the movie industry hasn't lost its touch, no matter how many remakes it produces. Steven Spielberg and J.J. Abrams are the few directors that still make movies that mean something to the audience. This is a movie I will be buying.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great couple of hours,"What a good film. Just started watching it at random on TV, and thought it was great. Went in with no prior knowledge and found the next two hours to be great entertainment. Could perhaps be say 10-15 minutes shorter in length, but no major issues there. It's a really good cast (if you're a fan of playing the game where do I know them from). Fairly original premise with good effects, good acting performance, even from the younger cast members.Generally I'd recommend this if you have a couple of hours spare.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Started well but fizzled out,"I thought this film got off to a great start, but the more it went on, the more my attention dwindled. I was more interested in the kids making their short film than I was all the military and alien stuff, when it started to get heavy on all that that's when I started losing interest, because all that nonsense has been done to death.

Boring and slow paced .. repeated story,"Wow, what a mess !! I was really expecting much much more from J.J Abrams and Spielberg, instead, i was slammed in the face with this awful film.So where do i begin ? the story ? nothing original here what so ever, and i understand that they meant to bring us back to the old days, but even then they should have had to invent something new to add to the story. some people in here are happy that it is so like E.T !! but does that really make it a good movie ? if we really want E.T, why not just make a sequel ? and if i really want to go back and enjoy the old movie days, i can always visit them on DVD, i could just watch E.T on DVD. Don't get me wrong, i would love to see something that brings back the old movie making style, but i want that to be executed better with a touch of originality.in short, a group of kids witness a train wreck, after which something mysterious is unleashed and is terrorizing the small town. meanwhile, we have the kids themselves struggling with their own family problems and relations.."" Sigh "" .. very slow paced, boring for the most part and filled with cliché characters, moments and scenes. the kids do a decent job in acting, but i gotta blame the bad writing in making such cliché characters, and typical over-acted relations. I never connected with the Parent-child relationships here, i never felt it. however, i did feel for the love and admiration created between Joe and ALice.they tried to make an adventure type of film with thrills, something like the Goonies, but i just didn't feel the tension or thrills. typical tension arising scenes like when a trapped door won't open, or when a lighter is not igniting are a bit cheap for the smart movie goers nowadays. one scene where the kids running in the middle of the suburbia during a heavy military firing was meaningless, had no point other than trying to create and adventure type of scene, but really was ridiculous and out of context.classic jump of your seat moments were frequent here, and were pretty predictable and lame, however, i did see a couple of senior people watching jump during these scenes, but is that the target audience for this movie ? while i was watching, i tried to figure out who is this film meant to be for ? i guess they were probably thinking a Horror film for kids and seniors.Another big problem with this movie, was the sound effects, it was loud, a bit too loud !! i mean i love it when the movie theater shakes during action scenes and so on, but here, they seemed to have crossed the limits on how loud they can go, it was really too loud it was annoying and uncomfortable.there were also other problems involving the plot, but i won't go through them so i won't ruin or spoil the movie for others, although, i gotta say you are not missing anything if you give this one a skip.the fact that JJ Abrams and Spielberg are behind this movie was a shock to me, i really can't wrap my head around this fact, sorry guys but you really screwed up here, i was waiting for some surprise, a twist, something to shock me at the end..but it never happened and this ended up a slow paced, boring, familiar story with cliché characters, that I'm sorry to say, i won't recommend to anyone.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
THE summer-blockbuster I was waiting for,"Seeing that there has been such an amount of really lazy dumba** movies this summer I was so happy watching Super 8 last night. I don't know where to start, to make a long story short: It's awesome, it's a really great film, has a lot of heart (you definitely feel this was a production by Spielberg and Abraham's)the child actors are unbelievable totally fantastic. (Funny that Spielberg has a talent for finding good child actors) The story is typically Spielberg story, I know it's by Abrahams but it has so much of an old nostalgic Spielberg movie, you don't have to like it but I loved it. Maybe the ending NO SPOILERS was a bit rushed but overall it was a great adventure.So yeah by chance go to the cinema and check that movie out. Won't regret it.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Original? Not really. Captivating? Yes!,"I went into Super 8 knowing that the reviews were pretty good, but that most people didn't like the ending. I didn't see much wrong with it,but I'll go into that later. Overall, I was highly entertained by this movie--the atmosphere it sets is one of growing up in the late 1970s, and I found myself being nostalgic for an era where I wasn't even born yet.The plot, if you've seen the classic sci-fi films of the 1970s and 80s,isn't that original. However, I haven't seen those movies, or at least not many of them, so I thought the plot was good enough, although there were a few clichés, but that's almost expected in movies today.This movie, though, really isn't about the plot, it's about the characters, and on that note, it deserves a perfect score. The characters pull you into this movie--they are so believable in the way that they act around each other and in the situations they are faced with throughout the movie. The actors did a wonderful job, too. Joel Courtney was great, as was Riley Griffiths, especially considering it was both of their first times acting in a movie. They were both able to get into their character's persona well, and it really came through. The best performance, however, hands-down belongs to Elle Fanning, who conveyed so much emotion as the girl needing an escape from her alcoholic father. Often times with only a few lines, or even just a single glance, she was able to bring so much to the screen, that she definitely stole all the scenes she was in.Now, about the ending. I personally didn't think it was a let down, but you have to fully understand the fact that this movie was never about the alien/monster to begin with--that was just something for them to react to, something around which they could attach all their emotions and feelings. So, in essence, the ending is obsolete: it is about the characters and what they do along the way to get to the ending. In some movies, the ending is a huge surprise and it is supposed to leave you thinking, and I believe this is what many people were expecting, seeing as this was written by J.J. Abrams, but this is just not one of those movies.Still, it was highly entertaining, especially the dialogue between the children, not to mention the incredible sound and special effects, as well as the enthralling and, at times, tender score by Michael Giacchino. Overall, I'd say it was one of the best movies of 2011.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"A Sci-Fi, Mystery, Thriller done right for a change","J.J. Abrams and Steve Spielberg melded minds to create a movie sci-fi movie that is watchable once again. This one was done wonderfully. Today we have way to many hack directors out there doing these ""Found Footage"" crap, and I could see with a title like ""Super 8"" another dimwit would attempt it. Thankfully they decided to make a real movie instead. There was a youthful wonder element of the movie, and evolving drama of realities of life, and some mystery government activity.They did a great job of hiding the ""Mysterious forces"" until it was necessary and didn't overdue it. Thumbs up to the Big Guy's (Speilberg and Abrams) You made watching a little bit of a sci-fi movie watchable. All other directors out there need to be taking notes.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Was wishing for magic, got mag.....","The Short: Extremely engaging, a solve the mystery as it happens style story, brilliant action scenes, massive production value, and just an overall excellent story.The bad: One actor is just there for comedic effect, despite being a somewhat major character, and certain minor elements are a stretch.The Full Review:Abrams is the new king of Sci-Fi. I felt this way after I saw Star Trek, but now it is official. I connected with my inner 12 year old after Super 8.Super 8 is unlike anything in recent memory because of the fact that it succeeds in being original. It just doesn't start out with ambitions of being great, like most summer films. It develops so well and is told in such a masterful way that it truly succeeds in being one of the most engaging films ever.The cast is fantastic. It is filled with a colorful characters, all of whom are very likable and have great moments (except the shop salesman). Abrams utilizes a great cast of kid actors that truly stand out from other films. The relationships between these characters grow more and more, and there are some truly some surprising performances from the actors.What makes Super 8 so entertaining is the way Abrams blends different film techniques that truly connect with audience. Abrams uses a perfect combination of dialogue and story, which connects so well with the audience, and huge, explosive (did I mention huge?) action moments to blow your face off. The sound is big, and the action is bigger, and there are some excellent scares to be had.Some elements aren't explained enough and they lose their effect (specifically the dogs) but other than a forced performance and the dogs, Super 8 concludes in an excellent way, and everything connects perfectly. If you pass up Super 8, for whatever reason, you are missing an excellent film. Whether you like Sci-Fi or not, Super 8 is original Science Fiction at its best. The storytelling follows in the footsteps of the legendary Steven Spielberg (who actually co- produced Super 8) and the action is Abrams-branded and kicked into high gear. It is absolutely entertaining and is thought provoking at the same time. Which is a Super reason to love Super 8.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Soon to be Classic,"""Super 8"", directed by J.J. Abrams, the man at the head of such projects as the recent ""Star Trek"". Anyone who saw the trailer for this film were drawn by the mysterious tone of it, giving off the appearance of the next E.T. What a coincidence, guess who produced it? Speaking of which, that's probably the best way to describe it; a combination of ""The Goonies"" and ""E.T."", with hints of that other movie Abrams was behind""Cloverfield"". I am no fan of thatokay movie, but don't worry this one is not shot in that annoying ""found bullsh*t footage"" manner. It's just that I suppose the premise is somewhat similar.The joy of it all is the acting is quite well done. Joel Courtney, Elle Fanning, and Riley Griffiths all do incredible jobs cementing the characters in our hearts. Kyle Chandler is also great, as well as Bruce Greenwood. I don't want to reveal too much about the story, seeing as that's the key to enjoying this particular movie. In terms of drama, comedy and action, as well as mystique, I believe they hit a really good balance and the film has a vintage sheen to it. I would definitely rate this film an A.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Fantastic, thrilling, emotional ride","Abrams keeps getting better each time. He really recaptures some of the old Hollywood magic in this film. And by Hollywood magic, I don't mean fancypants fx and glamorous arrogant actors. I mean the storytelling style that Spielberg made famous, that truly imparts a sense of thrills, excitement, and a sense of wonder to the audience. Where he surpasses Spielberg is in the sentimental relationship development of his characters and their ties to the storyline and the action, and Spielberg's no slouch in that department. Where he falls slightly short, is in a conclusive thrilling ending that ties in well to the rest of the story and to the characters. Still the ride was a fantastic, emotive experience and should be a lesson to other contemporary filmmakers (unfortunately the majority) who go for cheap, lazy, and simple gimmicks rather than an innovative or genuine investment in the story and characters.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

ET Just Went Hardcore,"If you combine the creative mind of J.J. Abrams with the great Steven Spielberg, you'll get a pretty unique, entertaining alien film that can be quite enjoyable to all. I completely lost interest in alien films, but this film really brought back that interest that I lost, and grabbed my attention by bringing an exciting and entertaining film. The film is not childish in any sort of way and focused very well on these children. You follow these children as they go through this crisis while filming their movie, and being involved with these crazy events that occur. You get enough character depth to care about these characters and somehow relate to any of these kids. The movie has this ""Goonies"" vibe to it, as you can't hate the characters and you know that this film will present an awesome adventure. Everything was just well paced and didn't lose track of anything; the film had heart and it worked out pretty well.Personally, I find it hard to not even get thrilled while watching some of these scenes. J.J. knows how to keep the audience excited and that is what he does in this film. You will definitely be up for a fun ride as what you see is quite enjoyable to watch and does bring in the thrill that made this film significant. When hell breaks loose, that's when the excitement kicks in; explosions everywhere, carnage from left to right, and thrills that made this a fun ride. My jaws dropped during these scenes, especially during the train crash as I was just blown away with that event. There are plenty of special effects and CGI used, but this really helped bring in the excitement factor that this film perfectly portrayed.Director J.J. Abrams somehow does a good job of keeping the audience in suspense as he will not reveal something important until the end; that is how you will feel in this film. If you have watched ""Cloverfield,"" or J.J.'s famous TV series ""Lost,"" then you know that you are up for a few surprises as the film tends to keep the appearance and information about the monster a secret. Strange occurrences are occurring in this small town and everything gets out of control; you will simply be sucked into the story, wondering what is going on and why these things are occurring at the same time. You will only get a few glimpse of the monster and will not be able to see the monster as a whole until the end of the film. People maybe frustrated by this, but I thought it boosted the interest as you will keep wondering to yourself about this creature. I really liked the creativity that J.J. does with his work and the monster looked pretty awesome; as a fan of monster films, I really liked how this monster looked.Personally, when I see kids cuss on screen, it feels like it was used to surprise and make the audience laugh, seeing that a young 5 year old child is cussing. However, when it comes to this film, I really didn't mind about these kids cursing like crazy. The dialogue works really well in this film and I actually liked the conversations that these kids have. The kids are all different, having different characteristics, likable, and relatable. Thinking real hard, I am possibly the fat kid because of how he acts and actually picturing myself acting that way during a crisis like that. My good friends are filmmakers and watching these kids reminds me of the good old times of us filming our own film. The acting is pretty good in this, especially coming from the kids. I was never annoyed by their existence in the film and actually liked their performances. All of the kids were great, but I have to say that the best is possibly Joel Courtney as the cops son and Elle Fanning. Both were just fantastic in this film and really liked, both of their acting and the characters they portrayed. All of the other cast members were actually pretty good and really liked the performances from everyone.Two great minds helped made an alien movie that delivers a great fun ride, likable characters, a very good storyline, and a mystery behind this monster that will slowly reveal itself, keeping you wondering about this being.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Super 8 (2011) - A Breathtaking Sci-Fi Spielberg Tribute!,"Written and directed by J.J. Abrams, accompanied by producer Steven Spielberg, ""Super 8"" is a sci-fi thriller about creatures from the unknown. But at it's heart, it's a movie about forgetting the terms of the past, and growing up. Set in the late 70s, the movie is about a group of kids who experience a deadly train crash while filming a movie on a Super 8 camera. Then, when something breaks out of the train, none of the children has any idea of what has just emerged. Then, the city experiences unexpected disappearances, a power outage, and missing dogs. For all we know, that thing could be an alien. ""Super 8"" is a classic tribute to Steven Spielberg's classic sci-fi flicks like ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and ""E.T."". Every moment feels like watching a classic nostalgic sci-fi. This is a thrilling, suspenseful, and masterfully accomplished film, directed beautifully by J.J. Abrams. Every moment kept me on the edge of my seat, because I was entertained by the heartbreaking drama, suspenseful action, and all the amazing special effects, music, and sound. The performances by the young cast including Joel Courtney, Elle Fanning, and Riley Griffiths were all just special, when they do things that any adult actor would do. From their feelings of freaking out, and their inappropriate swearing, they make this movie stand out for what it really is. The only problem with the film was it's cheesy ending. It was disappointing, that it felt like it was too quick to end the movie already, and it's really silly. The rest of ""Super 8"" is crystal clear perfect. This is a spectacular film, and it's one of the best of 2011. The young performances, the special effects, the classic storyline, and that Spielberg touch helps make a classic sci-fi. ""Super 8"", in my review, ""a thrilling tribute of Spielberg sci-fi"".",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Even better second time around...,"A very well made film with likable characters, some neat CGI and some very clever effects. As I've already said, I can see what J.J. Abrams was aiming at, and that is the Spielberg films of the late 70's to the early 80's. Films like Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial (1982) and even the Spielberg-produced, The Goonies (1985). Unfortunately this doesn't have the warmth or the magic of those films, but it is still a worthy effort. Going back to the middle third of the film, I referred to it at the beginning; J.J.Abrams uses this section to give the film a lot of emotional depth. This is something I hadn't noticed on my initial viewing, but I can now see just what he was trying to do. Unfortunately it doesn't quite come off here but even so, by the end I could see its place and it made for a really quite enjoyable film. Some great music, both the original soundtrack by Michael Giacchino and the songs of the period that were chosen. As far as the cinematography goes, I've read a lot of comment about ""flaring""; this didn't bother me as much as I thought it would. I like that they show the film the kids were making while the end credits are rolling It's pretty neat.

A love letter to Spielberg and horror sci-fi,"Super 8 merges the explosive effects of today's blockbusters with an extremely likeable band of young characters almost reminiscent of The Goonies, whilst exploring themes of love and forgiveness alongside the importance of family and friendshipSet in the summer of 1979, Super 8 focuses on a group of young filmmakers in the fictional town of Lillian, Ohio who capture an extraordinary train crash on their Super 8mm video camera whilst shooting a low-budget horror film. The crash causes a sudden heavy presence of military personnel in Lillian as a series of strange and frightening occurrences take place, and the boys set out to figure out the cause of this mysterious chain of events.At the start of Super 8 we're immediately introduced to the films core characters; Joe (played by Joel Courtney), his best friend Charlie (Riley Griffiths), their pyromaniac friend Cary (Ryan Lee), Martin (Gabriel Basso) and Preston (Zach Mills). The adventure they share together is a similarly fun-yet-daring and life changing experience for all characters involved.The plot to Super 8 isn't by any means magnificent, a lot of the reveals and devices are standard in today's blockbuster market but the difference is how this film fares with the others. Super 8 has a way of really gripping you to the action even when you know what's going to come next, whether it's the off-rhythm jump scares (which are actually nicely done) to the mood lifting one-liners coming from the comic relief tertiary characters. If I had to be harsh I would say the only real disappointment when it comes to this films plot structure is the adult focused sub plot, which feels more like filler material than anything else because this is strictly not a film about adults.""Production Values"" is what we hear from our secondary character, Charlie, repeatedly through the film, as if he's telling us to keep watching to ensure we don't miss them. The thing is that we can't miss the production values in Super 8, especially considering the partnership of its creators: Abrams and Spielberg. What we have here is an awesome sci-fi adventure filled with trademark elements of the two directors, and the beauty is that these aren't very hard to spot; from the Spielbergian broken home as a plot device, to the consistent use of the lens flare. What is truly great about Super 8 is how well each director's trademarks seamlessly flow into one another.The theme of love isn't over or underplayed in Super 8, which is nice to see. The young actress who plays Alice (Elle Fanning) does an awesome job at selling a realistic portrayal of a quasi-Juliet damsel-in-distress character that gets caught up in the gang's adventure and ends up forming a central part of their group as well as the plot. The relationship between her and her father could be seen as a subtle mirror image of the underlying tensions that exist between Joe and his own father; similarly, Joe's attachment to and protection of Alice can be seen as a reflection of his attachment to his mother's locket.Overall, Super 8 is a highly watchable, well-acted and incredibly entertaining piece of original modern sci-fi that acts as a nostalgic look at the work of Spielberg as well as a big hope for the future of its genres.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A worthy homage to Spielberg, Ellen Fanning is stunning, The Goonies are back","¨She used to look at me this way, like really look, and I just knew I was there, that I existed.¨ As a true fan of Lost (the best television series ever in my opinion) I was really excited about J. J. Abrams's latest film, Super 8, which as usual he not only directed but also wrote. Abrams is one of my favorite directors and I've really enjoyed all his films. Add Steven Spielberg, who was one of the producers of this film, to the mix and this was perhaps one of my most anticipated films of the year. Fortunately, it didn't disappoint and it even exceeded my expectations, although this didn't even come as a surprise for me considering how well he managed to reboot the Star Trek franchise a couple of years ago. I was also a big fan of Cloverfield, which some people disliked, but I thought was really well crafted. Super 8 might be compared to Cloverfield in some ways, but I think it is a much more complete film in the sense that there is more character development going on. The whole mysterious monster thing was only a side story and the true heart of the film relied on the relationship between the kids and their friendship. Super 8 is really a nostalgic film that seems to pay homage to some of Spielberg's early films like E.T., Close Encounter of the Third Kind, and The Goonies. That was the mood that Abrams kind of set with Super 8 and what makes it stand out from all the rest of the modern disaster/monster movies. Even the title suggests this nostalgic feeling considering that Super 8 mm film were one of the first formats used for home movies before the invention of video. The movie even has this dark and dirty visual style to it making you think you are actually watching an old classic (until you see some of the dazzling visual effects like in the train crash which remind us this is a modern movie).The story takes place in a small town in Ohio during the summer of 1979. A group of young kids who are friends from school are making a super 8 movie about zombies. Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney) is helping out with the make-up, Charles (Riley Griffiths) is directing, Cary (Ryan Lee) is helping out with the sound, Preston (Zach Mills) is filming, while Alice (Elle Fanning) and Martin (Gabriel Basso) play the main actors. One night the five kids are out by the tracks filming their movie when all of a sudden they witness a catastrophic train wreck. Several explosions take place and parts of the train fall everywhere, but miraculously the kids are unharmed. Joe tells his friends that this wasn't an accident; he witnessed how a truck drove straight at the train in order to provoke the crash. While the kids were shooting their movie the camera kept rolling so they decide to develop the film the very next day, but have to wait at least for three more days until they can actually see the footage. Meanwhile some mysterious things begin to take place after the accident: the dogs all of a sudden have disappeared, motors from vehicles are missing, and even some people have gone missing as well. Joe's dad, Jackson (Kyle Chandler), is the town sheriff so he begins to search for answers, but the US Air Force (to whom the train belonged to) seems to be concealing what was really inside the train. Jackson discovers that there was a lot more to the accident then what they are actually telling him.The first hour really keeps the suspense and mystery building as we try to discover what was in the train. The relationship between the kids is actually the primary focus of the film and the mystery kind of works as a side story. Elle Fanning does a terrific job with this film and deserves an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress since she actually steals every scene she's in. She is the heart of the movie, and her relationship with Joel Courtney's character reminds us a lot of that first innocent love. The chemistry between both actors is actually very intense and far more believable than that of the lead characters from most of today's romantic comedies. Super 8 manages to mix well the action and suspense with the drama and character development, while at the same time remaining funny. It's all these mixed emotions that remind us of those 80's Spielberg blockbuster action movies. I couldn't help but think of Drew Barrymore in E.T. when I saw Elle Fanning in this film; watching the kids investigating the mysteries reminded me of The Goonies; it's just all these emotions that the movie evoked that gave me this sense of nostalgia while keeping me entertained at the same time. I really enjoyed this film and loved the performance from the kids, especially from Elle Fanning. I was so interested in these characters that I actually enjoyed the first half of the film over the second which focused more on the monster and the action. Super 8 is definitely worth watching, especially if you were a fan of some of these early Spielberg movies.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
80's nostalgia gone too far?,"This film had all the chances in the world. Namely Abrams and Spielberg. The film is shot wonderfully and instantly takes the audience back to the eighties when films were great and Spielberg was king. Abrams has undoubtedly recreated a charm here that is missing from most modern films, although admittedly less successfully than the films it is a homage to (E.T and Goonies). I so wanted it to be great, perhaps to the point where I expected too much from it. However it does contain stellar performances from a few of the cast.

Louis Dainard (Ron Eldard) comes to the wake, but Joe's father, Deputy Jackson Lamb (Kyle Chandler), takes Dainard away in handcuffs. It is later revealed that Jackson blames Louis for his wife's death because he was absent during his shift and she had to fill in for him.Abrams and Spielberg collaborated in a storytelling committee to come up with the story for the film.[6] The film was initially reported to be either a sequel or prequel to the 2008 film Cloverfield,[7] but this was quickly denied by Abrams.[8] Primary photography began in fall 2010. The teaser itself was filmed separately in April.[9] Super 8 is the first original J. J. Abrams film project, produced by Amblin Entertainment, Bad Robot Productions, and Paramount Pictures.[10] Filming took place in Weirton, West Virginia, from September to October 2010.[11] To promote the film, Valve created a short video game segment and released it alongside the PC version of Portal 2.Just go and watch, it a good Summer movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The title is not the only super thing in the movie,"Super 8 is a very funny, spectacular and modern-made mix of a science fiction monster-destroying-a-small-town-movie and a family/kids/teen comedy. The main characters are young teens so the film is made for them, but at the same it is a very intense sci-fi mystery thriller.The film begins with a funeral of the main character's mother, which clearly marks him as a tragical parent loss. Four months later, he and his friends are working on an amateur movie with the Super 8 camera. Accidentally, they film a monumental car crash. Soon, the military air force arrives and mysterious events start to happen.The first two thirds of the movie, it is actually just building up suspense and playing with the viewer's expectations. Some scenes are very intense, but in a good way, just making you more and more interested about seeing the monster itself. Aside from the whole monster story, the movie follows the main character's typical and untypical young teen problems.The storyline is interesting and entertaining, the monster scenes intense and a bit frightening, there is lots of amazing suspense, but still on the level, that is okay for older children. The young actors are incredible and the humor is amazing. Super 8 is a great movie, in short.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Clichéd, disappointing","Clearly there's a market for this stuff, but I thought the kids making a movie captured pretty well how I felt about the whole thing... clichéd plot, contrived action sequences and some pretty clunky dialog. I agree there was some good work by Fanning, but that hardly saves it. Fortunately I was able to multitask while I watched, so it wasn't a complete loss.The fact that Abrams wrote and directed is interesting... I'm a big Fringe fan, and you can certainly see shades of that here, but Super 8 totally lacks the great characters, dialog and humor and the ability to make you willingly suspend disbelief for the sake of the story.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"""Super 8"" (2011) was, as everyone told me, a good movie","I'd give it an 8 out of 10. It had a smart, funny script that made for likable adolescent protagonists, some nice tension in setting up a sci-fi mystery, and some great special effects (including an impressive train crash that reminded me of the very different ""Final Destination"" movies). I had fun with this.I can only enjoy ""family films"" so much, though. It isn't that I need violence or sex to be entertained. It's that these movies are ""safe"" and therefore predictable. When I realized early on that this was intended for general audiences, it gave me a pretty good idea of what would and would not happen throughout the film. (This film is a mystery that is a little hard to discuss without spoilers.)The movie was made even more predictable when you realize that director JJ Abrams was consciously imitating a certain other famous filmmaker. Let's look as what we've got: 1) an earnest, vulnerable, yet ultimately heroic adolescent boy; 2) quirky, flawed, yet lovable supporting characters that aid him in his quest; 3) a sci-fi mystery; 4) several family conflicts involving absent parents; and 5) ruthless government and/or military authorities.Hmmmm. Remind you of anything, anyone? Hint: see this film's producer.There was a little too much heavy handed imagery and plotting. Accidentally turning on a film projector and seeing a dead parent? A flying locket with a picture of said parent? And the locket is let go at the story's climax? I felt that Abrams would next reach right out of the movie screen and write the movie's message in black Sharpie marker across my forehead. Just in case I didn't get it.Still, this was good. Those kids were so damned cool it made me think it might be fun to be a parent. That heavy kid would actually be really cool to hang out with. If I were his Dad, I'd buy him all sorts of stuff for his hobby of making zombie movies, and I'd let him skip his chores just to give him the space he needs.This movie also did something pretty creative that I don't remember seeing done outside of ""The X-Files."" We're shown a government or military conspiracy, but this time the local police department does NOT cooperate or become complicit in it. So you see local cops actively working against their federal or military counterparts. I found that to be different and interesting, and it seems like the sort of thing that might occur in real life.All in all, this was a good movie. It seems like a pretty decent flick with which to introduce a kid to science fiction.https://ericrobertnolan.wordpress.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"You can't please them all, Abrams...","This was the perfect summer action flick to me. It was a heart-pounding popcorn flick that had a lot of heart and likable characters. Did you guys expect LOST level complexity? Some sort of Sci-Fi revelation? I read a lot of hate for 'Super 8', but I have never heard one bad review of the 1980s classic movie 'Stand By Me'. If Abrams deserves one criticism, it is for (essentially) referencing that movie a ton. This movie is about the characters, and the magic of child hood more than anything else. I think a lot of adults go into a movie like this wanting more depth or better this or better that, but this was supposed to be a family summer blockbuster, and considering the nature of the movie and the intended audience, I find it a very smart, entertaining film. It doesn't have a whole lot of instant re-watch-ability, but then again most movies don't.In an era where 'filmmakers' buy scripts from others, I have a massive amount of respect for Abrams doing both the directing and the writing. Despite similarities to some other films and occasional (I would argue intentional) movie clichés throughout, this is a unique film, not a sequel or remake. Considering he made this, and is only now getting to his second Star Trek film, I think it is apparent how much he wanted this film made, and that kind of passion really shows in the finished product, especially when you are looking for it.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not much going for it...,"I have not seen anything from the series 'Lost' which made J.J. Abrams famous so I didn't come into this movie with high expectations and it's a good thing I didn't either. I just found so much of the action sequences flat, the characters weren't really all that engaging and the story pretty much non-existent. It had really good potential early on with the train crash and played the mystery up fairly well and then the payoff was just not there at all. So much of the action and the entire movie for that matter happens in darkness which makes it easy for F/X department but just made it confusing and tiring for me. The dialogue was hard to pick up, it seemed like the kids were mumbling a lot or something, and what lines you did hear was pure corn. I really have no idea why this was a period piece set in the late '70's either, there was really no reason for it and there was little there to indicate it was the '70's. There was a 'Super8' camera in use and they had to wait for the film to be developed but the 3 day wait wasn't much a of a plot device. Just a really poor movie with very little story, which basically hacked 'E.T' for inspiration. I was expecting something more from a Spielberg production. I get the feeling that Abrams was offered a shot at making a movie but he didn't really have much of an idea what to do for a movie. Very disappointing.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
My rating would be 8 if haters hadn't over low rated this,"I said it in the title.Looking around on the reviews I've found both too pleasing and too negative reviews. Still I think it's more good than bad.One thing to underline is the teens's behaviour. Many people say that's annoying, stupid, and unreal, but having been at that age not too time ago I can see that's exactly how teen kids behave. So that argument is invalid.Then we have hates towards the 'too over dramatized' train crash, saying how impossible that scene is. My answer is: you came to watch a science fiction thriller about an alien on earth, and you expect realism? Must say that J.J. Abrams did a great job on this, and showed that he's able to direct a movie in Spielberg's style, so much that a friend of mine thought it's directed by Spielberg. I wasn't very okay with the ending, but overall this movie is enough good.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"For younger viewers, and Lens flares again....................","Best described as the Goonies meets E.T. on steroids. Heavy on the younger audience (13 to 15 yr. olds) very light on adult entertainment. JJ Adams persists in using lens flares.......... most of us think they are an obnoxious distraction, but Mr. Adams continues ruining scenes with his obsession/love making use of lens flares. There are only a few people in the world who thinks it's really cool- JJ Adams and the person who showed him the first one. The kids acting is well done. The little bit of adult interaction was average. Takes two thirds of the movie to finally get to the alien, which was done just o.k...... Only pay admission if you have a minibus full of kids, otherwise it will make a good red box rental.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Better then expected and worth seeing!,"I just want to say that I really enjoyed this film and I could sit down and watch it all over again. If you haven't seen it, the go rent it and sit back and enjoy the ride but don't take it to serious, it is aimed at the middle school to high school age group in my opinion. Another reviewer mentioned that it had an E.T. feel to it and I would have to agree. It even gave me the same feel good feeling while I was watching it. I thought the acting was very good for most, especially Elle Fanning.. She was simply amazing. About the only thing that was a little over the top was the train wreck, although it was cool; just not very realistic. But then few movies (if any) are perfect. It's well made and worth seeing.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Super.,"Writer/director J.J. Abrams knows, if anything, to keep the pace up, sometimes even hitting 11. His monumental STAR TREK reboot played testament to this as characters, settings, intrigue, cosmic play and even the death of Winona Ryder came flying at warp factor 9 when, at times, it can be argued, a slower pace would be welcome to provide more character development. So too happens here with Abrams' latest, SUPER 8, but instead of playing with Gene Roddenberry's creations, an even higher-power is being paid homage to as this film feels as it could be set in Producer Steven Spielberg's backyard.The film itself pays homage to the days of super-8 mm recordings and times when young boys made movies before becoming the next generation of Hollywood. So too here, a group of teenage friends plan to make a monster movie and instead end up as stars of the film itself. However, unlike in the aforementioned STAR TREK, where the characters, if anything their names, are already known, Abrams' fast pace prevents the viewer from getting any deeper into the lives and characters of these kids who are already deep into their long-term existing friendships. Outside of Joel Courtney's Joe and Elle Fanning's Alice, the other friends all kind of blend into the Goonies, Elliott's bicycle gang and Biff Tannen's nameless thugs.Abrams does get a huge piece of the puzzle correct, and that is the everyday boy getting involved in the spectacular extraordinary all wrapped in a coming of age tale – the perfect Spielbergian formula. Courtney and Fanning are believable – enjoyable – teens and their fathers – Kyle Chandler for Joe, Ron Eldard for Alice – are both dramatic and fantastic. As the tale rockets by a little too quickly, their characters make for a great focal point of the story, even if Joe's bedroom, perhaps a little unbelievably, houses every bit of late 70s and early 80s toy collector nostalgia possible.SUPER 8, like Joe's bedroom, is a wonderful vision of nostalgia. A bit derivative at times, a little glossed over at others. However, it would be hard to come by a finer example of a modern-day look at a time of fun films.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Big performances by little guys !!!,"The story in Super 8 isn't something new. The special effects and CGI are quite convincing and spot-on. Directing is adequate, such as the pacing. What really takes off the film is the kids'performances !!Seeing this film reminded me of Goonies and other kid-focused films where friendship, curiosity, recklessness, bravery and selflessness define the film. If you approach this movie as another alien sci-fi film you may not be that satisfied because there have been a lot of identical films out there with much more special effects, deeper plot etc.Instead, try to see it as a film about 5 young teenagers, their troubles, their friendship, their hunger to do things and explore new stuff, all these being told through a disaster and a crisis due to an extraterrestrial creature.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Old-school Sci-fi,"A factory accident in the small town of Lillian, Ohio leaves an emotionally distant man (Kyle Chandler) a widower and his son without the one parent he could relate to. At the reception in their home, Deputy Jackson Lamb (Chandler) ejects a man who showed up intoxicated and his son Joe (Joel Courtney) bears witness. In an effort to buy time so that he himself and his son can come to grips with the loss, Jackson tries to persuade Joe to go to baseball camp for the summer and, at the same time, disparages his friends whose interests include the production of monster films for one and explosive for another. As they are in the middle of one such film and Joe promised to help complete it, he declines the offer.One night, he sneaks out of the house to joins his friends in filming a scene at a train station and they are all nearly killed when a train is derailed after a head-on collision with a speeding pickup. It is the collision and subsequent events that are the source for most of the film. The train belonged to the Air Force and before long, so does the crash site and most of the town as it is placed under a de facto martial law. Joe and Charles, the director of the film that brought them to the train station in first place, examine their footage and see something escaping the train.Written and directed by J. J. Abrams of Lost fame and with Steven Spielberg co-producing, Super 8 is easily a step above efforts like Cloverfield and Artificial Intelligence while falling just short of films like E.T., Super 8 is a welcomed addition to the sci-fi genre and a great time to be had at the movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It Came From Outer Space,"First--I had a heck of a good time watching this film with my daughters (who couldn't help covering their eyes at times--and I don't blame them!) Most reviewers mention the homage Super 8 pays to 80s blockbusters like E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and I would put Stand By Me in there, too. Now I'm sure others have noticed this also, but the essential elements of the story line go back much further--to the 1953 SF film It Came From Outer Space. A really terrific film! The story idea and first treatment were created by a very young Ray Bradbury, though the screenplay was taken out of his hands and given to a more established writer. Who didn't quite bung it up completely, thank goodness. I don't want to ruin anything for anyone, so suffice to say that if you watch both films you'll see that in bare outline they are strikingly similar. Of course Super 8 is an updated, big budget film that cost about 50X more to make than It Came From Outer Space. Yet, strangely, the 1953 film is actually more believable. That's my one complaint about Super 8--too much of the action, events and characters soar glibly beyond credibility. An incredible premise is okay--but outlandish scenes tend to take me out of the story as I ask: ""how?"" ""what?"" ""why?"" and ""no way!"" Another problem--and this is true of about 85% of films--is a bad guy or gal with absolutely no redeeming qualities, nor any positive elements to his or her argument or position. A story is just so much stronger if both the ""hero"" and ""opponent"" have credible, sympathetic reasons for their conflict/positions/actions. But I quibble. Super 8 was the most fun I've had in a theater in ages. See it!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
chaotic and stressful.,"This move really sucked ass. I had some mixed expectations about this one, and decided to watch it because it was rated 7,3 on IMDb. HOW IN EARTH did this movie get a rating on 7,3? Must be some kinda error that switched around the numbers. 3,7 would be more like it :)The beginning of the movie is good, you get to know the characters and the kids are good actors. But it doesn't take too long, around the part of the train station that the movie starts to drop.So much stupid and unrealistic things (ye i know it is sci-fi and are supposed to be excessive, but some things in this movie are just plain stupid.)Then the movie goes more and more into a big mess. A lot of stuff happens everywhere and i got the feeling the film maker just rushes trough the movie, to get done with it.I really tried to like this movie, but got more and more disappointed the longer i got into the movie.

The Blockbuster of the Year,"This in my opinion is set to become the blockbuster of the year. It's a great mix of genre's including Sci-fi , Drama , Horror , Fantasy and Adventure. I thought it was like a mixture of the films The Goonies , Cloverfield , E.T. and Stand by me. I liked the acting from the group of kids and their cool super 8 zombie movies , the SFX was great and the creature looked cool even though there was some CGI involved but as you can imagine with a massive budget the CGI looked good in most parts.Anyway i really enjoyed this and it really reminded me of the cool 80s flicks that i grew up with so hats off to JJ and SS for making this. It knocks the socks off other blockbusters like Michael Cash oh sorry i mean Bay's Transformers 3 which i haven't seen but don't need to see to make this comment as nearly everything Bay makes these days is just to make money.Super 8 is super cool and i think it has something for everyone that watches it.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
