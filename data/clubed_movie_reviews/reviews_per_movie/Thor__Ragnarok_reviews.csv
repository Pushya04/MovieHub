The best Thor yet!,"The action and humor mixed up in this movie was done with such quality that you forget about the problems with it, if there are even any at all! Thor kicks butt along with both new and old friends of his and unforgettable superhero power scenes that will make you smile! This was especially great seeing it in theaters!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

This Thor is Thor-some!,"Frankly, I didn't like the first two Thor movies, the game plan was so clear from the get go. Same old ""save the world"" routines, brooding hero with a burden, a love connection born out of necessity and bloated battle scenes. It is the same blueprint for many superhero movies, but Thor has the God element that made the stories feel even more preposterous and ridiculous. It is hard to be vested in his quests because God don't die, hurt as much and can always employ one last deus ex machina that solves the unsolvable problem. But Thor: Ragnarok throws that over-used game plan out from Bifrost into an unknown territory, making it this year's best superhero movie. I know I know Justice League has not descended, but looking at the trailer it doesn't take a genius to see that it will be doing the above-mentioned routine.New Zealand director Taika Waititi seems like an unusual choice to helm Thor's third standalone movie. He has the indie root in him and he makes superbly smart comedies with oddles of heart, just watch What We Do in the Shadows (2014) and Hunt for the Wilderpeople (2016) to see his outstanding oeuvre. Apparently, the Marvel-Disney studios have given him full reins and he went ahead and make a comedy. But how do you inject an indie comedic vibe into a superhero franchise that has not been done before?Essentially, Waititi throws out all the cumbersome weights that hampered Thor and tells a simpler but no less cool story about a superhero trying to get back to his home to clean house. In between he gives Thor ample opportunities to be a beer-swigging beefcake, negotiate some treacherously outlandish situations and strip him off the one thing that makes him Thor, the Mjolnir. At one point, Odin even asks a defeated Thor ""What are you, the God of Hammers? "" that had me laughing till my tears rolled down.The tone is light but no less serious, populated by so many colourful characters in a vivid world trapped in impossible situations. At first I thought the introduction of Hulk in the early trailer is a misstep, but Mark Ruffalo's casting would have been close to impossible to keep under wraps. By giving Planet Hulk comic fans a look-in would have been a better move. The repartee between Thor and Hulk/Banner is so hilarious. No less funny is also the dialogue between Thor and Loki, gone is that ""he ain't heavy, he is my brother"" vibe and this is a Thor that will give Loki a smackdown if he is out of step.Cate Blanchett plays Thor's estranged sister with evil relish and you don't cast Jeff Goldblum without allowing him to be Goldblum. Waititi even voices a gladiator-mentor character named Korg that practically steals all the scenes he is in. Chris Hemsworth hams it up just to a safe degree and nails all the one-liners with an A+. In fact, the whole cast seems to be having fun.Thor: Ragnarok embraces its preposterousness and swims in a pool of ridiculousness with the deadpan and self-mocking humour hitting all the bullseyes. In the midst of it all, it still manages to tell a super duper cool story of a superhero saving his people. Yet it manages to remain fresh and zip along with a zany lightning pace. What an inspired choice for a director. The risk taken will pay huge dividends. This has superb rewatch value and I already feel like buying another ticket just to catch all the one-liners one more time. This Thor is Thor-some!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Best Movie in THOR series,"The cast for Thor Ragnarok are all matched well, and the sibling chemistry between Tom Hiddleston and Chris Hemsworth is as natural as can be. Cate Blanchett as Hela, the goddess of death is frightening in her cruelty as well as physical perfection. But, the reason this movie stands alone is the multi talented Taika Waititi, the director of the film. His offbeat New Zealand style shows in every scene, humor throughout and a rocking 80s electronica soundtrack, the film will transport you as fast as Heimdall and the Bitfrost!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Damn you Marvel!!!!,"Ragnarok is a neon-infused fantasy of what superhero films could look like. There are gigantic monsters and beautiful women; zombie armies and a big spooky dog; an evil witch and Jeff Goldblum, but this isn't just a wacky movie made for the sake of wackiness. Ragnarok is the child of confident filmmaking and understanding of what the Thor franchise could have always been.It takes a character that could have always been more and makes good on that promise through competent storytelling and unbridled enthusiasm for the world. This is exactly how we should be rewarded for their fandom. There has never been a clearer example of throwing the entire kitchen sink at a single title and having every single washer and lug-nut of that porcelain mechanism land in perfect order than Ragnarok.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
The best marvel movie of them all!! Humor and action!!,This us a phenomenal movie has the whole super hero package plus some great humor. An incredible villian played by the flawless Cate Blanchett!!

Thor and Marvel Cinematic Universe are at the top of their game,"Really enjoyed the first 'Thor' and loved even more its bigger, darker and bolder follow-up 'Thor: The Dark World'. 'Thor: Ragnarok' manages to be the best of the three, and is not just a strong contender for the funniest Marvel Cinematic Universe film (yes even more so than the 'Guardians of the Galaxy' films) but also one of their best to date.As said in my review for 'The Death of Stalin', 2017 has been very hit and miss for films, the best ones being wonderful (I.e. 'God's Own Country', 'The Farthest', 'The Death of Stalin', 'Blade Runner 2049', 'Wind River', 'IT', 'The LEGO Batman Movie') and the worst ones being dreadful (i.e. 'Baywatch', 'The Snowman', 'The Emoji Movie', 'Stratton', 'Flatliners', 'The Mummy', 'Transformers: The Last Knight'). 'Thor: Ragnarok' is to me up there with the year's best. Would even go as far to say that it's one of the best and most entertaining ""superhero"" films so far, whether in Marvel, DCU or anywhere.On a visual level, 'Thor: Ragnarok' is the best-looking of the three 'Thor' films and of Marvel in general. Asgard looks colourful and atmospheric. The photography and editing are stylish and the locations are stunningly vivid. The special effects and stunts are not just dazzling and have substance and purpose rather than just being thrown in for the sake of it, they are among the best of any Marvel film. Just for the record, Marvel get a lot of hate, particularly in the ridiculous and blown completely out of proportion DCU vs Marvel war, have personally enjoyed a lot many of their efforts. The music pulsates thrillingly and is also catchy and rich in atmosphere and emotion.'Thor: Ragnarok', as said, is a contender for Marvel's funniest film. The dialogue crackles in wit and deadpan deliciousness, and absolutely loved Thor's quips and the clever in-jokes (Loki's horrified reaction at coming face to face with Hulk was a standout). They are all placed adeptly, placement is never questionable.It's not just about the humour that makes 'Thor: Ragnarok' so great though. Like 'Thor: The Dark World' in particular of the previous two films, the action is absolutely thrilling and breath-taking in spectacle (almost 'The Lord of the Rings'-like in scale). There is plenty of bold dark-natured tension and the emotional moments give the film a lot of heart and are genuinely moving.Taika Waititi balances humour, action and drama with ease and it shows in the compelling and tightly structured and paced story. The characters are even more expansive in development, both intrigue and entertain and their well fleshed out personalities make them easy to care for them. Thor and Loki are beautifully realised characters while Hulk is the most interesting he's been in a long time. Hela is not just the best non-Loki 'Thor' villain (so much better than the one-dimensional and underwritten villain of 'The Dark World) but also one of the best villains in the Marvel canon, not just posing a threat, interesting in personality and having a motivation that nobody will scoff at but she is also one of few Marvel villains to actually have an arc. Korg (with Waititi writing himself in to portray) is a bit random but is a lot of fun.Chris Hemsworth is at his most relaxed and charismatic, while Tom Hiddleston is terrific as Loki and pitches his mellifluousness and serpentine-like malevolence perfectly. Anthony Hopkins continues to bring welcome gravitas to Odin and doesn't ham up. Cate Blanchett relishes the character of Hela, and makes her a character that's menacing, entertaining and oddly rootable.Mark Ruffalo is a strong presence as Hulk, Benedict Cumberbatch brings everything that was good about his Dr Strange in the first place and Jeff Goldblum is suitably playful. Karl Urban comes off least but does his best with the relatively little he has (which to me was nowhere near distracting enough to bring the film down).Overall, a brilliant film with Thor and Marvel being at the top of their game. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A very fun movie that sheds new light on the future direction of the MCU,"I think that this newest installment in the MCU, Thor:Ragnarok truly solidifies the MCU's new direction that has been commencing in phase 3. Contrary to the previous Marvel Phases this new Phase focuses on a new direction, in Phase 1 we had the origin stories which came together in the first Avengers movie. In Phase 2 we got some further world building in the different solo movies like Iron Man 3 and Captain America: The Winter Soldier. But, other than these entries Marvel's Phase 2 also gave us some experimental projects like Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant Man. Now in Phase 3 this experimental Marvel is coming in full force.In order for a franchise like Marvel to survive I think this new direction is very important if not necessary, it is very interesting that Marvel is now employing directors that are not necessarily the usual big budget movie directors but rather, directors of low budget movies such as Taika Waititi. Marvel Phase 3 seems to be all about having this ensemble of films with drastically different tones. We've had 2 comedies Thor: Ragnarok and Guardians 2. But we've also went into mystical/fantasy genres in Doctor Strange or serious dramas like Civil War. Not to mention the coming Black Panther that has a very estranged setting. All this is what the New Marvel has become and I think it is perfect.So, after discussing so much on the direction of the MCu I would like to pull the focus back to Thor: ragnarok, I can understand that many people did not like this film for its lack of significance in the greater scene/setting of the MCU. In fact there wasn't much stakes that carry through to the MCU and it seems very self contained. However I think that it is important to enjoy this movie as it is, the fun action sci-fi that is probably the funniest Marvel movie to date. The thing is we as audiences get so much superhero movies nowadays there is a case of superhero film fatigue and having large stakes in every single movie is just going to dilute out tastes. This current way, we can enjoy these characters in their own side stories/adventures and enjoy the big explosive moments when they come together, like a comic book crossover event!What Thor: Ragnarok does so well is that it really redefines the Thor franchise, the character of Thor himself and even the Hulk character. All the while maintaining the sense of fun and adventure. I did enjoy that they further characterized Hulk so he isn't just a raging monster but a simple minded character who has more complexity than is previously perceived.However, the comedy does come at the expense of certain climactic battle sequences and serious moments and this is sure to put certain audiences off.But overall, a thrilling, fun action movie that is sure to evoke certain controversies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Popcorn-blockbustering of the highest order.,"Being the 17th instalment into the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), and the third in the solo-Thor series—generally the least liked within the MCU—it wouldn't be surprising if this cosmic adventure showed signs of repetition and fatigue. It doesn't, not one bit. The opposite is true in fact, thanks to the unique energy and ingenuity brought from New Zealand director Taika Waititi (Hunt for the Wilderpeople, What We Do in the Shadows). Waititi's comedy background is noticeably in full swing, the previously darker Thor outings traded in for a laugh-heavy vibe closer to Guardians of the Galaxy – the movie Ragnarok shares top spot with, as the MCU's funniest film. A throwaway gag about scissors from a side character made of rock (mo-capped and viced by the director himself) is pure Waititi, and the franchise's best one-liner since Chris Pratt's Starlord appreciated the artwork of Jackson Pollock. Of course a big budget means big action, and there's plenty here to thrill and delight: a tone-setting smack down of a fiery underworld demigod, a bruising gladiatorial contest between Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), an exhilarating spaceship chase, and the breathtakingly electric finale. This threequel is visually distinct too, Waititi opting for a grungy-disco 80s atmosphere over the more theatrical opulence of the first two Thor flicks. His use of slow-mo, backed to Led Zeppelin's 'Immigrant Song', for two key moments, is simply brilliant. Supporting Hemsworth, who has never been better as the macho God of Thunder, is Tom Hiddleston as fan favourite bad-good guy Loki, Cate Blanchett as the sneering God of Death Hela, Tessa Thompson as the cocky warrior Valkyrie and Jeff Goldblum as the eccentric Grandmaster, plus a raft of awesome cameos. A few minor nit picks: Idris Elba seems bored as the returning Heimdall, two previous major supporting characters (both females) are conspicuously absent, a talking Hulk doesn't quite work, and the narrative-retcon work could've been more subtle. But when a movie is this damn entertaining, a few quibbles are easily forgiven. Comfortably taking its place in the top echelon of MCU films, Thor: Ragnarok is hilarious, invigorating and popcorn-blockbustering of the highest order.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Thor Review,"Thor: Ragnarok is a fun and entertaining movie. The acting is great along with the comedy. The tone and feel Taika Waititi has created fits so well with Thor and completely embraces the ridiculousness of the Thor setting. The movie perhaps gets too silly at some points, but for the most part the comedy is spot on.A strong 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Thor Ragnarok: Marvel deliver yet again,"I admit it, I'm not exactly a Thor fan. I think the first two Thor feature films were passable efforts but paled in comparison to other heroes outings. For this reason I went in expecting a whole lot of meh!Now Ragnarok was critically acclaimed, I never heard a bad thing about it despite the fact that I wasn't blown away by the trailer at all.So with a new Thor outing, sprinkles of Planet Hulk and more humour than usual (Especially from Thor) how'd I think it did?From the opening moments with Thor swinging from a chain awkwardly rotating as he's trying to have a conversation I was gripped. This wasn't the dull boring stoic Thor we'd grown to accept, this guy was cracking of the wise and I was laughing by buttocks off.Cate Blanchett delivers as Hela like I never expected she'd manage, Jeff Goldblum is excellent in a role he felt almost born for and the entire thing is one joke filled roller coaster ride that I enjoyed considerably more than I expected to.Did all the comedy diminish the impact of the Marvel Universe? Oddly not, it fit in perfectly even when a serious moment was underlined with a goofy slapstick laugh.Kudos to Marvel once again, so far out of every single MCU movie I've only disliked 2 and for a harsh critic like me that's really something.So much fun, so many laughs and has freshened up a character that in this guys opinion was getting a bit stale. Damn good job.The Good:Cast do a great jobGenuinely funny stuffThe Bad:Could have done more with the Planet Hulk story arcThings I Learnt From This Movie:This is where Hulk and Thor were during Civil War!!!!Immigrant Song just makes any scene betterIt's probably best Jaimie Alexander (Lady Sif) couldn't be part of the filmHulk talking is weird, confusing and please make it stop",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Superb tongue in cheek Fantasy Sci Fi 9/10,"I have to admit this blew me away , I wasn't expecting to enjoy it but this was a really funny enjoyable piece of entertainment.Definitely worth seeing .This is not my genre but this will appeal to those who love films like the LOTR trilogy as well as those who love the humour in Guardians of the Galaxy .Jeff Glodblum stood out as Grandmaster. As well as the Stone revolutionary South African gladiator .Kate Blanchet was superb , there was even a small cameo role for Scarlet Johansen completing the Avengers assemble .As a complete novice to the genre and knowing very little about the franchise - it came across as a mix of Sci Fi ( of the Star Wars ilk ) mixed with myth and fantasy tied together by an excellent script and great comic lines .Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleson were great as was the Hulk / Banner and Valkyrie . The only let down was Anthony Hopkins - his performance was below par for such an excellent actor .Plenty of action and CGI for those who like their cinematic fix .It's a film I'd definitely see again maybe in 3D or in the reclining seats :)Pad.A 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Hell Yeah!! Good Job Marvel,"This movie was a really solid one. It was really funny and and just lots of fun. I didn't like the first 2 Thor movies that much and this is obviously the best one so far and probably one of the best mcu movies. Taika Waititi did a really good job both directing and voicing the funniest character in mcu history probably. His character Korg was probably the funniest character in the movie, his lines were hilarious,he had the funniest accent ever probably. And all the characters were really good. Hela is probably my favorite mcu villain right now. Cate Blanchett is really good in this movie, she is really sexy, funny and intimidating and her little fight with the Asgardians was really fun and cool. Chris Hemsworth was also really good in this he was really funny and had more character to him compared to the other Thor movies. Jeff Goldblum was awesome in the movie. Karl Urban was really good (I couldn't realize him in his character). Tessa Thompson was great. Tom Hiddleston, Mark Rufallo and Idris Elba were great as always. This movie had a basic plot and story that was just fun. Also this movie was visually stunning (not BR2049 stunning but very pleasing in that regard. Had really cool set pieces and action. Soundtrack was also really pleasing with its synth wave-y 80's feel and pretty much the whole movie had the 80's feel with neon color usage. I don't have much problems with it and I definitely would recommend seeing this movie if you have the time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Exceeded my expectations,"This movie really exceeded my expectation.For me it is already the second best comic book movie,right after Logan.When I ve watched the both of the trailers,I ve thought Thor 3 has the best trailer in this genre so far.Trailers really met with my expectations.You are gonna see epic showdowns just like the way you imagined.Glad they didn't go on serious,boring mode like they did in Thor 2.Cause that movie bored me to death just like man of steel did.Lastly,I just wanna say that Taika Watiti is pretty damn good director who can make both good stories/plots and brilliant jokes/references(just like deadpool's humor).Thanks again for all the joy you gave me Marvel.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A great marvel film!,"There are some beautiful shots and colours in this film! Especially a slow scene with the Valkyrie girl, just visually stunning. The poster for this film being one of my favourites of the year.This one contains a lot more action and comedy, similar in tone to guardians of the galaxy. Could be considered a good or bad thing but I liked it. Furthermore some minor characters like Heimdall are expanded upon, which is great because I really enjoy his character.However you need to be a marvel fan to understand some scenes, don't watch this if it is your first as you may be confused. It moves quite fast in the beginning but gradually the pace gets a bit better. Overall I would hold this in high regard, just under Captain America: civil war and The Avengers.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Most enjoyable movie for me.Thanks for giving me joy marvel.I really needed it,"Thor: Ragnarok plunges headfirst into unbridled comedy and Waititi gives his actors ample room to showcase their natural comedic talents, especially Hemsworth and Blanchett, who are rarely seen having so much fun. Jeff Goldblum, Karl Urban, and Ruffalo also shine, and Tessa Thompson steals scenes as Valkyrie, a hard-drinking Asgardian bounty hunter and former member of Odin's elite guard. Overall, the film benefits from its director's distinct style and measured irreverence, giving Thor a welcome boost of vitality.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
This might just be the best MCU movie.,"As a fan of dark comic book movies like The dark knight and Logan, my favourite movie in MCU was The winter soldier but after seeing Thor I just couldn't believe a movie could have so much dark and light side and still pull it off with such cohesion. major kudos to the director and I always believed in him because ""the hunt for Wilderpeople"" had the same funny story line with dark moments in between, the Aussie and Kiwi themed jokes were just awesome (I live in Australia). each cast member played there role to perfection and the relationship between Thor and Loki just keeps getting better with time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
An Enjoyable Technicolor Superhero Flick,"Thor Ragnarok leaves the bland formula from it's first two films for an exciting and self-aware redemption story, traversing through the trash heap planet Sakaar and an Asgard under siege. Sakaar was my favorite setting out of any recent Marvel films, with Jeff Goldblum giving a hilarious performance as a playful dictator and the arena-centric atmosphere providing an intriguing set piece. Blanchett plays the best villain of the Thor trilogy, Elba's character is essentially Aragon from LOTR, and Tessa Thompson and Marc Ruffalo/Hulk are respectively well- motiaved and solid comic relief.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
great experience,"""Fun"" isn't a dirty word. It's also not a word that means ""not art"" or ""lacking drama."" And the word ""funny"" likewise doesn't negate artistic integrity or drama. Anyone who thinks these words are contrary to great filmmaking or ""true art"" simply doesn't know what they're talking about, and should probably stop trying to discuss cinema. Humor, comedy, and satire not only have a long and glorious history in art and expression, they are in fact very hard to do correctly. Writing comedy and directing comedy is every bit as difficult, if not more so, than straightforward drama in many ways. And to whatever extent fun and comedy in films can also serve to purely entertain sometimes and to add levity to situations, that's not bad nor limiting of art either.It speaks to the absurdity of modern film debate and fandom that I even need to point out such glaringly obvious, fundamental truths about storytelling, movies, and art. But such is the nature of rabid, narrow personal preference driven by bizarre loyalty to one publishing corporation over another. Fandom is always -- generally speaking -- turning everything into ""us versus them,"" but the extent to which it's devolved into outrageously uninformed and limited claims of what is or isn't ""art,"" is a newer development and a sign of the shallowness of so much of our modern discussion of cinema when it comes to genre storytelling.Thor: Ragnarok is fun, and it's also funny. It is also dramatic, it is also terrific art, it is also the best Thor movie by a wide margin, and it is one of the best Marvel sequels released so far.If those statements or words bug you, then get over it and grow up",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Jokes weren't misplaced,"I know some people are worried about the humour on this movie.But they used it excellently in this flick.This movie to me,is at least on the same level with Guardians of the Galaxy 1.I mean both guardians and Thor 3 made me laugh but never felt cringe or sensed any forced jokes.There were also very intense and emotional moments in this Thor movie.The fight sequences were so damn epic.When it comes to action,this movie is close to Lord of the Rings 2.They did a good job on reflecting the epicness of the Ragnarok event. The last trailer of the movie got my attention.And I made one of the best decisions of my life by watching it.Hela,Valkyrie,Hulk,Thor,Loki,Grandmaster they all did pretty good job.Especially Hela.She was so gorgeous and menacing at the same time. Tessa Thompson kinda surprised me with her great performance btw.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Simply epic,"Well for what it's worth, Thor Ragnarok is definitely a satisfying and suitable ending when speaking of this year's MCU movies. Despite enjoying Spider-Man Homecoming a little more overall, partially because there were things I didn't like about Thor Ragnarok but there was very little I disliked about Homecoming, all in all, this film is really, really good. It's explosive and fun and colorful and enjoyable and looks terrific and exquisite all throughout. Is it overdone? You decide whether or not they overdid some things for this one. I see lots of people comparing it to Guardians of the Galaxy and while I don't fully agree, I can definitely say that there are some things that are reminiscent of the Guardians' movies, but certainly not in a bad way.What makes this film so good is its associates. They're not out of place and they're not really forced in; like, it fits perfectly, man. Everything comes together so nicely. Take Hulk for example. I was thinking, ""Hulk may or may not work in this film. Could be great, could be straight out opposite."" Well, overall, I think it's a good idea that they did include Hulk - even more so when they had him appear as Bruce, rather than Hulk himself. Mark Ruffalo's Hulk is by far the best one yet. Well, to me at least. Another thing I have to include is its humor. Some say it's either a little forced or it's just simply not all that funny. Well, the moments that were funny, were funny. Not much more can be said other than the fact that yeah, some stuff had me like, ""Ehh.. okay"", but for the most part, there's some solid laughs here and there.Jeff Goldblum's role was unique, to say the least - but did kind of remind me of The Collector from Guardians of the Galaxy. I don't know, he just did. Not a bad thing, but you know. If I were to comment on his character, I would have to say he's pretty good. He's not amazing, but he's an interesting part of the film and makes an okay villain (assuming you would call him that). One thing that really stood out to me and made the film even more enjoyable was its brother scenes, aka, scenes that revolve around Loki and Thor together. That was good in this film. I actually enjoyed Loki in this more than I did The Avengers. And Hemsworth is superb in the film. Not a better guy out there that could have played Thor. He was the correct, undeniable greatest choice.There's also a very good 'cameo' like role, if you will, which does add to the movie. The film also doesn't lose its identity, meaning that even though there are other characters and whatnot, it's first and foremost a Thor film.Here's what I didn't like (or, who I didn't like, for that matter): Hela. My reasons for disliking her character are pretty much simplistic and generic, but they're not invalid by any means- she's annoying. She's boring. That's really all I can say. I mean, there's a scene in which I do love that includes her, but it's spoiler-ish, so maybe another time...Overall, however, a great film. Bright, colorful, funny, loads of action, good character usage, and the third act is damn good! I think this is perhaps my sixth favorite MCU film overall, overtaking Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, but it is still right behind: 5- Spider-Man Homecoming, 4-The Avengers, 3-Captain America The Winter Soldier, 2-Guardians of the Galaxy and 1-Captain America Civil War. Ragnarok is a terrific film though, and it's one of this year's best.8.5/10",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Thor reinventing himself with the backdrop of an 80's synth,"Thor must stop Ragnarök! It's back again: The Marvel machine. Pumping out more and more movies for you. This movie is what you expect. It's a fun, enjoyable party. It's difficult to hate it, because you realize the movie itself isn't taking things that seriously. This time around they are more self-aware than usual. I liked that addition. It's true that we are so many movies in and you question when it will get tiresome. But to my surprise they shape-shifted the franchise again and got out on top. I never expected that I would like a third ""Thor"" film as much as I did. It's unexpected, but I'm so glad they took some chances by not making the same movie again. If you've had a stressful week or just a bad day, then you will not have a good time watching something that's too dramatic. That's when something like ""Ragnarok"" steps in. It's a nice refresher. Forget your problems for an hour and follow Thor while he jumps around with 80s synth music. The first act is basically a classic ""Thor"" sequel. But things pick up as soon as our hero lands on Sakaar, and the film enters an edgy science fiction zone. It's funny, full of great jokes. It's distracting at first because its obvious how much the humor has been turned up compared to some previous chapters. I easily started enjoying it though. Everyone had fun making this movie and that fun feeling transcends to me as well.Cate Blanchett's Hela is one of those scenery chewing villains. It's classic, but whenever we cut back to her it does feel like an entirely different film. Like with ""Homecoming"", I enjoyed the character interaction scenes more than the action. The final battle feels like an easy training match. It's like we are on autopilot, but then again we get some neat visual elements. Every supporting character is great for this story. The Hulk, Loki, Grandmaster, Valkyrie.. They are all like-able. Jeff Goldblum is playing himself and its fantastic for what it is. Also, the director of the movie plays one of the best new characters. There really isn't much that I can add to the things that everyone else already is saying. It would sound that I'm just repeating every other review for this film. The truth is that ""Ragnarok"" is a very laid-back watch with some retro feels sprinkled in just the right scenes. Know this though; It doesn't strive to become emotionally engaging or inspirational in any way. It won't hit you in the feels as they say. But it's a funny space party where every friend is included and appreciated.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Thor is uneven but just so much fun,"This film is ridiculous.Lets get that out of the way but really any film with Thor in it let alone any of the Avengers is by definition, batshit crazy.The exception here is that Taika Waititi embraces the Crazy, he fosters it and it does pay off. Remember how bad Thor: Dark World was? Probably not, because like most traumatic incidents you have lost the memory. Where could Thor take a standalone film that was enjoyable and still maintain a link to the Avengers universe? Planet Hulk is where! The Marvel alchemists have taken numerous strands of lore and swirled them together to concoct the breathiest and most colourful confection in their short history. Guardians was funny because the characters were funny while Thor is funny because he is in on the joke.The problem then becomes one of tone. The film is peppering so many jokes and self deprecating nods that the structure becomes uneven which is most seen when the film creaks into Hero mode...you can hear the gears grinding.I am not a huge fan of Hemsworth but he is his most likable here and seems reinvigorated once that famous haircut takes place. The rest of the cast is amazing: Blanchett, Goldblum, Ruffalo, Hopkins and so on. There is just not enough time to go round. Cate Blanchett is brilliant as Hela and totally absorbs the screen whenever she is on. The character is underwritten and she still wrings something memorable from it.The film looks fantastic and most especially when they save their money shots for the big battles. Waititi employs a specific colour palette at times such as the Valkyrie battle which resembles a moving Renaissance painting and it is magnificent.The big question will be whether audiences buy into Waititis' gamble. Will they laugh at the NZ accents as Korg says ""Bro"" and ""New Doug""? If they do this will be a huge hit and a shot in the arm for the extended Marvel universe.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Zeppelin, Cate, Goldblum","Greetings again from the darkness. The ultimate cinematic dilemma  how to make the next comic book movie stand out from the (many, many) others? The brilliant answer comes from director Taika Waititi and co-writers Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle and Christopher Yost – a screwball superhero action film that delivers not only the required alien war scenes, but also a campy villain for the ages in a movie that may be the funniest of the year.For those who prefer their superheroes dark and brooding, this one will be a shock. Prepare for Jeff Goldblum as the Grandmaster – the most polite villain we've seen in awhile, and one who looks to be straight out of the 1960's ""Batman"" series. Chris Hemsworth as Thor is one of many returning actors/characters, only this time he really gets to flash his comic timing on top of his Thunder God biceps. His love- hate, trust-no trust, see-saw relationship with brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is in full force, as is the Bruce Banner banter with The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo). It's certainly more in line with GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY than the previous movies for Avengers.As much fun as Goldblum brings to the party, this is really Cate Blanchett's show. She is the frightening (with a dash of camp) Goddess of Death, and long-lost sister of Thor and Loki, and daughter of Odin (Anthony Hopkins). With a headdress that puts everyone at the Kentucky Derby to shame, Hela's enormous powers are such that she crumbles Thor's mighty hammer with little effort – just to remind everyone that big sisters are renowned for messing up younger brother's toys.Of course, with that title, we know that the story revolves around what could be the end of Asgard. Joining in the fun are: Idris Elba who is back as Heimdall, Tessa Thompson as a master of one-liners Valkyrie, Karl Urban as Skurge - rewarded with a wonderful exit scene, Ray Stevenson returns as Volstagg, and rocky alien Korg who is voiced by director Waititi. Fans of the series will be happy to know other familiar faces pop up periodically – one especially magical sequence teaches Loki a quick lesson.In addition to the main rescue story line, the powerful villains, and crazy aliens, there are numerous nods and tributes to previous versions (notably Planet Hulk, and Fantastic Four), and a hilarious early stage play with three cameos that make it clear, big time laughter is here to stay. It's fun to catch the reunions from such previous projects as Star Trek, JURASSIC Park and Westworld.Special acknowledgment goes to director Taika Waititi for hilariously taking the comic book film world down a different path. He's known for his comedic projects like HUNT FOR THE WILDERPEOPLE (one of my favs from 2016), WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS, and his work on the brilliant but short-lived ""Flight of the Conchords"". It's still very much a Marvel movie, with visible fingerprints of Stan Lee, Larry Lieber, and Jack Kirby. It's also a fantastic adventure film that sets the stage for next year's AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR, while also featuring the best use ever of Led Zeppelin's ""Immigrant Song"". So get ready to rock, roll and rollick in a film that is just about as much fun as you can have in a theatre.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Thor-tastic,"Thor Ragnarok is a fun and entertaining film. Reminded me a lot of Guardians of the Galaxy 2.

"Another C-Rate Director by Disney - No Taste, Spoofish Feel","Movie Mood Level: Spoofish.Not sure why Disney is letting bottom-shelf talent handle top-shelf content once again (Star Wars '17). The level of humor was drought, effortless, disappointing, overworked yet ever-trying, and must have been most likely very embarrassing for the actors at times. Was the choreography union on strike? Screenwriters too? Writers? Where was the talent aside from the actors?

Intergalactic Blockbuster,"Another win for Marvel. Phase three shows no signs of slowing down.The movies itself is a great stand alone film, but also does its part for the wider MCU. Thor has evolved from the serious, god-like character we knew after spending some years on Earth. His new found humor fits well without throwing away the development that has occurs in previous appearances. The dynamic between Thor and Loki continues to flourish; the latter remains a key factor into the franchise success. Hulk/Banner gets enough screen time to warrant a spot in the title. No one will ever tire of seeing Hulk smash on a scale as large as this. Stand out performance from Valkyrie. Excellent portrayal of a lesser-known character that shall no longer be lesser-known. Grandmaster goes full Goldblum. That should be enough to sell you on that character. Hela does not fit the mold of weak antagonist roles from past Marvel movies. Too powerful to disregard with motives to back her actions.Epic actions scenes on a larger than life scale. Worth a watch in IMAX.Some overuse of comedy but it's what you come to expect from a blockbuster appealing to the masses. Not once does it distract you from the threat at hand.A nice set up for Infinity War without seeming like a prequel.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Thor RagnaROCKED!,"*TWO* POST CREDIT SCENES TO WATCH!Great starting sequence was pure magic, the banter, cinematography and the ACTION! What I admired about this film is Taika Waititis brilliant humor, being from New Zealand appreciating it even more so. The action sequences were slick, crisp, and actually watchable - as opposed to many other movies who cover up the action with motion blur, too much camera work or just not enough scene time to appreciate the spectacle.Hulk and Thor were brilliant in this film, CGI was the best I've seen for the Hulk, and his scenes with Thor are hilariously funny. Hella was hellish and I loved it, her story interestingly made sense tying her into the movie and not making it feel forced. Supporting cast of Valkyrie, Skurge, Korg, Grandmaster, Loki, Odin etc... all had their place and they all had their moments to shine, which is hard to do in a movie with a plethora of characters.Only thing to note is the pacing is sometimes a bit abrupt going to and from other stories happening within the movie, but it's not a biggy at all. One small thing is some impactful and emotional scenes (which you'll know what I'm talking about) didn't feel like it had the depth or impact that it should of – Maybe it's just me, but I'll see this movie a few more times over and maybe edit this as I would have had more time to reflect on it.All in all, from start to finish Ragnarok is a roller coaster ride of beautiful action pieces, quirky and snappy humor and a flagship for other Superhero movies to strive Thor!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Epic Space Adventure which propels Chris Hemsworth's Thor to A-List Status!!!,"I just came back from seeing it and this movie is awesome man.1) the action scenes were top notch in this movie. Thor has never been this epic in the MCU. He does some pretty epic sh*t in this movie and he is definitely not under-powered anymore. Thor in unleashed in this, I love that.2) Marvel did a damn good job in hiding some spoilers in the trailers.3) design-wise, the movie is totally beautiful. not a single bad effect in the movie. even the scene that changed from city to field looks better on the actual big screen.4) the freaking soundtrack. absolutely perfect. Immigrant Song FTW.5) Hela is totally bad-ass too. powerful, commanding, with just the right amount of scenery-chewing. hell, a lot of characters are so delightfully over-the-top in this.6) great supporting cast too. Valkyrie owns everything the moment she enters the movie. even Surtur was pretty darn hardcore. and Korg is freaking hysterical. Man I loved Korg!7) the movie's got a lot of humor. that may be a problem to some..but, when it's time to take things seriously, the movie does exactly that. specially towards the spectacular third act, when real sh*t is going down, the humor dials back a ton. It is only during the Sakaar portions of the movie where most of the humour is, not without several moments of sincere character interaction of course.8) I thought what they did with the ""Ragnarok"" part was kind of genius. this may not be the Winter Soldier of Phase 3 they told us, but it does make some significant changes to the overall MCU, or at least, the Thor section of the MCU.9) The pacing of the movie was perfect. Plus there wasn't a single scene in which I felt bored.Overall this was one of Marvel's best films for me. It would definitely be in my top 5 marvel movies along with civil war, winter soldier, guardians of the galaxy and iron man 1. I'll probably rank it at 2nd or 3rd!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Get ready to Ragnarok & Roll - this film is the most fun you'll have in a cinema all year!,"In some alternate reality, a movie bearing the title of Thor: Ragnarok has taken itself very seriously indeed: full of literal doom and gloom, it's an apocalyptic drama about the End of Days, as prophesied by Norse mythology. Since that pretty much describes the world in which we currently live, it's actually rather fitting that Marvel's 17th studio film is something else entirely. In our reality, Thor: Ragnarok is a wild, wacky and very welcome blast of pure joy - a raucous comedy that fuses an intergalactic road trip with buddy comedy, brotherly rivalry and battle domes. Thank Thor (and director Taika Waititi) for that!We reunite with Thor (Hemsworth) - still free of new Infinity Stones, freshly confident that he's once again warded off the fabled Ragnarok - just as he discovers that something is rotten in the state of Asgard. As teased at the end of Thor: The Dark World, Loki (Hiddleston), his shape-shifting trickster brother, has been impersonating their ailing dad, Odin (Hopkins). When Odin's strength finally fails, the dark secret he's been keeping at bay storms into the lives of his sons: Hela (Blanchett), their bloodthirsty older sister, is back to claim the throne she believes is rightfully hers.For (largely) better or (occasionally) worse, Thor: Ragnarok doesn't dwell as much on the royal family drama as its predecessors did. Instead, its second act plays out on the candy-coated, death-dealing planet of Sakaar. Ruled by the whims and fancies of the Grandmaster (Goldblum dialled to 11), Sakaar's people are relentlessly entertained in their very own battle dome. (Think the gladiatorial contests of ancient Rome, with holographic screens and super-powered alien beings.) Following an initial devastating confrontation with Hela, Thor is stranded on Sakaar, and brought in by the mercenary Valkyrie (Thompson) to stand against the raging primal force of the Hulk (Ruffalo) - not quite the ""friend from work"" Thor remembers.If that all sounds like serious business, rest assured it's very much not. There's a gentle wit threaded through every frame of this film - a glorious, big-hearted silliness that fans of Taika Waititi will remember (and treasure) from such indie comedy gems as What We Did In The Shadows and Hunt For The Wilderpeople. Miraculously, Waititi has managed to infuse this gargantuan, green-screened epic with his trademark offbeat vibe, best exemplified in the way key plot points are revealed (via sardonic monologue or ironic stage play) and the character he plays (Korg, a chirpy rock monster who befriends Thor before our hero heads into the arena).Waititi's involvement is a blessing for pretty much everyone involved in the film, but especially for Hemsworth. It's not that he hasn't been good in his previous appearances as the God of Thunder throughout the franchise - he was suavely charming in Thor and resolutely grim in The Dark World. But he's so remarkably good here, switching effortlessly between bright-eyed puppy and care-worn leader, that it feels like he's finally come home. Hemsworth's performance in this film is a fantastic balance of sunshine, silliness and subversiveness, and it's a joy to behold.It's clear, too, that everyone in the cast - including respected veterans like Hopkins and Blanchett - were delighted to partake in the film's mirth and mayhem. Ruffalo continues to play the dual aspects of Bruce Banner - looming brute and mild-mannered professor - with so much winning charm that you want him to get his own Hulk movie, stat. Hiddleston is totally game for playing up the odd- couple comedy of Loki's rivalry with Thor, while shading unexpected complexity into his character's machinations. Thompson swaggers off with practically every scene she's in, finding the heart, humour and heroism in an Asgardian warrior who's lost her way.Perhaps more impressively, Waititi handles every Marvel blockbuster's requisite action scenes with more clarity and flair than you'd expect from an indie director. He manages to find character and comedy beats even in swooping spaceship chases and bruising hand-to-hand combat. There's a thrilling fluidity to the action sequences - whether it's Thor soaring towards his enemies like lightning made flesh, or Hela unleashing her multiple projectiles of death with a dark, graceful beauty.That's not to say Thor: Ragnarok is perfect. As it turns out, the film's greatest strength - apocalypse as afterthought - is also its biggest flaw. Waititi just about manages to find the emotional weight in Thor coming to terms with his power and leadership (a driving theme for this character), but it does get a little lost in all the knockabout comedy. Thanks to Blanchett, Hela is never less than terrifying: she oozes gleeful malevolence in her wake, forcing Thor to confront his own gold-tinted ideas of himself, his family and his history. Alas, she's also one of that peculiar breed of antagonist who's immeasurably powerful and strangely ineffective, all at the same time.For years, Marvel has been making brave choices in terms of the directors to whom it has entrusted its stories and characters. This strategy has yielded films that are, for the most part, creatively diverse, ranging in quality from decent to excellent. Even so, handing the reins of the Thor franchise to a director with such a unique voice as Waititi might have been its biggest gamble yet. Fortunately, it pays off in spades. Smart, silly and self-aware, Thor: Ragnarok is a blockbuster that feels like it snuck into cinemas by way of the art-house. It's also that rare threequel which isn't just as good as its predecessors - it's easily the best of the lot.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Arguably the best in MCU!,"This movie shows something I've never seen in MCU. It's amazing for its plot setting, pace, visual effect, music etc.They are telling the story right, and making it hilarious and exhilarating. Every role is developed and paid adequate amount of attention. So glad to see that Hulk was finally given more personality.I also liked the female characters in this one, both very bad ass fighters, no unnecessary romantic entanglement as the previous works. (I mean, it's not about Jane herself, she's fine, but was written in a way that doesn't really fit in or helpful to the plot.)btw I watched it in BFI IMAX. It was such an experience! Would highly recommend 3D or IMAX for it's visual effects.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Thor goes wild in this 80's infused superhero comedy,"It's hard to know how Thor acolytes will feel about the God of Thunder's latest solo adventure, with New Zealand director Taika Waititi turning the previous Shakespearian meets modern day blockbuster like first two outings on their heads with his laughter focused/80's infused action comedy that is likely to appeal to a broader audience while also alienating some hard-core fans in the process.It's not like Thor from 2011 and Dark World from 2013 are exactly overly well-loved properties, Thor the character finding a broader appeal and resonance in the Avenger films, but Waititi's departure from what has come before is one of the greatest change of paces for a series I've ever seen.Gathering a passionate if small fan base from his work directing films Boy, What We Do in the Shadows and the critical smash Hunt for the Wilderpeople, those that have adored Waititi's work on a small budget will be pleased to know his oddball sense of humour and playful directing is still well and truly in-tact with a Marvel budget behind his every wish and imaginative idea.Barely taking a chance to catch a breath over 2 hours of runtime, Waititi throws the audience headfirst into Thor's newest life or death outing as the muscled god with a freshly minted haircut (courtesy of a particularly excited hairdresser) finds himself trying to escape Sakaar, a planet run by Jeff Goldblum's camp Grandmaster all the while dealing with his dastardly adopted brother Loki, his angry green friend Hulk/Bruce Banner and most pressingly Cate Blanchett's new villainess Hela, who has taken over Thor's home world of Asgard.It's a multi-stranded plot line but it's all there as an excuse and fodder for Waititi to showcase a new side of Thor whose grown into himself and learnt more about the universe from his time on Earth, as well as a reason to team Hemsworth with Mark Ruffaloo's Hulk as the two share a great on screen chemistry as mismatched friends.As to be expected with a Waititi film, the characters and humour are what makes his features resonate with audiences around the world and he gifts Hemsworth his best take on Thor yet while newcomers to the series Tessa Thompson as feisty warrior and likely fan favourite Valkyrie, Waitit himself doing the voice of rock fighter Korg, Goldblum as Grandmaster and Blanchett as lead antagonist Hela all fair well, clearly having a blast with Waititi's wacky and often inventive situations and executions.As fun and visually captivating as most of Waititi's movie is, Ragnarok still struggles to bring the narrative arc of the story full circle and with Waititi still undoubtedly needing to mould his film into what lays ahead for the Marvel universe, as a whole the final section of the film suffers from a rather forgettable and bland finishing act that feels incredibly lacklustre to what has come before it.Caught up also with the arc of Thor being on Sakaar, Waititi struggles to make the most of Blanchett's Hela and her whole period on Asgard never really gets out of first gear and it becomes an arguable statement that perhaps Waititi took on board to much at once and sections of the film feel the pressure from so many things going on at once.Final Say –Ragnarok is Thor gone wild, a film that's an over the top colourful mash-up of 80's stylings, action tics while on a constant search for the next punch-line.A Marvel experience that will once more light up the international box office and become a quick-fire audience favourite, there's not a lot of lasting appeal to Waititi's film other than the likelihood of it being a guilty pleasure of the Marvel film series but it's one of the years silliest and sensory overloading blockbusters that provides a great bang for your buck adventure and more laughs in a single scene than most mainstream comedies could conjure up in an entire runtime.3 ½ eager hairdresser's out of 5",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

MCU's most audacious entry yet.,"*Just to note, ""Do You Find This Review Helpful?"" doesn't mean if you agree with the reviewer's opinion or not, but rather, it means if the review actually describes the film, and what are its pros and cons. So please, don't just click 'No' below instantly. Thanks!*Thor: Ragnarok is the 17th film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I brought that up just to tell you that Marvel is still standing strong until today, even at its seventeenth film, and the fact that this is one of my favorite Marvel films.I'm glad the film takes Thor differently. Unlike the first two, which are both mostly boring and trying to be very serious, this film is fun, and energetic.The best thing about this film is that it's probably the most fun entry of MCU. It's 90% filled with humor. Almost all of the main actors in the cast steals the movie. Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, Cate Blanchett, and even Taika Waititi as Korg. They were all very interesting and funny characters, thanks to these actors that did great in their roles.I also have to give props to Taika Waititi for his direction. The film feels very fast-paced (in a good way), energetic, and fun overall. The reason why it's different to most of what MCU gave us so far is that, again, it's filled with humor most of the time. It's just a straight up superhero-comedy film. And that's what makes is MCU's most audacious film yet.Sure, the previous MCU films may have humor, but throughout the film, it's laughs and giggles. Though it sounds bad that the film is mainly comedic, the way the comedy is executed is very well done.Another plus for me is the action is very well-executed and visually stunning. The film is very colorful, and I loved the animation for the closing credits.The only flaw for me in this film is that there may be a lot of jokes in some scenes. There's this one joke, and then there's another. In return, the viewer wouldn't handle all of it. It's a minor flaw, but I thought of it, so I had to include it here.Overall, it's a very fun and colorful film. Easily the best of the Thor films, one of Waititi's best works as a director, and one of MCU's best efforts.Final Rating: 9/10 <> A",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Packed with Marvel references, gorgeous action and more genuine laughs than most comedies, Thor: Ragnarok is an absolute blast!","After a total of seventeen films in less than ten years, it's pretty safe to say that Marvel has safely established itself as a popular, successful franchise with its own identity. Known for comedy, references to its other films and comics, and epic, fun action, every Marvel film is at least enjoyable. However, there are some that peak; some that can be included in the best Marvel films - and sometimes best films in the superhero genre. Films like this are the first Avengers, The Winter Soldier, Civil War, Guardians of the Galaxy - and also Thor: Ragnarok. Definitely a highlight so far in the Marvel anthology, Thor: Ragnarok is one of the best, delivering everything you want and expect with a little bit more, brimming with fun, personality and action.Anyone who's seen director Taika Waititi's vampire-comedy mockumentary What We Do in the Shadows will likely expect his inimitable and delightful brand of humour to extend to his Marvel entry (perhaps they've learned since getting rid of Edgar Wright from Ant-Man). It's fortunate that he kept his comedy as it really delivers and fits in well with the comedic personality that Marvel has crafted itself; some of their best films are also, by no coincidence, also the funniest (something DC fails with) and Waititi has continued this trend, while keeping the laughs fresh and genuinely funny. Not that this is a out-and-out comedy - not all the jokes are intended to make you laugh out loud; but they never feel forced and all lend themselves to the personality of the film (and the franchise) and really maximise the fun we have watching the movie. After all, this is a film about a traditional Norse God as a superhero fighting alongside a big, angry, green rage monster - it's important to have fun with it!'Fun' is certainly one of the best words to describe Thor: Ragnarok and it doesn't extend to just the laughs. Other enjoyable elements include references to the wider MCU to excite geeks and non-geeks alike. They all fit in well and seamlessly, not a shoehorned, forced reference or cameo; they all seem organic and make sense to the plot. It's delightful to see Dr Strange, even just for one scene, and to be able to spy glimpses of the Tesseract and a fake Infinity Gauntlet. These add to the rewatch value in a few years time.The crazy, kinetic action really does extend to the whole of the film, from beginning to end, each sequence excellently choreographed. It doesn't shy away from its roots from comics as some of the fights are just as delightfully eccentric and over-the- top. Still they never cease to entertain and, more than that, some are just stunning to behold; the flashback to Valkyrie battling Hela the first time, her army atop a hoard of winged horses soaring through an orange sky only to be cut down by swords and spikes flying towards them in slow- motion. These are gorgeous scenes and Waititi and cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe should be proud; the beauty of some of Zack Snyder's superhero moments, but in a good film with much more personality.Most of this movie's joy lies in its characters though; at the end of the day, it might be funny and the action might look cool, but if we don't love the characters, we won't love the film. Back again we get the usual ensemble of returning characters - Thor, Loki, Odin and Heimdall. All are as regal, fun and charismatic as ever, Hemsworth and Hiddleston in particular; it's wonderful to see these actors develop their characters over the last few films into lovable parts in a franchise full of heroes we already love. I feel Hopkins deserved a little more screen time and a chance to get more emotional, but, ever the professional, he makes the most with what he has (and is exceptionally good as Loki pretending to be Odin). Returning characters from elsewhere in the MCU Dr Strange and Hulk also add to the delightful ensemble; it's nice to see Strange solidifying his presence in the franchise after just one film (particularly when comparing to Tony Stark having been in six so far, not including post-credit cameos). It's a relief too to finally give Hulk a decent amount of screen time and for us to get to know him as opposed to just Banner; they're two distinct characters within each other and it's about time we get to see more of everyone's favourite rage monster.The new characters introduced in this film are all excellent worthy additions to the Marvel roster and bring a refreshing touch with them. Tessa Thompson is excellent and charismatic as kick-ass female hero Valkyrie, able to confidently stand among Thor, Hulk and Loki. Korg may not be quite the same character he is in the comics, but Waititi takes this part (who wouldn't give themselves a minor role in the MCU if they can?!) and really makes it his own, saving lots of the quirky laughs for himself. Cate Blanchett too is a particularly fantastic villain, sure to stand amongst the best Marvel villains so far, heads and shoulders above the likes of Malekith and Ronan. She's less generic, less monologue-y and never boring; able to kick ass and be just as evilly sexy as Helena Bonham-Carter was as Bellatrix (or is that just me...?). And of course there's Jeff Goldblum who's as Jeff Goldblum as he's ever been - who doesn't love that?!Thor proves himself to be the God of Thunder and Thor: Ragnarok proves itself to be one of the Gods of Marvel, standing proud amongst the best so far. The whole movie's an absolute blast, packed with references, gorgeous action and more genuine laughs than most comedies. An excellent film to round off Marvel in 2017 - let's hope Black Panther keeps up this level of excellence.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
An enjoyable superhero film,"This film tells the story of the God of Thunder, who is trapped on a waste planet and has to win a tournament in order to gain back his freedom. In the meantime, he has to race against time to stop an evil force destroying Asgard.Perhaps inspired by the success of ""Deadpool"", ""Thor: Ragnarok"" has comedic elements beefed way up. It gets to a point where I think there is too much comedy and not enough heroic demeanor. Fortunately, the balance of comedy and heroic action is successfully struck by the middle of the film. The jokes in the second half of the film induces giggles, but do not distract viewers from the story. The story is intense and the visuals are great. Cate Blanchett is stylish and yet chill inducing in her new look and feel that I have not seen in any of her previous film. I feel a little sad about what happens to the main character, and I wish it did not turn out that way.

RagnaROCK!!!,"Let's get rid of this """"Aw,but the Ragnarok event in mythology has great battles, foretold to ultimately result in the death of a number of major figures (including the gods Odin, Thor, Týr, Freyr, Heimdallr, and Loki), the occurrence of various natural disasters"""" nonsense.Cause these movies don't have to stick to the myth or comic books,100%.They should make changes for the sake of the movie.For instance,in NORSE MYTH,fenrir(the giant dog) is the son of Loki and hela is also the child of Loki. Now tell me how the hell Marvel is gonna show us Hela and Fenrir as Loki's children??Loki is already a well established and grounded character.At this point,I don't think any director/writer could change Loki's past and introduce Fenrir and Hela,as Loki's kids cause this would also bring tons of questions,plot holes and flaws.For the sake of MCU continuity,Marvel HAD TO make changes in the Norse Myth and in the comics.The performances of the main cast are impressive and exceptional.This movie also showed us the real ""God of Thunder"".For the first time he was extremely powerful without his hammer.That lighting streaming all over his body was pure awesomeness.This movie is mostly targeted for everybody except for joyless,moody,edgy people who are allergic to have fun and have a boring,dull life. The CGI,fight scenes,epic battles,monsters etc..kinda remind me LOTR.Also,when I ve read the first reviews of this,some critics were praising the soundtracks too.Wow..they were completely right this movie's soundtrack list is on the same level with GotG 1 which was perfect.They finally gave hulk a personality.Even though he looks all big,formidable and scary,he was kinda adorable every time he talks:).So glad they finally made him talk.They really improved his CGI.The best version of Hulk in MCU.The haircut made him better too.Tessa Thompson surprised me with her performance.I still hear some people complaining about the color of her skin.Cause she doesn't look like Valkyrie in myth.Well,she doesn't have to actually.All I care about is,her performance.And she did really good.So put another major hit on MCU.They did it again.We have another MCU movie approved by critics and audiences.They have successful track record since 2008.Unlike some people's petty,shallow claims,I don't think marvel is always using the same formula again and again since 2008.Cause if they fallowed that path since 2008,people wouldn't watch their movies for the past 9 years.And they definitely couldn't create the highest-grossing franchise of the planet without their major players like Fantastic 4,X-men and Spider man.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

If you're a kid, you probably like pretty colors, lots of characters, and wackiness.As a movie though, it's like this one has too many ingredients and no time to make sure everything fits together and has cooked properly. Exactly like kids making their dinner on their own, and then end up with a mess everywhere and giggle about it.Maybe it's because the writers were given an impossible task, like telling a chef to use everything inside a mall for one dish. ""You can't put cat litter in food"" -sure you can, it fits in the pot and we've already paid for it.The result is busy introducing new characters, fierce characters doing stupid stuff, all the while trying to keep the story intact and then giving up, which is the actual ending of the movie.There were many things along the way that showed like they struggled with the mess and took easy solutions with their hands up. Dialogs shot with experienced actors, which gave serious Owe Boll vibes and should have been rewritten, reshot, or left on the cutting room floor. And how do we solve the problem of getting the God of Thunder captured? With a bug zapper. Next problem.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Thor:Ragnarok example why Marvel outclasses DC over and Over,"Superb Experience and characters to make even a non fanboy geek out on them totally. While DC have destroyed classic concepts and Characters by employing c-grade writers both in comics (JL:Gods among Us) and movies (Batman Vs Superman, a wasted opportunity) while time and again Marvel really produce one roller-coaster after another.The way they create old stories with new addition and mix up and slowly present awesome surprising characters to create new story-line to enjoy is just unbelievable.

"Entertaining, and yet...","I saw this movie a few days ago. And i liked it enough to write a review. Although... i liked it, yet it also had some major flaws that need to be pointed out.Tradition-wise... Good sides first:The Acting: The acting is overall good, as we can expect from Marvel by now. They hardly ever get a serious miss-cast and they did not have it here either. The lines are good, the story is solid and the overall feeling of the movie is absolutely entertaining. Also newcomers like Cate Blancett (Hela) and Karl Urban (Skurge) were part of the world immediately.CGI: Again a no-brainer with Marvel, yet i'd like to point it out anyway, mostly because it is heavily relying on CGI. We spend our entire movie either in Asgard or on other worlds, and practically no time on earth. A lot of blue-screen and CGI had to go into this for it to look even remotely good.Story: The story on itself is not a bad one. Thor comes back from saving another day and finds out that Loki has taken Odin's throne (we knew that from The Dark World). But then Hela comes in and tries to claim Asgard for her own and banishes the brothers. Thor becomes a gladiator (somehow) and Loki is up to his usual mischief. Slightly predictable when it comes to characters and story, yet entertaining nonetheless.Now for the bad sides... because every movie has those.Acting: It is also listed as a good side, yet it has become predictable. The characters have lines that are their trademarks. Thor being bad-ass, Loki being mischievous again and all the characters are no different. We know it by now, and despite that it is part of their character... there is little new there. Although... that is not true, because:....Jokes: .... they now have jokes. I have no idea where this came from, but the entire movie felt like a buddy-action-comedy. There was not the more serious Marvel feel that we had during Thor 1 or The Avengers. A few gags here and there, but still during a serious story. Now the one joke came after the other, with almost slap-stick like comedy. This is definitely the biggest thing that i do not like about this movie.New characters like Jeff Goldblum's 'Grandmaster' were awkward as hell. I don't know why Marvel felt the need to do this, but it did not feel right. The only jokes that were worth it were the ones we saw during the trailers, but the rest were made by characters that had no real sense of humor before. And that was also the main reason why this felt so out of place. Thor was never the joking kind of guy... yet now he made about a dozen jokes. The characters felt almost re-written to suddenly, and inexplicably, be more funny. This was a definite misfire.Overall it was an entertaining movie, but the joking around was almost cringe-worthy at times. It put a huge damper on the overall feeling of what a Marvel Movie should have. I like the movie... don't get me wrong.... but they should go back to the original, and more serious, mood of storytelling. 6.5",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
An utter blast,"Both missing in action since the end of Avengers: Age of Ultron, Thor and Hulk could be seen as the forgotten children of the MCU, and when they're two of the most popular characters with fans, that seems quite criminal to me. The two haven't really been done justice in their solo films yet, even though I'm a big fan of Thor, but with Taika Waititi on board to direct Thor: Ragnarok, my expectations were sky high.Imprisoned on the planet Sakaar, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is pitted against the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), a former ally, in a gladiatorial duel to determine whether he can travel back to Asgard and put a stop to Hela (Cate Blanchett) and her apocalyptic tendencies toward Asgardian civilisation.It's testament to Marvel Studios that, even with Thor: Ragnarok being the seventeenth film of the MCU, they can still produce work as unique and exhilarating as they have here. Taika Waititi has worked wonders to inject the Thor solo films with such vibrancy of colours and characters, leading to Thor: Ragnarok becoming one of my favourite entries into the MCU so far.With Waititi involved, I was expecting this film to be funny however, I was nowhere near prepared for just how funny it ended up being. Seriously guys, there are plenty of moments that caused raucous laughter from the audience, Thor and Hulk giving the Guardians of the Galaxy a run for their money as the funniest MCU heroes. It's the screenplay from Eric Pearson that should take most of the credit, along with some of the brilliant new characters we're introduced to, Korg in particular played by Waititi himself being one of the MCU's most welcome additions.The action, of which there is plenty, is driven by the retro vibes of Mark Mothersbaugh's score and even Led Zeppelin's Immigrant Song, which kicks the finale into overdrive particularly well. Javier Aguirresarobe's cinematography combines seamlessly with the expectedly stunning visual effects to create an almost psychedelic sense to the action sequences.Coming to the performances, Thor: Ragnarok features a strong ensemble cast, pretty much all of them showing some fine comedy instincts at one point in the film. Chris Hemsworth leads the film with such a confident performance, matching both the cockiness and naivety of his character to great effect. Much like people say Robert Downey Jr. is Tony Stark, I just can't imagine anyone else playing Thor.The supporting performances make this such a special film, Mark Ruffalo doing some great work as the Hulk/Bruce Banner, keeping his place as one of the best actors within the MCU. Tom Hiddleston returns to the role of Loki and he's expectedly wicked, making it easy to see why he's such a favourite with the fans, while MCU newcomer Tessa Thompson shows plenty of potential to become a future fan favourite with a performance full of grit and fire as Valkyrie. If you're a fan of Jeff Goldblum then I'd just like to say you won't be disappointed with his performance as Grandmaster, a character just as eccentric as Goldblum himself.I really liked Cate Blanchett as Hela, the villainess of the piece. While she may succumb to the weak villain syndrome that plagues superhero films these days, I felt that she suited the tone they were aiming for with Thor: Ragnarok. If the heroes can have some fun, why can't the villains have some as well?Thor: Ragnarok finally gives Thor the solo film he deserves as one of the original Avengers, full of laughs and plenty of heart, the road to Avengers: Infinity War is nearly complete. I, for one, cannot wait.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Fantastic action but ...,So I saw Thor Ragnarok last night. I have given it 7/10Pros: .Funnier than most marvel films .Amazing visuals .Thor being amazing .Fantastic fight scenes .More hulk .threat seemed more real (unlike civil war and homecoming)Cons: .Too many reminders of guardians of the galaxy like the music and planet scenery .Too much forced humour which didn't need to be thereIt was very enjoyable overallBut I miss marvel movies like winter soldier and ones going back before the avengers as none relied on humour.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Some humor and some satire, but uneven","This Taika Waititi take on superhero genre is original and feels different, but he does not quite feel comfortable in this sort of movies. The fake promotional interviews felt better as that was the medium his wacky humor could fit better.Overall, there are quite a few amusing bits, and the movie does not take itself too seriously. Some biting satire is chimed in, my personal favorite being about ""prisoners with jobs"".",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Weakest MCU Movie so far.,"A little goofiness is OK. But Thor has too much of it. Was expecting an Epic, Action filled, dramatic Thor film, not a silly space comedy. And it ain't that funny also. Not like Guardians or even Ant Man. Those are funny and well made. This one is a train wreck. The weakest movie of the MCU so far. It's a bad joke. The characters had so much potential, but everything was wrong. Bad acting, Bad jokes, Valkyrie and Jeff Goldblum being certainly the worst. Odin's scenes were horrendous. What a mess. No emotions, no story background. Feels like a rushed product, made by a cinema first year student. The previous Thor movies were so majestic and dramatic. This one looks like a bad B movie with great CGI. No serious Thor or Marvel fan will think this movie is good or fun. So Disappointed. Waste of money. Awful.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Forgettable,The start of the movie clearly was heavily gutted with scenes no longer that 30 seconds which felt really bad. Cheap and childish forced jokes that were not fun (excluding a few of them) and many scenes with clear bad acting. This movie feels like it was filmed in like a month and the editors worked with what they got. It's a movie that tried too hard to be guardians of the galaxy but became a parody of it. Its entertaining but nothing I got thrilled to watch. Something you watch when there is nothing special to watch anyway.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Tries too Hard but it's Still Fun,"There's a lot to like about Thor Ragnarok. Naturally, everyone's talking about the heavy dose of comedic elements, but I found that 80% of the jokes felt forced and unfunny, and 10% were misplaced. However, there were few groaners or eye-rollers so it was OK. I did like the tone of the movie, though, and Chris Hemsworth's comedy chops are quite impressive. It was nice to see him work with such diverse material. The plot wasn't great, but it was good enough.My favorite parts of this movie were the interactions between Thor and Loki. That's such an interesting relationship and I'm glad they gave it some screen time here. Characters like Loki I find very interesting, that is, anti-heroes with complex motivations.Everything else was pretty good, not super great, but good enough.

Thor Ragnarok,"First things first, if you like Marvel Studio films then you're going to enjoy this one. If you dislike Marvel Studio films (why?) then this one isn't going to convince you to jump on board with the MCU. Thor and Hulk/Banner team up and the banter between the two is at times very funny. Tessa Thompson did give a decent performance as Brunnhilde, but to be honest, I'd rather have had Jaimie Alexander's Sif in this flick as we've got history with that character. However, I definitely see Brunnhilde becoming integral part of the MCU and can see her character being expanded upon if they make a Thor 4.The soundtrack (which I loved), CGI, and action all complement the movie. Taika Waititi directing was, as always superb and I would love to see Marvel Studios give him more projects to work on. I think his humor would fit Spider-Man or Iron Man pretty well.The reason this doesn't get ten stars because yet again the villain is underdeveloped and although we're told time and time again that Hela is this all powerful Goddess I don't quite feel it. I can't really discuss it without going into spoilers, but I found the character underwhelming a bit. However, Cate Blanchett was amazing both to look at and her performance.I would highly recommend you go see this. Probably best Superhero movie of the year in my opinion.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
The God of Thunder-ous Laughter.,"Let me get this out of my system, Thor: Ragnarok is one of the most fun I had at the movies in 2017. It's one of those movies that had everything. Action? Check. Comedy? Check. Amazing VFX? Check. Hulk being a God-smashing maniac? Double-check. This is definitely the best out of the Thor series. The two previous ones were just generic superhero movies. They weren't bad, they were pretty good. But as soon as you left the theater, you won't be thinking about it anymore.This one, however, wasn't generic. It was different. We were used to seeing Thor as this almighty God with a hammer that nobody can lift. And that's pretty much it. To be honest, I never cared much about Thor. He just wasn't that interesting. But this movie drew sort of a parody of his image and it was really fun to watch. And let's not forget about the Hulk. He is so lovable in this movie. How do you even make a person want to cuddle a 10-foot green abomination? You got to be a genius or some kind. Marvel appointed Taika Waititi to direct this movie. An indie darling from New Zealand that made comedy hits like What We Do in the Shadows, Eagle vs. Shark, and most recently, The Hunt for the Wilderpeople. They all have this unique dry humor that I adore very much. And he brought his signature style again for this movie. I respect this move by Marvel because a lot of studios are afraid of trying new things. A lot of directors were left with minimal creative decisions when it comes to big blockbusters. One of the case was the Fantastic Four reboot by Fox, two years ago. Josh Trank was so frustrated at Fox's dominating involvement in his project that he eventually took his frustration to the social media. Marvel don't want this to happen. They bravely take the risk of giving directors creative decisions. Though sometimes it could result to a mixed bag like Iron Man 3, it could also be a smashing hit like Guardians of the Galaxy and Thor: Ragnarok.In the end, this movie is a total blast from start to end. It may be different than the other Marvel movies, but I swear there is nothing to regret. Whatever this movie lacks in dramatic aspects, it makes up in its comedy and fun characters along the way. And by today, I know that Thor isn't on my Top 2 Most Boring Avenger list anymore. Though Hawkeye is definitely still there. Make the poor guy relevant Marvel, jeez.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Guardians of the Galaxy Attempt - Failed,"This is a Marvel Guardians of the Galaxy attempt that failed big time.If you are a Marvel fan and know the comics right this movie is an utter disgrace to the Thor character - I agree with every reviewer who stated that. I can't figure why Marvel drag this movie in the direction of a comedy - comedy carrier away big time.I'm also surprise by the IMDB 8+ rating on this... Perhaps its the same Guardians of the Galaxy audience that enjoy lite and fun movies who aren't necessarily Marvel fans either. So, you can easily see how people who voted this movie are in two opinions, either very low rating for this movie being an unbearable comedy or high rating for being nothing but a fun superhero movie.I had high expectations but walking away very disappointed. This movie had great potential for that budget and time spent...Marvel - Hoping your studios don't get carried away and side track from making good Marvel movies.

Not So Good,"Saying this is the best Thor movie is like saying Rampage is the best Uwe Boll movie (well Rampage is better than all the Marvel movies that's for sure). It's true, but it doesn't really mean much. When the bar is so low there's nowhere to go but up.Comedy is one of, if not the most, subjective genre in cinema. If the humour doesn't click with you, it's pretty much impossible to judge whether the jokes work or not, leaving you with only the story to latch onto. And the story is cliché: Hero doubting, losing or giving up their powers then getting them back. It's a tired and overused trope ever since Superman II. It's not a very good trope either and a lazy way to raise the stakes. I don't know why writers and directors love it so much. Not to mention the first Thor movie already did that.I can already tell how the pitch meeting went:Feige: Taika, people loved Guardians of the Galaxy, so make it a GOTG style comedy. People love the Hulk, so put the Hulk in it. People love buddy movies, so make it a buddy movie too. Oh, and have Thor lose his powers because that's totally something we haven't seen before in a superhero movie.Waititi: But, I can put my own personal stamp on it, right?Feige: Nope.Waititi: Okay, I have to pay the bills I guess.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

The concept is one of the best you can see in superhero movies.They balanced the humor and seriousness perfectly.There were also brutal moments which will surprise you.Especially the 3rd act is pretty brutal.I heard the laughter of audience almost on every funny moment of the movie.

Waititi Thor,"Chapter Five of Phase Three in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.I am a fan of the Marvel movies and a fan of Taika Waititi. I was surprised when he was tapped to direct Thor: Ragnarok and I was even more happily surprised that Taika Waititi kept his voice throughout the movie.The movie feels almost like a reboot that takes the Thor character in a new, less serious direction. The action remains but is surrounded by brighter colors and more campy characters (Jeff Goldblum as Grandmaster is a hoot and the wonderful Rachael House brings a sly tongue-in-cheek shade to Topaz).It looks like it was fun to make and it was fun to watch and, as Taika Waititi also bring a sweet emotional edge that resonates by the end.If I have a question, it would have to be ""Where next?""

Satisfying muscular myth and light humor.,"""Asgard is not a place, it's a people."" Odin (Anthony Hopkins)Thor: Ragnarok is about saving a homeland, Asgard, but eventually not the physical land. It's all about the people, a gentle allusion to the plight today of immigrants who have become travelers while bringing home with them. People leaving in a space ship like an ark carry the Biblical heft and a swashbuckling sci-fi adventure.So the redeeming element of these heroic films from Marvel, and DC for that matter, is the cultural mash up that reflects our civilization's abiding interest in how we can become better than we are, i.e., becoming super heroes, and yet retain the sweet, flawed humanity we were meant to be. The pervasive humor in quips and self deprecation is a welcome humane ingredient and a sign that the super hero genre is maturing.In Thor :Ragnorak, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is not just a hemmer-throwing, muscle bound cutie; he is a young man dealing with the death of his father, Odin; the mischief of his brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston); and the devastating power of his sister, Hela (Cate Blanchett), the goddess of death. A bit more severe than yours and my families, but in a figurative way, just the same with its challenging relationships that sometime seem bloody.Although these space citizens are years ahead of us, they still fight with broadswords and machine guns, confirming our cultural awareness that battles will never really be different because they reside in the mind. From Greeks through now, we have been fascinated by our highs and lows, our greatness and our flaws, be it in Oedipus Rex or Willy Lowman.There will always be a place for hubris in our theater and films, and although the time and technology may differ, we still love and deplore our bloodlines as we work our way to dusty death. This Thor carries too many explosions for my taste, but the sociological thunderstorms are satisfyingly entertaining and sometimes downright allegorical.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"not bad, better than Thor Love and thunder","""Thor: Ragnarok"" (2017) smashes onto the screen with a delightful and colorful 7/10 spectacle that's as entertaining as it is quirky.

Director Taika Waititi's unique comedic touch invigorates the franchise, bringing a refreshing blend of humor and action to the forefront. While the film's strength lies in its witty banter and creative world-building, its weakness could be a slightly formulaic plot.

80s Style Action,"I will keep it brief; this movie was akin to some cult action/superhero movies from 80s like Flash Gordon with the pace, kind of imagery it had, the balance of action/interaction in a humour loaded format, choice of tracks in OST and the way said music is capitalized in the movie.I am a middle aged person who loved Flash Gordon back in days and Ragnarok was almost a nostalgic experience for me. I enjoyed most choices in the movie even the ones that are most criticized such as easy discarding of Fandrall and Volstagg. For me those simply were used as highlighters of how Hela is in a league of her own that's simply beyond challenge. The ease they let people perish (akin to hawkmen charge in Flash Gordon) along disco music was also one of the factors where I enjoyed that nostalgic fan ride.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Its fun, its energetic and its often hilarious to watch. Its a complete tone change from the previous two Thor movies - the second in particular - and its all the better for it. While its a shame that some familiar characters couldn't make an appearance, and some did only briefly, I don't think the movie suffers horribly for their absence.

Sought the essence and becomes the best Marvel movie.,"Everyone knows that Marvel movies are well produced, the company that was founded by Stan Lee already skidded in the past, but currently more hits than misses. Unfortunately your failure in the past was to have sold the copyright to some of his heroes to other producers, that tactic was used not to break in a time of crisis of movie heroes. With the explosion of movies from Spider-man (2002) the company carried on and went back to producing movies of their heroes. The first Thor movie was released in 2011, and it was a great movie. I recall the success this film has done at the time. but the second film Thor the dark world (2013) are no longer managed to be so good. Film has multiple errors in the narrative and it was very confusing, and had no villain.Thor Ragnarok begins two years after the Avengers (2012). Thor is the defending world and still does not know that your brother seized the Throne from his father in the second movie. Upon returning to Asgard discovers that your brother is leading and that your father is missing. With this he begins a long journey in search of your father along with Loki. On the way ends up having a hand of Dr. strange ""scene that is post movie credit Dr. strange"". Thor just knowing that Asgard is in danger and that Cate Blanchett (Hela) is on his way to kill everyone. He ends up finding the Hulk on the way back to Asgard in search of resume peace and order.Thor Ragnarok managed to bring the essence of Marvel after a few years. Film is very well written, has amazing graphics and impresses in the narrative. Hulk works great the hero is in your best shape and performance since the Avengers (2012), who had an excellent performance and left the film even more complete. Cate Blanchett (Hela) has an impeccable performance to me she was a great villain of the Marvel movies, your character really scary. The film is full of action with a quality humor without being forced. Chris Hemsworth (Thor) and Tom Hiddleston (Loki) still has a great chemistry on screen that has been creating over the time together really work well and makes the story even more fluid. Marvel hit movie and managed to overcome other great long as, Avengers (2012) and Civil War (2016).The third film of Thor is the best Marvel movie ever made! Time for fun is guaranteed.

Unexpected fun,"This is the not the film I was expecting. As the third entry in the ""Thor"" franchise, I anticipated a traditional super-hero movie like the previous two: lots of drama and threat and the occasional humorous one-liner. But this is actually the funniest by far of all the works in the Marvel canon (now 17 films) and has clearly been influenced substantially by the commercial success of the two ""Guardians Of The Galaxy"" movies which came out in between ""Thor: The Dark World"" and ""Thor: Ragnarok"".This makes for an immensely entertaining outing but inevitably dials down the tension. As well as different writers, we have to thank for the new style New Zealand director Taika Waititi who additionally voices the granite character Korg who could have stomped straight out of a ""GOTG"" film.As always with super-hero movies, we have lots of noise and colour together with splendid sets and effective special effects, but ultimately what makes this movie work is the cast. As well as Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston as brothers Thor and Loki, we have the wonderful Cate Blanchett as their gorgon-like sister Hela, another enjoyable female actress Tessa Thompson as a Valkryie, Mark Ruffalo as the Incredible Hulk, and the delightful Jeff Goldblum as an unlikely- looking villain called simply Grandmaster.The plot is rather confusing (but essentially Ragnarok = the destruction of Asgard) and the humour sometimes juvenile (a cosmic star gate is called ""the Devil's Anus""), but the whole thing is such F-U-N.Marvel movies always have a teaser clip at the end and this time we are treated to two: one early in the credits and one at the very end. The humour never stops.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
great film,"Acting: 10/10. Surprised?Action: 10/10. Are you really!?Comedy: 9/10, taika waititi hit my funnybone in many scenes, but sometimes missed in some key moments in the story. I still laughed my ass offCamera-work/cinematography: wow... a few mindblowing shots and a lot of kirby inspired set pieces that put me right back in 1991 reading my comics like a supernerd i wasStory: 9/10 The First and the last act are both so so exciting that the second act lacks the speed the first and last were going on. Im not used to that nowadays where the third act always slows down the film. It is a cool change up. It does tie in to infinity war, you whiney nerds. they actually listen to your dopey wishes. the post credit scene will bblow your damn mind and make you jizz your pants.all in all, go see it opening nights because it has LOADS of sppoilers for future stuff. you'll love it. in the conversation for best marvel films for sure. even superhero films.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Valhalla, I'm Coming!","Marvel, how do you do it? You make movies that this superhero/comic book illiterate will go see. Not only that, but you made a Thor movie that really got my attention in the coming attractions. I used to think Thor was one of the more serious and boring Marvel films. I once caught the first film on a flight home somewhere and I totally slept through it. Well, out of nowhere comes Ragnarok, which injects serious comedic energy through the veins of the franchise. This is a goofy, funny little acting flick. Not so different from Guardians of the Galaxy, in fact. It takes itself so lightly and I was thrilled to see that. Comic book movies shouldn't be so gritty. Thor and Hulk romp on the screen like a reboot of Lethal Weapon. Jeff Goldblum is here and he's fantastic... as Jeff Goldblum. Let's face it, we wouldn't want him any other way. Cate Blanchett is dynamite. The beauty of this, as with most Marvel movies is that you will have a great time, regardless if you're familiar with the comic books or not.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Best MARVEL movie since Deadpool!,"This movie was so much fun! Seriously the third funniest MARVEL movie, right after Deadpool and GotG#1.

Garbage!,"Probably one of the worst movies I've ever paid to watch. Plot was predictable and corny and Hulk was an unnecessary addition to an already poorly written cast.

If you're under the age of 10 or like poorly written movies then this is for you.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Had a lot of issues with this film's presentation and marketing,"First of all, it was very obvious the director was a no-name beginner they took a gamble on. It was hard to take the movie seriously because it never took itself seriously. I like humor in my movies, but every scene tried to shoe in situational joke after joke to the point of absurdity. The blue rock man was the worst. I presume he was voiced by that annoying actor from Flight of the Conchords, Jerome whatever. The director got so obsessed with his jokes that the plot of the movie got lost in it all and it was hard to take Hela seriously.As for Hela, I could never buy her as a serious villain. Cate Blanchett did a good job, but she was an afterthought in this movie. You knew she was the bad guy, and that was that. Her story arc was as generic, boring and non-threatening as it gets. I mean, Thor has known his dad for what, thousands of years, but he never bothered to tell him about her? Really? No one else in Asgard told Thor and Loki about her? Not even the Frost Giant king? Come on. She comes and goes in the film barely registering an impression other than looking attractive. Karl Urban is totally wasted in the Marvel universe as a lame henchman when he's totally capable of much, much more. That was the biggest tragedy of the whole film.Marvel keeps pulling this stunt where a character's weapon, home or whatever gets destroyed, leaving the viewer wondering how the character will deal with this in the sequel. We all know what's going to happen, they're just going to have said weapon, home or equipment magically respawn and never explain what happened. They've done this with Iron Man's suits, Captain America's shield, Asgard's bifrost and now, Thor's hammer. You will see Thor get his hammer back in Infinity War without any sort of explanation. It's just bad storytelling.Last but not least, the trailers completely ruined the movie. It would have been a much better film without all the ads thrown in your face everywhere, revealing the Hulk's appearance in the movie and Hela destroying the hammer. There were no surprises. Dr. Strange could have easily been cut out without anything lost, why not spam the trailers with his scenes? There were plenty of other action scenes that would have spiced up the trailers just as well. I feel that the director of this film got boned as badly as the one who directed Terminator Genisys, who ironically, was the same guy who directed the last Thor! What are these studio exec fools thinking?The best thing about this movie was Tessa Thompson playing Valkyrie. She was another actress totally wasted on a lame sidekick role. Why not make her Captain Marvel? She's far more believable as a leading lady superhero than Brie Larson! What a WASTE. I'm going to presume they're going to make her the female Thor? Please don't do this, for the love of God.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Best Marvel yet...,"Don't listen to the purist cry babies. This is a non-stop joy ride of color, humor and action. All the characters are great and Cate Blanchett as the villain is epic.

Another really fun Marvel movie,"I saw many people in the internet complaining about the ""fun vibe"" of the movie. Well, guys, IT'S A MARVEL MOVIE! What the heck are you expecting?! The trailer sell me a fun movie, and this was exactly what I receive. Didn't you?Look, I'm a really critical about the excess of jokes in the Marvel movies, I really believe that in some of them it doesn't work at all (like Civil War, Age of Ultron, Doctor Strange). But here in Ragnarok for me was a improve, comparing with the other Thor movies (the first one suck, and the second it's fun, but not that much too).Chris Hemsworth has amazing comic skills (way better than his ""dramatic"" ones), Mark Rufallo is great too, Tom Hiddleston, etc etc (you get it, the cast is great).The movie isn't a master piece (like Joss Whedon said), far away from that, they bet on the save (again), but this time works. Cate Blanchett is F#CKING INCREDIBLE on the movie! And that is a improve when you think in the MCU (you know... the majority of the villains in the movies suck).So, in short, for me Ragnarok is another very entertaining, fun, and well done Marvel movie. Doesn't will win an Oscar or something, but it's good, and mainly, a lot better than the first two.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
How could they manage to do this?WOW,"First of all I wanna say,Hela is amazing.Best villain I ve ever seen since the Joker(Of course not the God awful joker from s.squad.The joker from dark knight)Action scenes were so incredible.Fenrir,Surtur,Hela,Sakaar,Hulk,Thor, Gladiator-battle arena,demolition of Asgard etc..so damn epic.I am glad they put comedy on this last Thor movie cause the Thor 1 and 2 were all serious movies,especially Thor was a serious character.This didn't work out so they tried to make a funnier,more entertaining movie.In my opinion it was a great move.Cause there were so many emotional moments and deaths in this movie.Btw,be ready for very surprising deaths and cameos.I didn't mind the comedy cause they put all the jokes in right places.Just like they did in Guardians of the Galaxy,Ant man and FOX did in Deadpool.Also I am not allergic to comedy or having fun if they make it right.I am not one of those moody,goth/emo,depressing people with boring,dull life.I am very satisfied with this movie.Now it is time for JUSTICE LEAGUE.I really hope that movie will be great too.

How comic movies should be made,"Had the pleasure of watching Thor on the opening night, and damn was this movie good. The trailer and previous films have nothing on this third installment. Now do not get me wrong, I am not some crazy fan boy, but I give credit, where credit is due. The film was hilarious and makes this action packed film seem like a great 90's comedy, the one where you laugh at funny jokes and not silly skits or genital reference. The film had really awesome colors and amazing cinematography.The acting in the film was for most part great, few exceptions can be listed, and there were few moments where you can see actor trying to stay in character and they are trying to not to laugh, but it can be excused as 80% of dialogue was improvised, and i guess its just natural reaction of people laughing at something. One of the funniest things of the film was definitely the director, the amazing great job he did directing, as well as his hilarious character Korg and that funny Kiwi accent that makes you laugh every time he spoke.Like I wrote at the start, this is how comic movies should be made.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Laughs and action,"I saw this film at the Beckenham Odeon in London. The beginning of this film was as impactful as the bullet-time opening of Swordfish. So that set the movie off at with very high expectation indeed. Hela's part in the story was as expected, and nothing changed from the trailers. She's very powerful, and also very single-minded. Hulk's treatment in the film was in two parts - when he was the Hulk, he was a star, but when he was not hulk, he was a bit part player. I'm not sure I liked how his role was handled in the film, but I suppose anymore exposure of the Hulk, would have taken the shine off Thor himself. So maybe its understandable. I personally felt that more could have been made of the Hulk's character. What did make the film stand out though was the comedy. It was very unexpected, and also brilliantly done! Along the way, Thor meets a minor gladiator, who turns out to be the funniest guy ever! You'll have to see for yourself, but his deadpan delivery turns the film almost into a comedy, every time he's on the screen! The battle scenes were good, but not to the level of LOTR, for scope and spectacle. I enjoyed it, but I feel that it fell just a little bit short of the standard that Wonder Woman delivered. But it did set up the forthcoming space-based Marvel films very well (Black Panther was not referenced).",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Not for Thor Fans... or Anyone over 10,"I had the opportunity to witness this goofy nonsense with my Father, who was a big fan of the Thor comics in his youth, and what he saw on screen destroyed everything he, and later, I, would come to enjoy about the titular character, who has been reduced to a comedic buffoon thanks to this, as my Father would say, ""abortion"". And indeed it was. The constant jokes, which fall flat in the hands of Jeff Goldblum and Cate Blanchett, who seem to have swapped genders in this film, caused the story to lose its stakes, rendering the 2hr 10min movie a complete waste. Don't see this if you're a Thor fan.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
An entertaining setup for greater things to come.,"At this point in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), I feel these movies are practically on autopilot. Because Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) were absent from Captain America: Civil War (2016), there had to be a movie to explain what they were doing during that timeframe. Consequently, while Civil War had great conflict and an epic battle sequence, Thor: Ragnarok (2017) feels . . . less necessary. This being said, I do think that Ragnarok explores the Thor universe better than Thor: The Dark World (2013) did, thus making me wonder if Dark World was truly the unnecessary film.Sure, there are little snippets here and there in these films that set up other parts of the franchise (mainly, the Infinity Stones that will lead to Avengers: The Infinity War (2018)), as well as minor cameos that are fun, if not wholly filler (Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) in the case of Ragnarok). All Ragnarok seems to do is set the stage for the next big film in the franchise. That's not to say it's not fun and entertaining. There is plenty that Thor: Ragnarok has going for it, that's for sure. At the very least, it probably won't be relegated to a two-minute play put on for Asgardian royalty.While being bright and colorful, there were still enough moments of character development that concluded in a flashy spectacle. Where Dark World brought humans to Asgard, thus necessitating Thor's eventual return to Earth, Ragnarok explored the universe connected to Asgard in a way that helped to develop the MCU. The humor in Ragnarok was also on point, with Jeff Goldblum's Grandmaster and Taika Waititi's Korg being some of the best dialogue in the film. I also enjoyed the minor cameos of Liam Hemsworth and Matt Damon in a ""blink and you'll miss it"" moment.An entertaining setup for greater things to come, I give Thor: Ragnarok 3.5 stars out of 5.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Best Film I've seen yet!,"The film started off with more than I expected. A few issues I did notice was that several trailer bits were cut out of the film. The three warriors could have had a bit more to do before dying. Sif should have been in the film as a hero but as long as Marvel still use her. The new characters Korg, Skurge, Hela and Valkryie were very interesting. Another clever thing the film did was put the Doctor Strange post credit scene into the film which was quite clever.This film was way better than the first Avengers. A lot of the films are better than Avengers but people just don't get that. Ultron was better, Doctor Strange, Captain America and Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol 2 should be rated higher than Avengers so I expect any true fans to rate Thor Ragnarok higher.It deserves 10 or 9 but certainly no lower than 8. Avengers Infinity War I fear may ruin the ending for this film, especially if all the surviving Asgardians are killed by Thanos like the Infinity War trailer showed.Loki and Thor did some funny things like the ""get help"" thing. Bruce Banner remained as Hulk for two years is a bit bizarre. If he does now permanently stay as Hulk then it suggests that his actor is quitting. Korg and Heimdall need to return some day for more action.Now that you know some viewpoints, go and watch this. You'll definitely be pleased if you do.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

I was sitting in the mid when I heard someone impressed by the first appearance of Hela (Cate Blanchett), she was gorgeous. Bringing the first female villain and they didn't messed it up.

Fun,"This was more entertaining than I expected, I usually don't like comedies, but I enjoyed this one. Thor was awesome and I enjoyed his character development.

One of a Kind,"If we judge the quality of Marvel movies regarding pure entertainment, Ragnarok is easily one of the best Marvel movie yet. It is filled with Laugh Out Loud moments and stuffed with emotions. This movie also solves the villain problems of Marvel, all thanks to the brilliant performance by Cate Blanchett. This is probably best portrayal from Chris Hemsworth yet after his movie Rush. One of the biggest positives of the movie is it has the right amount of known/beloved characters and new/exciting characters. However, as a negative aspect of this movie, I would say this is the most Marvelish movie yet. They treat everything as an opportunity for a goof. However, thanks to the chemistry between Hulk-Thor-Loki, it will be a stand-out movie in the highly crowded MCU. To sum it up this movie was a riot from start to finish.

Thor: Ragnarok Review,"Thor: Ragnarok is coming out at a time where people are starting to ask if we have reached comic book fatigue. To that, Thor: Ragnarok puts a big cross through that thought. Thor changes the game. We can't get tired of a sub-genre when the films keep reinventing themselves every time.Ragnarok is a blast start to finish. If you are someone who liked laughing, then you will have a smile from start to finish. Every bit of humour hits and if you are an Australian like me, you will get a kick out of a few jokes.If Ragnarok was a chain, there would not be a weak link. While some links are weaker than others, there is no outright weak part of the film. Everything was at the minimum, just solid.Every character felt like like they were used close to their potential. Every actor and actress put in the performance they needed. You felt like 99% of characters were done perfectly. The only slight complaint that can be had about characters in this film was the villain of Hella.Like most Marvel villains, she is terrifically performed by Kate Blanchett and she is a force when she needs to be, but by the time Black Panther comes around next year, she will be quite forgettable. What they did do well with her however was use her to set up some terrific Thor history.As mentioned, the humour was outstanding, and I think that comes down to Taika Waititi. While he didn't get a writing credit on the film, you know by the style of the humour that he had a lot of input into what was happening on screen.While still on Taika, his directing was fantastic. There are some shots in this film that I want as a wallpaper because they are look like they should be paintings. The action was shot really well, the emotional moments had an intimate to them and of course the wide shots of the landscapes were brilliant.Something I really noticed this is the use of the music. They really tapped into the Guardians music style and it worked so well with what was happening on screen. They had a nice balance of using songs when needed but working in score when it is much needed.Ragnorok is a film that if you are going to have a problem with something, chances are it is going to be something personal. For me, what stood out as a negative was the pacing, however that comes of the back of a massive positive. This film is trying to balance two stories that could have easily been a film separately, and does a really good job of it, however I felt as though the Ragnorok story line did feel a bit short changed at the end. They weave the two stories well but at the end of the day, Thor can only be present in one story at a time.Overall, Thor: Ragnorok is a blast from start to finish. It captured the humour and light hearted fun that the first Guardians had and took it to a level you wouldn't of been able to think of. Taika Waititi was by far the stand out of the film both infront and behind the camera, and it couldn't have been achieved without him. As mention, if the film was a chain, the weakest link would still be over 90% strong.9.5/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

One of the greatest movie of the year rocks like Led Zeppelin's Immigrant Song!,"I mean seriously, no kidding! that breathtaking opening action scene, that exhilarating fight scene between Thor and Hulk on the arena, those countless hilarious scenes that literally made me laugh out loud (seriously!), that touching moment with Odin, that sad but satisfying ending, that shocking first post-credit scene, and the list goes on and on and on made this movie the greatest, the most epic, and the most awesome superhero movie of the year! (whether or not ""Justice League"" could live up to that title, I guess we'll never know until November the 17th arrives)Some critics (or maybe just one, I dunno) say that ""Thor Ragnarok"" is the boldest Marvel movie to date, in which I say it's true! I mean, how they stir and twist one of the greatest and the most well- known mythology in the world into a super-hilarious comic book movie (that perhaps upsets some people in the Scandinavian countries, from which the epic tales of Thor originated) that people and fans love is the key to Marvel Studios success. I never knew who Taika Waititi was before, but after I saw his movie yesterday, I can confidently say that he is one of the most promising new names in fully-packed- action-movie genre in the history of Hollywood.now that I have watched this movie yesterday, I'm now looking forward to watching other Marvel Studio movies in the years to come such as Black Panther, Ant-Man and the Wasp, Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 3, Captain Marvel, and the most importantly, Avengers: Infinity War and its sequel.

My favourite superhero film,"The reviews are all over the place with this film. People who adore serious yet poorly written Marvel movies (Avengers, etc.) tend to hate this.

Honourable mention goes to Thor, Jeff Goldblum's character, Korg, the insect guy, and Loki.That said, the movie could not escape the usual humdrum superhero banality of a storyline, and eventually left humour behind in Act 3 for a villain showdown with all the usual Marvel mayhem studio execs eat up. The only consolation is that Cate Blanchett still looks pretty good despite growing horns. At any rate, that's the trade off for good movie-making in the Marvel universe.

Good but not 10/10!!! Really!!! 10/10 is a masterpiece,"HOLD ON! before you click ""unhelpful"" let me just say that this movie is great and easily the best in the Thor trilogy however it does have flaws and that is why it is not 10/10. The comedy in this is really great and I like the overall feel of the film, there is a big difference in the plot compared to the other two that makes this film feel much more fresh and enjoyable. However there are pacing problems, some of the actors seem stilted and dull (especially the grand master).The comedy is the foundation of this movie. Whilst The Dark world was a serious mess and the plot was really dark and boring, this movie keeps it very light and playful. Honestly even in the serious scenes there is a slight comedic side that doesn't take away any of the seriousness. Waititi is a great comedic director having done some really great films such as Hunt for the Wilderpeople and What We Do In the Shadows.He has always thrown a bit of New Zealand humor and stupidity into all his films and it really helps to lift the tone and make it a bit lighter which really works well in this film. Honestly I would really recommend his other films as they are all beautifully done.The actors who really stand out in this are Chris Hemsworth who has taken a tone shift with Thor and made him less serious and ""more realistic"" as a hero. Tom Hiddleston is great as always. He has not lost his gift of playing Loki well.The Two I really did not like and Jeff Golblum and Cate Blanchett. Goldblum plays a really dull, goofy character which would work well if Jeff Golblum could play anyone else except himself. All of the characters he plays in every movie are the same character and this takes me out of the film a lot of the time. Luckily he is not a main character thank god.Cate Blanchett plays a very boring baddie with no real personality or charisma. She is the ""goddess of DEATH"" and keeps on saying through out the movie that she is which doesn't add anything to anything. WE GET IT!!!!! you like death no can you try and have a personality. Her helmet as well is stupid as fu#k (which is just a side note of something I hated).The plot of this movie is stilted with random scenes thrown in but I still enjoyed it the story. When the plot was moving forward and the pacing was actually good then the film got a lot more enjoyable. Unfortunately it was hampered by lots of ""random character"" moments. One thing I really did not like is that random characters are in this for no fu$%ing reason!! Doctor Strange is in this for 5 seconds and really does nothing to help that could not have been done by Thor or Loki. It is just a pointless scene that doesn't advance the plot and probably was a studio executive decision so that they can plug more movies.The technical side was interesting but had a little flaw. The CGI was meh with no real use other than to look pretty but that's the problem now. CGI should be used to advance the plot and not really as a ""look at this"" device. If you like CG more than plot and character development then good for you I guess.I loved the music in this, it fitted the lighter tone Waititi was going for and worked well. It is a lovely score of 80's synth that fits the space theme and tone and gives a sense of other world wonder. Honestly I hold music in high regard in film and this is one of the better fitting soundtracks that Marvel have done. It's mostly all score as well with only one Rock song being used to great effect in the fight scenes.The colour palet of this movie is more vibrant than the last two films as well. More neon and less dark colours make this film a lot more enjoyable to watch visually speaking. This goes hand in hand with the music and the cinematography to create something which is really good and different from most of Marvels movies.Overall this film is really good and I did enjoy it, however it was in the end another marvel movie with a few small changes and a great jokes. In a world where we have TONS of superhero films I just want one that breaks the mold and does something different from the norm. The last one to do that was Logan and I wish Thor Ragnarok had done more to fight against the Marvel plot conventions.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"A humorous, colorful, energetic popcorn flick","Thor: Ragnarok is a humorous, colorful, energetic popcorn flick. It's definitely more comedic than the previous films. However, most of the humor comes from characters acting differently than expected-to the point where they don't seem like the same superheroes we've gotten to know. It's not as solid as the original movie, but it's stronger than Thor 2 and, despite its flaws, it is a lot of fun.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A fun ride,"While I really enjoyed Thor: Ragnarok, it didn't really do anything new when you put it next to previous Marvel movies. It's a reproduction of the same thing over and over again, with maybe a little better jokes (it's really a matter of taste), which these movies are mostly depending on nowadays. It's sad how creators only think of how to bring masses to the theaters and thus the quality of the creation suffers. The main villain has no originality and all of her actions were predictable, which has happened to most of the superhero villains recently. They're brought in for the sake of only that one movie and get cast out before the end. Except for Loki. But in the end, nothing happens to him. (Tom Hiddleston looked so hot in that all-black suit, though.) The acting was really great on most parts, but Mark Ruffalo was so disappointing. Mostly it was bad script-writing for Bruce Banner, who was a joke in this movie, but he could've delivered his part so much better.I'm mostly bringing out the ""bad parts"", but I really did like the movie. It just wasn't what it could've been. I hope Marvel won't keep using the same pattern for all upcoming movies, soon it won't entertain even the masses they're aiming for.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Bit of an oddball,"This film is an oddball in terms of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It has a quirky style of humour that didn't really work for me.

A much needed jolt of life that was lacking greatly in its two predecessors,"Thor: Ragnarok is the third standalone Thor movie and the fifth film in Phase 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Directed by Taika Waititi (Hunt for the Wilderpeople), this installment gives the Thor films a much needed jolt of life that was lacking greatly in its two predecessors.Two years after the events of Avengers: Age of Ultron, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) finds himself imprisoned on a distant planet where he is forced to do battle in a gladiatorial duel against his former friend, The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo). Meanwhile, Thor's home realm of Asgard is under attack by the powerful Hela (Cate Blanchett), who plans to bring it to an end during the oncoming apocalyptic event known as Ragnarok.Considering how bleak and serious the first two Thor films were (mainly the second film), Thor: Ragnarok thankfully takes a different route by injecting more humour and colour into the story to become one of the most fun and entertaining films in the MCU to date. All of the film's comedic moments worked well, and didn't feel as though they were just inserted for the sake of generic comic relief. Another issue I feel is that the original two focused too much on Loki (Tom Hiddleston), making us forget that Thor was supposed to be the main character. Thankfully, Loki, while still having an important and amusing role in the story, is merely a supporting character and Thor himself is given the proper development needed to move the film along nicely. As with all films in the MCU, be sure to stay after the credits for two bonus scenes.I rate it 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
My Thoughts On The New Thor,"The plot of this hulk sized film is imprisoned the mighty Thor finds himself in a lethal gladiatorial contest against the Hulk his former ally. Thor must fight for survival and race against time to prevent the all-powerful Hela from destroying his home and the Asgardian civilization. They actually did it they did a Planet Hulk film i had to say that because it pretty much is Planet Hulk and i have to say that to me the story was really well told and really well paced which is to be expected since the film is only two hours and ten minuets long.Returning as New Doug (if you don't get the joke then watch the film) is Chris Hemsworth , Tom Hiddleston , Cate Blanchett , Idris Elba , Jeff uh ah uh ah uh ah Goldblum , Tessa Thompson and Mark Ruffalo. I have to admit i loved the chemistry between Chris and Tom at this point they might as well be brothers and the same goes for Chris and Mark i'd say the only one that Chris doesn't have chemistry with is someone i can't mention since it's spoiler.The rest of the cast do a solid job i know we make a lot of fun about Jeff Goldblum but damn he was good in this film you can tell that he was having a blast playing this character and i hope to god that we get to see more of him in future movies and once again Tessa kills it i loved her in Creed and i love her in this i'm calling it right now she's going to win a lot of awards.It's taken them awhile but finally Marvel have created another great villain at least in my eyes Hela was a true badass. The only real gripe i have with her is more personal then anything and that's the fact her motivation wasn't that clear others might think the opposite but that's my opinion and she can actually beat people up and be an actual challenge for our hero and i hated her helmet.Wow this film has a lot of humor and i do expect a lot of it to go over people's heads especially with the music choices but this film had me laughing out loud and hard we all know of the scene where Thor and Hulk first meet up and that's still funny but for me one of the best jokes in the movie is what happens after that scene and if you've seen the first Avengers movie you'll know why i laughed at that scene.Honestly at this point there's no point in my even talking about the CGI because we all know it's going to be good so instead i'll jump right into the action which honestly was rather refreshing just due to the fact that not a lot of it boiled down to who can hit who the hardest and there's a badass scene with Thor near the end of movie which i was going to make a joke about but then i thought it might be a spoiler.Damn the soundtrack for this film is really something and when i say the soundtrack i don't mean the score used by composer Mark Mothersbaugh.i mean the songs they inserted into the film i kid you not one of the scenes uses ""Pure Imagination"" from Willy Wonka while not one but two action scenes use ""Immigrant Song"" by Led Zeppelin and i was OK with that.Overall i can't say this is the best Marvel movie because i think there are better movies but i can safely say that this is the best Thor movie and the best Hulk movie for me this film gets an 8.5 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
For those about to Ragnarok,"I read through some of the hate reviews and they must be purists of Thor and Ragnarok and by the looks of things they are in the minority for now.I had high hopes for this film after the disappointment of Blade Runner 2049 and all I can say is it didn't disappoint.For me personally this is the best film I've seen this year and by far the best Thor film, great visuals, great action and very, very funny.Some great cameos at the beginning that I wasn't expecting, excellent involvement of Dr Strange to get the ball rolling. my son thoroughly enjoyed and he's quite reserved when sitting watching a movie with me but he was laughing away and some of the scenes.Again as usual sit right to the end the very last credit Roll on Infinity War",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Jackpot!,"Every time I go into the movies I feel like playing the lottery. I hope for the best but really don't know what I'm getting and I often feel disappointed in the end. This time it was not the case. Marvel universe movies have been my favorites from the very beginning of the story and Thor:Ragnarok as the latest edition has surpassed my expectations. I was hoping for a another good entry in the Marvel universe but this was on another level entirely.This movie is fun, funny, full of action, well acted, fits the story perfectly and what is most important it feels fresh and original. It is different from the other Thor and Marvel movies and stands firmly on its own while still being a bridge to the culmination of the Marvel universe. It's light tone is in my opinion a good set up for the final chapters of the Marvel universe which are no doubt going to be much darker and more dramatic. But make no mistake Thor Ragnarok is a serious movie with a thin layer of drama and darkness as well. It's not perfect but it's flaws are tiny and barely noticeable when compared to the big picture. Without a doubt in my top 3 Marvel movies for now.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Asgard is the people..,"The best out of the 3 three thor movies. Full of laughter, light heartedness and one of the best MCU movies. A similar formula used in Guardian's of the Galaxy.Very good story that takes some minimum inspirations from World War Hulk a Marvel comic series. The writing and acting were great. The charcters are decent. We got Valkyrie, the last of the elite guards of the throne. Thor has developed greatly in the last 3 movies, wiser and much calmer. And a pretty good antagonist, Hela , Thor's sister. And with amazing CGI and likable music.An enjoyable film..Memorable: No Rewatchable: Maybe..",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Guaranteeing a ""safe passage through the anus""","I'm neither a Marvel fan, nor (in particular) a Thor fan.. but I have to admit ""Thor: Ragnarok"" was brilliant from beginning to end.Thor (Chris Hemsworth) has been travelling the universe in search of stuff (I neither remember nor care) but returns to his home planet of Asgard with a dire warning of impending 'Raganrok': this being the 'End of Days' for Asgard. But he finds the court engaged in serious leisure time!Things go from bad to worse when Hela (Cate Blanchett, ""Carol"") – someone with more than a passing relationship to Thor – arrives with a mission to assume the throne. Teamed uncomfortably with half-brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston, ""High Rise""), the brothers get cast millions of light years away to a planet lorded over by a 'grand master' (a lovely performance, that I will leave anonymous here) who pits new gladiators in an arena against his latest champion. You'll never guess who his champion is? Well, OK (cos the trailer gives it away) he's big and green!The film's script is hilarious. It generates an enormous volume of entertainment with laugh-out loud moments throughout; the unforeseen involvement of other Marvel characters; some startling cameos all mixed with the usual brand of spectacular fights and action. Some of the action is surprising: a real eye-opener you might say.The lead cast (Hemsworth, Hiddleston, Blanchett and Ruffalo) all perform admirably and are joined by heavyweight cameos from Anthony Hopkins (""Westworld"") and Idris Elba (""Bastille Day"") reprising their roles from ""Thor: The Dark World"". Particularly impressive is Tessa Thompson (""Creed"") as Thor's Valkyrie warrior side-kick and Karl Urban (""Star Trek: Into Darkness"") as the turn-coat Asgardian Skurge.Directed by young New Zealander Taika Waititi (behind last year's successful indie hit ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"") it's a breath of fresh air for the Thor franchise, more similar to the style of ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" rather than the previous films in the series. Waititi also saves all the best comedy lines for himself as the 'rock warrior' character Korg: his New Zealand twang delivering just side- splitting dialogue.As with most Marvel films, its a little bit flabby in places, running to 130 minutes: some of the dialogue, particularly scenes between Hemsworth and Ruffalo, feel like they needed tightening up in the editing suite. This time of course includes the scrolling of endless teams of visual effect artists in the closing titles which – naturally – 90% of the audience stay for to see if there are any ""monkeys"". In fact,there are two: one fairly early on; the other right at the end. (To be honest, I thought neither of them was particularly worth waiting for).However overall the movie is highly recommended for a fun night out at the cinema. By the way, this is a film best viewed cold if someone tries to tell you the surprises, cut them off quick!(Thor (sic) the full graphical review, please visit bob-the-movie- man.com. Thanks!).",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Thor: Ragnarok,"Thor: Ragnarok, directed by Taika Waititi, created this breath of fresh air, being undoubtedly, the best installment to the Thor series. You can tell that Taika had a great respect and bond with the returning cast members, seamlessly working together on this exciting tale. Waititi did an amazing job adapting his multi-genre style into this film, but the fact that he tried to keep it in continuity with the Marvel style, it didn't really fit all that well; If Waititi made this film with strictly his style, it would've paid off better, grasping what made Guardians of the Galaxy a great film.Even though Waititi played things a little safe, while the premise is overused and predictable, he brilliantly switched up the whole narrative, doing his best to make this an original and entertaining film. Thor: Ragnarok, was so much fun, while really embracing the weirdness the saga poses. The film flows at such a brisk pace, that can be laidback at times, while having so many memorable moments. Waititi created this film to be more of a comedy-based film, but the other darker tones he incorporated worked pretty well, although some of the dramatic scenes were played off a little light.Thor: Ragnarok stands out so much because of the characters! Sarah Finn did another amazing job casting this huge talent! You can genuinely tell that everyone was having a good time, which translates to great performances across the board! Chris Hemsworth is a stud! He brings so much wit, humor, and heart to the Thor character, being able to create chemistry with anyone! The writers gave him everything he needed to make his character more likable, while giving him some nice character development. We finally get to see Mark Ruffalo back in action as Bruce Banner and The Hulk, and he absolutely steals every scene that he's in! Ruffalo was born to play this character! He brings a tremendous likability to the character, bringing so much wit, and subtle humor, to give his character more great layers! Ruffalo can fit any scheme that he's thrown into, being such an enjoyable presence everytime. Tessa Thompson gets thrown into the MCU mix, and she is another one that fits the scheme like a glove! She is such a fantastic addition to the saga, while putting on such a natural performance, here. Tom Hiddleston returns as Loki, but he doesn't have too much to do in the film, because of his antics in the past. Believe it or not, he is more mellowed out, and grounded this time around, also having some nice character development. One of the most favorable additions to the film, was Korg, voiced by Taika Waititi. He didn't have much to do up until the end of the third act, but he was just an enjoyable presence, having some great jokes along the way! Karl Urban as Skurge, was fine, but he wasn't one of those characters that needed to be there, especially due to the fact that he's just a jerk. Urban definitely made the best out of his screen time, having a few decent moments, but he isn't the most memorable out of the cast. You probably wouldn't expect to see Jeff Goldblum in the MCU, but him as The GrandMaster was awesome! The way his character was written was perfect for the tone of the film! Even though he didn't have a whole lot of screen time, he made the absolute most of it! Cate Blanchett may have overcooked her performance a tad, but she was still great as Hela. She is one of the better villains of the MCU, having a good motive, and connection to Thor and Loki. One of my only issues with Hela, she could've been fleshed out better, instead of throwing a lot of exposition at us. There is a lot to be explored about her character, so it's understandable to an extent, but it left her character to be a little boring, at times.The screenplay by Craig Kyle, Christopher Yost, and Eric Pearson, had a lot of good pieces of writting, with a great flow and timing, but some of the dramatic aspects were cut a little thin, due to the comedy-heavy genre. The film would've benefited if they would've cut back on the comedy just a little bit, to tighten up the emotional and dramatic aspects; other than that, there isn't much to complain about.The production of this film was gorgeous! There were so many beautiful colors, with unique world designs. The effects of the film weren't the best it could've been, but it worked a lot better than something like Black Panther. The action of the film was one of the best aspects, being well balanced, well shot, and really entertaining! The score and soundtrack wasn't the orthodox score from the MCU films; Waititi and Mark Mothersbaugh incorporated this rock anthem, and it just worked perfectly!Overall, Thor: Ragnarok is one of my personal favorite MCU films. Even though this blast of fun comes with issues, Thor: Ragnarok belongs close to the top of your list!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
3rd time is very much the comedy charm,"Three Thor movies, three quite different films. On this occasion, after the much lauded success of other films in the franchise like Guardians and Deadpool. (Which I love.) It is easy to see why they would choose to duplicate the comedic style.This is my favourite of the three Thor films by a clear margin. I was chuckling quite regularly from the very first scene. However I did think are they taking the balance of comedy and drama a bit too far at times. Often you feel yourself hanging on waiting to see if there is a punchline coming even in the more dramatic moments. Even when the bodies are piling up. (The Sokovia Accords have no jurisdiction in the wider universe.)For the most part the directors approach of encouraging improvisation does appear to work very well. But sometimes it does feel like there is a real lack of the ""straight man"" to add structure to the chain gun of gags.On the whole I enjoyed Thor Ragnarok.

Why do I want to see Loki again???,I never understood why they made Loki the main villain in the first Avengers film. He wasn't scary and didn't even die in the end. To date he's been the villain in around 4 Marvel movies and all the time the heroes think Loki will be on their side and guess what? He ends up tricking them and somehow gets away. I mean there aren't any variations to his character to provide something different. It's just the same character villain again and again. Tom Huddleston is a boring actor. I hate his soft spoken voice. He thinks he's doing Shakespeare.And why are they making a Thor movie look like a Custodians of the Cosmos (i.e. Guardians of the Galaxy) movie? The Thor movies had a Viking vibe to them which I liked. Also severe under usage of Heimdall. I'm not running to the theaters for this one.,1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

A great instalment from Marvel,"30 October 2017 First Film of Choice at The Plaza Tonight - Thor: Ragnarok. This is another outing for Chris Hemsworth as Thor, and a very welcome return it is too. Joining him is the enigmatic Tom Hiddleston as Loki, Mark Ruffolo as Banner/Hulk and Idris Elba reprising his role as Heimdall. We once again find ourselves immersed in a gladiatorial contest between good and bad with Thor the central character binding it all together. This outing to Asgard is very much more slapstick than the previous ones and there are many more moments of genuine mirth amongst all the fighting and slaying. Having said that, it in no way detracts from the story and from the core characters that have formed the stable of Marvel stories over the years. Add one Jeff Goldblum as a larger than life caricature of himself into the mix and you have a thoroughly entertaining film. I want to see this again and soon.

Rating: A-,"After Spider-Man: Homecoming and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, it is time for Thor: Ragnarok to try and finish a very positive year for the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), in great fashion.I find the previous Thor movies very interchangeable, they are not exactly great films, but they are still entertaining and enjoyable. However, Thor: Ragnarok elevates that same entertainment to a whole other level ... This is one of the funniest (!) and best movies of the entire universe.Opposed to the previous installments of the series, this one is tonally very different. The amount of comedy implemented in the screenplay and the outstanding humor make this film surprisingly hilarious and extremely fun. It is definitely a marvelous time at the theater and money very well spent.Taika Waititi's (Hunt for the Wilderpeople) fantastic direction is all over the movie. He is able to achieve a flawless balance between comedy, drama and action, something that most directors have trouble with. Consequently, the pacing feels incredibly controlled throughout the whole runtime. The 130 minutes fly like the blink of an eye and the film never has a dull moment, but it still slows down when it needs to, without becoming boring.Waititi also applies a very interesting, intriguing and unconventional way of storytelling, which truly helps the movie carry itself since the overall narrative isn't really unusual. The visual effects and cinematography are both remarkable but in the last act, the action requires a lot of CGI, which becomes too heavy in some brief moments. Due to the mostly fictional Asgard in the background, when the CGI isn't perfect, it feels like a video game ... Thankfully, I am just nit-picking a couple of shots that, in the end, didn't bother me at all.Eric Pearson's writing is distinctly exceptional with extremely hilarious lines and quite few exposition scenes (the ones that exist don't feel forced at all, except for one or two very concise bits). I believe that he is responsible for a big part of this film's sense of uniqueness and creativity, considering he provides excellent scripts for every character, upgrading each and every one of them and obtaining a more exciting movie.As for the cast, I just need to once again praise Marvel for its amazing choices, they keep nailing every single actor and actress they introduce to the MCU. Cate Blanchett is unbelievable! She is such a wonderful actress that she can portray a super cliché villain like Hela (Marvel's ""default"" villains are something that I honestly hope Thanos can change) and bring a whole other dimension to the character. Thanks to her and an extraordinary script, Hela does not feel like (what could very well have been) a cheap villain.Tessa Thompson is another brilliant casting. Valkyrie adds a new layer of comedy and sass to the film, but her backstory is what gives both herself and Blanchett's character a bit more of depth. The surprise of the whole movie is Korg, a Kronan fighter portrayed by the one and only ... Taika Waititi! You are right, the director of Thor: Ragnarok has the funniest performance of the film! I am far from joking, his lines almost steal the whole show, there isn't a single scene with Korg where I didn't laugh like crazy. It is going to be the audience's favorite, without a doubt.As for the superstars, Chris Hemsworth proves that he is a perfect Thor. Both his acting and body shape are excellent for the portrayal of a god, he is able to be very compelling but also incredibly funny, carrying the story with no slip-ups. His chemistry with Mark Ruffalo and Tom Hiddleston (Loki) is palpable and their dialogue scenes are always at a great level of quality, both comedy and story-wise.Hiddleston is great as the evil brother, but Hulk is the one that stands out. The big green guy speaks more in this movie than in all of the others combined and he is freaking awesome! His witty one- liners hit every single time and his action scenes are amazing. There are also some short but very cool appearances from Benedict Cumberbatch (Dr. Strange),  Idris Elba (Heimdall) and Anthony Hopkins (Odin), plus a surprise performance from someone I won't spoil for you.Jeff Goldblum is always great, but his character ... I know this is not going to be a very popular opinion, but I find Grandmaster a bit annoying. Karl Urban has a good performance as Skurge, but just like Hela, both characters feel unexplored and pretty under- developed.My only real issue with the film is something I already mentioned above, which is the story itself. Even though Waititi's uncommon storytelling elevates it, the overall narrative is pretty much the default superhero story. Basically, if you have been alive for the past 10 years, there is nothing about the screenplay that is going to surprise you or blow your mind. Thankfully, the movie is so damn entertaining that the narrative becomes secondary to the all of the action and comedy predominant in the film.In conclusion, Thor: Ragnarok is definitely worth your time and money. It is undoubtedly the best movie of the series and one of the funniest in the MCU. Taika Waititi (with the help of Eric Pearson) molds a cliché narrative in his very unique and humorous way of storytelling, packed with hilarious comedy and phenomenal action scenes. A splendid cast with Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo and Cate Blanchett at the top of their game pull off some fabulous displays, but it is Tessa Thompson and Waititi (!) that steal the show with their distinguished performances, plus a big green badass that has a lot of funny one-liners.MSB Reviews - If you enjoy this review, please follow my blog :)",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Good but not MCU good,"It's very clear that the MCU was greatly influenced by the success of Deadpool. What do I mean by that? Well, Deadpool was largely a comedy with action or an action comedy (however you choose to define it) and it seems that Thor: Ragnarok followed the same mold (less the abundant profanity).The question is: did it work? Judging by the amount of laughter I heard in the packed theater... yes. As for myself... not so much. It was entertaining and I did chuckle a few times myself, but I could have sufficed with fewer laughs and a little more substance.I was not that impressed with the nemesis, Hela (Cate Blanchett), with no onus on Cate because she's great. Hela just wasn't an interesting enough or captivating enough foe. And while I have generally loved Hulk's roles in the two Avenger movies, he was too cartoonish in Thor: Ragnarok. I mean he was literally more cartoonish instead of the more lifelike look he had in the other movies and he was more cartoonish in his behavior.I love the crossovers that Marvel does now (adding other Marvel characters) and that does boost its overall enjoyment value. There were some added characters around Thor in this movie that was nice. But boiling the movie down to the story and the execution of that story, it was more ehh. It was still entertaining and a fun night at the movies but not MCU good.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Thor Ragnarok has the dumb, colourful bombastic fun cinema sorely needs right now.","Thor Ragnarok is an absolute ball of a film: it's the MCU's most enjoyable film since the first Guardians of the Galaxy film, and doesn't focus too much on sequel building like previous MCU films. Ragnarok is the kind of film that will appeal to even the most ardently cynical critics of superhero movies; it's stupid but it relishes in its self-aware sense of joy and fun.Ragnarok is eons ahead of Thor: The Dark World in my eyes, and is even better than the first Thor. It's one of those rare 'threequels' that's better than the films which came before it. And considering how supposedly 'formulaic' people are starting to perceive the MCU films, that's saying a lot of great stuff about this movie. Thor: Ragnarok has the mythological scale of something like The Lord of the Rings, the over-the-top fun of Richard Donner's Superman movies, and the extra sprinkling of The Hulk in a gladiator costume to top all this insanity off in a perfectly gorgeous combo. Oh, and it accomplishes the other-world-liness of films like The Star Wars Trilogy.Thor: Ragnarok is the Thor film I've been waiting for easily. It uses the character in a way that we unfortunately had to wait several films for to justify this payoff, but I promise you the payoff is surprisingly satisfying.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"Okay, but not so heart-capturing.","I honestly came to the cinema with high expectation, especially knowing that Hulk and Doctor Strange will feature in the movie.

They still are funny, but some came to be failed though.The plot were pretty predictable, and it was lack of depth. I would not put things in detail since it will be a spoiler but overall, it did not impress as much as other Marvel's project this year. The villain was cool, but the battle and how they get the victory was pretty, how would I say it, not as thrilling as I expected.As the sum up, this movie was more to 'classic super hero plot where the hero get some problem then gain incredible improvement in his power then win the battle' thing than something with surprise and lack of depth or plot development aspect.

One of the best Marvel Superhero movies out there.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Good fun but lacks depth,"As a fan of Taika Waititi I was very excited to see him at the helm of an MCU movie, especially a Thor film the character I have always felt was the weakest Avenger and the one that nobody seemed to know which direction to take in. Waititi fixed this issue and all of a sudden made Thor a more likable and interesting character, Chris Hemsworth providing a hilarious and brilliant performance like the rest of the cast. The comedy created a jovial atmosphere that is not present in most marvel films and this alongside the vibrant use of colour in the film appears to mark a turning point in the MCU.However I couldn't help but feel slightly disappointed by this film. Firstly Cate Blanchett was excellent as Hela, proving to be one of the best villain the MCU has to offer, however she was slightly underused. Also the film lacked depth, almost trying too hard to be humorous in certain places instead of focusing on backstories or character's emotions which may have been more effective. Whilst the upbeat, fun of the film was welcome it felt wrong during particular moments that involved the planet Hulk story line, a fantastic more serious story. It was a shame that such a rich story was merely brushed over. Furthermore, Taikia Waititi may need to work more on producing grand, large scale films because, even though the his personal touches were nice, for a film about Ragnarok (the end of everything) it felt very small and didn't occupy the grandeur it possibly deserved. Also maybe just because I love Taikai Watiti's style of comedy I went in expecting more humour similar to that of the character Korg (played by Waititi) however that is just personal preference.Overall this is a fun, enjoyable and visually epic (except on some of the occasions when green screen was used ) film, but for everything good about it there is an equal number of problems with it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Scary that they could turn Infinity Wars Part 1 and 2 into a comedy,In the 1% chance that a director or producer reads this...please don't ruin the Infinity Wars Part 1 and 2 by trying to make the entire thing a comedy like Thor Ragnarok did.Watch Lord of the Rings (not the Hobbit ones)...a couple jokes a movie is good.

"Hela stupid! (Get it?) Thor 3 is good fun, but grossly overrated","I'll admit it: part of me loved Thor 3. I certainly got my $15 worth of action, spectacle and laughs from this movie. The trade-off was that I lost an equivalent 15 brain cells while watching this dumb schlock.My biggest problem with the movie? It's a comedy. Worse, a comedy based on the premise that characters such as Thor, the Hulk and Surtur are innately ridiculous and don't deserve to be taken seriously. The movie laughs at them, not with them.Why does this bother me? Because I've read and enjoyed the far more serious Thor comics written by Walt Simonson and J. Michael Straczynski. What Marvel has done here is take a bunch of those great comics, stitch them together into a clumsy Frankenstein's Monster of a plot, and add tons of corny punchlines. It's fun, yeah, but it sure ain't a 10/10 masterpiece.My ideal Thor movie would have a realistic, primitive, gritty feel - like Conan. And it would focus on the violent power politics of the Asgardian royal family - like Game of Thrones. Presumably, Alan Taylor was trying to do something like that with Thor 2, before Marvel re-edited that unfortunate film into one of their kid-friendly joke fests.The problem with the comedy approach is that nothing has dramatic weight. Several tragic things happen in Thor 3, but none of them carry any emotional impact. That's because, five seconds after every tragic event, someone cracks a joke. 5...4...3...2...1...joke! Whew, I was kinda sad about that major character's violent death for a moment there, but thankfully the emotion passed!Of course, there's nothing wrong with a film that's content to be light entertainment. Not everything needs to be violent or heavily emotional. But, I personally would've preferred a Thor sequel with more weight than this. Alas, Thor 3 takes the same campy approach as Batman & Robin - it merely has somewhat better jokes and special effects.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
*The Battle for Asgard*,"!! Possible Spoilers!!*Thor: Ragnarok* is a breath of fresh air in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, transforming the series from a serious epic into a vibrant, comedic adventure. Director Taika Waititi's unique vision injects the film with an infectious energy, reimagining the character of Thor and delivering one of the MCU's most entertaining entries.Chris Hemsworth undergoes a comedic transformation, imbuing Thor with a newfound sense of humor and vulnerability. The character's journey from arrogant god to reluctant hero is both entertaining and heartwarming. Tom Hiddleston's Loki continues to be a scene-stealer, with his complex relationship with Thor providing the film's emotional core.The introduction of Cate Blanchett as Hela, the Goddess of Death, adds a formidable villain to the mix. Her powerful and charismatic performance elevates the film's stakes. The supporting cast, including Jeff Goldblum's eccentric Grandmaster, Tessa Thompson's Valkyrie, and Mark Ruffalo's Hulk, contribute to the film's vibrant and eclectic ensemble.The introduction of Valkyrie, played by Tessa Thompson, adds a layer of complexity to the story. Her character arc, from disillusioned warrior to reluctant hero, is both inspiring and empowering. Her alliance with Thor and Loki creates a formidable trio, capable of taking on Hela's formidable power.The film's climax is a visually stunning battle that pits Thor, Hulk, Loki, and Valkyrie against Hela and her army. The stakes are high, and the outcome is uncertain, creating a sense of tension and excitement. The final confrontation between Thor and Hela is a powerful and satisfying conclusion to the film.*Thor: Ragnarok* is a visual spectacle, with stunning production design and imaginative alien worlds. The film's humor is infectious, with witty dialogue and physical comedy abound. The action sequences are thrilling and well-choreographed, blending spectacle with character-driven moments.*Thor: Ragnarok* is a testament to the power of reinvention. It's a film that revitalizes the Thor franchise and sets a new standard for superhero comedies. The film's blend of humor, action, and character development creates a truly unforgettable cinematic experience.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Thor: Ragnarok is one of the funniest movie in the MCU,The humor is very well done. The cast does a good job delivering this humor. Hela is a pretty solid villain.

"The best comedy, adventure, action movie in mcu so far!","This movie clearly overshadowed the past 2 Thor movies. It's a really entertaining one, you'll never regret watching it for even a minute.

You can watch it with your kids and family, they'll definitely love it. The only downside is that there are some forced jokes(come on it is the god of thunder we're talking about) in it that ruined Thor's character a bit much!

Unimpressed and goofy... Good attempt though.,"As a devout and I mean DEVOUT Marvel fan, I am so confused at why they went super 'goofy' on this movie? Surprisingly unimpressed... Didn't expect such a great storyline to be so boring. It was good entertainment, just seriously unimpressive and almost lost in value for being anything 'epic'.I think what happened, that was so surprising is the effort to copycat the humor from 'Guardians of the Galaxy' which was so successful in it's own light. Here, Marvel tries this with all the gods of power and it just seems aloof in sincere value. Loved the 'human' elements they put in here but this movie is confusingly uninspiring to say the least. Looking at the Marvel universe, there IS a need for this humor but the silly-stupid character from Jeff Goldblum - does not work as an example. There are numerous unanswered questions in this movie and I feel it'll be picked apart once the hype settles down a bit.Some really weird introductions, and odd separations from good storytelling make this movie very mixed on quality. I am trying really hard to enjoy this film over a day away from watching this; but sadly, I just don't think this is one that needs to be rushed out to go see...",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Best Film of the 'Thor' Trilogy By Far!,"'Thor: Ragnarok' was amazing! Best film of the 'Thor' trilogy by far. The action scenes were mesmerizing, the humor was some of the funniest in any superhero movie I've ever seen, the story was captivating, and the acting was superb, with the standout performances being Jeff Goldblum as The Grandmaster, Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie, and Korg (who is actually voiced by the film's director Taika Waititi). An instant classic (in my opinion), 'Ragnarok' is one of the best films of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I also can't forget to mention Hela, the main villain played brialliantly by Cate Blanchett, who has a very interesting, and personal, connection to the God of Thunder. And if you've been wondering what Hulk has been up to since we last saw him in 'Avengers: Age of Ultron', you'll find out! Overall, 'Thor: Ragnarok' was a joy to watch, and I was very pleasantly surprised. Now bring on 'Avengers: Infinity War'!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Another Experience where technology ruins it!,"It's sad that such a good movie gets ruined by the hype of 3D. This one on my opinion didn't work with 3D, and that is the fundamental flaw in regard to this movie. I just cant pass the fact that images seems to small, spacecraft that looks like flies, people that looks like dummies for being so small on screen and jump straight to looking normal size...anyway those are technicalities.Now to the movie - Am I wrong or is this using the same soundtrack as DC's League? Works! Great sound editing great soundtrack that fits the mightiness of Thor. As always not a lot of swirl around the story line, that continues to be for me one key ingredient for the success Marvel Studies have been gaining with its movies when comparing to the DC Universe. Simple, straight to the point and straight to the action (after all I don't believe people going to watch super-heroes movies are expecting reality) - so the key is then entertainment. And Marvel does this well. It treats super heroes movies like comic books with motion. That's it.The action is good - (again 3D damages some of it) - The Lord of thunder is awesome the special effects plus the sound mix - makes it really entertaining. Kate Blanchet - how do they do it? If being a goddess of death is this hot...nice refreshing act from her... on less common note that the one she's known mostly for...A Hulk that have conversations? straight funny. Valkyrie, nicely played, Loki always entertaining and one Idris Elba that is simply convincing as the one that sees it all...Apart of the 3D, if one thing I would like more - Hulk and Thor fight.It feels this is not the last stance - so looking forward for the next one... if possible 3dless.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

It starts on a high and crest-rides all the way to the end.We're introduced to interesting characters (some plot-integral and some side-dish) and a fantastic amount of colorful set pieces. Thor: Ragnarok is a significant improvement over the previous Thor movies and follows the Guardians of the Galaxy formula (make the movie fun and colorful, not drab and overly serious) to exceptional success.If you haven't seen Thor: Ragnarok because you were turned off by the first two movies you're missing out.

Im gonna see this film in theater again and again!!,"I think marvel finally figured out the characters of Thor and Loki, especially Thor's. In the first two movies in the franchise, and in Avengers12, the only thing I remembered about him is "" A strong but a little dumb hero with a hammer, long blonde hair and brother issues "". That's all, far away from my best hero list. But now, after thor3, dudes he is on the list!!! I even want to buy a hammer-shaped cup on my desk. He is smart, humor, protective and he knows how to deal with his relationship with Loki, breaking the thin images in the previous movies. That's exactly how the Thor Series should have been made! Taika Waititi WHERE WERE YOU.Thor 3 is amazing. I REALLY didn't expect this one will be that good. Actually, I was not sure if I should go to the cinema to see this movie until the trailer with ""immigrant song"" came out. (I am a Marvel fan but it took me 3 times to finish watching thor1, well I mean Thor 1 is not that bad... it's just a kind of boring and tooo old-fashioned that nothing surprised me at all. ) I saw thor3 in IMAX and I knew got that ticket is the right choice less than 5 minutes after the movie started. IT IS AWESOME AND EPIC. The action scenes and soundtrack are perfectly matched. The story line is great. And I must say Thor 3 has the BEST JOKES in Marvel universe!

Big disappointment and boredom,while the main story of the film regarding the destruction of asgard and the entry of the big evil sister could make a great enjoyable film it did not cause those beeps at marvel chose to show us an irrelevant boring secondary story which existed in the film for a beep 1 hour and 30 minutes.I'm talking about the grand master story in which also hulk was involved and that story destroyed the film for me.the whole film run 2 hours and excluding first and last 20 minutes all the rest of the movie was how hulk was fighting thor in a kind of....kolloseum or something.this part of the story should take plce around 10-15 minutes not more.I don't know why marvel had that story for more than 1 hour in to the film but it was a boredom failure.I nearly slept during those scenes and only in last 20 minutes I really enjoyed the film again but that won't save the film.At some point they have to understand that this film was about thor....not about the avengers.it's a thor solo film.marvel has made so uch money they have lost it for good.All in all this is the worst solo thor film of the three and it's a shame cause it had a great main story which unfortunately was ignored for 2/3 of the film.Grade C+,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Another nail in the coffin for superhero movies,"There's nothing here but the same formula, with a few tweaks for the mentally ill simpletons to think it's something different. To say it's ""different"" or a ""change of pace"" (which some people are) is just stupid . The fact that this is a superhero movie alone negates all possibility that there is anything remotely refreshing or different about it.The attempts at constant ""jokes"" are just obnoxious. Besides, I don't think that a movie that is in fact one big joke would be able to swallow that irony.As for the actors there's the always annoying, uninteresting, no-count lead actor who plays thor-what's his name again? lol, yeah, like that matters. A plank of wood would have more character than this no-count, who in this movie looks like he just freshly pulled his head out of some guy's crevice.As for the other ones, they could have gotten a more attractive actress to play Valkyrine (did I misspell that?), so then at least there would be something fun to look at despite the obnoxiousness of the character. All the hot musclegirls there are these days and yet they couldn't get one for this role? No excuse for that really.Same goes for Cate Blanchett who plays Hela for that matter. Hey Cate, they're called implants, look them up some time, hit the thick glutes training while you're at it. Might have made this character remotely interesting....but probably still not. Hopefully at least she'll die horribly at some point.I used to respect Jeff Goldblum more, mostly for his older roles and that respect will dissipate quickly if he keeps taking roles like the one here. Maybe he's starting to think he should have stuck with his jazz piano playing.How do these movies even make money in an age of peer-to-peer downloading or get any good reviews? I know a lot of people are basically either paid off or obliged to make fake good reviews, and I suppose the big studio and finance system takes full advantage out of the special interest group of depressed, lost, and thor-oughly butt-stuck idiocrats out there, apparently before they kill themselves, too depressed and too in a mental fugue to know what they're doing with what's left of their lives, exposing themselves to things that's probably just making them even more unhappy. Although the lack of choice presented to these poor people has much to do with all this of course. And the suicide and mass shooting rate continues to rise....Anyway, this is yet another marvel/comic book movie that would truly sully any landfill site. Another nail in the coffin for superhero movies no doubt.

Fine for what it is....,"Thor: Ragnarok (2017, Taika Waititi) In last years mega-hit film 'Captain America: Civil War' we saw pretty much all of the earthbound Marvel characters turn up except Thor and The Hulk/Bruce Banner. So now its time for us to see what they have been up to in the meantime. New Zealand indie director Taika Waititi (What We Do in the Shadows) works with a budget for the first time to bring us the third entry in the Thor series that looks and feels more like a Guardians of the Galaxy film in many ways. We have a film set mostly in space and other planets with colorful and goofy characters everywhere and jokes inserted into every scene... but unlike Guardians and the other better MCU films.. this one lacks any emotional resonance.The story telling is a bit of a jumbled mess but tries to blow through plot points so fast that you might not notice. The action scenes are effects heavy but lack excitement, stakes or tension. Despite its many shortcomings though it is fast enough and funny enough to entertain throughout. The highlights for me were Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner and the director himself as a humorous side character names Korg. Hemsworth was great as always as Thor and Tessa Thompson did not disappoint as Valkyrie.The new thing that I noticed atmosphere wise was a much more interesting score than the traditional MCU films have had with a mostly Synth' based score composed by Mark Mothersbaugh (The Lego Movie), who is an unusual choice for score but it paid dividends. In the end the film is not a great film, nor a bad film but an inconsequential yet funny film.5.5/10",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

I am not fan of Thor movies. This one is no exception.,I don't know why the rating is high for this one. It is no better than the first two.The storyline is nothing new but Thor's family fighting for throne. Writers tried the best to make you laugh with jokes. But most are stupid and not funny.

Best of the MCU films I've seen thus far!,"I confess, I grew up a fan of DC comics, not Marvel.

Awful movie overall,"Where to begin. Personally I disliked this movie with all my hearth. Most of the jokes are extremely predictable failing basically 90% of the times to make me laugh. This film will also set the start of the downfall of both Hulk and Thor, since they completely destroyed their character development. Personally i would have preferred to not have the Hulk in this movie so we could have had him in Infinite War. Not to mention that out of curiosity I read both ""Planet Hulk"" and ""Thor Ragnarok"": after that reading they completely butchered both those story.""Planet Hulk"" would have told an incredible and touching story, not simply the Hulk smashing stuff, but an interesting story with great side characters that gave strength to the story itself, while in this film they didn't even came close to give them justice. Same can be applied to Thor Ragnarok, even if the story is way different from movie to comic.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Way Better than the First Two Movies,"This movie was unbelievably better than the first two movies and it's not even close. It was funnier, had better action, better effects, just better everything. Although I do think that some of the comedic moments undercut the dramatic ones, which is a little frustrating, but it doesn't sour my thoughts about the movie in any way. I also love how they incorporated Hulk into the story and he and Thor's relationship throughout the movie.

"Thor gets it right in ""Ragnarok""","""Thor: Ragnarok"" rocks as the best ""Thor"". Chris Hemsworth is hysterical and heroic as the God of Thunder in Director Taika Waititi's ""Ragnarok"" which refers to the Norse mythology's End of Days. This is the delightful narrative recreation in the screenplay by Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle, and Christopher Yost. Yet as whimsical as the movie becomes with Thor battling his Avengers mate The Hulk in the gladiator arena on planet Sakaar saying ""Yes! We know each other. He's a friend from work!"", ""Thor: Ragnarok"" underlines hero and family. Tom Hiddleston and Anthony Hopkins are both funny and poignant in that capacity.Hopkins returns as Norse god Odin. His first born daughter Hela, Goddess of Death, regally malevolent Cate Blanchett, returns from Odin's banishment in vengeance imposing Ragnarok upon Asgard. In the touching scene in Norway, Odin tells his warring prodigal sons Thor and Loki, charismatic Tom Hiddleston, ""I love you."" While escaping from Sakaar, Thor tells Loki he thought growing up that they would ""fight side by side forever"". That was not to be. Loki is who he is.With the impending conflict with his sister the Goddess of Death, Thor seeks out Odin in the realm of dreams. Thor says, ""I am not as strong as you!"" Odin reminds, ""No, you're stronger."" Waititi pokes fun and creates amazing visuals of distant worlds, but never forgets what moves are heroes and love. In his recurrent theme, Thor says, ""Because that's what heroes do."" ""Thor: Ragnarok"" may make you laugh out loud in irreverence as Thor and Hulk talk about being ""hotheads"". Yet, ""Ragnarok"" is about reclaiming one's greatness and family.Chris Hemsworth is awesome. He looks like a Norse god: handsome, chiseled body, and with his long blonde locks shorn. He has great comedic timing and delivery. His Thor reveals as self-deprecating, funny and humbled by circumstance. Hemsworth's Hero emerges in his vulnerability. This comical saga of good and evil compels with Cate Blanchett, who is formidable evil power in Hela. Blanchett is beautiful in sleek wardrobe, antlered helmet, onyx mane, and Goth eyes. Cate restrains from total camp by harnessing some of Hela's fury within. Hela was the merciless warrior in Odin's bloody wars that united the ""8 Realms"". She embraced her darkness which resulted in her exile as Odin reinvented peace for Asgard.Blanchett brilliantly nuances Hela's rage and betrayal. She easily disposes hundreds of Asgard warriors. She even shatters Thor's Might Hammer like glass, as seen in movie trailers. Thor may not be strong enough to defeat Hela's great evil.In silly convoluted fashion Thor and Loki end up captive on the planet Sakaar, the kingdom of the Grandmaster, played by goofy in a good way Jeff Goldblum, as the self-styled Emperor Nero. Thor becomes the Grandmaster's gladiator challenging his champion, the Hulk and his human persona David Banner, played by genius straight man Mark Ruffalo. Thor and Hulk discover the unexpected ally in surviving warrior Valkyrie, strong smart Tessa Thompson. The Valkyrie are the women warrior protectors of Asgard in Norse mythology. Perhaps, the romantic interest for Thor, Thompson is fun and total kick ass.Eventually, ""Thor: Ragnarok"" reverts to its superhero DNA. Though it is a wild fun ride with a lot of laughs and welcome poignant turns. Thor does what heroes do—fight against great evil not knowing whether good will prevail. The good man or god in this case fights on as opposed to doing nothing in the face of evil. Hemsworth and Blanchett lend gravitas to Director Waittit's whimsical take on the classic battle of good and evil in the universe where heroes and family count. ""Thor: Ragnarok"" is great fun.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Great MCU Movie, Such an Improvement to Thor","After re-watching the original Thor, I was very surprised that I found the movie boring and his character somewhat bland. I remember nothing about the Dark World movie. I did not care much for Thor when this came out, but wow did this shock me. A ton of humor, which at some points is slightly much, but overall 90% of the jokes land very well. Hulk was also one of the MCU characters I cared least for, but this movie treats him surprisingly well. Hella has a great design, but could have a little more character since she poses more as just an obstacle for Thor rather than a true villain. In the end, this movie is just a great improvement for the Thor franchise and has really made me a fan of Taika Waititi. One of the best MCU movies!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Ragnarok Unleashed,"Hello everyone, I'm Mr. C Reviewer, tonight we are discussing the Movie, Thor: Ragnarok. I watched it on Disney plus . The Movie first aired October 10, 2017. It has a runtime of 2 hour and 10 minutes. It was rated PG-13. The Movie was directed by Taika Waititi and created by Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle and Christopher L. Yost. The movie was loosely based on the comic books by Stan Lee, Larry Lieber and Jack Kirby. There was some elements of story's that was used in this movie which was created by Greg Pak, Walter Simonson and Carlo Pagulayan.Summary: Thor, finds himself in a dire situation as he faces the formidable Goddess of Death, who threatens to bring about the destruction of Asgard. Stripped of his hammer and separated from his home, Thor is catapulted across the galaxy to Sakaar, a chaotic planet ruled by the eccentric Grandmaster.Review: -I appreciated the film's engaging opening and how swiftly the action unfolded. I think that the film masterfully weaved a vibrant sense of humour throughout its narrative. These comedic elements not only entertain but also enrich character dynamics, making the story feel more engaging and accessible to a broader audience. The humour felt organic, seamlessly integrated into the plot. I liked that the film draw from various mythologies beyond Norse traditions, adding depth to its narrative and appealing to viewers interested in diverse cultural stories. I was happy that the movie delves into themes of empowerment, resilience, and the importance of friendship. The storyline emphasizes overcoming obstacles through collaboration rather than relying solely on individual strength. This message can resonate with progressive values that celebrate teamwork and collective effort in facing challenges, highlighting themes of friendship and cooperation that uplift viewers seeking inspiring narratives. As an autistic individual, I was especially grateful for the inclusion of subtitles, which made it easier to follow the dialogue.I admired how the film's cinematography skilfully employed a variety of shot types to enhance its storytelling. Wide shots effectively establish the grandeur of environments like Sakaar and Asgard, allowing viewers to appreciate intricate details and character interactions. Close-ups captured emotional nuances during pivotal moments, conveying feelings that wider frames might miss. Aerial shots, achieved with drones and specialized rigs, provided dynamic perspectives for expansive landscapes and action sequences, enhancing battles and chase scenes. Action shots were essential in fight sequences, employing tracking and handheld camera techniques to enhance immediacy and excitement. Steadicam technology facilitated smooth navigation through intricate settings, ensuring seamless transitions while maintaining focus on character interactions and key plot points. High-speed cameras, such as the Phantom Flex 4K, were utilized for capturing slow-motion effects that amplify dramatic moments like explosions and combat impacts.I found the CGI utilized for key characters and action sequences to be quite commendable. The portrayal of characters such as Hulk stood out to me; his design and animation effectively captured both his immense strength and distinct personality. The film's vibrant colours and imaginative landscapes, particularly those of Sakaar-where much of the narrative unfolds-demonstrated a creative application of CGI that significantly enhanced the film's unique visual style. However, I did observe that some background shots lacked realism and appeared poorly executed. There were noticeable inconsistencies in the quality of CGI throughout the movie. While certain scenes showcased impressive visual effects, others, especially those featuring background environments, did not meet my expectations. Dim lighting was used strategically to emphasize key elements within the frame. The soundtrack and sound effects were particularly impactful, as they complemented the scenes beautifully.-I appreciated how the film illustrated Thor's significant character development, transforming him from a somewhat arrogant warrior into a more self-aware and responsible leader. This evolution adds depth to his character and enhances the overall narrative. The movie also excelled in its portrayal of strong female characters, such as Valkyrie and Hela. These characters are not only crucial to the storyline but also represent women as powerful figures in their own right. This representation resonates positively with audiences who advocate for gender equality in media, showcasing diverse and compelling female roles. While I found the main narrative engaging, I noticed that some supporting characters lacked sufficient development and were often side-lined. Despite their potential for richer story arcs, their limited exploration left me wanting more depth and backstory for these individuals. The film's villain stands out as one of Marvel's more intriguing antagonists, marked by complex motivations and a formidable presence. I appreciated how this character posed significant challenges to the heroes in meaningful ways. However, I believe that a deeper exploration of their motivations would have further enriched the story.-I found the movie's ending to be quite satisfying, and I was delighted to discover the two cleverly integrated extra scenes during the closing credits.I rate each Movie I watch out of 10 and for this one, I give it an 8 Remember this was what I thought about the film personally and I suggest that you give it a go for yourself.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Taika is a god.,"Its not Taika who is doing this writing, but he is a directing god.

Colors! Funnies! A decent antagonist! Just enough story to tie it all together!,"Well, that's certainly nice to have.What makes this movie work is its sense of outlandish fun which seeps into every part of the filmmaking process. From the script to performances and even set design and special effects, the movie prioritizes being fun over anything else. I think it muddles some of the basic storytelling elements, but not enough to actually drag the movie down that much.Thor is away from Asgard trying to prevent a recurring dream he's been having of Ragnarok taking place and wiping out his home world, so he has come to find Surtur, the demon who will perform that apocalypse and defeats him in battle. Upon returning to Asgard, he discovers that Odin is not Odin but Loki in disguise. Taking Loki with him, they find Odin and discover that their never mentioned (honestly, for good reasons within the narrative) older sister, Hela the goddess of Death, has been waiting for the power within Odin to dissipate with his death to return and lay claim to Asgard. Thor and Loki get cast out and land on a trash covered planet where Thor gets roped into gladiatorial games that have been using the Hulk for the past two years. Thor teams up with Hulk, Loki, and a long drunk Valkyrie to escape the planet, go to Asgard, and eventually give the planet up to Surtur in an effort to save the people of Asgard over the place itself.That second to last sentence above? That's about an hour of the film, and it was the core of my reticence of the film's efficacy as a story. There's a thick layer of humor and fun over that hour, but I didn't quite understand the purpose of it narratively. Perhaps too much time is dedicated to the Hulk, who carries much of the humor and subplot within that hour, but ultimately the hour does serve a narrative purpose. Thor begins the film trying to prevent Ragnarok as heir to the throne of Asgard, and he ends the film as king of Asgard while triggering Raganarok. That's quite a journey, and it felt like most of that came in the final act when he faces Hela and realizes the scope of the danger she represents. However, the full hour in the middle does show the other part of Thor's journey, that of him becoming king. It's done with brightly colored sets, costumes, and lots of humor, but it's still there. Thor starts with nothing and ends that hour with a following. He starts the process of learning how to apply the lessons Odin had taught him about being king and developing relationships with people to create loyalty in a populace. It's not the focus of that section, the humor definitely is, but it raises the humor from being merely fun into actually serving the story to some degree (I still think this could be stronger).But the movie is really only trying to be fun, right? Its only purpose is to make you smile for two hours, right? Well, it's still trying to tell a narrative story, and it's valid to judge the film's merits on that level. It would be find if the movie only wanted to make us laugh, then it could be a sketch show of two hours and it could work quite well at that, however the film does have characters, a plot, and a theme at its core. To ignore that all in favor of just the giggles is a disservice to the film as a whole.From Korg, the rock monster, to Thor's new flippant attitude, to Skurge's pride in his stuff (like ""Des"" and ""Troy""), the movie wishes primarily to provide light entertainment and it succeeds quite well at that. It also does that in a vividly visual design sensibility that uses color in set design unlike anything Marvel had done before. The Guardians of the Galaxy movies started the bright, cosmic, colorful trend in visual storytelling in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but Thor: Ragnarok takes it in a direction with more straight lines and clear delineation between the colors. It creates a unique look both in and out of the MCU. The use of music is also similar to that in Guardians, but the influences are of a different era and style (a good helping of Led Zeppelin, for instance) that gives Ragnarok an entirely different energy.The acting is quite entertaining throughout, with no one quite taking their roles too seriously. Chris Hemsworth is having a blast as Thor, Tessa Thompson is happily drunk as Valkyrie, Mark Ruffalo is appropriately befuddled as Banner, and Cate Blanchett is sexy and appropriately hammy as Hela. Overall, the movie is quite enjoyable, but there was definite room for tightening the narrative a bit.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
People Always Find a Reason to Complain,"Not sure how you can rate this movie so low. I have seen every movie in the MCU and this is one of my favourites. People complained about previous Thor films because of his lack of character, now they are complaining that this is not a Thor movie.
Much like Guardians of the Galaxy, this movie infuses comedy, fun action and a great soundtrack. It also happens to be truly visually stimulating the whole way through.
It's a comic book movie that couldn't be more comic book esque but people still find a way to chew it apart. This was a great way to develop Thor's character even more, and I expect more in his next solo film, Love and Thunder.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
My Most Watched MCU Movie Ever!,"I've probably watched Ragnarok for over 20 times. It makes lot of sense each time I watching it. Taika took Thor to an all new direction by his fantastic talent.

They had a funny chat by the way:) after that one of the most iconic fight scene of Thor. Also I love how the logo of Ragnarok appeared with metal music it was fantastic!If you are huge fan of Thor you should watch this at least five times because it's totally a masterpiece and probably the best Thor movie out of three!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Finally a decent Thor movie,"It took Marvel two standalone movies and two Avenger movies to finally get the right note for this character. How do you make a movie about a comic book character based on a god from Norwegian mythology played by an Australian surfer dude? As a full fledged comedy of course, and Taika was a perfect guy to do just that. 
While Hemsworth is struggling badly with serious roles, thankfully here he is a (sort of) parody of himself from a previous movies, and it works like a charm, because he is a very talented comedian. Also, his chemistry with Loki, played by Tom is perfect, they work excellent together without drama component from the first two movies.
I need to mention that Taika himself as a Korg is hilarious and Jeff Goldblum as an intergalactic despot is just pure gold.
The downside - Valkyrie actress Thessa Thompson.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!,"Woo-hoo! Three Marvel movies in one year! Everyone's been celebrating 2017 as perhaps the best year for comic book movies in history, with every single one thus far either meeting or exceeding expectations. I understand the hype, as like the last couple of movies in the MCU, Thor: Ragnarok features lots of good comic timing thanks to director Taika Waititi's (Hunt for the Wilderpeople, What We Do in the Shadows) effort in staging sound to time each gag. The excitement goes nonstop as the hero fights demon after demon against screaming rock music to put the final cherry on the sundae.The continuation of the heroes' journeys will expectedly keep committed fans raising their foam fingers of approval; when we first see Thor, he is chained over lava, face to face with a fiery demon, but without a hint of fear. When he meets his evil sister, she breaks his sacred hammer, and he's later pit into a gladiator arena against a familiar green face, escalating the thrills with each new spectacle. The Incredible Hulk even has his own great moments faithful to when we last saw him, particularly in how he remained green and mean for the past two years.But that doesn't excuse Ragnarok's empty sense of humanity. The lack of consistency essentially starts with Thor's father passively dying, leaving his evil daughter to rule over Asgard, a ""sad"" moment standing as a mere plot motive with no hint of trauma. As for the Hulk, what exactly does he think about forgetting the last two years of his life? Apparently nothing, as all his self-doubt gets insultingly contradicted in his final moments on screen. A couple of other new members join Thor's team, including Valkyrie. Right upon her introduction, she falls off a platform drunk, setting off a damaged amount of sympathy for her shallowness that carries on with every other new character thrown in without consideration.For a majority of the feature, each supporting individual says their exact thoughts in service to exposition, even at the cost of satisfying closure to their stories. While I certainly learned plenty about what these new characters are, I learned little about who they are beyond funny caricatures. These characters needed to be more than comic relief against flashy colors to last longer than a month in audience's memories. The laws of physics and social order make as much sense as the humanity, appearing a little too conscious about who needs to stay alive and who needs to stay beautiful after going through chaos. As a result, too much goes on in the climax to keep everyone active.Marvel's new freak of art does nothing valuable beside combine Greek mythology with visualized techno music, two things that should never go together. As a result, the world looks uglier than ever before, even for a comic book movie, from the stupid historical paintings decorating Asgard's capital building to Hela's overdesigned ""crown"" or whatever you call it. People already care so little about ancient cultures, so once it's time for kids at school to learn about Greek history, they will think about something less valuable instead.Although I most want to talk about the acting, an overstated aspect that the entire Marvel series in actuality does dreadfully. Chris Hemsworth deserves no praise for his awful performance; he just stilts around with a charming smile plastered onto his spray-tanned face as if waiting for an awkward school photo. The film's comedic charisma has no thanks to give to him, an actor praised only because he's handsome without being annoying. But Jeff Goldblum was the absolute worst casting decision; his instantly forgettable role simply felt awkward to watch, as he created the most painful attempts at humor. I can't remember a time he has ever put on a good performance, and I wonder how he's still getting cast in big movies today.The nitpicks go on much further than you may assume: Teenage boys might complain about the fake looking graphics fit for the X-Box. Long time Marvel fans might complain about Doctor Strange's underuse in an easily rewritable four-minute scene. The more artsy viewers might complain about Hulk's dumb looking gladiator armor. The older viewers might complain about some of the seemingly never- ending jokes. Women might complain about how Hela insults middle-aged women everywhere who want representation beyond roadblocks to men's triumphs. And parents might complain about the bad role model Thor sets for younger boys. Thor's first scene alone features him playing with his hammer in its 3D glory as he beats up demons Halo style. Then for the rest of the film he joyfully beats up his siblings, celebrating his rewards afterward. So why let boys look up to some self-righteous white dude with flowing blonde hair who brags about the hardness of his hammer? If anything, Thor will raise a generation of pompous blonde-haired men who think only about claiming the throne.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"Daft, almost self-parodic, but with its own special charm","An American fantasy adventure; A story about a warrior imprisoned on a planet in the distant universe, attempting to return his homeworld to stop its destruction, who finds help from an unexpected source. In a departure from previous films in the series, Hemsworth was required to reduce his stony-faced persona and stilted, prosaic delivery in favour of a more humanised, provincial persona. What worked well for the character before (being oddly distinctive compared to the other superhero characters in the ensemble) is now conspicuous for reducing the screen power of the once lofty Norse deity. Nonetheless, Hiddleston and Hemsworth have marvellously prickly exchanges, which is enjoyable. More broadly, the film attempts the sort of ironic humour that worked well for the Guardians of the Galaxy and Deadpool films but doesn't succeed quite as well here, except when Jeff Goldblum appears. There are improvements on the previous film, Dark World, in terms of the editing; we are able to dwell more on the splendour of the visual effects, especially the imagery of mystical planets. The film ramps up the talent stakes and theatrical absurdity with Cate Blanchett, but despite her best efforts, we don't get the same kind of tension as we did about the same idea of a banished heir to the throne returning home as we saw in the original Thor film.

With Chris Hemsworth, when he was first given the part of Thor he will have done his research on the character, thought of ways he he can play him and to his credit he has done remarkably. Not only did the Dark World help him improve his character but it helped the complete Marvel Cinematic Universe as a whole!
Great having Doctor Strange and Hulk appear in Ragnarok as they only helped make it even better.
Lastly, a shout out to Korg - a small part but everytime he was on the screen he stole the spotlight!Korg: (to Thor) ""Hey. Take it easy, man. Over here. The pile of rocks waving at you. Here. Yeah, I'm actually a thing. I'm a being. Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Korg. I'm kind of like the leader in here. I'm made of rocks, as you can see. But don't let that intimidate you. You don't need to be afraid unless you're made of scissors. Just a little rock-paper-scissor joke for you.""",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

There was a Ragnarok?,"THOR: RAGNAROK
RATING: 3.7/5The first action scene, is something I'd been waiting to see for years now, Thor literally swinging his hammer around like a badass in fights. It was perfect, and felt right out of the comics. Loki is as Loki does, so not much to say there. Jeff Goldblum was Jeff Goldblum as the Grand Master, so take it or leave it. Valkyrie was good but she left something to be desired IMO. With the backstory they gave her, and how it tied into the overall story, it felt like a missed opportunity for that character.Seeing Doctor Strange's cameo was fantastic, i loved everything about it because you could see that he had gotten a lot better at using magic, compared to his own movie where he was struggling. Hulk was good and I wish we had gotten more information about him and how he's been, but alas it's not his movie. Visually the movie is fantastic, it's a Marvel Studios movie, so you know the production value is gonna be there. The score is pretty forgettable, as usual, but the trade off is that they use Led Zepplin's ""Immigrant song"" from the trailers.I guess my main gripe would be that the movie has the word RAGNAROK, in the title, but it never feels like it. Everything is so lighthearted and jovial, that even when serious scenes happen, they don't resonate long, if at all. The film moves so fast, that it ends up becoming emotionally unbalanced. Any time the movie tries to be emotional, the scenes either fall flat or are undercut by a joke. Almost every time Anthony Hopkins was on screen, it got on my nerves because he felt so out of place visually with the rest of the movie, if he didn't wanna dress up, he shoulda just stayed home. If he wasn't so important to the story, I'd say the movie would have been better off without him. Cate Blanchet looks incredible as Hela, and she's a villain you really want to like, with kind of a tragic backstory, but she's almost completely wasted as a villain here. The revelations about her origins and the significance they hold for all of Asgard, are practically buried under a mountain of jokes and pretty visuals. It was a little frustrating to see so many great story pieces on the board, and then slowly realize that they were going to waste every single one of those opportunities.Ultimately, this movie had a lot of good to great ideas going on, that it chose not to use to their full potential. That being said, Thor honestly feels reinvigorated as a character here, and the movie feels like the start of a new beginning for the franchise. If any Marvel character deserves a 4th movie, I'd have to say, it probably should be Thor. In the end, THOR RAGNAROK is a fun and colorful, but pretty flawed, popcorn movie, that chose to be funny, instead of epic... still, i am definitely interested to see what the future holds for Thor. :D",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
flawless fun,"Thor (Chris Hemsworth) returns home to find Loki (Tom Hiddleston) ruling Asgard disguised as their father Odin (Anthony Hopkins). Before dying, Odin reveals a previously unknown elder daughter Hela (Cate Blanchett) and warns against an impending Asgardian doomsday prophesy called Ragnarok. With Odin's death, Hela is released and Loki's carelessness allows her to return to Asgard. She destroys Thor's hammer and relegates the brothers to the planet Sakaar. Scrapper 142 (Tessa Thompson) takes Thor prisoner and sells him to the Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum) for his gladiatorial contests. Thor is surprised to find the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) as the champion.This is fun. In fact, it's flawless fun. It's light, funny, action-packed, and fun-fun-fun. The Asgardian brothers continue to have good chemistry but the best bromance has to be Hulk and Thor. That is Hulk in both Hulk form and Banner form. These two are the new buddy comedy duo of Marvel. They are hilarious together and has the best section of the movie. I only wish for more Hulk Thor pairing. Tessa Thompson is a great addition. Jeff Goldblum does his Jeff Goldblumiest. Hela is the only one who may need more dimensions. She's a bit of a cardboard cut out villain and Blanchett does her best with what she's allowed to do. She needs a scene by herself to add some dimension and lay down some Shakespear on her father's spirit. That's often the case for Marvel villains. Director Taika Waititi really let his unique skills loose on this franchise.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Waititi's definition of fun!,"We are all familiar with the superhero movie formulas by now – the invincible hero, the big bad villain, exuberant CGI action, and clichéd one liner jokes. Thor Ragnorak proves that this formula is not imperturbable, and the formula for superhero movies can evolve. Marvel Studios have on board this time, small feature filmmaker Taika Waititi (the wizard behind warm and hilarious films such as 'Hunt for the Wilderpeople'. Waititi is very confident, and took isn't afraid to take risks, it seems here that he just wanted to bring his own interpretation of the superhero genre, and most importantly  to have some fun.It seems that everyone else wanted to have some fun too. Apart from the usual crew – Chris Hemsworth (Thor), Tom Hiddleston (Loki) and Mark Ruffalo (The Hulk), Cate Blanchett and Jeff Goldblum has also signed on to play villains Hela and the Grandmaster respectively. I think the sentiment was the same among them all – let's experiment and break some barriers, and cut some of that serious stuff.The story itself hasn't changed much from its usual form - we have a wicked and malicious villain Hela (Odin's first-born, thus Thor's sister), hell-bent on taking the throne of Asgard, and seeking supreme power through fear and destruction. It is therefore, up to our heroes, Thor, Loki (questionable), Heimdall (Idris Elba), the Hulk and newcomer Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) – a tough former Asgardian warrior girl, to stop her. Part of the story takes place on the planet of Sakaar, where we are introduced to some of our new characters – the eccentric and self-indulgent Grandmaster who rules the planet and hosts gladiator-like battles for entertainment, and Korg – an adorable, inadvertently funny creature (and gladiator) made from rocks. He befriends Thor, when he was trapped on the planet, and forced to compete against his 'friend' the Hulk. Korg is literally Waititi in rock form both physically and character wise) (he was played by Waititi through motion capture) – and I think many would agree that he was a highlight.All the characters, old and new, brought something refreshing to their identities – their own charisma and personalities. As a result, they are simultaneously familiar and unfamiliar. And that's where the fun is at. The film's temperament didn't feel like that of a typical serious end-of-the-world film, it felt more like a series of bloopers, where the camera catches all the behind-the-scenes banters and quibbles. The jokes and the humour is spontaneous, and the atmosphere is filled with good cheerfulness and bonhomie. If you've seen the film, you'll know what I mean when I say the funniest bits are the Hulk 'jumping' out of the plane and Loki and Thor playing 'get help.' There's so much chemistry between Hemsworth, Hiddleston and Ruffalo, nothing feels forced.Another film comes to mind when I think of vibrant colours, a playful tone and upbeat music – that is, the 'Guardians of the Galaxy'. This film is similar, but with its own wit and pleasant surprises. I think the humour is more effective and genuine here, it catches you off- guard because they happen at the most unexpected moments. It is truly hilariously entertaining. The 1980s music and score (by Mark Mothersbaugh), is fitting and extremely addictive, and extremely fun. You'll enjoy all the cameos too, I won't spoil them – but you'll definitely recognise them and smile.I didn't expect this film to be as fun as it was. It is a harmonious symphony of humour, action and storytelling. If examined closely, there are shortcomings and inconsistencies in the narrative, but for a fun superhero film, it is easily forgivable. Because it is distinctively Waititi, it is a bit of an outlier to the other Marvel films – but you'll laugh a lot and have loads of fun. I think I mentioned fun a hundred times in this review, but it seriously is.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"Thor, God of Thunder, receives thundering laughter's all the way through!","Being a long time marvel comic fan, I was a bit disappointed with Thor 1 and 2. Going to the movies, I had no high expectation, aside from seeing the high score on IMDb at that point, with 8.3 at 23k votes. I simply wanted to see the movie because I wanted to follow all the movies in preparation for the Infinity Wars.To start of, I would like to commend the writers on how they took so many story lines from the comic books and implemented them so well in small and modified parts into the movie. Lets be real, Planet Hulk, Ragnarok, Hela, and other story lines from the comics which I will not mention due to spoilers, could not be brought to full life even if the movie had spanned for 3 hours (note:movie played for 130 minutes).However they were intelligently crafted into the story line in small parts with a awesome dose of comedy that could even challenge Deadpool (whom for me is by far still the best Marvel movie with the best comedic parts, though Thor Ragnarok is a close contender).Then there is the mood and music set on the alien planet Thor and Hulk are on. The 80's synth music, the very light touch of Bladerunner (very light and is there in my opinion!), and the great banter between Hulk/Banner and Thor was simply amazing. That was writing and comedy at its best! The fight scenes were not disappointing either, a bit blurry at times, but all in all well done and a great display of higher level powers that match a bit more with the power levels set in Marvel comics, so that was awesome! All in all, you will not be disappointed! I personally thought Thor 1 and 2 were mediocre, however this one was truly done so right, I wish I could promote it more in anyway so more people would go and see it! Hope this helps you make the correct decision to take friends,family and kids and go see it in the cinemas! Enjoy!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Comic Book on Film,"I know, both 'Comic Book' and 'Film' seem out of date, but this movie may be the index case for the 21st century version of merging both. Ragnarok seemed to capture the cocky adolescence of traditional comic books while delivering the big screen visuals one expects from a theater film. The acting was slightly better than most superhero films, too. Benedict Cumberbatch's Dr. Strange cameo was well done. Chris Hemsworth was much funnier than in Ghostbusters. Even Kate Blanchett's character showed some texture and pathos in spite of her limited appearances. Humor was well placed, and special effects were first class. The music and sound effects were both better orchestrated and less intrusive that usual.On the unseemly side, Anthony Hopkins did seem to phone in his limited role, Mark Ruffalo seemed to have been dragged into his role, and Karl Urban seemed underused. As for the plot, this is a comic book story.BTW, stay for all the credits.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Who cares if it's different, this is awesome!","The main aspect that makes this film so good is the tone - Marvel finally decided to make Thor fun to watch and the comedy, the music, the locations, and the characters are some of the best in the MCU.This is all apparent when the characters are on the vibrant and bursting with energy planet of Saccar. This is truly the highlight of the movie, and what saves it, with Jeff Goldblum giving just...just such a Goldblum performance I miss him every time he's not onscreen.Basically everything that doesn't take place on Saccar is what brings the movie down. The first 20 minutes or so feels disjointed and uninteresting, and anything with the bland and cliché villain on Asgard is so tiresome.As a result this is a very mid-tier Marvel movie, it has very high highs but still falls victim to the forgettability and boringness of the Thor franchise (although this is undoubtedly the best of the three). The comedy is very clearly improvised and 90% of the time it works, but some of it can feel awkward, especially between Hemsworth and Ruffalo (although the Thor/Hulk team up is one of the things that makes this movie.Great comedy, great atmosphere, but weak story.

Additional amazingly cameo of witty characters played by Jeff Goldblum and Benedict Cumberbatch are fantastic to the entire scheme of the movie.

"Marvel goes full comedy with ""Thor: Ragnarok"" and it's a blast","The hugely successful Marvel Cinematic Universe has continued to inch further and further into comedic territory in recent years; with ""Thor: Ragnarok,"" it completely passes through the comic threshold.With its laughs-first approach, from start to finish ""Thor: Ragnarok"" is Marvel Studios' funniest film. The comedic instincts of director Taika Waititi (""What We Do in the Shadows,"" ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"") far surpasses those of the directors of the nearly 20 previous Marvel movies. He knows how to get the extra, unexpected laugh; every time the film is funny for overt comedy writing reasons, there's another sneakier layer of humor working in other hilarious surprises.Although the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" movies made the first claim to be Marvel's comedy-inclined franchise, humor has always been a core element of the ""Thor"" films as well. Star Chris Hemsworth's knack for comedy has been the most consistently enjoyable element of the ""Thor"" solo films, though the previous two were surprisingly reticent to embrace it. ""Ragnarok,"" on the other hand, gives it a Hulk-sized hug.After a prologue in which Thor squares off with the fire demon Surtur (Clancy Brown) to prevent Ragnarok, the prophecy that would see Surtur use the Eternal Flame to destroy Asgard, he returns home to find things amiss thanks to his mischievous brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston). The brothers soon discover that their previously unknown and extremely powerful older sister, Hela (Cate Blanchett), is set to make her claim to the throne – and all the realms. In their initial attempts to stop her, Thor and Loki end up stranded on Sakaar, a planet of misfits and detritus ruled by the Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum), from which they must escape with the help of friends new and old.Laughs drive ""Ragnarok,"" but the plot mechanics do not sour the overall joyride as has been the case with many superhero films of late, including some of Marvel's. Writer Eric Pearson, with Craig Kyle and ""Thor: The Dark World's"" Christopher Yost, manage to create a true hero's journey and a sense of stakes. As silly as ""Ragnarok"" gets, it never loses its grounding, unlike its still-good but more reckless recent Marvel Universe predecessor, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.""Abundantly clear is the way Marvel applied the successes of ""Guardians"" to ""Thor"" (if the use of a '70s rock song weren't obvious enough). The film has a similar aesthetic, especially in all the Sakaar scenes, and an almost parallel assortment of characters. Aside from the obvious similarities between Thor and Quill, you have a no-nonsense woman like Gamora in Tessa Thompson's Valkyrie – and awfully similar to Drax is the talking Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo). It's not a bad model to draw from, but the almost Shakespearian elements of ""Thor"" and ""Thor: The Dark World"" have disappeared as a result, instead replaced by Waititi's playful spirit.The MCU has yet to be truly influenced by an auteur – in fact, it's lost some (e.g. Edgar Wright on ""Ant-Man"") – so fans of these movies that are bigger fans of film in general will be really pleased at how visible Waititi's fingerprints are on this project. Some of the comedic touches are distinctively his, or at least a touch more clever than the Marvel norm, and he brings some of his usual lackeys to the cast (including his own voice talents as the gentle brute Korg). Every actor in the film is in step with Waititi's vision and comic tone, though certainly some are better with it than others. If nothing else, ""Ragnarok"" is great proof of what can happen when unique filmmakers and major studio machines play well together.Another subtle element of ""Ragnarok"" that works well is pacing. At 2 hours and 10 minutes, it's the longest ""Thor"" movie and up there with most of the long Marvel movies, but it doesn't drag. There is a real comfortable trajectory to the story, and whereas most of these large-scale blockbusters with multiple plot lines feel disjointed and consequently slow, the transitions in ""Ragnarok"" come with little cliffhangers of suspense that sometimes even leave room for imagination.""Thor: Ragnarok"" doesn't leave a ton of room for pathos – it's not emotionally resonant in the way many Marvel films have been, but it can hold its own against the rest of the MCU library in terms of humor and entertainment value. Maybe Marvel once believed ""Thor"" could be more dramatic, and there's something sad about giving up on that vision, but sometimes you just have to do what you do best, and at this point for Marvel Studios, hilarious big-scale adventure is where they're excelling.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Absolutely BrilliaNt,"Norse mythology is always a satisfaction to see portrayed on the big screen; but the name Ragnarök pounded fears in everyone's heart when it was just unveiled given that it means the death of the major Gods. This fright did not last because of the knowledge of Avengers: Infinity War that would feature our favourite hammer wielding, God of thunder Thor Odinson.Let's get to the movie.Following the announcement of Taika Waititi as director, I was both excited and wary but I've always put my trust in the MCU given their critically acclaim streak on the big screen (had to specify big screen). The movie was a fun, adventure, action-packed, endearing experience. It has only been out for a week in my country and I have already seen it three times (0.0004% of the box office total) - I have not suffered from diminishing returns but instead adding to my utility. I am elated that they ditch the gloomy tone and added this great humor to the franchise and it was largely due to the new characters. Elaborating on new characters: We've seen Thor and Loki four times in the MCU but they were new characters in this installment as we finally get to see Chris Hemsworth's true side (funny) and Loki was just as great. The antagonist Hela was also amazing, Hulk, Banner, Valkyrie, Grand Master etc. It was just a great spectacle.To conclude, I must give a special mention to Korg who I thought stole every scene he was in. The idea to use a soft voice for the ruffian looking rocked Alien (Krónan) was just astonishing; he was voiced by the director Taika too.Marvel Studios (MCU) - You've done it again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Cheap laughs are no substitute for good writing,"Thor Ragnarok is one of the first marvel movies that left me rather disappointed. While the first Thor introduced us the the character and the second expanded the lore in a meaningful way, while leaving a lot of interesting threads to pick up on, Ragnarok throws this all out of the window and instead tries very hard to be its own parody.With the exception of Heimdall the whole support cast is either missing for unknown reasons or gets dispatched rather unceremoniously. At no point does Thor even ask what had become of his life long friends. Probably because he just replaced them with a diverse female girl boss, a cheap cgi stone monster and an imbecile with two machine guns. Loki has the worst of it though, as the once most charismatic MCU villain gets reduced to a running gag for most of this movie. And yeah, Hulk is in this film because... he didn't get his own one I guess? Also there is a completely pointless (but at least amusing) brief guest appearance of Dr. Strange.There are a couple of things however, that save this Movie from disaster: Cate Blancett is phenomenal as villain Hela, the choice of music is top notch and the cinematography is pretty awesome as well. Thor finally gets his character defining moment he should have had in this movie in ""Avengers: Endgame"" but that is another story.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Such a waste I wish I had of walked out,"I say this as a massive fan of Taika Waititi, but the Ragnarok and Planet Hulk comics are both such heavy weight story lines that easily could have been the Logan of their series for either Thor or Hulk and had been set up as such but they where just played for gaff humour there was no weight to this film because literally nothing was taken seriously.I'm not saying it wasn't funny for some people or have some very pretty shots like the Valkyrie shot used in the review I just think that this film was so bad because they could have used another story and saved these to do something of weight with it was a couple of hours of jokes and CGI and in a years time I don't think anyone will remember this film and for me it ranks in line with Ironman 3.......",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,"With Marvel having succeeded with the 2nd installment of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 and managing to bring back Spider-Man in 'Homecoming', their third and final release for 2017 succeeds with making Thor: Ragnarok a true Thor film and somehow managing to make it as fun and hilarious as possible.What makes this film close to perfect is the direction and vision of acclaimed New Zealand filmmaker Taika Waititi (which marks this as his first Hollywood feature and biggest project to have worked on), what he brings here is a big dose of humour that consists of witty dialogue, visually appealing world design and characters to actually care for (with our leading hero being as bold, his side allies being as helpful and a villain that literally is a true form of evil). It somehow manages to beat over the first two films in terms of fun and scale, though they were big budgeted productions but here Waititi is given plenty of space for his touches to make it unique, similarly enough it has the tones that made Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 great.Casting range here is on point; Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, Mark Ruffalo, Cate Blanchett, Jeff Goldblum, Tessa Thompson, Karl Urban and a few more giving solid performances for the entire film. The visual effects are greatly used to a high point and of course the humour plays a bigger role here that makes it so much fun, and music as well is used to a high point of greatness. Only fault is that with the humour being so consistent throughout, there isn't as much emotional investment with some of the characters so it does miss a mark slightly but the fun tone makes up for it.Thor: Ragnarok delivers to audiences awesome comic book fun with mixing an overdose of humour, epic scale production value, dazzling action set pieces and solid performances from the cast overall. Marvel ends their release schedule for 2017 with a bang and delivering a Thor movie that I can say personally is a true 'Thor' movie while setting up more to lead up of next year's Infinity War.4/5 - Nick 3.5/5 - Jay -The Autistic Reviewers.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
The 80s kind of 'FLASH GORDON' style of the movie is cool too!,"'THOR: RAGNAROK': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The third film in the popular Marvel Studios comic book movie franchise, and the 17th installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This sequel has Thor teaming up with Hulk, in order to escape a garbage planet and return to Asgard in time to rescue it from the upcoming Ragnarok. The movie was directed by Taika Waititi (who's also helmed the indie comedy hits 'WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS' and 'HUNT FOR THE WILDERPEOPLE'), and it was written by Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle and Christopher Yost. The film stars Chris Hemsworth (reprising his most iconic role), Tom Hiddleston, Cate Blanchett, Mark Ruffalo, Tessa Thompson, Jeff Goldblum, Karl Urban, Idris Elba and Anthony Hopkins. It's received some of the best reviews ever for a Marvel Studios film, and it's also another huge hit at the Box Office as well. I really enjoyed it too.Thor (Hemsworth) has been looking for the Infinity Stones for over 2 years now, and he's imprisoned by a fire demon, called Surtur, while doing so. Surtur informs Thor that his father Odin (Hopkins) is no longer on Asgard, and that the planet will soon be destroyed by the prophecy Ragnarok. Thor defeats Surtur and returns to Asgard, only to find his brother Loki (Hiddleston) posing as Odin. Thor then forces Loki to go with him to Norway, on Earth, and find their father. Odin informs Thor and Loki that he's dying, and that their sister Hela (Blanchett) will be able to escape her imprisonment once he's dead, and return to take over Asgard. While trying to stop Hela, Thor and Loki crash land on a garbage planet, called Sakaar. There Thor finds Hulk (Ruffalo), who has been stuck as the green monster for over two years now. Thor then attempts to convince Hulk to help him save Asgard.This Thor film is more of a comedy than anything else. I think it's a very fitting genre for this character though, and the film is very effectively done this way. Waititi has already proved himself a great comedic director, with his other feature films, and he doesn't disappoint here. The 80s kind of 'FLASH GORDON' style of the movie is cool too, and the performances are all more than decent. It's perhaps just a little too long though, and slow in some places. It's also not as exciting of an action film as well, compared to other recent superhero flicks, because of all the comedy. It is a lot of fun though, and more than worth seeing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Another MCU Success,"Ragnarok is the third in the Thor franchise. It is the sixth film featuring Hemsworth as the God of Thunder. It is the 17th entry in the behemoth known as the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and the third one just this year. This game-changing series has been plugging along for almost ten years, with very few misses among their many hits. So what can I say new about Ragnarok? It's colorful, funny, epic, appropriately intimate, full of cameos and great performances, and way more entertaining than it is original. In other words, it's a fairly standard but similarly great Marvel movie. In it, Thor has to escape a gladiatorial planet with Hulk and Loki in order to save Asgard from being destroyed by limitlessly powerful new villainess Hela (Blanchett). In scope and plot, it's fairly common. However, there's so much goodness in the smaller stuff that makes the movie standout. Goldblum is wonderfully sleazy and charmingly despicable. The hang-out sessions with Hulk and Thor are great, like two petulant children fighting over who is cooler. The music is great, especially the use of Led Zeppelin's ""Immigrant Song"". And each time the movie underhands superhero posturing with a needed comedic beat, I wanted to cheer but couldn't from laughing. So the movie is obviously a blast, but reviewing it is difficult for me. It's almost like having to review a single episode of a TV show. Luckily, the MCU is a TV show I love, and Ragnarok fits quite nicely within the quality of the larger universe. Even with its messiness and familiarity, Marvel has given us (yet another) undeniably fun foray into their expansive creation.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A mishmash of ideas,"Ragnarok while being a fun movie felt extremely dull regarding overall tone and execution. Two stories mashed into one movie.
It has fun moments like the arena planet scenes, but the Ragnarok part of the plot is rather tone deaf. Odin's 'scene' is rushed and void of emotional impact. Acting is weird at times, especially Loki's lines were delivered weirdly at a few places and the writing/humour falls flat often throughout.
Moreover the directing is rather mixed too, resulting in failed moments and causing some of the problems mentioned before. Because of this action scenes often shot in a way that eliminates tension and impact. The army massacre scene was particularly unbelievably weak. The CGI is rather inconsistent too. Some of the scenes were really unimpressive, felt half-complete while others looked cool.
I would also add that the visual and musical style also felt weird, the film having a kind of 80s vibe, with almost game-like sequences with pumping 'rock' music then of course the usual mythological-superhero crossover music came in at a few places. This further adds to the confusion whether this supposed to be an action oriented, fun movie or a more cataclysmic story of destruction and loss. In the end the dual story line might have been the biggest issue in the movie. These are two very different sides of the same universe and does not add up to a coherent experience.
My favourite scenes from the movie that I really liked are definitely from the arena. Though there are problems there aplenty too like Hulk being advertised as a killing machine then after the fight showing him as a sobered down version of himself joking around and being adorable. This is weird as hell. I would even call this lazy writing which is nothing new in this genre.
Another thing which is not really an issue for me but which can be a kind of lore-breaking decision is to cast a mixed race woman as a valkyrie. Though once again I am not sure how accurate this based on the comic books but mythologically it seems to be rather conflicting. Nevertheless it was not a huge thing overall, and on the other hand I am quite happy with Heimdall's portrayal to be honest.
Overall based on my first watch Ragnarok felt a rather rushed movie with mixed execution. The Thor series is the weakest of the standalone ones (on the level of the Hulk movies maybe), Ragnarok being the latest and possibly the best so far. I am sure that the character and related universe can be used to come up with a great story but so far the Thor franchise was let down by filmmakers.

The most dysfunctional family in the universe,"REVIEW - THOR RAGNAROKThe most dysfunctional family in the universe.I've been getting tired of all the Marvel and DC films recently and with more on the horizon to come I didn't fancy the thought of sitting through another.THOR RAGNAROCK I must admit did surprise.It helped that it wasn't set on Earth because the feats were far better contained in this story than all of the previous based on defending the Earth and actually this film rather than making me cringe at Tony Stark did actually make me laugh.Interesting story to keep it moving, of course great special effects and stunts but again what tipped this into the positive was the humour.Worth seeing, don't think just enjoy.Rating 9 out of 10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Enteraining, funny but longish","In my opinion, movies should be at a length of 2.5 hours or less, but the longest being very rare or depending on the movie This movie was about 2 hours which is just about enough time. The movie was entertaining, funny, with lots of action and communication. The theater was a little too warm, so I had trouble enjoying the movie most the time. Maybe I should edit this review after I see it again in a better environment.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Excellent action and style. Great acting and direction. Captures details with an 80s retro feel,"Thor: Ragnarok impressed me because of its excellent action and style. The acting is top level and the wonderful direction captures every detail with an 80s retro feel. This is sure to be a crowd-pleaser for all Marvel fans.The story is about Thor (Chris Hemsworth), the God of Thunder and former Avenger, who finds himself in the toughest match of his life when he is pitted against Hela (Cate Blanchett), the Goddess of Death, who destroys his hammer in a fierce battle. Thor escapes through a space portal, but is transported to Sakaar, a planet known for its gladiator matches hosted by the Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum). Imprisoned, Thor is forced to fight on the gladiator ring, only to find out his opponent is the Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), who is unaware of their previous comradery. Meanwhile on Asgard, Hela is the new leader and executes a strict dictatorship. Despite being captured, Thor is trying to set up a team with the Hulk, Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) and Loki (Tom Hiddleston) to escape and stop Hela before it is too late.Chris Hemsworth, as Thor, excellently presents his desperation, despite being a hero of great power. His new-born comradery with the Hulk is well presented, due to their great chemistry. Cate Blanchett, as Hela, is one of the best villains in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, due to her nefarious behavior and interesting backstory that shines a new light on Asgard's history. Mark Ruffalo, as the Hulk, is excellent in his Jekyll-Hyde personality between being Bruce Banner and being the Hulk. Due to this, he is my favorite character in the movie. Jeff Goldblum, as the Grandmaster, is quirky and fun like always. Tessa Thompson, as Valkyrie, provides an initially flawed companion to Thor, but stops running away from her problems and face them, when she decides to team up with Thor. Tom Hiddleston, as Loki, is as deceptive and charismatic as ever.The direction by Taika Waititi is splendid. Every scene in the movie is filled with style and well-timed comedy. My favorite scene is when Thor activates his true potential in the final battle against Hela because it is a huge leap for the character, and it leads to one of the most epic battles in the whole Marvel Cinematic Universe. My only problem with the movie is the tonal shifts the movie faces because the movie is filled with comedic scenes. However, in serious and emotional scenes, they feel rout of place. The message of the movie is about believing in yourself. Thor is only able to last in the battle with Hela when he realizes his true potential is beyond his hammer. I give this film 4.5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 10 to 18 because of its intense action and suggestive references.Reviewed by Arjun N., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

Is it funny or not? Up to you.,"In my opinion, the jokes and humorous nature of Thor: Ragnarok didn't fit the universe Marvel set up over years and years of movies. It came from left field and just didn't feel very funny. Some swear by this film and say it's one of the best Marvel films made, but I feel like it used humor to make up for the fact the plot was lackluster and couldn't keep one entertained for longer than an hour.That being said, it's a Marvel film - the visuals are fantastic and the characters are fun. It almost feels like a side quest, and it's a good time. Still falls short of the best of the Marvel films though.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
SOLID BLOCKBUSTER FUN !,"Thor Ragnorak is a fun addition to the MCU.While I liked the dark and serious tone of Civil War, this flick with a healthy dose of humour is more in the mould of Guardians of the Galaxy.Both Chris Hemsworth and Mark Ruffalo sparkle, revelling and discovering the lighter side of the superheroes - Thor and Hulk. Academy award winner Cate Blanchet is rocking as the sinister sister of Thor, Hela.Kiwi director Taika Waititi comes as a breath of fresh air to the MCU and hopefully would continue to explore new and exciting dimensions along with worthy peers like James Gunn and the Russo brothers.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Thor 4 Made Dumb People Mad at This Movie,"This is easily in the top 5 best MCU movies of all-time. Before Love & Thunder came out and made people mad this movie had a wayy higher rating. Those angry people took aim at Taika, and rather than doing the logical thing and criticize Love and Thunder, which absolutely deserves it, they spray their fanboy rage at anything he touches.Directors and writer mess up sometimes and Taika screwed up with Thor 4. But that means absolutely nothing to Thor: Ragnarok.This movie was brilliant when it came out and it continues to be. Like it or not, Taika is a critically acclaimed, oscar-winning, brilliant, hilarious writer and director. Nearly everything he's done, except for Love and Thunder, is loved by critics and audiences alike. Now, it may upset you that someone made a bad movie about your favorite superhero. But going back a re-rating a previous work is dumb and just shows your opinion is weak and easily swayed by things outside the film itself.This will continue to be hailed and in the conversation of ""best MCU film"" by critics and marvel fans. Move on with your life and let people enjoy things. Your bad take isn't needed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"This Thor was strange, random and completely out there...of course I loved it!","I was not sure what to expect from this Thor film as I saw only one trailer of the film. It seemed to be having multiple things going on and a lot of randomness so when I finally saw the finished product it was a very random at times movie. It was also a very fun film and I enjoyed it immensely as there were more than a couple Marvel characters in the film. I knew Hulk was going to be in it, but he appeared in the film a lot more than I was expecting speaking more in this film than all his three solo films combined. I was not sure what to expect from Loki either, but sure enough he was his usual self and once again I really enjoyed the scenes with him and Thor together as they have such an interesting relationship. There is a lot going on in this one and it almost had the feel of a Guardians of the Galaxy film, just with Thor interjected into it.The story has Thor fighting a being who wishes to bring about the end of Asgard. Thor fights this being and wins, thus hopefully stopping this Ragnarok from occurring. He soon returns to Asgard where he reveals to everyone that Odin has been replaced by Loki. The two go to find Odin on earth and Thor is assisted by the sorcerer supreme. Thor and Loki learn of Thor's sister who is soon to be released upon the world where she takes over Asgard while Thor ends up on a strange junk planet ruled by the Grandmaster. Thor must battle the champion of the planet, find a way off the planet so that he may return home and try to reclaim the throne from his diabolical sister.Love the characters of Thor and Loki as they always have such humorous exchanges. There is a scene where Thor is imprisoned on a chair and I am thinking I see Loki kind of just chilling in the crowd and sure enough it was him. I also liked Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner in the film as he is all disjointed and a bit messed up. Seems the Hulk has been the far more dominating persona as of late and I found it humorous that both Banner and Hulk accused Thor of liking the other one more. Jeff Goldblum and Cate Blanchett also did well in their roles.So fun is the way I am describing this film as it is like a Guardians film or the latest Spider-man film. With the passing of my fiancé I do not have a lot to look forward to these days, but I do look forward to the latest Marvel release. The films keep being very entertaining and they make me smile if only for a bit and for that I am grateful. I will probably see the Justice League film when it comes out in a couple of weeks as well, but I am sure I will not like it as much. Marvel just works better for me I guess. I mean, they do not fear having a scene where Hulk is in a hot tub and gets out and you see his bare ass! Just a very enjoyable film that kept me entertained and made me forget my depression if only for a bit, but even if it is only temporary I am still grateful.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Cosmic, funny, and fun, Thor: Ragnarok is a god of thunder that is the best of the Thor series","By the Gods! We got another Thor movie in the mix. For a character that's the Norse God of thunder, you'd think he would be a favorite for a lot of people. For most, however, have admitted that out of all the avengers, Thor is rarely a favorite. Maybe not the character, as Chris Hemsworth carries a lot of the charm and naiveté needed for this type, but more for his movies. Perhaps he works better a part of a team, but other heroes like Iron Man, Spider-Man, and even Captain America, once considered to be the most boring avenger, are capable of operating on their own.So why have the Thor movies struggled to find their own identity? I think it has to do with how soon they brought him into the Marvel cinematic universe. At the time, the current heroes were manifestations of science and Thor was something more cosmic. The first movie tried to bridge that gap by saying Thor's ""magic"" was science evolved. Yet future Marvel stories like Guardians of the Galaxy and Doctor Strange have been capable of producing more fantasy-like scenarios. Let's see if Thor: Ragnarok can fully embrace a more ""cosmic"" journey that can make the character entertaining.Since the events of Avengers: Age of Ultron, Thor (played by Chris Hemsworth) has been trying to find the Infinity Stones away from Earth and his home of Asgard. When he's made aware that his brother Loki (played by Tom Hiddleston) has been masquerading has their father, he returns to demand that they go get him. Thor and Loki are led to Norway where Odin (played by Anthony Hopkins) is dying. Upon that moment, the goddess of Death Hela (played by Cate Blanchett) is released. She not only reveals that she's Thor's older sister, therefore rightful heir to Odin's throne, but that she once led armies across the realms of the universe.Thor and Loki attempt to get back to Asgard, Hela sends them into space where both land on a garbage planet. Thor ends up captured by a bounty hunter Scrapper 142 (played by Tessa Thompson) and is taken to the ruler of the planet, the Grandmaster (played by Jeff Goldblum). Though Thor is forced into being a gladiator to try and win his freedom, he's relieved that his opponent is none other then the Hulk (played by Mark Ruffalo) whose been missing for two years. Thor has to figure out how to get back Bruce Banner, get off this planet, and stop Asgard from the Ragnarok destruction.I stand by that the first two Thor movies were good. Thor: Ragnarok is great! This is a fun cosmic adventure that may be just as good as those Guardians of the Galaxy films. It's clear that Thor has fully embraced just what his character can go through in his kind of situation with new planets, creatures and powers. But what separates it from the previous movies further is a sense of self aware that adds a lot of much needed humor. In fact, many of the scenes on the Grandmasters planet reminded me of Big Trouble in Little China.As before, the casting is good, but it's almost all the new stars that nearly steel the show from Thor. Cate Blanchett is definitely having a ball as the villain, bringing a lot of class, yet a bit of insanity that fits her in to the Marvel universe. Jeff Goldblum is a joy, though a lot of has to do with that he's playing himself. Though it's a shame we aren't getting any more Hulk movies, Thor Ragnarok is clearly evolving the character the more Bruce Banner is in the Hulk state, and Mark Ruffalo does well, just as much of a fish out of water.But the main reason that Thor: Ragnarok may be the best of the Thor series is that we really feel like that Thor himself went on a major journey. Without spoiling anything, He finds out a lot of dark truths about his father and the past of Asgard that makes him question what's worth saving. Just how can his people survive? Should his home survive? It all comes together and feels earned.I'll give this ten Thor helmets out of ten. 2017 has been a successful year for Marvel and if you needed a reason, this should justify that. I'm not sure why you wouldn't have seen the other Thor movies or even the other Avengers movies before watching this, but I don't think it's totally necessary. This feels the most separated from The Avengers in tone (though that's because I'm only counting Marvel heroes that are a part of the Avengers) and should cater to science fiction and fantasy fans that wanted the series to take bigger chances. Let's just say that Thor: Ragnarok is a defined thunder god in form and should be watched.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Visually Stunning,"A lot of the negative reviews surrounding Thor: Ragnarok focus on the character assassination of Thor as we know him before this film. You must have to be a die hard fan of the comic books to take issue with his u-turn in personality. As far as I'm concerned, there's a case to be made that Thor: The Dark World might be the worst film in the MCU, and it was always going to take something drastic to get cinema goers back in the door to see a sequel. I applaud Taika Waititi for doing just that.Ragnarok is pitched as a comedy, which tries too hard at times to be funny, but overall works in finally giving Thor some personality. It has been a bizarre character arc watching this almighty Norse god transition into a slapstick joker figure. But it works (even if the transition is as sudden as the flick of a switch). The plot of Ragnarok focuses on the destruction of Asgard and therefore it can seem out of place at times when Thor's new colourful personality clashes with scenes relating to the decimation of his home realm. But overall the film functions very well as a comedy and is genuinely funny. Special mention must be given to the hilarious Korg (again, props to Taika Waititi).Thor isn't the only character who finally gets a dose of personality in Ragnarok - the Incredible Hulk does too. It's never fully explained how the Hulk ends up on the planet of Sakaar, which is so far away that even Heimdall can barely see it. But we don't question it too much. I'm struggling to think of a more enjoyable scene in the entire MCU than the arena battle between Thor and Hulk, and their chemistry onscreen after this point makes for the best relationship between two Avengers. The only person who probably didn't enjoy the Hulk in Ragnarok is Edward Norton, who I believe had much darker and maturer ideas in mind for his character back in 2008. These creative differences that forced him to quit the franchise have finally paid off.Overall however it was not the comedy and colourful characters that made me enjoy Ragnarok the most. From start to finish the film is visually stunning and I think it is this more than anything else that will force me in finding myself rewatching Ragnarok over and over again. By far and away the best Thor instalment and definitely one of the best in the MCU. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Not my Fave of the trilogy but still good,"I do prefer my superhero movies a little darker than silly and for me this addition to the Thor saga went too far down the silly end of the spectrum.It was really only saved from my perspective by buff Shrek aka The Hulk.Its colourful and creative and visually stunning which are all positives.Perhaps (though I think it will never happen) I would like to see are Joker style Thor, dark, brooding, damaged...just some musings.Lovers of all things Marvel will enjoy this for sure :)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"I'm not sure why, but I did enjoy it","As others have been saying, the movie has some significant flaws, and those need to be acknowledged first. The excess use of campy comedy is a big one, completely at odds in tone with the considerable slaughter that occurs throughout the movie with Hela's conquest of Aasgaard. That's not even to mention that it's supposed to be about Ragnarok, an apocalyptic event in Thor mythology. It's also a bit grating that Thor and Loki are buddies again. Apparently, even in spite of the destruction and death that Loki inflicted on New York in Avengers (2012), it's time to let bygones be bygones. Worst of all, I think, is that while Thor ought to be in Aasgaard dealing with, well, Ragnarok, he spends most of the time in captivity on another planet with the Hulk, all so that the writers can once again showcase superheros battling each other, as if we didn't get enough of that in Civil War, Avengers I and II, and Batman vs. Superman.Still, I did enjoy the movie. Much of the humor was really good, and the writers did manage to come up with a story in which Thor faced some serious challenges, ones that don't get solved with his trusty hammer. His adventures on Sakaar also reminded me nostalgically of Flash Gordon (1980), though I think that did belong in a different movie. All in all, I wish they would dial it back with campy humor already, but I did come out of the theater entertained, and I am certainly glad they didn't go super-dark, like Logan.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Cate Blanchett plays Thors sister and the main villain in this movie, she really brings a menacing character to this movie. Jeff Goldblum plays the grandmaster and is hilarious in every scene that he is in. Mark Ruffalo is surprisingly hilarious in this movie as well as Bruce Banner and the Hulk. Tessa Thompson plays valkyrie she is easily Dislikeable as first but you grow to like her throughout the movie. Idris Elba plays Heimdall he is the most badass character next to the Thor in this movie.

I waited all this time......for this?,"I watched Planet Hulk back in 2006. Loved it!!!I watched Avengers assemble and the Mighty Avengers animation. Loved it. I love the Thor and Hulk friendship and rivalry.So when they announced this movie and I saw the first trailer, I was convinced that lightning was finally going to strike home and that this movie would meet or beat all expectations. So I waited.....and waited. I saw more trailers and clips. I scoured You-Tube for more footage. I talked about this we friends. I was going crazy waiting for this to be released.Today...finally.....in Tokyo......I went to the premiere.Well.....sad to say it......but I was a little let down.First of all......it was way too many attempts at slapstick cheap humor. Even Thor was trying to be funny or cute. He never did that in the comics.Hulk was like a big goofy kid who could barely hold his own against Thor. I expected a lot more but OK......this was acceptable. After all, this is a Thor movie, not a Hulk movie.Also, would have been nice to capture more story while on Sakaar. Many things happened in the comic and animated movie. Including a love interest for Hulk. In this movie.....nothing, even though he had been there for quite a long while.Banners character was also a goofy whiny pouty teenage girl in the movie. I did not like that. It was not cute.I suspect that teenagers and children will love this movie. But I think adults will not appreciate it. For such a dark movie with dire conclusions, it is still too upbeat and happy, even at the ending.Hopefully, when this is released on Bluray, there will be directors cut, that might make it more serious.

Marvel Era Ain't Over Yet.,"Being honest, the two preceding Thors movies were meh - middle of the road, but decent movies, in which the main character was relatively restrained. This one is something else; it's wilder, funnier yet more streamlined. ""Midgard"" (us, that is) have been completely been dropped for this one, the action taking place on two worlds, one being Asgard and the other one being, huh, special.On this subject, Goldblum plays a great Gamemaster who makes a great pair with his relative Collector in GotG I. Blanchet is simply stunning, Hiddleston is at his usual excellence and let us give some credits to Hemsworth here, always playing in the right tones. He looks like he's having a hell of a time - we couldn't ask for a better Thor. On the other hand I don't see much of Tessa Thompson's character's relevance.The story is a bit fast, and less explorative than the usual first movies of a given trilogy. Battlescenes are acceptable, including one epic fight. the sets are on par with the rest of the Marvel movies, but the music got a bit on my nerves. I thought that Led Zep's Immigrant Song was a trailer exclusivity but it appears 2 times in the movies, with jarring effects. The end themes will surprise you for a Thor movie.All and all this movie was great fun, with a comprehensible story, great actors and great outcomes. Not ""Civil War stuff"" but damn close.

Thunder against dirt,"All known category of films marvel - THOR, this time did not disappoint with his story. However, the technical part of the film, for me personally, a little disappointed.The background, which clearly stood in the pavilions was a little unfinished. And it was evident early in the film- some fuzzy details. Again, as always, humor graced the film. Very interesting remarks.
With regards to scenes with character-warlock, incomplete effects pushed very hard on the eyes, because periodically the picture of the characters has shifted so that someone just out of frame.
All in the same the early the Director us gives to know about new characters and about their characteristics. Perhaps, this was suddenly. Brevity is the sister of talent.Sometimes, there were references to the following films. This is with regards to decorations. An interesting technique that asks a lot of questions...and one of them:
""Why was this done?""The technical side of film was disappointing and in the middle of the movie. Not very good computer effects in dark scenes, BUT that doesn't make the movie terrible or less interesting.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

I am not the expert).",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Count on the MCU to keep its fans happy all year round! [+74%],"It's the third Marvel movie of the year 2017 and the third entry in the 'Thor' series. With New Zealand director Taika Waititi at the helm, we hoped to see a further lightening of tone as opposed to the first two installments as well as treading fresh ground in terms of narrative structure. Thankfully, Thor: Ragnarok delivers on both counts.The screenplay by Eric Pearson (who wrote for the Marvel 'One-shot' vignettes), Craig Kyle (the writer/co- producer for an array of animated Marvel DTV & television entries) and Christopher Yost is one of the smoothest to come out of the MCU - the segments are connected well, supplemented by an easy- to- comprehend central plot and packed with sufficient elan. Much of the dialogue seems to have to been improvised on set as the chemistry between the ensemble shows - a witty jab here, a neat pun there and a sweet slur too, somewhere in between.The cameos and Easter eggs in fact, warrant reviews of their own. Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) shows up quite early on in a scene that ties his character in close proximity with the Avengers; The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) is present in almost two-thirds of the flick and this time around, he speaks (not just when he's Bruce Banner, although the Banner bits are 'vintage-Ruffalo'). The 'Tony Stark' references ('Point Break' was hilarious!) are sprucely inculcated. Unseen MCU characters such as Ares, Man-Thing, and Beta- Ray are also nimbly referenced (in the form of stone-busts). If you've got a good eye (for Hollywood), you could observe Sam Neill, Matt Damon and Luke Hemsworth in minuscule roles as well (wink). Oh, and not to forget, Stan Lee's cameo as the 'barber'.The chief villain(ess) in the movie is Hela, the God of Death and Thor's sister, played by Cate Blanchett, who manages to 'steal the thunder' from both Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Loki (Tom Hiddleston) whenever she's on screen. While it is appreciable to see a female main-antagonist for the first time in the MCU, there is very little fleshing-out done for her character (which hopefully, will be rectified in later entries).What's great about 'Thor: Ragnarok' is how the film all of a sudden deviates from the core, about 30 minutes in, and yet manages to keep its viewers thoroughly entertained. Hiddleston and Hemsworth (with great comic timings themselves) are aided by Jeff Goldblum who plays a completely madcap Grandmaster and the host of the 'Contest of Champions', Tessa Thompson donning the role of a bad-ass 'Valkyrie' who relishes her alcohol intake (and comes across mildly as a Norse version of 'Sarah Connor') and a CGI-'Korg' (voiced by Waititi - he reserves some of the best lines in the movie for himself, and makes sly references to his earlier ventures). The set-pieces themselves are a treat for the eyes, hallmarked by Led Zeppellin's 'Immigrant Song' (the original version and not a cover) that has its roots firmly planted in Norse mythology. The absence of Jane Foster & Co. was hardly felt.Waititi's attempt falls more in line with James Gunn's 'Guardians of the Galaxy' films than the previous two 'Thor' entries. Even when comedic efforts fail to hit the intended mark on a couple of occasions, the film is clever enough to quickly hop on to the next running-gag. As with 'Hunt for the Wilderpeople', every single character has a bit of eccentricity attached to them which they showcase in their own distinct ways. My pick among the set-pieces would certainly have to be the impressive 'Valkyrie flashback' which was shot using a technique known as 'Dynamic Light'. The climactic showdown is well-executed too: the apparent 'reincarnation' of Surtur being the cherry on top of the cake.The director has also ensured that franchise-regulars Odin (Anthony Hopkins in a cameo), Heimdall (Idris Alba) and Skurge (Karl Urban, excellent as always) made their presence felt. Loki is at his zany best all throughout and often towers over his brother, in terms of frivolity. 'Thor: Ragnarok' is by all means, exactly what the doctor prescribed in order to impart much-needed rejuvenation to the Thor franchise. Make sure you stay for the mid- credits (the post-credits really didn't add much) at least.Verdict: Seventeen films in, the MCU still has got what it takes to raise the excitement-levels of fans and casual viewers. 'Thor: Ragnarok' in particular, makes the titular character again feel integral to The Avengers, and teases 'Infinity War' in an amusing way.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
The funnest Marvel movie of them all.,"MY GOD do I love this movie. After two middling Thor movies, Taika Waititi does James Gunn one better and makes Thor: Ragnorak the funniest and funnest MCU movie to-date.Chris Hemsworth seamlessly embodies Thor just as Robert Downey Jr. Is as irreplaceable as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Hemsworth is so comfortable in the role you can't imagine anyone else playing the character.And damn if Tessa Thompson isn't the most bad-ass (anti-)heroine of the MCU -- she's like the Han Solo for Marvel. She's just fantastic. If Natalie Portman doesn't bring her A-game to Love and Thunder, (which she didn't to the first two) I'd like to start a petition that Tessa Thompson takes her place (without the horrible Valkyrie outfit).Cate Blanchett rips it as Maleficent (er, I mean Hela). I love the way she just makes Karl Urban her boy-toy. Without her guidance would he really have manned up and jumped out of a space ship double wielding machine guns?!?!The majority of the action and dialogue scenes with Hulk proves the point that the Hulk is SO much better as a supporting character than.Lastly, is there a better song to go with an action sequence than Led Zeppelin's ""Immigration Song?"" If so, I can't think of one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Underwhelming and Disappointing,"Director Taika Waititi takes the character in a drastically new direction, which wasn't exactly uncalled for. Like I said before, I find the Thor franchise to be the weakest MCU series, so reinventing the character is a smart idea. But the way that Waititi transforms him, and to what extent, really took me out of the movie. Thor is a bumbling moron in this film. He is not in the least bit competent. He's always cracking jokes, or tripping over something. It's slapstick comedy for a character who had previously been established as being a rather serious person with bits of comedy. But this was all comedy, to the point where it felt like an SNL parody sketch rather than a genuine movie. I did not believe for a second that Thor was capable of doing anything, because they made him out to be such an idiot. I appreciate them trying to adjust the character, but it felt more like an elseworld, Taika Waititi fan film than an actual Thor movie...",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Just what you'd exist from the trailer, No more, No less!","It was a quality marvel movie with all its comedic elements in place. I felt the story lacked substance.

But i personally craved and wished they went a bit deep into the storyline. Maybe i didn't wanted every marvel movie transform into a sequel for guardians of the galaxy. I enjoyed the humor, but i needed to learn more about their history. Well it's possible marvel prepped it all for the next thor movie in line, so we gonna have to wait i guess.

A different instalment in the Thor franchise,"Thor: Ragnarok is jam-packed with comedy. From the opening scene to the final post-credit sequence this film wanted to make us laugh. From that reason it felt more like 'Guardians of the Galaxy' than even the previous 'Thor' movies. It's bright, colourful, and a lot of fun. We were introduced to some fantastic new characters. Among them are The Grandmaster, who is funny, crazy in a way that's charismatic. Valkyrie is good too. Her character has a dark past, but she's strong, Tessa Thompson did a good job. Hela is a pure pantomime villain. The cinematography in this movie was incredible. With help from all the visual effects, the film looks fantastic. In particular there were two or three battle scenes where the film moved in slow motion and what we saw on screen looked like a classic heaven and hell themed oil painting you might find in an art gallery. Those were truly stunning to look at. The choice of music was also good - in particular the Immigrant song. Now I can't listen to the song without having picturing the scene where Thor fights Hela's minions. But to be honest, Thor 3 with the humor felt like a kid's movie at times. One scene which involved Thor throwing something and it bouncing back hitting him on the head was funny, but it's cheap humour. On the whole, I enjoyed the performances, the cinematography, the plot, the score, and most of the humour.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
The Batman Forever of the MCU,"I was super excited for this movie. I love Thor in the comics. I love Hemsworth as Thor. Brannagh's take on the characters in the first film was appropriate.

I loved the music. I even accept the story, though they really bastardized a lot of the comic book mythos, which I expect anymore. There was a great, deep story to be told here that was ruined by inappropriate humor. Now disclaimer: I don't enjoy the humor that is so popular in a lot of NZ and AUS material, so this movie was not for me.

"A fun, entertaining rebirth of the 'Thor' saga","Ever since Disney acquired the rights to the Marvel franchise, there have been signs of change in the films that have released compared to earlier efforts. 'Thor: Ragnarok' stands out as an example of a film that feels very different from its two predecessors, as it's closer to a 'Guardians of the Galaxy' vibe than a 'Captain America' one. This is true despite the fact that it revolves around Thor's quest to thwart the destruction of his homeland of Asgard at the hands of the evil war goddess Hela (played brilliantly by Cate Blanchett).'Ragnarok' is fun, yet dark. Campy, yet mature. A lot of this is likely influenced by its director, Taika Waititi, who is able to bring out more character in each actor. While Blanchett is easily the best part of 'Ragnarok,' Chris Hemsworth once again picks up his hammer and delivers a performance that is anything but wooden. Other standouts include Tessa Thompson, whose Valkyrie is the perfect sidekick for Thor, while Tom Hiddleston is his usual mischievous self as Loki. And then there's Jeff Goldblum's Grandmaster, who is quite possibly the oddest individual ever conceived for this series. 'Ragnarok' also does a good job of continuing to weave together others from the Marvel universe, from Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) to the boring as watching paint dry Bruce Banner/Hulk (Mark Ruffalo).It's clear there are almost too many people to keep track of in 'Ragnarok,' although it doesn't feel as overwhelming as an 'Avengers' film. Perhaps one aspect that helps in this regard is that the main settings of Asgard and Sakaar are interesting. It's nice to see the majority of a Marvel film take place somewhere other than earth, which seems to be a new trend for Marvel. And then there's the soundtrack - a mix of 80s-infused electronica - which doesn't really fit the story, but still sounds pretty cool. Perhaps its weakest element is in the dialogue - too many cheesy jokes thrown in to the point where it almost sounds like a running gag reel.It wouldn't be fair to say 'Thor: Ragnarok' is one of the best Marvel films, but what it lacks in sophistication is made up in the entertainment department.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

This is what you called a perfect all round entertainer.One thing which I have seen in most of the marvel movies is the predictable storyline and same is the case with this movie but I must say that Watiti deserves an applause for turning this cliche into a fun joyride. As soon as the movie starts with Hemsworth in the cage delivering a funny dialogue you will realize that you are into a different Marvel movies.Acting is superb and credit should be given to all the characters for doing a superb job, screenplay of the movie is fast paced and has the pinch of funny one liners and humour in between.

THEY MADE THOR GOOD!,"When the original Thor came out, I enjoyed it quite a bit. It was at the start of the MCU and it was an entertaining watch.With the vast improvements in storytelling, action, and character development the MCU has seen, re-watching Thor 1 has been a bit of a tough one to go back to. It's still decent, but it's really brought down by the Earth side characters (Natalie Portman and the annoying intern), and some really lackluster action direction (fighting the destroyer at the end).When Thor 2 came out, I enjoyed it at first, but soon came to realize that it was not very good. It has moments, but it's villain was AWFUL, the side Earth characters were even more goddamn annoying, and the story was just so unmemorable that I can barely remember what it was about...So when Thor 3 rolled around, I was skeptical. Iron Man recovered after the awful 2, Captain America got progressively better each movie, and I crossed my fingers that Thor would do the same. And luckily for all MCU fans, it did!It was a fantastic idea for them to team up Thor and Hulk as we've seen now that Hulk in his own movie really doesn't work well. Some people are critical of the comedy they added, while there are moments where it is too much, it works pretty well for the most part.This is the exact boost that Thor needed. I'm sure if you asked ANY MCU fan before this movie if they liked Thor and most people would give you a ""MEH"" reaction. But ask them after this movie? I'm sure many would tell you that he's their new favorite.One of the aspects that really improves it was removing all of the Earth side characters from the first movies. Removing the forced love interest and the annoying intern were the best things to ever happen to Thor. It's something I was hoping for with the 2nd movie, but they really felt the need to add ""relatable"" characters and keep bringing Thor back to Earth. Earth is only seen for a moment in this one, but 98% of the movie is on alien planets. Something I think Marvel was weary on doing until Guardians of the Galaxy ended up being a smash hit.I'm so happy with how Ragnarok turned out. It's just so damn fun to watch. Some of the humor is a bit too much, but most of it works and really make Thor a much more fun character to watch. Thor might be the ONLY original Avenger to get a 4th solo movie, and with this rejuvenated style of Thor I'm actually excited to see more from it. Not knowing what the finale of Endgame will hold, it might be cool to have him team up with another hero for an adventure, or possibly the return of Sif?",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

They always try to be serious when they can't possibly do it when they have characters like Thor, Loki and Odin. And so when it was time for me to watch this movie I was very reluctant, because I knew I can't skip it. But I'm glad I sat through this movie, because it was a huge improvement.The movie started out in Asgard, from the point where Thor: The Dark World left (and honestly the only thing I remember about that movie). The way that movie had ended, I had thought this movie would build more on Loki pretending to be Odin. But that ended immediately. Instead this movie focuses on Thor and Loki's estranged sister Hela, who had been abandoned by Odin at a young age. She easily manages to defeat both Thor and Loki and sends them to exile on Sakaar, with Thor reaching the planet two weeks after Loki. That was the part where the movie skyrockets the interest. I like everything about it movie from a cinematic point of view - the CGI, the acting, the comic timings, the story, the dialogues. Everything is absolutely perfect. I could undoubtedly say that this is one of, if not the best superhero movies which is not an origin story but rather a continuation of events. The comedy of the arc is the selling point. My favourite dialogue was the rock guy saying, ""I planned to start a revolution but didn't publish enough pamphlets so hardly anyone turned up.""After Thor, Loki, Hulk and Valkyrie come back to Asgard to stop Hela we get the best CGI ever witnessed with Thor. I really like how his eyes glow whenever he has to shoot lightning. I always wanted him to be like that. Thor really had a very drastic character development. I know many people have said this - he lost his father, learnt about his sister, his friends were killed, his precious hair was cut by none other than Stan Lee himself, he continuously got taken down by Valkyrie and lost against Hulk, his entrie planet got blown up and his people encountered Thanos in space. And yet this was the funniest MCU movie yet. And not just Thor, every scene that had Loki in it was always interesting too.However, this movie was obviously not without its set of flaws. For starters the elephant in the room, the amount of exposition that was given throughout the movie was too much, with most of it never being mentioned any time afterwards. There was even a scene where Thor is explained everything about Sakaar on a virtual trip, but it was never talked about afterwards nor was it necessary. If it wasn't for this unnecessary padding of runtime, I'd have given it 10/10. The Planet Hulk arc was also quite unexplored from the comics, and it would have been great if they made a spinoff movie on Hulk also since Hulk has never been given a solo movie starring Mark Ruffalo. Then the biggest plot hole, Valkyrie electrocuting Thor also didn't make sense since Thor is literally the God of Thunder and he shoots lightning from his hands. And then when Hela pins Thor he gets the ex-machina of his father telling him about his superpowers.Thor: Ragnarok is an excellent MCU movie. It's kinda sad that this can't be enjoyed unless you've watched Thor: The Dark World and Avengers: Age of Ultron. Because it could have really been cool to show to someone who has no idea what the MCU is all about. It does have the good reward to it, since you can watch Avengers: Infinity War after it. And the tone of this movie is so flexible that even the grim Infinity War completely suits in being its sequel.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Best Thor,"The quality is here: great production values and great acting by everybody, especially surprised by the supporting acts. It works as a comedy film even if it's weird to put him on the context of the previous films. A bit overpopulated, too many comedy elementos and too much chat during inappropriate moments (usual on MCU films) but overall this a good film and the best Thor.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Nothing Special,"When I see movies that are rated 8.0 and higher I assume that they're exceptional and thus worth the watch. This movie, however, was not exceptional. Jeff Goldbloom and Chris Hemsworth had solid performances and overall I liked the banter, but it was really just an average superhero movie. The only other superhero movie I can recall being rated 8.0+ was Logan, and after watching it I had to agree that it was worth the high score - but after watching Thor: Ragnarok I'm a bit skeptical of what criteria these critics are using.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"A crazy, crazy comedy","#MCUrewatch. It took three films to get the character and world of Thor right, but boy did director Waititi succeed (the first two were either too serious or too dark). If you thought Guardians of the Galaxy was crazy, wait until you see Ragnarok. With its 80's soundtrack and visuals it looks like a teenagers dream. The entire film is a joy (although the climax isn't as good as what came before) but especially the middle act (which takes place on the planet Sakaar) is some of the best the MCU ever delivered. Comedy genius with great performances from Hemsworth, Ruffalo, Waititi and especially Goldblum. It is here where the director can put his auteur stamp on the film and make it one of the craziest superhero films of all time. And that is a great compliment.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Hilarious and Very Entertaining,I have now seen this 5 times and it still makes me laugh - the first genuinely funny Marvel film that doesn't take itself seriously and sets out from the start to entertain. It never flags for a second - steamrollering through one episode to the next without allowing the audience to catch its breath. Everyone over-acts like it's a competition and the effect is an epic and inevitable cult classic. Nuff said !,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Hippy Hippy Thor,"Thor was always a tricky comic book character to bring to big screen. Kenneth Branagh managed to do it by making the first film as a mock Shakespearean action film fuelled by dysfunctional family dynamics. He was instrumental in casting Tom Hiddleston as Loki.Unfortunately Thor:The Dark World was rather dreary. Marvel has taken a left turn for Thor: Ragnarok by getting inspiration from The Guardians of the Galaxy film by underpinning the film with comedy.King Odin has been sent to a nursing home on Earth by Loki who has pretended to be Odin at Asgard. Thankfully Doctor Strange felt Odin would be more at home in Norway.When Thor returns to Asgard he sees through Loki's disguise. When they go to meet a dying Odin, he tells both of an evil older sister, Hela (Cate Blanchett) who will return and cause chaos.Thor:Ragnarok is a rather trippy neon lit 1980s infused adventure film. In some ways it nods a hat to movies like Big Trouble in Little China.Thor is both aided and thwarted by evil brother Loki who sees Thor getting a painful bashing that he endured in the hands of the Hulk who is the main star in a planet where beings take part in a gladiatorial contest.It is Asgard and some of the regulars from there who get short shrift, characters such as Heimdall. Karl Urban who plays Hela's henchman called Skurge is rather wasted of his talents as we know he is capable of giving much more. Even Blanchett is rather bland as the villainess, Hela. In some ways the film is rather dark and brutal but it is always undercut by the comedy.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Thor: Ragnarok,"Since the superhero movie was made, special effects and stars are almost no problem. They can match the routines the target audience wants to see, and they will still sell no matter how they are repeated. Action Rhythm and excessive details are a psychological game with the audience. If the commercial elements are well distributed, the plot will have a sense of seamless connection. Just like this Thor, it is also the most appropriate atmosphere for the climax of the recent action movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Best Thor Film Yet!,"After so many films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the filmmakers always seem to keep them fresh and interesting. Thor: Ragnarok is interesting and fresh to say the least. The director Taika Waititi is a genius behind the camera as he somewhat changed the feel of the Thor films but keeping some of the familiarities associated with the previous films. The comedic level is sky-high, as most of it was giggling fun thanks to Waititi's direction, as a result it seemed like the actors had a lot more fun, but had their work cut out for them. The cameos in this film are splendid especially in one particular scene with cameos by Sam Neill (Jurassic Park), Liam Hemsworth (Chris Hemsworth's brother), and Matt Damon (The Bourne Identity). Cate Blanchett as always does an outstanding job as the villainess Hela. Her commitment to the role was respectable in that she actually studied a Brazilian martial art called capoeira, pretty cool right? Karl Urban also had some homework to do to get ready for his role; he shaved his hair, and worked out. The effort by the actors especially the ones I mentioned make this film that much more pleasurable, the people actually cared about the film and the story, as all films should be. The action was intense, the acting was superb, the effects were stunning, and the story was likable. However, the only problems for me that prevents it from being a 10/10 is the just the length, I actually could have gone for more, it was too short in my opinion. But that's not a fault, just a nitpick, or in another way, its actually a positive since I enjoyed the film so much, so take the rating with a pinch of salt. Overall, I loved this movie! Keep it up Marvel!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
It's Safe To Go Back In The Theater...,"In recent reviews, I've called attention to the fact that 2017 has been a pretty dismal year for movies. Recently, I've seen ""Planet of the Apes,"" ""Logan Lucky,"" and ""Blade Runner."" What do these three seemingly disparate movies have in common? They all received outstanding reviews across the board, and all three were TERRIBLE.I was certainly beginning to lose faith in this whole ""Hollywood"" thing and this whole ""paying $40 for my family to watch a crappy movie when we could be home watching NETFLIX"" thing. Fear not, movie-lovers. As usual, Marvel has delivered the goods.""Ragnarok"" is the vehicle that will elevate Hemsworth from a star to a hyper-star. He is simply electrifying, and the movie is loads of fun. My only complaint is I wish they didn't use El Grande Verde in the marketing material. It would have been even better if his appearance was a complete surprise, which obviously it was not.Bottom line, Marvel is just running circles around the rest of Hollywood. If you have been burned by the appallingly lousy movies of 2017, set your fears aside and go see Ragnarok. You will love it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Great Balance of Comedy, Action and Emotion. Just Awesome!","So i went and watched it today with high expectations and it didn't disappoint. One major achievement of this movie is that it has great comedy(Thor-Loki-Hulk are a great combo for that), it has some dramatic moments and awesome action sequences.Fight scenes are intense and they give each character the time to shine. Including secondary characters as well.It's also interesting that you get to see another version of each character especially with Thor and Hulk. Loki is... well Loki as always in his exceptional way.And you got your weird eccentric Villain in a nice fit for Goldblum and a powerful female villain in Hela.It features nice cameos and in general the movie feels important with an ""Avengers"" magnitude but with less than half the roster.Nicely done...

Thor: Ragnarok (2017),"Marvel comics was once my favorite brand of comics but these days not so much. They have disbanded all their classic characters Peter Parker, Bruce Banner and even Tony Stark with stupid replacements like Miles Morales, some Asian Hulk and RI RI Williams as Iron Woman, so I'm not a fan of their comics anymore. Marvel Studios has been great I have loved all their films except for Iron Man 2 and then came Spider-Man: Homecoming which is undoubtedly one of the worst things I have seen done to my favorite superhero. Now comes the third Thor film and Thor has been the weakest even though I do love both movies but this, this is cool. Thor has been going around through the nine realms trying to find answers about the Infinity Stones but as we see is captured by Surtur the fire demon. He escapes and returns to Asgard Once there he sees that Loki has taken their fathers place, he demands Loki to take him to father. After they find Odin they are greeted by Hela who destroys Thor's hammer and as the two brothers try to escape through the Bifröst, Hela plunges them both into a different Realm. Now Thor must get the help of old and new ally to help him return home and prevent Hela from destroying Asgard. The opening scene with Surtur is my favorite part of the whole movie. I was just so excited to see him since in Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes cartoon he appeared briefly but he wasn't around for much. If any big gripe I have with the movie it's that I wanted to yet again see more of him and just Thor fighting. But it was great to see him finally. This is the funniest of the Thor movies and when I heard about this I was super concerned because I am not a huge fan of comedy and for a movie with a fire demon to have comedy kind of gave me a bad impression before going in. But the jokes mostly hit with me. Chris Hemsworth is funny. When they announced Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie I was very opposed to the idea, I have expressed in my review of Spider-Man: Homecoming that I hate it when comic book movies change the race of characters. It's even just as bad when they do it in Norse mythology or any myth and legend, that's not how history has shown or described them to be so to change it is just wrong. We can excuse it for Heimdal because Idris Elba is a good actor but I had no idea who this chick was, but she was great in the movie. I'm not a fan that they changed her race, Valkyrie is a white blonde. But Tessa did pretty great so I'll allow it, let's just say that's a nitpick. Cate Blanchett as Hela the Goddess of Death was amazing. Some might say that shes not that great of a villain but I disagree she's called the Goddess of death and Odin's daughter who fought alongside him. She has a clear goal of destroying her father's land because she is the goddess of death. Battleworld, where Thor meets up and battles the Hulk is a great looking environment. The fight with the hulk was great and it was great to see Jeff Goldblum have fun with himself and everyone there. The best thing about this movie is its aesthetic, the movie looks beautiful. Like a 70s or 80s high fantasy movie. That's what mostly appealed to me in this movie it was cool to see in a Thor movie. Director Taika Waititi is also in the movie voicing Korg who is one of the best new characters the MCU has introduced recently. He did a great job directing this film, I wouldn't be surprised if Kevin Feige and the studio decided to keep him around to direct another Marvel project. Thor: Ragnarok is the best of all the Thor films. In a time where I believe the Marvel cinematic universe is beginning to show more cracks, Thor: Ragnarok still gives us one big fun adventurous ride with our favorite asgardians and the big green Hulk, not to mention the best music video of the Immigrant song. I'm giving my favorite Thor film a five out of five.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
No hammer? No problem.,"Thor's reliance on mythological constructs is always a part of the draw for a fan of myth like myself, but also vexing because liberties are usually taken, and not always for the better. In this case, Hela(Hel in Norse mythology) has her background rewritten, but in this way it works, as it shows Odin's past, a past that is much more in line with his mythological self.That said, half the fun of Thor movies is Loki. I will never get tired of Tom Hiddleston in that role, and the rapport between he and Thor remains as great as it ever was. Thor also has a great few minutes with Dr. Strange, as teased at the end of that movie. It seems that each encounter with each different character brings a different level of snark from Thor that hasn't been as present in previous installments, and this makes him much more engaging and entertaining than he had been before. He trades jokes with fire demons, Hulk, Valkyrie, Loki, and anybody else he runs into.This movie is a lot of fun. For how serious the subject of Ragnarok is for Asgardians, they manage to have a good time with it. Cate Blanchett brings a great over the top touch to Hela, going so far as to give her a wit at times, and manages to separate her a bit from the rudimentary MCU villains.Marvel continues to make superhero films that are as fun as they are serious, and as such provides that truly engaging movie experience, reminding us that it's okay that The Grandmaster is a goofball, or that there's a guy made of rocks that's as soft spoken as they come. In the end, we get what we come for: The heroes do battle with a powerful villain throughout, summoning great courage and special effects to deliver a great time for all. And now, it's nearly time for the Infinity War. Stay tuned.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Garish yet good,"I'd heard so many good things about this film and I thought I'd give it a chance as soon as it arrived on blu-ray. It wasn't a disappointment in the slightest. We get Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston as well as Jeff Goldblum (in a better role than Independence Day: Resurgence) and lots of colorful sets and powerful effects. The director did a fine job with this film and it's good for a trilogy-closer. I wasn't bored in the slightest. To be honest, I liked this better than The Dark World (Thor's second outing). It's more memorable too.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Above average action flick for children,"Good action flick with mediocre script. All characters behave like 8 year old's (especially the Tessa character, she's so god damn annoying).

The Thunder Rolls,"Welcome to the new and approved Asgard, or as I like to call it: The Revenge of an Angry Sibling. Let's rewind back to 2011 when we were first introduced to the God of Thunder. Thor, the crown prince of Asgard, has a sibling rivalry with his brother Loki over the rights to the throne and the birthright to become better brothers. You know the saying, ""All that ends well, ends well."" Not in this case ""Not all that ends well, doesn't end well."" Then we come to 2013, when all hope was almost seen as lost. When the dark forces of a foe that they thought was almost diminished, got stronger through a black mass that almost destroyed what Thor almost hold dear to his heart.Now we come to the mother of all, the impending doom of Asgard when someone from the past comes back unbeknownst to Thor and Loki – a woman from the past seeks revenge on the city and all that Thor and Loki could do to save their city is to, well, I'm not going to spoil it, but I will say this Hela, played beautifully and menacing by the talented Oscar winner Cate Blanchett, did an incredible job.Ragnarok was awesome. It was adventurous, dangerous, comedic. I thoroughly enjoyed. Stay tuned though because this movie is vital to the upcoming next Avengers movie. Not saying anymore.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Come for the Action, Stay for the Comedy","If there's one area where superhero movies generally fall short, it's in the storyline and dialogue, while the fight scenes and special effects never disappoint. Ragnarok is the exception as they have finally put together a story that remains gripping throughout the film, largely due to all the laughs the movie provides.I thought it was peculiar whe I heard the new Thor movie was being directed by Taika Waititi, who is known for comedies including the amusing well-known film, ""What We Do In The Shadows"". I have to give credit to him for showing his unknown talent in making terrific action scenes, but for also bringing a better comedic touch to the Marvel universe. I noticed IMDB Trivia points out how Waititi says probably 80 percent of the film was improvised or ad-libbed, so I reckon he deserves credit for adding funny lines and letting the actors have fun making the film.Waititi doesn't only deliver in terms of comedy though, he also creates some of the neatest fight scenes I've seen from a Marvel movie. In particular, the fight between Thor and a fellow Avenger was very well done and a pleasant surprise to me when they encountered one another.In the end, it's the most enjoyable superhero movie I have seen (and I've seen them all), because unlike the others that have cheesy, dull dialogue separating the stunning action sequences, Ragnarok is never boring between the action scenes. In fact, it's practically a comedy that is enhanced and made better by the action when it comes along. In other words, you're not just sitting and waiting for the next duel to come along, but you're excited when it arrives.Some of the other superhero films, on the other hand, have been obviously hastily written, as if they came up with a few cool fights and then quickly wrote up a weak storyline with shody banter between characters to connect the fight scenes. With Ragnarok, I was never bored for a second and (shockingly) never had to roll my eyes even once due to the usual sappy, overly sentimental segment that is meant to touch our hearts, which had become fundamental to these superhero films.Ultimately, Ragnarok brings the action as expected, but it also brings the comedy, and does so in a perfect balance, to create the best overall superhero movie to date.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

'How did this happen?' Superheroes become a joke...,"Ragnarök is the ultimate Nordic battle and the last movie we will see before Infinity War, therefore I was expecting something a little bit more apocalyptic.From the first scene to the very last one everything is a joke, I know MCU likes to make the movies a little kid-friendly with a comic relief, but Thor Ragnarok is way over the top. The movie is full with sad moments, a bunch of them, I couldn't take any of them seriously because the jokes would not stop.Because everything is a joke there's no tension at any point, the main character doesn't grow or learns anything new, and the villain is never something you actually worry about, the plot becomes flat and boring.Hela, played by the amazing Cate Blanchett, is a waste of character, she does it beautifully, as far as she can, but doesn't make a villain you will remember. The friendship between Thor and Hulk doesn't go to a really deep level; and the brotherly Thor-Loki relationship is so predictable that it just plain dull.What I'm most worried about is that this will set a new trend for the new Marvel movies, where superheroes can't be taken seriously because they make a joke out of it. Most heroes have a dark past that makes them who they are, MCU had done an incredibly work till this year, with Spiderman-Homecoming, but specially Thor Ragnarok, a movie that had such a potential but it turned out being a joke, literally.Apparently Marvel is more concerned about making a movie that will make you chuckle for a couple of hours instead of making a movie with a deep story that'll make you say ""I can't wait for the next Marvel movie!"".Now we just have to wait and hope the best for Infinity War.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
The most crazy and fun Thor movie you will ever see.,"The Thor films have never really been the standouts in the MCU slate (at least by my opinion). I have always felt they have only ever existed to expand the scope of the MCU from global to cosmic but have been afraid of fully embracing the weird sci-fi/Lord of the Rings element. This Thor movie unapologetically embraces the weirdness and subverts what you would expect.New Zealand director of Hunt for the Wilderpeople and What We Do in The Shadows, Taikai Waititi and star Chris Hemsworth completely reinvent the mythology of the Asgardian god and have fun with it. The story of Ragnarok basically tears away everything that we've known about Thor and rebuilds his identity similar to what Winter Soldier did with Captain America. The way Waititi treats the mythology is that either there is a meta-type of humour to acknowledge the past two Thor films or it reveals dark secrets that questions what Odin and Asgard stand for. Some may feel bothered by how Waititi treats some characters depending if you somehow liked the past two Thor films.Another divisive thing is the humour. I for one am a big Waititi fan and thought his sense of humour was a nice change of pace compared to some of the forced comedy in past Marvel movies. A lot of it revolves around the fun awkward moments the characters have with one another. The humour may be a bit weird and twisted, and does come unexpectedly at some serious moments in the film but I felt that Waititi still hit the mark in understanding Thor's own personal struggle. I will say there were a lot of times this felt more like Waitti made a sci-fi fantasy comedy then a Marvel movie. That could be a good or bad depending on whom you ask.This is definitely the best Hemsworth has been in the role as Thor thanks to Waititi letting him show his comedic sense of humour rather then just rely on him seriously brooding for most of the time. Hemsworth and Waititi are aware of Thor's thick-headedness, pride and ego so they just go for it to show how flawed and insecure the character really is. And it still allows Thor to grow out from his comfort zone once his hammer gets destroyed to become a better defined character.There are great characters that Thor interacts with that are lot more unique and well-defined compared to Jane Foster (no offense to Natalie Portman). With elements of Planet Hulk thrown in, Hulk for the first time feels like a full character rather then just a piece of Bruce Banner's personality. On Sakaar, Hulk (played by Mark Ruffalo in mo-cap) now is this semi-intelligent, childish celebrity who challenges Thor's masculinity but also relates to his insecurity. Tom Hiddleston once again is great as Loki who this time is no longer scheming a master plan but just trying to make the best of the situation he is unfortunately in. The big scene-stealer in this is Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie, the fallen warrior turned bounty hunter. Thompson just owns the role without resorting to being a bland female sidekick. The character can come in and challenge someone's masculinity and status of power but still have enough vulnerability where we learn that she remains on Sakaar as a form of escape from her own personal demons. Also her alcoholic drinking capabilities would be one to challenge Tony Stark. And what can I say about Jeff Goldblum as the Grandmaster. It's Jeff Goldblum being himself as a powerful tyrant on an alien world and it's perfect. Couldn't ask for anything more. The one character I didn't unfortunately really connect to and is a problem that Marvel still refuses to fix (If you don't count Micheal Keaton's Vutlure) is the villain Hela. She does feel more intimidating and dangerous then most MCU villains but is very one-note in her goals. Cate Blanchett's performance does elevates this one-dimensional character with some fun but most of her scenes are just giving exposition to Karl Urban's Skurge and creating another faceless army of monsters for the hero to fight. Other great hilarious performances are from Waititi himself playing a cgi rock warrior version of himself called Korg and surprisingly Urban is also pretty funny as well.The look of the alien garbage world Sakaar is just breathtaking to look at from the oceans littered with fallen spacecrafts to the brightly coloured, abstract cities. Waititi's use of colour makes this Thor movie feel more bright and lively. With a lot of the action and the fun character banter happening on that world, when the film cuts back to Asgard I felt the pace slowing down and became less exciting. But it does make up for it in the final battle when Thor and his new team (delightfully called the Revengers) arrive and the stakes for Asgard are raised. And this leads to some big-changing events that put Thor on his path to Infinity War.Overall Thor: Ragnarok may not be the Marvel movie for everyone but is for sure the best and most fun we have gotten out of Thor and will surely be a treat for anyone who is a fan of Taika Waititi.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Nothing but jokes and one-liners, and I love it","I must admit, the first two Thor movies are some of my least favorite movies in the entire MCU. They both feel very silly and not very competent at all to me, and I was pretty worried that this was going to be similar in quality. That fear did not come true in the slightest though, as this movie is a gem that I liked way more than I should. On paper, this doesn't seem like anything special. The plot is really basic at first, the characters are just passable and so is the acting. The villain is pretty boring, and her plan felt very reharshed from previous Marvel movies. I will say though, the climax subverts your expectations really nicely, and I liked that they went in a new direction with the old ""End of the world""-trope. Still, this movie seems really basic on paper, and it probably would be in practice as well, had it not been for one crucial thing: The COMEDY. This is without a doubt the funniest movie in the entire MCU. Every scene has funny moments, every character spits out jokes and one-liners left and right. Some characters feel like they were only created to be comic relief, yet I am not even mad, as they're all comedy geniuses. My personal favorite side-character was Korg, every single word that came out of his mouth was pure gold, and the same can be said for several other characters as well. Loki worked way better as a side-kick than the antagonist, which was something I pointed out about Thor: The Dark World (In practice the only thing that movie got right). And the fact that Jane and Erik wasn't in the movie, yet I didn't miss them for a second, unfortunatly speaks to their worth as characters. This entire movie is comedy gold, there is no other way to describe it. Every scene is great, every joke lands, this is such a delightful movie. It doesn't really have much to offer in terms of multi-layered themes like some other MCU movies, and is therefore not as good, but it's still a awesome movie that greatly exceeded my expectations with how much fun I had watching it. I highly recommend this to anyone that enjoys dumb, hilarious jokes and slap-stick (Which, for the record, I'm not usually a fan of), and to anyone that likes Marvel movies in general. This is by far the best Thor movie and probably one of the funniest movies I've seen in years. It's just that hilarious.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Ragnorok Rocks!,"This is our go to movie in the Marvel Universe. I realize it is not everyone's cup of tea, but it is our favorite. The opening sequence is hilarious and nothing is more perfect than badass Thor fighting to Led Zeppelin's ""Immigrant Song"" to send the movie on it's way. We get a bit of background of Odin, the Valkyries, and Asgard along the way, but the movie's primary focus is preventing Ragnorok.As always, Hemsworth and Hiddleston are flawless in their roles. Cate Blanchett is perfection as the sociopathic Hela and Ruffalo is charming as the bipolar Hulk who really just wants to be loved. Who knew?But what we love most about this movie is that it never takes itself too seriously. Sure it has all the requisite elements of a great superhero movie, but it is funny... REALLY funny. It was refreshing to see another dimension to Hemsworth as he delivers the excellent comedic moments. We are almost in the double digits on viewing this one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A breath of fresh air,"It is fair to say that out of all the Marvel superheroes, Thor has not had the best run, commonly viewed as having the worst solo outings. However, that all changes with the recent release of Thor: Ragnarok, his third film, proving that the character still has life in him yet.We follow Thor, played by returning star Chris Hemsworth, as he attempts to take on the magical knife-weilding Hela ""The Goddess of death"" (Cate Blanchett). We see Thor join up with a wide multitude of characters including Loki (Tom Hiddleston), Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) and The Hulk/ Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo). Although the standout is the hilarious newcomer of Korg, played by the director: Taika Waititi, who steals every scene he is in. The film is very reminiscent of Guardians of the Galaxy due to the fact, a large portion takes place on alien planets and relies on a very similar type of humour - which to say the least, is a good thing.Thor Ragnarok is primarily a comedy. It is hilarious. Anybody could go into this film and then come out of the cinema with a huge smile on their face. Being a superhero film, there are several highly stylised and well shot action scenes allowing Taika Waititi, to show his skill. The most memorable being the fight between the Hulk and Thor, which is pure spectacle. It is not just the action scenes that are well shot, it is most scenes in general. Granted, it is no Blade Runner, but every scene is packed with so much colour that you can't help but admire it.
Being the 17th Marvel movie, it is fair to say that a lot of people are feeling a ""Marvel fatigue"". I know I did with Guardians of the Galaxy 2. However, Ragnarok, thankfully, breathes new life into its characters and its universe, as there are events that will have consequences in future Marvel movies. Before Ragnarok, Thor was very much a background character, for example; if someone asks you to name a superhero, you would probably say quite a few before even considering Thor. But Ragnarok increases the characters likeability immensely, doing for him what the first Iron man film did for Tony Stark. That being said, it is not perfect. If the film has to choose between a serious scene, or a joke, it will choose the joke. This can affect the flow of the film and the gravity of a situation, but it by no means ruins the film.I highly recommend getting to see this one, especially if you want a break from the seriousness of life, it is guaranteed to put a smile back on your face. With a stellar cast, spot on action, hilarious jokes and a surprising story, Thor Ragnarok is the Marvel movie to see.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"Puerile, but has its moments...","I immediately looked at all the worst reviews (the 1 and 2 ratings) and I couldn't disagree with anything they said. This is Thor as ""Frat Boy"" with poor jokes. He was considerably more ""Thor"" in the first movie, with the nobility that is part of Thor's character. I knew as soon as I heard Led Zepplin in the first 10 minutes when Thor is fighting Surtur that this was going to be one of Marvel's more juvenile movies. I was not disappointed in my observations.No point in mindlessly bashing it, but accurately describing it? That I can do.1) Hela is not Odin's daughter. 2) Nobody can actually destroy Mjolnir: this was done strictly for the 15-year olds, who like to see punches, big arena fight scenes and endless ray guns shooting everywhere, and, 3) this just isn't Ragnarok in any serious sense. So, this is a teen comedy!Which explains Skurge, the Executioner. In the movie, he behaves like a 14 year old, complete with toys, trying to impress the ""babes.""
Everyone talks like they're on 20th century Earth. Is this so the viewing audience doesn't have to think at all? I guess it is. It reminded me of one of the 'Charlies Angels' movies, only with guys.That said, no review that's not ""RAH RAH"" good will influence anyone who uses the word ""awesome"" at least 5 times a day. It IS entertainment, but entertainment that I can press ""pause,"" make a phone call or three, or do a 10 minute meditation, read the New York Times, come back to this, and hit ""play"" again without ever feeling like I lost anything. There's no tension (as was pointed out in the 1s and 2s reviews), no character development (there's that ""FratBoy Thor"" again), and Cate Blanchett, for the one and only time, was an extremely banal Hela, whose hairstyle must have been done by the late Vidal Sassoon (but then, you'd had to have actually read Thor comic books to care about that, ) and that's why the poor reviews are (justifiably) poor.As the late, great famous wit, Dorothy Parker once said of a play, ""It ran the entire gamut of emotions from A to B."" If you understand that, good. If you don't, then Thor is going to be okay for you, and there's nothing wrong with that! 87% of the audience on Rotten Tomatoes liked it.Me? I'll take The Black Panther movie over anything else Marvel has put out, although the FIRST Avengers movie was quite well done (and completely unlike this).",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

This movie wouldn't have looked or felt any different if they had replaced Chris Hemsworth with Aziz Ansari.

Waititi embraces the kitsch in a huge tonal shift from The Dark World and it's all the better for it. Hemsworth is in his element playing every scene with a extra devilish wink in his eye. There's a host of superb new characters who all add to the fun from Blanchett's camp villain gloriously chewing all the scenery around her to Goldblum's hilarious portrayal of a futuristic well... Jeff Goldblum. My personal favourite was the Kiwi pile of rocks played with superb dead-pan humour by the film's director Waititi.

Thor 3 RaganaROCKS!,"This more than makes up for the lackluster ""Thor: The Dark World."" Although, this still could have been better. I enjoyed it and thought it was fun, but the tone and style felt out of place for a Thor movie. I kept thinking ""I'm watching Guardians of the Galaxy"" with different characters. Everything from an '80s synthesizer soundtrack to bright unicorn-vomit visuals is here. While the film is fun, the plot was all over the place. It felt like watching 3 movies at once. I kept thinking ""Just pick and stick with a plotline."" It jumps from location to location and story arc to story arc very quickly, and at times it was very hard to keep up with. I had to keep backtracking at least 10 minutes in my mind to catch myself up. ""Oh yeah, that happened."" Jeff Goldblum had a lot to offer as the character ""Grandmaster"". He had some funny lines and made me laugh a few times. Cate Blanchett is chilling as the villain ""Hela."" If you thought Tom Hiddleston could be scary at times, just wait until you see her performance. There were a lot of fun Easter Eggs that foreshadow at things to come and it was overall, a very fun movie. Like I said, my only complaint is the all-over-the-place plot, but considering how boring ""Dark World"" was, I'm just glad we finally got a good Thor sequel, even if at times it still could have been better.

"Absolutely ridiculous, yet the best possible outcome","I don't know whether the comic book Thor is or has ever been popular, but its movie adaptation never stood much chance. It's simply impossible to make good cinema - which implies evolution and improvement - when your main theme revolves around almighty and technically unkillable gods which seem to be perfect by design. The first movie had the bonus of setting's and characters' freshness, but the sequel was basically a mess simply because the franchise hit the ceiling and started to suffocate.What Ragnarok did to Thor is both a blasphemy and a revival. The almighty ones are still mighty enough for the show, but aren't quite omnipotent anymore. More to that, this movie has much less hero'ing and much, MUCH more goofiness. Director Taika Waititi basically splits it in two: the ""typical Thor"" stuff, with Asgardian theme, a serious villain and ""true"" confrontation, and the ""comic relief"" part which, from its neon disco start, was obvious to bear nothing but the ironic load - and that irony is exactly what makes Thor Ragnarok not merely watchable (which Dark World failed at) but even actually funny.The difference between funny and fun is so subtle that some don't see it at all - but there is one and it's important. By breaking the rules and turning a superhero film into a sequence of ""Thor and Loki walk into a bar""-like sketches, Ragnarok loses a clear point of view we could perceive it from. Should we still expect it to be coherent and consistent within its own rules? Or should we just let ourselves slide along the slapstick action because nothing is truly serious or important anymore? The film tries to cater to every side of this argument, but kinda ends sitting straight in between of two chairs, with no obvious failure but with a typical crack implying that its pants might've fallen a victim of the bold maneuver.Call me old-fashioned and rigid, but, despite all the funny quirks, this film feels more like a filler intro for the upcoming Infinity Wars epic where Thor will probably make sense again. If we accept such purpose as worthy though, Ragnarok isn't bad at all. Had it taken any other road, and we would've ended with another dark and tedious drag filled with mumbo jumbo and long fighting scenes with gloomy faces. Luckily for us, the faces here are far from that (maybe far enough to call them goldblum'y), so let's learn to enjoy the little things and have fun while they still serve it, shall we?",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Bring on 'Thor: Love and Thunder'!Chris Hemsworth is quality in the lead role, I found him super enjoyable in this second sequel. Big fan of his new hairstyle, by the way.

The people disliking this movie are just stingy..,"Most people who hate this movie hate it because of the comedy and overall direction.

The writing, acting, score, color, editing, and cinematography are all excellent. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this movie. People disliked the first two Thor movies, as they were cheesy, unnecessarily ""serious,"" and unbelievably boring. So they decided to switch it up. A lot. Make it more modern, make it something that people weren't used to. And they did an amazing job of it. Everything was different. The main baddie was tackled in an unconventional way.

"A little too polished, but very entertaining and fun","This was the second Marvel film I watched this week (Homecoming being the other), and it reinforced what the franchise does well - which is to entertain. Not all the films achieve this, but Thor Ragnarok certainly does. It takes its lead very much from the stylish and retro fun of Guardians of the Galaxy, but it has an awkward humor that is very much its own. This is really its main selling point, as the film displays great comic timing throughout, with plenty of very good moments drawing good laughs and fun.At times the film feels a bit too engineered and designed. It is such a change from the previous Thor films (which didn't embrace this silliness quite as much) that it does stand out for its difference, but yet at the same time the accessible entertainment value makes it fit very well beside the more recent Marvel films, in particular the comedy tone of Guardians of the Galaxy. This carries it well, and it does own it surprisingly well; it helps that the cast all get it throughout, there is no feeling of everyone working in one direction while a different direction was trying to be found. The silly tone works, while not detracting from the general plot, which is a frame at best, but yet works.The times it tries to have weight don't really manage to stand up, but otherwise there is a lot to like in a film that is entertaining, slick, well timed, and with everyone aligned to what it is trying to do.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
FINALLY! A good Thor movie!,"This movie in three words: A good time. This movie always pulls me in whether it be with the action, the comedy, or the vibrant colors.

"THOR: RAGNAROK doesn't rest on its brand's laurels, that is what really matters","Entrusted in the hands of Kiwi wiz Taika Waititi, the third installment of Marvel's Norse god substantially alters its predecessors' Shakespearean solemnity while rings small changes in the cookie-cutter plot.Right out of the box, Thor (Hemsworth) appears to be modulated in an unusually verbose mood when confronting the fire demon Surur, a scourge of Asgard, who threats to bring Ragnarok (a prophesy of doom of most Norse heroes) to the empyrean planet, only becomes a mere bagatelle under Thor's mighty, that is the tonal-setting prologue, levity and spectacle are the two sides of a helluva galactic ride.The real danger is within the family, an exiled and soon-to-perish Odin (Hopkins) apprises his two sons that his first-born, the ambitious Hela (Blanchett), the Goddess of Death, who has been sealed in the prison by him, will be back to reclaim her birthright and play havoc with whoever stands in her way (including the loyal Warriors Three, all dispatched offhandedly en passant).Defeated by Hela, Thor and Loki (Hiddleston) are stranded in the planet Sakaar, literally a huge garbage dumping ground (a smart sideswipe of earth's unsustainable consumerism, mark my words, this is something humans definitely will do when galactic travel will become handy), and its potentate, Grandmaster (a gleefully snide Goldblum) has an archaic hobbyhorse, gladiator fighting, which sets Thor against his ""friend from work"" the Hulk/Bruce Banner (Ruffalo), also explains their conspicuous absence in CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR (2016).Soon the trio escapes with a bibulous huntress Valkyrie (Thompson), together they must defend the unvanquished Hela and her resurrected army, so if Ragnarok is preordained, might as well leaving Hela with the calamity, as long as they can take a throng of token survivors and play up the humanistic stopgap, however feeble is might look because you just cannot equate an entire planet with (at most) several hundreds lives. The final victory is hardly a mood-booster, that is why this fiber of discrepancy (playfulness and grave loss) takes its toll in the end.A trendy haircut does do justice to Hemsworth's buff appeal and apparently his comedy timing (apart from showing off his immaculate bod) and it looks like that Loki and Heimdall (Elba) are next in line for a coiffure upgrade; we cannot get enough of Cate Blanchett snarling and blustering in a sleek suit with lissome martial arts postures, her Hela is unapologetic-ally lethal, but some subtlety would have been nice considering her immense craft. Tessa Thompson's Valkyrie is the latest addition of Marvel's (not too prescient) recruitment of female superheroes and she is ass-kicking and can equally stand her ground and hold her liquor.Waititi's revamp is a welcome step-up for the ever-expanding comic cinematic universe in toto, its varicolored brio, astute sonic placement, astonishing visual swagger and bristling action verve are exactly what gratify and appeal to its core audience, there is something idiosyncratic lurking beneath a mainstream blockbuster, a baby-step maybe, at least THOR: RAGNAROK doesn't rest on its brand's laurels, that is what really matters, isn't it?",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

He's a goof bumbling about in a movie written as a comic relief....but a comic relief from what exactly?Sure, the movie looks great but in an attempt to write the whole plot as lighthearted it just turns out emotionally shallow.

Fortunately, Thor manages to escape from his chains and quickly seizes the crown of Surtur--which is the main catalyst for initiating Ragnorok--and then departs before Surtur can attempt to recover it. What Thor doesn't know is that Odin is extremely ill and upon his death his powerful and extremely evil daughter ""Hela"" (Cate Blanchett) will be released from imprisonment and lay claim to the throne of Asgard-which is possibly even worse than the possibility of Ragnorok ever was.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Thor: Ragnarok - 7/10,"1. Overall Plot - 6/10
I like the Ragnarok storyline a lot. And I like the Sakaar storyline a lot also. But I hate how they did Sakaar in this movie. It doesn't fit for a Thor movie at all, and it's supposed to be a Hulk planet. I just feel like Thor was out of his character the whole movie. It didn't feel like a Thor movie at all.2. Entertainment / Engagement - 8/10
This movie used to be a lot more entertaining for me. But now all I see is how it doesn't feel anything like a Thor movie. But the movie itself as a standalone thing is still pretty entertaining.3. Emotion / Investment in Story - 7/10
There is a good amount of emotion in this. But it doesn't hit as deep as it should. For as much as Thor goes through, he just doesn't really feel that much emotion. It's like he almost forgets about it, rather than dealing with it how he should.I don't really get that invested in this movie, because it does not feel anything like a Thor movie.4. Theme and Depth of Story - 4/10
I cannot honestly think of a theme for this movie. It kind of feels very random in that sense.This movie isn't very deep at all. It tries to go deep into Thor, Asgard, and the past, but it just misses.5. Characters - 4/10
The only characters I like in this movie is Loki and Korg. Loki is really the only one who stays true to himself and had proper character development. While Thor doesn't feel like Thor at all. He acts complete differently than he ever has, and there isn't really a reason why. Hela is more annoying than menacing, and something about her I just don't like. She seems to cheesy. She has no reason for us to even think of her as a villain, as even the main characters don't really know anything about her. Korg is a great comic relief character. He just has great one liners. I also like how Heimdall is still helping the Asgardians, but he should have been in it a lot more.I also hate how Hulk is a bit smarter. He is talking more, and smashing less. Mark Ruffalo Hulk just sucks. And Bruce Banner being in this movie doesn't really fit in a Thor movie at all. It's part of why it doesn't feel like a Thor movie. Valkyrie is also just kind of annoying, and pretty forgettable.6. Acting / Writing - 6/10
The only good actor in this is Chris Hemsworth. And he just doesn't feel as good in this as Thor. Probably because the character was changed so much. Tom Hiddleston as Loki is still great, and honestly steals the spotlight in this film.All the other actors aren't great. Cate Blanchett sucks as Hela. Mark Ruffalo is worse than usual as Bruce Banner. And Tessa Thompson is not great at all as Valkyrie. Even Jeff Goldblum isn't that great as the Grandmaster. He's just too weird. A lot of Goldblum goes a long way, and in this case it's too much.7. Cinematography / Sets - 8/10
This movie looks great. It is very bright and vibrant.8. Score / Sound - 5/10
The music for this movie isn't bad. I actually kind of like it. But it absolutely does not fit this movie or Thor at all. It is way different than anything we've heard before, and ruins a lot of epic moments.9. Editing / Pace - 8/10
The editing is good. The fight scenes are edited well.The pacing is pretty good. It is just a bit rushed at the beginning, but is pretty good throughout.10. VFX/Practical Effects - 8/10
All the CGI and effects are very good. Hulk just doesn't look that good, and his face is ugly. Hela's sword power stuff is also not that great looking. It kind of looks pretty cheesy.Average Score:
6.4/10My Overall Rating and Final Thoughts:
7/10
I don't dislike the movie, but I don't think it is as cool as a lot of people think. It just doesn't feel like a Thor movie at all. And they completely changed his character in it. I do really like Loki in this movie though.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Disappointingly juvenile and unintelligent,"As a fan of the previous Thor movies and MCU movies in general, I feel this was the worst Marvel movie so far. I had such high hopes for it, but the genre change to slapstick comedy alienates former fans in favor of bringing in new fans. The only truly funny parts were the ones that weren't trying. Many of the jokes were either crude or aimed at an immature audience, causing them to fall flat (if you have to resort to anatomical jokes, you aren't funny). Hulk was horribly annoying, and many of the characters came off as undignified and wimpy (such as having responses that aren't proportionate to the situation). I felt that the characters that I used to love are suddenly unlikable, and frankly I lost respect for them. I admit that I require my comedy to be intelligent, and this was anything but. I love Cate Blanchett, and her performance was great. In fact, she gave such potential for a cool villain, but Hela wasn't developed enough as a threat, and with the constant bombardment of bad jokes, you don't get a chance to appreciate the situation that she places the heroes in. For a dark situation based loosely on a dark comic and a dark mythology, the serious ""relief"" moments felt out of place. The character arks were obvious, and the solution at the end was dissatisfying and simple. I'm left with the sense that I would give anything for a redo. I'm longing for a third chapter that I can fall in love with. I want to pretend that this movie didn't exist. Bonus stars for good effects.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Unusual but a pleasant surprise,"Looking through the reviews, I noticed that most reviews were saying that it was a film for five-year-olds or ""pre-teens"".

Ragnarok cleverly integrated jokes and homages throughout, resulting in a light hearted film that's easy to watch.I also love the bold colours and dress design. I think that, because the planet (Sakaar) had never been seen before in the MCU, it gave a blank canvas for the team to make something new.Maybe my admiration towards Taika Waititi (Director) sullied my review a little however I truly believe that you will enjoy this movie if I have persuaded you enough.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Not as good as advertised,"I went to see Thor Ragnarok with my wife yesterday which we then followed by Justice League and boy I am glad I stayed in the cinema for Justice League.Although I have never read a single comic I am a big fan of these kinds of movies as much as of any good sci-fi and this is what I think.Thor Ragnarok was over-hyped. It completely failed to bring any meaning or continuation of the story of Thor that was in line with all Avengers movies. It turned the once mighty god/alien being with snappy witty comments yet serious and important stance into a stupid moron with overly large ego who has no sense of danger or urgency. While Avengers combined the seriousness of the Winter Soldier and the wittiness of Iron Man, it did so based around the story with meaningful characters with real feelings and personal struggles and great team chemistry. This was even more apparent in the Guardians of the Galaxy that introduced an unlikely team of heroes with seemingly nothing in common that against all odds unites them and you feel for them. The comedy is then part of their quirks and personalities as well as situations but it is never overarching the threat of danger or urgency. Thor, on the other hand, was a collection of silly one-liners, a crap team without any chemistry and absolutely no sense of danger. Also, there was no feel for his world or people. At no point I cared about who his people are or why should they be saved or spared. They were just so disposable. Then there was the once menacing strong Hulk turned into a stroppy retarded babe, terrible Jeff Goldblum being Jeff Goldblum and the out-of-place appearance of Banner and Dr. Strange.Thor was sort of fun but disappointing, disposable and a forgettable movie that undermined the threat Avengers are going to face.Then we continued with Justice League which was a completely different story. I don't know whether it was the fact that it was made by Zach Snyder and director of the Avengers but this was in a different league. This was from the very first minute a grown-up movie. The story was great, the chemistry of the team was awesome. They felt like a new team, full of contrast and disagreements. The humour was spot on and mostly it was situational rather than forced. A lot of times thing were funny just through imagery rather than silly one-liners like in Thor, just as when Flash noticed that Superman can see him or the fact that Batman took ages to catch up with them because he has no superpowers. I loved the fact that they addressed the relationship with the mother or that Batman is getting old, or that Flash is inexperienced. I loved the fact that until the end I did not know whether Superman would actually step in and help them and showing the family in danger made me feel like the threat was actually real. Or about the fact that they addressed the elephant in the room that Wonder Woman is gorgeous and manipulated everyone with her charm (as it was the case with Cyborg). Overall, this was a better movie that perfectly fits in with the previous DC movies. Honestly, seeing the reviews before we saw the movies I felt like Thor would be better, that it would be like Avengers or the Winter Soldier combined with Guardians of the Galaxy, it failed to deliver. On the other hand, JL positively surprised and my wife who is not really into these kinds of movies said: ""Should we go and see it tomorrow again?""",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Must watch of the MCU!,"The Thor franchise has been largely forgettable, remembered mostly because of his upstaging brother Loki and his love interest, Dr. Jane Foster. Thor considers himself to be the ""strongest avenger."" Although given his image in Thor (2011), and Thor: the Dark World (2013), he should be the ""most boring avenger.""When Thor: Ragnarok hit the theaters, I had my doubts. Now they have disappeared. The third installment of the Thor series is absolutely fantastic.Director Taika Waititi reinvented this movie from the previous tediousness into a silly and joyous comedy. Despite the Asgard-ending catastrophic event that the title promised, it's filled with a cheerful atmosphere and packed with jokes.The story is set two years after the Battle of Sokovia (Avengers 2.) Thor finds himself imprisoned on the alien planet of Sakaar. In order to get back to Asgard to save it from Hela, his half-sister, and the impending Ragnarok, he finds himself in a lethal gladiatorial contest against Hulk.Marvel has already announced that Thor: Ragnarok will be the last installment of the Thor franchise. To give this franchise the ending that it deserves, they added new characters. Like the Grandmaster, portrayed by Jeff Goldblum, Cate Blanchett as Hela, the one that has shattered Thor's hammer, and Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie. Together, they made Thor: Ragnarok grand.However, Thor: Ragnorak does have its flaws. The transitions between the scenes of Asgard and Sakaar is too abrupt. Also, I would have liked it much more if the complicated relationship between Thor and Loki was explored deeper (It's been three films!).

Thor: Ragnarok Hammers Out A Hit,"Despite how poorly directed and filmed the movies Thor and Thor: The Dark World were, the third movie in the franchise, Thor: Ragnarok, brings comedy, action, and new characters to the table. Thor: Ragnarok is beautifully filmed and directed by Taika Waititi, who had previously acted in the unfortunate movie The Green Lantern. Not only did Waititi direct and produce the film, but he also starred in it as a side character, Korg. I find this movie fascinating due to its marvelous acting, comical script, and astonishing photography.
This movie is about Thor's struggle to defeat his older sister, Hela, the Goddess of Death. This journey takes him to multiple planets where he meets new and old characters. Thor starts out in the Underworld where he fights a demon named Surtur who was prophesied to destroy his home. Later on in Sakaar, Thor gets reunited with the Hulk and meets new heroes such as Valkyrie and Korg. While Thor was stuck on another planet, Hela was planning on taking over all realms in the universe. She raised her army of dead soldiers and her giant wolf Fenris. With the help of his friends, Thor escapes Sakaar and flies back to Asgard. Thor and his friends take on Hela and her army. As they struggle to fight them, Loki, his brother, shows up with an army of prisoners from Sakaar. Thor then fights Hela, and while he does so, he uses his true powers to help fight her. He strikes her with a lightning bolt. Unable to defeat his sister, Thor had nothing else to turn to, but I will not spoil the ending for you.
One thing I enjoyed about this film was the incredible acting. Chris Hemsworth, who had taken on the role of Thor four times before (Thor, Thor: The Dark World, Avengers, and Avengers: Age of Ultron), used his superhero experience to create an amazing, lively, hilarious character in the latest Thor movie. Not only did Hemsworth portray a perfect Thor character, but he even improved from the previous movies from the franchise. Hemsworth wasn't the only talented actor that was thrown into the mix. Actors such as Tom Hiddleston (Thor, Thor: The Dark World), Cate Blanchett (Carol, The Gift), Mark Ruffalo (The Hulk, The Avengers), and Tessa Thompson (Creed) also starred in the film. Although Mark Ruffalo is an extremely accomplished actor, his role in this movie lacked some personality. I personally believe that he could have put a little more effort into his performance. On the other hand as a newer actress in Hollywood, Tessa Thompson had a giant role to fill. Although her experience is limited, Thompson was not a let down. She couldn't have been a better fit for the part. From her snarky looks to her skillful fighting, Thompson was the best Valkyrie possible.
Another great thing that was added to the movie were the classic Marvel cameos. Of course, none other than Stan Lee himself was the one who gave Thor a haircut. Dr. Stephen Strange played by Benedict Cumberbatch (Dr. Strange, The Imitation Game) had also appeared in the beginning of the film. Once in Asgard, Thor witnessed a play that was being put on about Loki's tragic death. The actor who played Loki was actually Matt Damon (Jason Bourne, The Martian) and Thor was actually played by Hemsworth's least known brother, Luke Hemsworth (Hickok, The Anomaly).
Lastly I loved the way they filmed the movie, the effects and photography were absolutely superb. Waititi, the director, used brilliant colors and astounding special effects to draw in the viewer. All the effects blended in seamlessly, all scenes connected perfectly together. Not only were the effects great, but Waititi showed both sides to the confrontation. At some points, the movie would only focus on what Thor and his allies were doing, and then on the other side, viewers would get to see the devious plans Hela had for the Universe. Waititi used his special effects to also create some of the most iconic entrance scenes in Marvel history. When entering the fight with Hela, Thor dropped down from the sky in slow motion, lightning bolts crackling and exploding from his skin. Valkyrie entered by walking, also in slow motion, along the beautiful rainbow bridge, dressed in her iconic warrior uniform, with gigantic fireworks exploding in the background. Although some of the entrances were serious yet prodigious, Waititi decided to put some comedy back into the way he filmed this movie. The Hulk's entrance was my favorite one of all. He started off as Bruce Banner, observing Fenris from a spaceship. Banner decided to aid in the fight by taking on Fenris and releasing the Hulk. So he jumped out of the plane, and without turning into the Hulk, Banner crashed onto the bridge and laid there until he was able to turn.
One of the key themes to this movie is peace. In every Marvel movie, the goal of the hero is to create peace within the world. Each hero has to defeat a villain that comes their way in order to keep harmony in the universe. Another major theme within this movie is power. Throughout the movies Thor: The Dark World and Thor: Ragnarok, Loki and Thor had power disputes. Loki wanted to take control over the throne, he even pretended to be King Odin. However, in this film it is Hela who truly wants to seize power of the throne. Although Loki, Hela, and Thor all fight about power, Thor doesn't really care about being king. He just wants the best for his people. In the end, Thor ends up as the newest King of Asgard.
In conclusion I find this movie to be one of the best movies in the Marvel movie series. I enjoy watching this movie because not only does it tell the story of a hero, but it takes the viewer on an extremely fun and adventurous journey through different realms. This film was also enjoyable because of the way the director wrote the script and executed the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
The Thor Outtakes - a mixed bag.,"I wasn't overly impressed by the fact that Thor went the Deadpool/Guardians of the Galaxy route and I still can't say I like the decision, but overall it didn't turn out as bad as I had anticipated.Personally, I prefer the more serious, darker and grittier Thor movies. If I want comedy and action, I'd actually watch Deadpool or Guardians of the Galaxy. But lately there seems to be a trend with Marvel, that there needs to be humor, everywhere. To appeal to kids, I guess? So now I can watch Thor as well if I want comedy.. meh.The humor often is childish, slapstick even, I'm not a fan. It's not terrible across the board and sometimes it manages to actually be funny, there's just too much that doesn't stick.The premise of the movie, that ""everything must be destroyed"" ultimately just felt unneeded to me, probably because the motivation behind it isn't really developed at all. This in turn also didn't help me to appreciate the main villain, who has no motivation or development either.I'm not even going to touch Hulk/Banner, they've been turned into a goof.Luckily, there's also a rather decent movie buried beneath all that if you can manage to overlook the rest. Thor: Ragnarok doesn't seem to take itself too serious, and that works in it's favor, as much as I hate to admit it. The acting is mostly very good and the CGI is top notch. The movie has some interesting locations and settings and all in all it still felt like an adventure to me that I didn't totally regret seeing. Yet, I still feel a little sad inside.Watch at your own risk.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
The best Marvel movie till date,"Since its first trailer, I knew that this movie is going to be epic. This is the best Marvel or say best superhero(probably) or comic movie ever.

Guardian of the Galaxy : Ragnarok,"I don't know where to start. I love MCU superhero movie. Thor is my favorite after Captain American and Doctor Strange. The first movie was good, the second was outstanding, and when I hear Ragnarok will be the third (and probably last) Thor movie, I'm thrill. I hope this movie gonna be majestic like lord of the ring movie, aaaaand we got this awful movie.Ragnarog should be the perfect conclusion for Thor trilogy, especially when you have Anthony Hopkins and Cate Blanchett in it. F**kin 'Anthony Hopkins and Cate Blanchett !!! Whats wrong with you people !!Dark and gritty theme is not for all superhero movie. And vice versa, not all movies can be made as comedy budy action. Leave that genre to Guardian of the Galaxy. Thor is meant to be be Shakespeare's Norse mythology movie. What makes GOG works, because they able to develop their great characters and the relation between. Hell even GOG Vol 2 know how to pull a line somewhere between their jokes and make me cry in the end of the movie. Thor : Ragnarog is just bad rip off from GOG with plenty of miss-placed jokes.I also disappointed with wasted talents of great actors. You will be fascinated in the first 10 minutes Cate Blanchett. But after that, just bland acting, bad dialogue and the editing is the worst. At least make powerful and touching dialogue between Thor, Odin and Hela, as they're presented by great actors. but noooooo. Hela has no special motivation, no expression, only an unclear desire to rules Asgard and other 9 realm.I don't get it with all people who rating this movie above 5 and said it it the best MCU experience so far. Have you no respect for Winter Soldier, Doctor Strange, Civil Wars and the noise mythology? you guys need to watch more movie.certainly whatever my opinion, this movie will still make a lot of money. and I also have good time.

But unfortunately I have a disdain for anything that betrays the original source like what happened with Spider Man Homecoming so **** this $#!+ and its comedic tone is at times annoying.

Thor: Ragnarok - Review,"The reviews on here are split pretty evenly between haters and lovers. Who are the haters? They are the humorless, the self-important, and most of all- the desperate alpha-male wannabes. Who am I? I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!To start with, the cast is the best Thor so far, devoid of the annoying whining and bulimic neck-wasting of Portman and the tedium of the Warriors Three (Lady Sif is MIA, however...). Instead, we have the Valkyrie, who is a real and very interesting woman, plus the delightful Urban as Skurge, complete with failed-male accoutrement such as shake weights and AR-15s. And best of all, The most excellent Blanchett as Hela, a true show stopper. The denizens of Sekaar are also hugely fun, as is the extremely talented Ruffalo.The production is superb, with Sekaar ranking as one of the most original worlds created so far. DEVO's Mothersbaugh's music is perfect. Goldberg's performance becomes funnier and more menacing every time I watch it, while Hemsworth finally has a script where he can stretch his comic talent as well as his dramatic chops. And as Joss Whedon discovered, Chris will hit every comic moment out of the park, if you give him the chance. I can't even count the number of wonderful comic moments in this film, it's that golden.Much of the credit also belongs to Taika Waititi, the NZ wunderkind. His Korg is the perfect anti-dote to all the alpha-male testosterone that passes for film in the DC-verse (may it soon die forever). Here's a giant powerful creature with a mind, a snappy wit, and no desire to hog the glory. Take note, all you one-star haters! What said haters of this film want is another unwatchably tedious and monotonous MAN OF STEEL-style piece of garbage, utterly devoid of anything but grimacing, shouting, punching and brooding. Luckily, what we have in Ragnarok instead is wit, style, and excitement. Long Live THOR and MARVEL!!!Excelsior!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Best Thor Movie,"This has to be the best Thor movie made so far, Chris Hemsworth(Thor) with his chiseled physique looks very much like a Norse God, and Cate Blanchett(Hella) does a fine role as the main negative lead. Mark Ruffalo(Hulk) and Tom Hiddlestone(Loki) put in very impressive performances too. But the best part of the movie was the timing of everything, be it the comic dialogues, the action sequences or the amazing background music. At times you are left amazed with the movie and the little kid inside of you leaps out for more. The only downside for me was the final action sequence which I think did not justify the movie.Not a movie to be missed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Still not my Thor but its still good.,"Thor in Thor Ragnarök is like a Peter Pan, King Arthur and Thor mixed into 1.Thor Ragnarök is Ragnarök and Planet Hulk in one. Its really a 15% Planet hulk and a miniature Ragnarok. Its nothing like the comics or mythos. matter of fact its a simple kiddie version of Ragnarok.The movie starts out as Thor as a badass and ends, in the middle he is a baddass and ends with him being a badass. Thor finally gets some justice pre-infinity war.Visually its a step up from Thor 2. Thor has evolved so much since Thor 1. Thor overall is gold.
Loki is gold.
Hulk is just Silver. They could have done more with him.Grandmaster is a chilled gentle, dictator who isn't afraid to kill.Odin once again is wasted. MOST WASTED MCU CHARACTER EEEEEVEEEER.Valkyrie looked like those Ferby dolls that we use to get from our happy meals when were were snot nosed kids. She's in the story because of guilt and amosity.Then there is Hela MCUs best villain before Thanos. (Loki in mcu is more of an anti hero. That's just me.) There was no best before Hela. ulton was decent to say the least.Overall it's a space/gladiator/doomsday/viking/drama/medieval/fantasy/comedy movie. Mighty fun.Great movie indeed. Thor 1 is the best for me because it was the live action debut of the mighty Thor. Thor 3 is mighty 2nd and Thor 2 gets 3rd.Verdict: See you on the other side Brotha!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

bland and boring  another marvel movie,Thor Ragnarok was a boring movie that had some elements that worked but more or less is forgettable my main issue with the film is its presentation but before i get into that i have to mention some elements that worked for the most part for one some visuals were interesting to look at there were some fun moments in the film the humor at times were pretty good and thee hulk and Thor plus Loki worked well together but that's where it ends for me most of the time the film is uninteresting the villain character Hella was boring cringe worthy and non threatening i mean she does kill a lot of people but the film gives me no reason to care at all the quips and jokes at times got really annoying to hear for one most marvel movies have jokes and that's fine but more less at this point the quips and jokes feel like they belong on the how to make a marvel movie check list there is a scene early in the film where Thor is narrating to the audience but they try to past it off as him talking to a skull but for me it felt cheap and lazy and finally the thing is of course presentation now most marvel movies have this problem but i gotta say that I'm getting sick of seeing marvel movies do this they frame there movies in such a boring way that it becomes hard to be interested in there are some good looking visuals in the film but they decide to film it in a boring way and marvel has no excuse for this right now they are the biggest superhero film studio in the market and no matter what people will go see these movies so why cant marvel experiment and use film making to its best ability i mean there is no threat i mean most of the competition they have aren't really that big of a threat the dc-mu are in a bad place Sony messed up with spider man i mean the only studio that might be a threat are 20th century fox i mean with dead-pool and Logan being big hits for different reasons its showing that marvel movies aren't as great but instead of taking chances and risks marvel decides to play it safe i can't really recommended this movie to anyone but the fanboys but trust me there are better movies to see than this film,5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Thor at his best!,"Thor: Ragnarök is a movie whom takes itself a little less seriously than many other marvel movies. Is this bad? No. On the contrary this is good!Thor: Ragnarök delivers a story filled with adventure, action and comedy

Whom are largely comedy focused.

Is it the best Thor Film Yet?,"Thor Ragnarok is an unexpectedly funny return to the Thor trilogy. By far the best of the trilogy Ragnarok stands out because of its humor and color scheme. Many fans have complained that over the years Marvel films have acquired a generic feel and tone, however, Ragnarock is all style. The movie is one of the best looking Marvel films, besides the Guardians movies. It is also very humorous but juxtaposes that humor with some very great character moments that I haven't seen in a Marvel film in a long time. It's because of this blend of action, comedy, and drama that I think this movie is worthwhile. However, the movie is a bit unmemorable. Although it will have major ramifications in the MCU, it never felt very serious. The steaks in this movie are not high enough to get one invested really deeply in the overall plot. If it weren't for the humor, visuals and key moments between the characters we love, I honestly would've rated this lower since really the steaks diminish the overall plot of the film. Having said that, the villain was passable due to some connections to the main characters. Overall I believe this film is really cool, although not groundbreaking. It's not the best film in the MCU but it sure is fun. Final score 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Funny & Silly To The Point Of Overkill!,"The sequel to 2011's Thor and 2013's Thor: The Dark World (both entertaining films), 'Thor: Ragnarok' has to be the silliest superhero movie in a while. And luckily, its the silliness is intentional.'Thor: Ragnarok' Synopsis: Thor must escape the alien planet Sakaar in time to save Asgard from Hela and the impending Ragnarök.'Thor: Ragnarok' works till it lasts, but I have one question: Did the humor have to be on till the point of overkill? Sure, the jokes land well & even energy remains all through in the narrative, but after a point, I laughed only because I had too. Its fun to watch Thor aka The Hammer of God on a light note & being the bum of many a joke, as well as watching HULK being supremely angry, with Bruce Banner being the ever surprised in real-self. But only till a point.Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle & Christopher Yost's Screenplay goes all-out for the laughs & succeeds. But at the expense of a mediocre villain & a few lagging pieces. The Terrific Taika Waititi Directs this recent Superhero Blockbuster, with the perfect blend of madness & ambition. Cinematography, Editing, Art & Costume & Graphics, are outstanding.Of the cast, Chris Hemsworth shines as Thor, continuing to play the part with complete commitment. And he's so funny here! Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner / Hulk, is very good. Tom Hiddleston as Loki, is okay. Cate Blanchett as Hela, is reduced into being a seductive, but one-note villain.

Tongue-in-cheek Ragnoruckus,"Taking a page from the popular ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" films, ""Thor: Ragnarok"" is played strictly for laughs. I initially disliked the constant stream of wisecracks and sight-gags, but after a while got into the spirt of the film and for the most part enjoyed it. Once again, the hero has to deal with a malevolent God (in this case, Thor's sister Hela), which after a few diversions to pick up the supporting cast, leads to a climactic CGI-spectacular showdown. Chris Hemsworth seems to have fun playing the flippant (and sometime petulant) God of Thunder, as does Cate Blanchett, who plays his wicked sister, the be-antlered Goddess of Death Hela, and Tom Hiddleston, back for the fourth round as duplicitous brother Loki. The special effects, if not particularly novel or imaginative, are excellently rendered and the supporting cast (humans and otherwise) entertaining. The score includes Led Zeppelin's iconic ""Immigrant Song"", which adds a real kick to the battles. The 'plot' is some vague revision of the ""Ragnarok"" legend (in which Asgard is overcome and the Gods (including Thor) destroyed), and a few players from that story make appearances (e.g. The Fenris Wolf, The Midgard Serpent, Surtr), but it's all just an excuse for a massive, but largely bloodless, battle between Thor and his motley crew of supporters and his sister's army of demonic cannon-fodder. In keeping with modern sensibilities, the Asgardians are a somewhat more diverse looking group than one might expect in the home of Norse Gods and Tessa Thompson makes (IMO) an unlikely Valkyrie.

MCU wild ride,"Not only is this probably one the best MCU entries to date, but it's a wacky and colorful spectacle, the likes of which, we haven't seen since the days of Flash Gordon. It doesn't reach the levels of campyness that Flash Gordon achieved, but it sure retains its wackiness and eye-candy elements. Production and costume design on this one are the main focus and a casting array that seem to be having the time of their lives (Jeff Goldblum and Cate Blanchett seem to be having a blast). Many hard-core fans may be upset by the many twist and turns that the movie takes and the humorous take on many of the elements and characters of the movie (Chris Hemsworth's capacity for making fun of himself is something that's been a constant of late in almost all of his movies and a very well received one), but it's something this movie excels on and what makes it, along with the Guardians of the Galaxy entries, one of the best exponents of the Marvel Cosmic Universe, which is slightly different to the Marvel Cinematographic Universe.

At Least It's Funny,"I think I saw the first ""Thor"" movie. All of these superhero movies blend together in my mind. I know I missed some of them, because there was clearly plot exposition that probably would have made ""Thor: Ragnarok"" make more sense. Oh well, these movies don't make much sense even if you have seen them all. They all devolve into loud and flashy spectacle by the time they're over and hope you'll be so dazzled that you'll forget any crappy parts. It's harder and harder for me to watch movies like this and get past the weapon fetishism they all wallow in -- there's such an emphasis on how cool you look wielding your big gun, the bigger the better. In the increasingly disturbing American gun culture, it's no longer possible (for me at least) to shrug stuff like this off as ""only a movie."" But whatever...I acknowledge that I probably shouldn't be watching movies like this in the first place if that's going to bother me.As for the rest? It's pretty funny, it doesn't take itself too seriously, and it's got Cate Blanchett looking sexy as hell in a dominatrix outfit (that is, until she puts on a ridiculous hat that makes her look like one of Satan's reindeer).

Falling in love with Thor,"What the Russo brothers did for Captain America, Taika Watiti has done for Thor. In place of a Shakespearean hunk, we get a humorous, likable, and compelling hunk. I also love all this film did for Hulk and Loki in characterization. And I must mention its badass and stylish new villain Hela who is a favorite Marvel villain of mine. This film is not lacking in any one thing. In its comedy, it's by far the funniest Marvel film ever. So much is ad-libbed and all else reeks of Taika's genius. I should also mention Taika voices Korg who is the funniest character ever written in a Marvel film. As for the action, this movie shows Thor at his best, far more badass and powerful than he's been in his prior films where his feats were often lacking. The soundtrack is excellent, even without the adrenaline-inducing Immigration Song. The visuals are gorgeous. Even a trash planet is a visual feast to look upon due to the color palette and cinematography. The film's writing is also subtle, with themes of colonialism underlying its plot. And for all its comedy, this film has consequences, twists, and emotional moments. This film is utterly excellent and insanely rewatchable.

The lightheartedness of the movie and the film overall was a bold and unique move. Taika Waititi really brought this movie together and redeemed Thor. Ragnorak was vital for Thor's unleashing of his full potential. Allowing the actors to improvise and bring out themselves through the characters made all the difference as well.
The storyline blends in nicely and it explains so much, and catches everyone up. It doesn't feel like an unnecessary add on. We had Loki on the Throne from The Dark World, which was a problem that needed to be addressed. We have a missing Thor and Hulk in Civil War, which needed to be explained, and of course Thanos had to start somewhere. The whole movie fits in so nicely to the MCU
Another thing I just have to point out is the CGI and visuals of this movie are spot on, down to the smallest detail. Even Hulk looked so much like Mark Ruffalo.
The only complaint I have is that sometimes the humor was a little to much at parts. We didn't really need to see Thor scream like a little girl. Yet all the laughs kept me going through Infinity War, as if Marvel knew we needed something to cheer us up before the next Avengers. Team Thor!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Entertaining and best Thor movie,"Though I liked Chris hemsworth as Thor, I was not any fan of Thor standalone movies. While Thor 1 was strictly okay, Thor 2 was one of the most weakest films of MCU. But in Thor ragnarok Thor franchise gets completely revamped.
Ragnarok format is same like iron man 3. Like in iron man 3 we saw what tony can do without his suit, in Thor ragnarok we can see what Thor can do without his hammer. Despite all the worst things happening to Thor in this one(loses his father, hammer,eye and Asgard kingdom) there is a lot of humor in this one.
When a serious character does humor, his fan following increases like never before. Same has happened with Chris hemsworth whose fan following as Thor has increased leaps and bounds with ragnarok. Though he deliberately does not be funny, situations make it so. With film by film our love towards Loki increases only. So has happened in ragnarok. The bromance between hemsworth and tom Hiddleston is the highlight. Cate blanchett gives a menacing performance which makes hela one of the best villains in MCU. Tessa Thompson was badass as Valkyrie. And last but not the least, I never liked hulk before but with ragnarok I finally started loving him. Seriously the film becomes most entertaining with the entry of hulk.
The music is foot tapping. Only drawback I felt was some portions are dull when Thor is trapped in sakaar. But with the entry of hulk this becomes a hilarious entertainer. Full credit goes to director taika watiti for ressurecting the thor franchise.
On the whole Thor ragnarok may not be the best MCU film but is definitely the most funniest MCU film ever made.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Planet Hulk feat. Thor,"I adored the first two Thor movies. They had the right mix of humor and serious plot with well-timed jokes and excellent character development- something this film was severely lacking. Thor seemed to have regressed back to the Thor from the beginning of the first movie, when he was even the focus. Despite being the title character it felt like the main character of the movie was anybody but Thor. Hulk in particular got a lot of focus in the Planet Hulk portion of the movie, which really should have been its own movie rather than taking over Thor. vent though this film was the longest of the three Thor films it was so packed full of unnecessary filler that the parts of the movie that were actually important get glossed over, happening in the blink of an eye to move on to more lengthy filler nonsense. In addition to Thor, Loki was also very poorly written. The god of mischief and lies shouldn't be predictable. Tom Hiddleston is an amazing actor but even he can't save this movie from its bad writing. It felt like the writers had no idea how to write the characters so they just recycled what they saw in the previous movies.
Worse yet, this whole movie was overrun with bad humor, as though they had tried to shoehorn in as many jokes as humanly possible in the two hour run time. For the ""What was Thor doing during Civil War?"" short the humor worked and made me laugh but for a movie with so much death about the destruction of Asgard and the end of Asgardian civilization as we know it it should be far more serious. All the humor does is downplay the gravity of the situation and the ""comedic timing"" was such that serious situations got turned into jokes and ruined the whole moment. It got to a point where any joke made me cringed or groan in exasperation.
I went to Deadpool to see Deadpool. I didn't go to Thor to see Deadpool, but that's what I got and while Deadpool was great Thor Ragnarok was a complete dumpster fire.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Thor: Ragnarok,"Where should I start? The progression of his character is downright amazing. Backed up by the Immigrant Song, he is introduced in the beginning as a glorified martyr with a signature weapon and soon after, forced to step out of his stereotypical hero-shoes and we finally get to see a redeemed version: cropped hair (his only physical source of dignity lost), permanently outgrowing the influence of Mjolnir and definitely more Odin-like (you know what I mean), charging into the battle with ginormous crackling electricity surging through his entire form, truly living up to the God of Thunder. Now that's a sight you don't want to miss and by the closing credits, you're already going to catch yourself consistently humming the song that has now become your personal Thor anthem, hah!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
One of the only movies you could say the third one was the best.,"I've personally never been a fan of the all-serious Thor, as someone who appreciates a good (and bad) joke. 
This third movie has definitely raised Thor up on my favourites list! I know that a lot of people were iffy about the comedy and didn't like it, but I honestly thought it was brilliant. 
I'm a sucker for comedy, especially when some of the dumbest jokes are coming out of the mouths of gods and powerful characters. Taika Waititi (Director/Korg) really made Marvel fresh and the cast enjoyed themselves, which was exactly his plan. The Kiwi style comedy and references in it really hit close to home and made the movie all the more enjoyable and connectable. 
Definitely worth the money and time. Puts a whole new take on superhero movies, best superhero movie of 2017. Can't wait for Infinity War and Taika Waititi's next works.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A fun sequel,"Directed by Taika Waititi it takes place a few years after Avengers Age of Ultron. After a long hiatus away Thor returns back to Asgard only to find out step brother Loki staged his own death to rule Asgard in the form of his father Odin. Meanwhile Odin has been living his last days on Earth as a recluse. From the help of Doctor Strange Thor eventually finds him to discover he has an evil sister more powerful than himself. Naturally she wants to rule Asgard and beats Thor and Loki by casting them out to a waste planet and then singlehandedly takes out an army.It's reminiscent of films like The Running Man and Flash Gordon. The cinematography by Javier Agurresarobe looks stunning full of bright colours and textures. It's 
 filled so many eye popping visuals from the retro 80s look of the waste planet Sakaar down to the exciting crowd pleasing action scenes. The music score by Mark Mothersbaugh also has a cool 80s synth vibe to it and it's one you will probably want to download on iTunes. Chris Hemsworth looks to be having the most fun with the role so does Tom Hiddleston and Mark Ruffalo. None of the actors look bored and it's probably down to director Waititi's wacky energy which also shows on the film. Tessa Thompson plays Valkarie and she is also a great addition to the series complete with an interesting backstory. Writers Eric Pearson and Craig Kyle bring so many fresh ideas to the film - It doesn't just feel like a bland rehash like the last Thor film and it's full of a few surprises along the way. We finally see Thor's true potential showing him to be the most powerful Avenger even without his hammer.There isn't many problems with it really. There are only a few minor complaints. It's very lighthearted considering its serious themes like death, defeat and the apocalypse. There are some hilarious moments throughout but sometimes they feel a little bit overblown as they can often affect the dramatic scenes. Some of the CGI looks cheap and Cate Blanchett as the villain (although great) is a little bit hammy sometimes. Overall though it's a thoroughly enjoyable film that never slows down. There is never a dull moment and the action scenes are so entertaining. The constant gags are not for everyone but they oddly work the majority of the time. And Jeff Goldlum plays the best Jeff Goldlum yet.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
IM LAUGHING,"This movie doesn't feel like a Thor movie. When I think about Ragnarok, it feels to me more like an experience of a sort. The movie does what Iron Man 3 does for Tony but this time for Thor, that is he must learn to be an epic hero without relying on his weapon. It provides a nice explanation of Banners whereabouts while setting up Infinity War. I want to say more about the production of the movie but it really is just a standard Marvel film. The reason it is one of the better films is because it is SO FUNNY. This movie could easily be labeled as a comedy because it is filled to the brink with jokes. Usually this many jokes would make the audience cringe, here however thanks in part to the hilarious supporting cast, EVERY joke lands.

The plot was really lame and it seemed to bounce all over the place. I honestly couldn't wait till it ended.

this movie was a joy to experience and a blast to watch!,"The hype and reputation of this movie set expectations in a weird place. Critic reception is through the roof and some talk of it being a pure comedy tuned out to be grossly exaggerated. First and foremost the film has a proper amount of gravitas. It's not overtly ""jokey"" Scenes and actions have real weight. Thor and Loki both have great character arcs and both characters are fleshed out quite well.The very beginning did give me pause. I feared that the early tone and rather light handling of epic characters from the books would make me hate this film. How Surtur, Skurge, Volstagg and Fandril are handled in the first 15 minutes frankly ticked me off. Even Loki seemed off at first. Yet, as the film unfolded most everything fell in to place nicely and everything seemed to fit the movie perfectly.The action and the visuals are as amazing as advertised. Even Valkyrie worked as a character even though I was not sold on the casting choice. She could easily be any Valkyrie and not the specific one from the books. This third effort puts a wonderful bow on the trilogy with healthy nods to the previous two films. Yet, this certainly stands on its own and is very unique.Hela is a superb villain and this is the best Hemsworth has ever been.Allowed to settle after a stumbling start, this movie was a joy to experience and a blast to watch.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Nice try but no Cigar,"First off: I am not familiar with the world of Thor in the comic books unlike the other MCU heroes. However I have seen the other 2 Thor movies and as such this is the best or at least the most entertaining one of the bunch. It leans heavy on the comedy side of things and there is the strength and the weakness of the movie. Obviously Marvel and Disney have found that it pays to be funny. Unfortunately they haven't got it completely right. And the fact that you have a truck load of money to waste on nothing doesn't mean you can make it any good. It's just plain lucky the other 2 were bad that in comparison this one looks better but in reality it is just average. Do not expect to be dazzled by the story, the visuals, the scenery or anything else you may want to be flabbergasted by. This is another one you have seen without having to see it. The formula gets old but I guess that as long as they cash in big time they will be made. There is nothing wrong with that but why not take a chance, try something different or just spent some time for a better story or at least a better dialogue. MCU movies are rapidly becoming fast food and that is a shame.

AN ACTION-PACKED ROLLERCOASTER RIDE,"After two average films, Thor returns with the bang that we all wanted. Taika Waititi has brought us what could be the best Marvel film yet. 'Thor: Ragnarok' is a riveting film that features a lot more than our expectations. Marvel made a clever move by showing the funny side of Thor, which is one of the most important aspects of the film. Unlike 'Thor' and 'Thor: The Dark World' which featured Thor as a very serious character, this film has a hilarious version of Thor. But it seems a bit odd. It's because we've seen a serious version of Thor in the previous films, while here, we see Thor cracking jokes at each and every moment. But overall, it works. On the other hand, Cate Blanchett, who plays the role of 'Hela' makes the character one of the best Marvel villains. She's got an interesting backstory, which every villain is supposed to have. Moreover, the team-up of Thor, Loki, Valkyrie and Hulk is eye-popping and one of the funniest and the most entertaining team-ups ever. Other characters, like the Grandmaster and Korg add an extra bit of humour and energy to this film. The climax is absolutely spell-bounding and is a game-changer to the MCU.But there are a few issues with Loki. As we've seen in previous Marvel films, Loki was a mischievous and a clever villain, who was so thrilling. But in this film, he's shown as a silly and a ridiculous character, who looks like he doesn't give a damn to what's happening around him. Another thing that doesn't work in this film is that it keeps changing its tone. The film has some funny sequences and some dramatic sequences. The filmmakers couldn't mix these very well. Many scenes of the film look fast-paced and rushed.Overall, 'Thor: Ragnarok' is a huge win for Marvel which presents a lot more than you could expect. It's everything that you would want a superhero film to be. It cannot be missed. There isn't a single point, where the film seems dull and yawn-inducing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"Decent, but ""too much"", not unlike GotG2.","Cap. 1 and 2, Thor 1, GotG1 and Avengers 1 were refreshing. Just as the superhero market seemed repetitive, Marvel gave us a very refreshing Doc. Strange and Ant-Man. And now Thor 3, which is fun, but far from refreshing.Thor has a background rooted in mythology and themes such as responsibility and family. Something that shines in a well developed relation between Thor, his father Odin, and his half-brother Loki, aided by the simple and likable Hulk who was more of a character in this movie, and not just a fun gimmick.Also in Thor 3, the focus is on family again. This is well explained through the under-used Odin, and even in his few scenes, Anthony Hopkins steals the show. So does Tom Hiddleston who shows his internal struggle, but also provides a lighter note. It is Hela (Blanchett) however, who carries this movie on her back, through a menacing and convincing performance as a new villain and a page out of Thor's family history. Unfortunately Thor himself was not well developed. The writers had the chance to make him grow into a more mature and godlike person, with the changes he does make. But unfortunately that process gets buried under the countless jokes, one-liners, slapstick and buddy humour, added with countless pointless cameos and a Grandmaster who was more a comedian, than a menacing, mysterious entity.As perfect as some jokes are, as brilliant as the timing is, it is a pity that this downgrades a beautiful mythology into a (still likable but also) silly comedy, only to rise above that mediocrity every moment Hela and Odin appear on screen. Especially Hela who shines in dialogue and in action. I hope to see more of her in future installments.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Ragnarok is Ludicrously Awesome Entertainment,"With a title like Ragnarok you have certain expectations. You expect apocalyptic combat against hordes of demons and undead, a giant wolf, a colossal serpent, and the end of the world. You don't expect a light hearted, tongue in cheek comedy. You certainly don't expect Willy Wonka references. Saying Marvel has taken an unconventional approach with this story would be putting it lightly, but the results are pure awesomeness.For a movie about the goddess of death and the destruction of Asgard, Ragnarok spends a lot of time off planet. Hela's depredations in Asgard are relegated to the background for most of the middle act after Thor and Loki are accidentally teleported to an alien world. Not that that's a problem in the least. Lots of awesome things go down on the Sakaar, including a reunion with a certain green skinned Avenger. After various misadventures the heroes do eventually get back to Asgard, where the real battle begins.And oh, are the battles grand. The Thor-Hulk fight is every bit as awesome as it looks in the trailers. There's also an excellent dogfight in the skies of Sakaar. But the final climactic battle against Hela and her minions beats everything else, hands down. It sprawling, chaotic, and ultimately apocalyptic in its intensity. This is one place where they might have made the tone just a bit grimmer and more desperate. But there's no denying the awesomeness when Thor really brings the thunder. And the death scene (I won't reveal whose) is the very definition of badass.What really sets Ragnarok apart though is its sense of humor. It may not be side splitting in the way that Guardians was, but in every situation the movie finds humor in the awkwardness, improbability, or sheer absurdity of the moment. There's good slapstick, puns and innuendos, subtle and not so subtle references, and some excellent fish out of water bits with Hulk's alter ego Banner.. Even the fight scenes are played for laughs. But none of it would work without the actors and the wonderful characters they play.Tom Hiddleston continues to shine as Loki. Not exactly a villain anymore, but far from heroic, he's still scheming, manipulative, vain, a bit cowardly, and oh so quick to betray his brother or anyone else if there's something to be gained from it. He also takes it surprisingly well when his plans are foiled over, and over, and over again. And of course he ultimately helps save the day, in his own arrogant and shameless way. It's kind of weird seeing one of Marvel's most powerful villains become a comedic foil and sidekick, but darned if it doesn't work.Jeff Goldblum is absolutely priceless as the megalomaniacal Grandmaster. In the comics, the Grandmaster of the Universe is near omnipotent and old as the universe itself, with motives and designs that humans can barely begin to comprehend. But here Goldblum plays him as the ultimate hedonist and egomaniac. Like a toned down, laid back Emperor Nero he presides over endless parties and gladiatorial games, disposes of those who get in his way, and even fronts his own synth pop band. Yet he's just so mild-mannered, outwardly friendly and slightly befuddled that it's impossible to hate him. Only Goldblum could make this work, and does he ever.Kate Blanchet also makes a very strong impression as Hela, exuding a sense of menace and lethal power in every scene. But perhaps the most interesting new character is the Valkyrie. Once a proud Asgardian warrior, she's now an alcoholic mercenary and slaver, working for the highest bidder and willing to sell out her own king. She's fierce, sassy, hot tempered, and absolutely deadly. Definitely not the type you bring home to mom. Even when she allies with Thor she loses none of the attitude. I really hope we see more of her in the coming films.All in all, Thor: Ragnarok is another resounding success for Marvel. It's action packed, well-acted, hilarious, and even has some surprising twists. It isn't what you'd expect from the title, but it's so much better.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

This movie failed in every possible level.,"I'm not a hater of comic book-based movies, and it is difficult, considering 2/5 of the movies that appear in movie theaters are based on comic book, if you want to see a movie with action and effects, in the end you always end up with one or another of this type of movie. Blame Hollywood and the mentality of wanting to get the milk from the cow in greater quantity in the shortest possible time.And this movie fails on almost every level, first, the movie begins with a set piece when Thor confronts a fire demon, before this, begins a monologue of this demon on Ragnarok. Honestly, who was the amateur puts such a big exposition before an action scene. And in the midst of these two things, Thor begins to make jokes about being attached to chains. Honestly the editing of this movie is horrible.And that goes for the whole movie. Another example, Odin ends up dying at the end of the first act, and soon afterwards appears an action scene with Hela. The public still barely chewed Odin's death scene - scene loses all emotional impact - a set piece appears which should have an emotional impact - the destruction of Thor's hammer - turns out to have no impact at all. Worse, both scenes lost their impact and ended up canceling each other out.The editing is so horrible, the pace is so fast that not only the emotional scenes lose their emotional focus, the action scenes are flawed and the suspense scenes do not work and the whole movie is gone down the drain, in which the movie can not be chewed and the movie looks like a Mcdonald's meal. Just a factory product. In addition, the film addresses the destruction of a civilization and a race - in this case Asgard - of such a simplistic manners, and in such a hurried way. This film needs (at least) 3 hours for development and make an satisfactory establish for the final battle (considering how many subplots this movie has), instead this is a 2 hours film of second-rate jokes.A movie to fill your eyes, but nothing is left in the mind and because of this movie is easily forgotten after the credits pass. Even the special effects are horrendous. The Hulk continues to be a digital doll and being made by a computer - what's the point of putting the Hulk in the film, but as a way to call more fanboys and sell more tickets, if the Hulk were not in the movie, this movie would make a smaller box-office and less money would went into Disney's account. Not to mention the big wolf, like the hulk, is a computer-made digital doll. The effects that should have been the decoy of the film are amateurs and lousy. Everything in this film fails. In other words, this movie as blockbuster fails to show grandiose special effects and action scenes, the movie fails at all levels. Look, I hate Avatar, but James Cameron knows how to make a great visual spectacle with great action scenes, a beautiful but empty movie. Thor 3 is rubbish at all levels, especially in its proposal (special effects and action scenes). And this for me this is the biggest sin of this movie, because this movie failed in all its objectives.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
One Of The Best Marvel Films To Date,"I believe that this is possibly the best Marvel movie so far, it was the perfect mix of hilarity and dramatic and emotions and family and just everything it is. It's incredibly amazing.I am a huge fan of the entire Thor trilogy, and it's filed with such brilliant character development from Thor (2011), to Thor: The Dark World (2013) and in Thor: Ragnarok (2017).Tails Watiti is the best director for the Thor series, and I hope in any possible future Thor movies, he will direct those as well.He just brought something entirely new and beautiful and colourful to the franchise and did it so wonderfully that every time I watch it I am blown away by how much I love it.It's not a perfect movie, none are, all movies have flaws, but Ragnarok feels too amazing to even focus on them. There is so much more right than wrong in this movie.I loved seeing The Hulk/Bruce Banner making an appearance, he didn't get much development throughout this movie, but the banter shared between Bruce and Thor was amazing and I really hope to see it more in the future.The only thing I did not like about this movie was Hela. She just wasn't interesting enough of a character for me to care about at all, and she just didn't seem at all likeable even in the slightest. I don't blame her for the way she is, I actually blame Odin. But I still don't like her at all.Other than that, the movie was very perfect to me and was completely enjoyable. Also the posters for this movie are incredible.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Funny and awesome,My fav marvel movie hands down. It's funny and epic.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Awesome,"Con 1:))) I will admit though that there is less of the mythology magical feel in this third installment than there was in Thor 1. So I came close to missing that feel of which I had adored in Thor 1. However I had no time to notice or feel negative about that because this Thor 3 kept me constantly captivated and entertained with an awesome feel of its own.Con 2:))) The other negative was a much bigger one for me. That being the lack of Natalie Portman's character. The romance in Thor 1 between Thor and her...was one of my favorite parts of that film. However I have heard it said that she might well show up in future MCU movies and (crossing my fingers) hopefully they will get to be in love again.Pro: Like ... nearly everything.

Putting a Kiwi in charge was always a good idea!,"Ragnarok has such a different feel to it to the previous Thor movies and it was a move in the right direction.
Thor is easily more likeable under the direction of Taika Waititi. He was able to make sure that no one was taking themselves too seriously. The use of music was epic, especially the heavy rock at the beginning and end of the movie.Korg was such a funny character. I've loved every character that Taika has played in all his movies, and Korg is high up there. He does so much for his few scenes.
Thor vs Hulk was also a fantastic scene. Such good humour. There was a nice touch of having two antagonists with Jeff Goldblum and Cate Blanchett each with seperate motivations made a more interesting story other than good versus evil.Great to see a few kiwis brought along with Taika with strong performances from Karl Urban and Rachel House.The only loop hole in the movie for me was the fact the Thor could destory Surtur the fire monster at the beginning of the movie. But then Hela could easily destory Thor but then couldn't equally destory Surtur? This seemed confusing and we're left to put the pieces together to accept this is ok because Surtur grew much stronger (and bigger) by being born again with the eternal flame and also he grows through being in Asgard.Great work from Taika again and great to see the kiwi humour being on the big screen.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Idris Elba could bring some dramatic effect, but no. I can go like that for the rest.Yes some images are beautiful (although much less than previous movie, the pair Thor - Loki had some nice opportunities, but even them seemed too fake, too one-liners, too child acting.

Better and worse than I expected,"The thing to remember when watching this movie is that it will never make any sense. Repeat it as a mantra until you believe it and you will enjoy it thoroughly.Half of it happens on a garbage planet that had no connection with the Marvel Universe, the second in the feudal surroundings of Asgaard, the crown of the known Universe. Wait, what? Hey, take me back to the garbage planet, man! So the story is not really relevant, I mean you know it from the trailer: bad Hela comes, bad Hela goes. I really hoped they would reach some sort of new dynamic of the brothers, now that they have a sister, but they go the standard direction of the psychotic overpowered and ultimately dumb villain. So what remains are the characters. And the thing is that the movie is entertaining. From the action scenes, the slapstick humor, the ridiculous cameos and the completely over the top... everything, the movie is fun. So fun, in fact, that it feels like a parody.What I think happened is that some execs wanted to turn Thor into a Guardians of the Galaxy kind of thing. It was funny, it was ridiculous, but people liked it. What they didn't understand is that there are a lot more movies that are both funny and ridiculous and no one gives them the time of day. So I was both entertained and completely disappointed in the movie. After all, it is a Thor movie, I shouldn't have had high expectations, and I always knew that the best scenes were in the trailer anyway, but when they take a whole legendary planet and portray it as one of those Stargate SG-1 places where everybody wears rags and lives in a single village, I can't help but cringe.Bottom line: Kids will probably love it. It's a good movie to watch drunk or high. Other than that, it's mediocre.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Easily the best Thor movie.,"This movie is so entertaining I'm a bit shocked by all the bad reviews. Sure its a comedy, but most superhero movies are comedies nowadays. At least most of the jokes work with the plot and are actually funny. There isn't really anything to complain about here. The characters are entertaining. The story is clever and fun. The effects are incredible. During the other Thor movies I wanted the people responsible to suffer. During this one I never wanted it to end. Nothing about this movie doesn't work, and that's mostly down to the director.

"""A hilariously fun ride, that isn't anything deeper.""","JordanRossReviews: Thor: Ragnarok– 7/10 Rating: PG-13 <> How to Watch: TheatersI greatly enjoy the Marvel movies because of their balance. I've often admired how Marvel Studios has been able to take the seriousness of these fantasy stories and fuse them with the comedy of its characters and situations to find a perfect middle. Some are more serious than others and some more comedic, and you will find fans on either side of the spectrum. Thor: Ragnarok was not balanced. If you're looking for a fun ride than look no further, but if what you're after is an intriguing storyline, serious acting, or even some great battles then look elsewhere.Speaking of acting, I loved Cate Blanchett as Hela, but the threat of her character and overwhelming power never seemed serious. Obviously you can guess that the heroes will most likely win at the end of the day, but when you make it so blatant it really steals away the threat. When it came to the action I was let down as well. There were the start of some very good scenes, but none of them could stay serious for longer than thirty seconds, if they even managed that long without a one-liner or pokes at superhero tropes. The scenes where we did see the darker and grim side of events felt rushed and after thoughts, almost as if the director had to put them in, but only to get back to the humor. Once I found out Taika Waititi was the director, whose previous work includes What We Do in the Shadows it made a little more sense. It truly felt like one big joke, but if you like your comedy you'll probably like this movie. If you're a hardcore nerd who seriously debates who would win in a fight between Thor and Hulk, don't get too excited.This film felt like a side story within the Marvel universe and one I hope that was meant to be the comic relief in the long line of more serious titles. A great comparison to make within the Marvel family would be that Thor: Ragnarok was the complete opposite of Logan. This film had jokes from the first line to the last. The serious fantasy and science-fiction fanboy part of me wanted to attack this movie, but even I can enjoy a pure laugh fest from time to time, as long as this doesn't become the norm.FILM INFO: Genre: Action, Adventure, Comedy Directed By: Taika Waititi Written By: Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle, Christopher Yost Release: Nov. 3rd, 2017 Runtime: 2h 10min Studio: Marvel",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

The dialogue is great, with a lot of funny one liners and I liked Thor and Bruce Banner teaming up, they worked well together. Wasn't a massive fan of the evil sister (Cate Blanchet) , but that's just me. The rest of the film more than made up for it.Overall, you don't have to be a Marvel fan to enjoy this film.

He's the funniest and most dynamic.

Waititi all the way !,"Here's my review of Thor :Ragnarok . So , Chris Haemsworth is back once again to wield the hammer. Despite being a sequel to the god awful ""dark world"" this movie blew me away , there was not a single dull moment in this movie , very fast phased with a really good soundtrack that went with it , especially lord Zeppelins immigrant . This movie took in so many new characters and gave them the right screen time . No matter how cool marvel movies are , the villains are not too challenging , but Kate blanchet as Hela was beast. Probably the best villain the MCU has to offer. Loki has a lot of character development in this movie and it hit it right. Hulk has a pretty good amount of screen time and how they pulled of the jekyl and Hyde thing was pretty cool especially how they made hulk talk. Now putting everything aside , the one liners in this movie are perfectly placed and they are too funny , like the hold your tummy and laugh kind of ones. If the one liners weren't placed right , this movie would've looked like a spoof , but nah , it nailed it.Thor ragnarok is an absolute treat . I'm not saying this cause I'm into superheroes , its just that good of a movie . And is definitely worth watching on imax and is inarguably the best superhero movie of 2017 , right beside wonder woman.In the end , Thor is not just philosophy convos with Odin , its the perfect entertainer with top notch CGI , crunching 80 s music , a big green monster , quotable dialogue and the perfect setup to infinity war. Can't believe I typed so much ... I guess its the power of lightning and lord Zeppelins immigrant song stuck in my head.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

I'm not really huge on the comedy, except for Taika's character, he's actually pretty funny and only funny because he's a kiwi and yes sometimes the jokes are overdone. Not much has changed story wise, it's still the same thing about family feud and revenge and other boring things. Not a fan and never a fan of the big CGI fight, they're dull and tedious.

"Really funny if sometimes to its detriment, but certainly had me laughing.","The Thor films have been kind of average so far; can a quirky New Zealander change all that?Thor: Ragnarok is the third film in its own series and Thor's fifth appearance in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as a whole. This time it's directed by Taika Watiti and also features the Hulk as a main character. For starters I'd like to say I love Taikia's work; his film Hunt for the Wilderpeople is hilarious to me and any interview you watch of his is a joy to behold. He has a very unique style of film so I can see why Marvel chose him to inject some energy and humor into this series. And he does do that. Ragnarok is the most entertained I've been while watching a Thor movie but it's not without its problems.Story-wise, there is a very quick set-up. You can tell that Taika and producer Kevin Feige wanted to completely dismantle what had been built up in the previous Thor films. I can understand why they wanted to do that but just seeing mythology, characters, and arcs that have been established since 2011 be wiped away or brushed under the carpet was a little disheartening, and this was all during the first act. It was very quick and we were going from scene to scene and location to location very quickly mopping up old plot threads and setting up what this movie was going to be. Once that had happened, and Thor was on the planet Sakar, it became more enjoyable for me. The rest of the movie showcased Taika's style of humor perfectly and had me laughing out loud plenty of times. It did seem a bit like two films at times with one set on Sakar and the other on Asgard as the story kept flipping from one to the other but I was entertained enough with the characters.Chris Hemsworth has always played Thor brilliantly and we get to see a lot more of his comedic talent here. Mark Ruffalo is always a highlight of any film for me and seeing him here was great both as Banner and the Hulk experiencing this mad Universe. Tom Hiddleston's Loki, of course, appears again and although the character has perhaps lost some of his popularity since everybody loved him in The Avengers, I enjoyed seeing him because I like Tom Hiddleston as an actor. Two new characters I absolutely loved in this film though, were Jeff Goldblum's Grandmaster who is hilarious; Goldblum barely has to act, his own wacky charisma comes through perfectly. And Korg, voiced by Taika Watiti himself had some of the best lines. I'd definitely say the characters were the best part of this film for me.In the end, I'd say I really enjoyed Thor: Ragnarok. The story is pretty basic and some of the green-screen wasn't great during the re-shoots but I loved the aesthetic and the characters. I laughed a lot too even though I felt some of the emotional beats were lost due to quick jokes. I still look forward to following Taika's work and I'm looking forward to seeing where the character of Thor himself is taken too.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

However plot wise it was really weak. Hela is doing her thing in Asgard, Thor and Loki is in god knows where doing there thing and met this random person that turns out to be also from Asgard and another avenger to boot... to many coincidences don't make for a strong plot.Then there was the rock guy. He seriously weighed the movie down and no that wasn't an intended pun!Personally I got a strong guardians of the galaxy clone off this movie which is a shame. I would have been happy just watching the actors work of each other. There is also some lack of creativity in the movie as it re-uses previous jokes -the iconic puny god moment, the funny ""he's adopted"" line. all re-used- It was like Loki's fan-fiction come to the big screen.In the end this is a fun popcorn movie, sadly compared to others marvel had put out it's near the bottom.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Ugly, badly paced, thinly written, tonally uneven and worst of all: unfunny, despite its desperate attempts.","Disorienting, loud and ugly, often all at the same time, Thor: Ragnarok boasts a cast of great Marvel characters and rich mythological storytelling--but squanders its potential by being nothing more than a paint by numbers action/comedy with a tone stuck somewhere between a Michael Bay film and a bad SNL skit. What makes it worse is that every attempt at comedy fails completely, and either kills the tension (not that there is much in the first place) or distracts from the plot.The plot is thin and glossed over, and the characters... there are none. Every character in this film is doing roughly the same thing-- a bit. A comedy bit to make the audience laugh. There is no real depth or humanity to this film, just jokes and bad CGI held together with more jokes. Awful choreography and sound design and basically no camera work at all, the film is shot like its a Clerks movie and is very bland to watch.I hope director Taika Waititi keeps away from blockbusters in the future--if only to save himself from anymore embarrassment. The already weak Thor trilogy ends on its lowest low.How Marvel has fallen.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
awesome,"Thor: Ragnarok, the third installment in the Thor series, is a thrilling and highly entertaining addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Directed by Taika Waititi, the film showcases a refreshing blend of action, humor, and visually stunning cinematography that breathes new life into the franchise.Chris Hemsworth reprises his role as the mighty Thor, and this time he finds himself stripped of his hammer Mjolnir and captured on the planet Sakaar. Forced into a gladiatorial arena, he is pitted against his old friend and fellow Avenger, the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo). Their electrifying and hilarious dynamic adds a unique twist to the narrative, injecting the film with a delightful dose of buddy comedy.One of the standout aspects of Thor: Ragnarok is its vibrant and colorful visual style. From the neon-lit streets of Sakaar to the majestic landscapes of Asgard, each frame is a visual treat. The production design and CGI are top-notch, creating a visually immersive world that enhances the overall experience. The film's action sequences are expertly choreographed, combining Thor's thunderous might with the Hulk's raw power, resulting in epic battles that will leave audiences on the edge of their seats.However, what truly sets Ragnarok apart is its impeccable comedic timing and witty dialogue. Taika Waititi's signature humor shines throughout the film, injecting levity into even the most dire situations. The banter between Thor, Hulk, and other supporting characters like Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) is a constant source of laughter. Waititi strikes a perfect balance between humor and the film's more serious themes, never allowing the comedy to undermine the stakes or emotional moments.The cast delivers standout performances across the board. Hemsworth fully embraces Thor's more humorous side, showcasing his comedic chops while still portraying the character's growth and vulnerability. Cate Blanchett steals the show as Hela, the film's main antagonist, exuding a captivating mix of charm and menace. Jeff Goldblum's portrayal of the eccentric Grandmaster is a delight to watch, and Tessa Thompson's Valkyrie brings a strong and memorable female presence to the story.While Thor: Ragnarok succeeds on many levels, it does have a couple of minor shortcomings. The film's pacing occasionally feels rushed, with some character arcs and plot points not fully explored. Additionally, the humor, although generally well-executed, might not resonate with everyone and could potentially overshadow the film's more serious moments.Despite these minor flaws, Thor: Ragnarok is an incredibly enjoyable cinematic experience. It breathes new life into the Thor franchise, infusing it with a fresh and exhilarating energy. With its impressive visuals, engaging action sequences, and sharp humor, it stands as one of Marvel's most entertaining and well-crafted films to date. Whether you're a die-hard fan or a casual moviegoer, this intergalactic adventure is sure to leave you thoroughly entertained.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Fem-autistic BS and PC crap run amok,"It's really sickening the re-writing of cultural myths such as the Norse gods to fit this stupid PC agenda and narrative is unbearably moronic. Hela is, in the actual Norse legends, the goddess of the underworld/hell NOT the goddess of death. Why is there this completely imbecilic idea to just ignore the actual Norse myths and rewrite it to fit some personal identity fem-autistic ideology PC crap when there is an actual character to base it on? In the underworld she is almost unbeatable but outside of it she is a bit on the weak side. That Hela is remade into a fem-autistic character that's is grossly and erroneously overly powered and completely different from the actual legends is just another pathetic and quite annoying act of Hollywood making up a pile of crap so they can pat themselves on the back. She was only strong when she drew her power from the realm of the underworld. This politically correct fem-autistic BS is ruining so much that would have been so good except for the inclusion of the moronic fem-autistic ideology. She breaks Thor's hammer Mjolinir? Really? Geez this is just another fem-autistic crap dance that their PC BS is imposing. Thor's hammer was forged from the core of a neutron star the strongest and hardest substance in the universe which is not possible to break. Odin couldn't have done it and Hela can? Yeah, right. Another thing Hela is NOT Odin's daughter but in fact from the actual myths she's Loki's daughter. Then there's the error of what Ragnarok is. It's not the end of Asgard it's the end of EVERYTHING. Armageddon. The gods and all people, animals, plants ALL life. All planets and stars will be consumed by Fenrir, the monster wolf, after he defeats Odin and kills him. With such a rich story already written why the hell was there a need to substitute with such a load fem-auti$tic PC crap and bullshit that contradicts it in every way. Another thing... Valkyrie is not a name it's the designation for the maiden guardians of Valhalla that rode winged horses who guided the honored dead to it's gates. They're not even Asgardian actually but created beings to perform a task which was protect the gates and entrance as the guardians to Valhalla and guide the honored dead to them.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"While it is entertaining, this somewhat messy piece never creates a genuine emotional connection to any of its characters; still, it's the best of the three solo 'Thor' films.","To say 'Thor: Ragnarok (2017)' is best of the three solo 'Thor' films, which it almost certainly is despite its tonal differences, may be faint praise but it's praise nevertheless. This generally entertaining, if somewhat messy piece, gets better once its plot is properly underway, which sadly takes around half of its runtime. At this point, the new comedic approach meshes with the pseudo sci-fi aesthetics to create a truly distinct entry in the 'MCU'. Though this unique approach isn't entirely successfully and is occasionally feels a little at odds with the core characters, it ultimately makes the piece a lot more fun than it likely otherwise would have been. It doesn't quite manage to hit all of its emotional beats, but it does manage to keep you entertained (again, much more in its second half) and is actually a lot more plot-focused than you may expect. It typically does a good job with its characters, although the villainess is a little weak, and is often genuinely enjoyable. It's funny at times, too. The first half is a bit of a slog, though, and the end result isn't as compelling or affecting as you'd hope. Still, it will probably satisfy disillusioned Thor fans, so long as they don't mind changing his DNA a little; it's certainly better than either of his previous two outings. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Funny superhero flick,"I like that they mixed things up by bringing Taika Waititi into this franchise. There was a level of seriousness in the original film and Ragnarok takes the story to new heights of wonder and laughter. I particularly like Taika's character and his charming Kiwi accent. There's definitely a great undercurrent narrative that propels the film, while keeping you entertained. It's a wild ride with a great film score and pretty astonishing cinematography and special effects for its time. I re-watched this film after seeing the travesty that is Love and Thunder and definitely can say, this film trumps that film by far.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Funny and entertaining...,"""Thor: Ragnarok"" is an Action - Comedy movie in which we watch Thor being imprisoned on another planet but he has to return back to Asgard and stop Ragnarök, the destruction of it.I enjoyed this movie very much because it contained plenty of interesting scenes but it succeeded even more on combining action with comedy. Something that elevated the movie and made the difference. The direction which was made by Taika Waititi was simply amazing and he presented very well both the plot and his main characters. The interpretation of Chris Hemsworth who played as Thor was outstanding. Some other interpretations that needs to be mentioned were Cate Blanchett's who played as Hela, Mark Ruffalo's who played as Bruce Banner, Tom Hiddleston's who played as Loki, Tessa Thompson's who played as Valkyrie and Jeff Goldblum's who played as Grandmaster. Lastly, I have to say that ""Thor: Ragnarok"" is a nice, entertaining movie and I highly recommend everyone to watch it because I am sure it will make you laugh and you will have a great time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Thor review,"When I go and watch a movie one of the things that I want is the film to be fun. And this film Thor: Ragnarok, is a very fun ride for me. The director ,Taika Waititi excellently blends his style of comedy, seen in his previous work like the Hunt for the Wilderpeople and What We Do in the Shadows, with the action and formula seen in the previous Marvel films. Where the other Thor Films fell short because of their overly serious tone and lack of interesting environments for the characters to interact with. Ragnarok does the opposite, taking some ques form other Marvel movies like Guardians of the Galaxy , the film adopts a very fun and ridiculous tone. Introducing characters like Jeff Goldblum's Grandmaster, who is a classic Goldblum Character with his fast-talking wit and charm, the psychopathic leader of the planet is played in a way that makes me excited when he is on screen as he is that magnetic in the role. Also, the reinvention of the character of Thor himself. Making him a fun-loving and witty character as he has the character in the past has been often forgettable in the previous films, often being outshined by the comic reliefs or the other characters with more to them. Waititi takes his previous experience of working on small New Zealand independent comedies and translated the storytelling method to the big budget action films of Marvel. He maintains the themes of his previous work to make the action franchise better. The themes of outcasts of a society trying to fit into a world that does not get them is strong in this film as Thor quite literally has to fight for his freedom in the film. Thor: Ragnarok is a different Marvel Movie, instead of a flashy action movie concerned with special effects and the battle for the fate of the world, the film tells a human story of finding someone's own identity through tragedy and the classic Marvel action and set pieces, all while being an amazingly fun ride.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Why does anyone give this movie a good review?????,This was truly awful!!! It looked like the actors were free to make up their own dialogue. Every single scene is made to be a comedy but the humour is sadly lacking in at least 90% of it. Marvel have latched on to the comedy plaudits they receives from the first guardians of the galaxy movie and now every movie they make has to be hilarious. The action was horrible. Just a horrible backward step for comic book movies. Devastated I spent money to go and see it.,1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

This Film Was Made For A Comedy,"To be honest, I didn't like Thor 1 and Thor 2 they were decent I guess but now a new director has taken over lets see what he can do? And boy what a treat this was. Ok so what does Thor God of thunder do in this film No spoilers But he has to do a lot of good things and you know the villian might be one of the best villians we have had so far along side Loki and Thanos. And also let me tell u this movie is so funny a lot of comedy to make the whole family laugh this is like the perfect team up film with Loki, Thor, Hulk, And so much more. Must watch marvel movie",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"""Hela"" fun, despite some inconsistencies.","I always felt that Thor himself is a character who for the most part was handled decently, but his movies were a mess and not exactly the MCU's best outings. Branagh and Taylor brought their own spin on it, but out of them, I felt that Joss Whedon got him the best. He's not supposed to be taken too seriously as he is an Asgardian God of Thunder after all. I felt Whedon balanced that along with some gravitas more coherently.With being said Captain America and Iron Man have had their limelight, and Thor for the most part has not. His movies are mediocre compared to Cap's trilogy or the first Iron Man film. I think Kevin Feige and Taika Waititi were aware of this problem.What Captain America: The Winter Soldier and the first Iron Man did to those characters, Thor Ragnarok does the exact same to Thor. Feige, Waititi, and Hemsworth reinvents the character and it feels very refreshing.It is definitely the best entry to Thor's trilogy. As a movie going experience, it's entertaining as hell. It's fun, funny, and hip, but as a comic-book fan, the film does take liberties with source materials from great Marvel stories and crams it in all together. While I do think that any movie that is based off of source materials should take liberties in order to fit better for the big screen, I happened to not agree with some of the things they changed in the film. It wasn't exactly what wanted, but for the most part it's handled with care.The cast is great and they look like they're having a blast. Hemsworth and Hiddleston can play these roles in their sleep at this point. They both own the roles and embody them better than ever. The brotherly relationship is still effective. Thor even points out that Loki is still being himself, and will probably never change. Ruffalo also could play his role in his sleep. Hulk can talk now and he's developed his own personality. He has the vocabulary of a three year old and certainly acts like one. The Hulk vs Thor fight recaptured the novelty of when I first saw those two fight each other in the first Avengers film. It's definitely of one the highlight action set pieces of the movie. It's staged well in a gladiator like arena and this time they don't hold back. Their banter is also fun to watch.Jeff Goldblum is a delight as the Grandmaster. He's kinda acting like his real life self and hopefully we'll see him and his brother in a scene one day. The female characters were always lacking the Thor films aside from Lady Sif. Tessa Thompson is a welcome addition. What I also admired is that Waititi and his team, despite her being a badass, don't let her become some redundant romantic interest. They just have a mutual respect for each other. Some of the side characters are also fun, including Waititi himself who portrays Korg, a rock like being with very humorous quips.Speaking of female characters, Cate Blanchett commands the screen as Hela. She does make one heck of an entrance (even though it was shown in the trailers). She brings Asgard to it's demise and she puts up a really good fight against Thor. Unfortunately it still does not solve Marvel's villain problem. Her story seemed like it was at the end of the spectrum. Her role seemed a little lost compared to the other moving parts of the film.Piggy backing off that, while this movie is relentlessly entertaining, I felt that it was missing some weight. Even though the action is amplified and the stakes are there, I never felt a sense of danger or tension. Some of the comedy also was a bit of a miss, although Goldblum's Grandmaster and Waititi's Korg never missed the mark. It doesn't exactly go to the level of the annoying humor Guardians Vol. 2 had, but it was pretty close. Blanchett helped eased some of the jokiness but a little more weight would have been more engaging for me.Despite all that, third time really is the charm for Thor. Despite some changes I don't particularly like and the crammed in story lines from other amazing comics, it's still a fun ride. But what really got my jitters going was the mid credit scene. Avengers: Infinity War cannot get here sooner. It's going to be a long wait.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
such a amazing moviee,"""Thor: Ragnarok"" is easily one of the best films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and a standout performance from Chris Hemsworth as the God of Thunder. Directed by Taika Waititi, this movie brings a fresh, humorous tone that wasn't seen in the previous Thor films. Hemsworth's comedic timing shines, allowing him to showcase not only his action-hero side but also his sharp sense of humor. The movie is packed with vibrant visuals, engaging fight scenes, and quirky characters, such as Jeff Goldblum's Grandmaster and the fan-favorite, Korg, voiced by Waititi himself. The dynamic between Thor and Loki (Tom Hiddleston) continues to evolve, providing depth to the story. The film also introduces Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) and brings back Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), making the ensemble cast even more fun to watch. Overall, the mix of action, comedy, and character development gives ""Thor: Ragnarok"" a solid 9/10. It's an enjoyable and fresh take on the superhero genre, with Hemsworth at the top of his game.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Thorsome Ragnarok,"Thor Ragnarok... A stunning ConclusionThis is how to do a movie and mix superheroes! Whilst the only negative is the exclusion of Natalie Portman...the rest more than makes up for it. An exciting storyline which left me hooked and the action scenes were visually stunning. The mix of Thor and Hulk is a surprising plus, and works well here.The fantasy element probably does overstep the mark a little, but that's what Thor does! A mix of emotions with the ending heightens the thrill of the film...yet for all the thrilling action and epic scenery...what makes this Marvel film standout from some others is the comedy element. Not often do Marvel pull it off, especially in a film without Downey Jr, but here they have and with great effect. This compliments the storyline perfectly and adds that joyous smile to our faces!Overall, this is an epic film for me and is definitely up there with some of the better films...

An absolute banger.,"Incredibly fun action-comedy that does not take itself too seriously but remains true to its heartfelt themes of change, acceptance, and growth.While I am a huge fan of the Shakespearean take on Thor, it didn't get to live up to it's full potential in the MCU, and an irreverent take on the character by Taika Waititi was necessary.Taking the character of Thor, ridding him of his powers, home, family, and birthright provided a much needed new dimension to the God of Thunder. Chris Hemsworth's comedic strengths are fully utilised as he has great chemistry with every cast member, new and old. Cate Blanchett can do no wrong and provides a solid performance that elevates the film, it was great seeing her play a more comedic character after a long dramatic career. It was really interesting how they approached her story, but upon rewatching the film she feels a bit under-utilised, with only a few scenes of her scattered across the film.The visual design is beautiful, especially those slow-motion shots of the Valkyrie, one of my favourite shots of all time. Lots of great action sequences and needle drops. I love the relationship between Loki and Thor, one of the greatest things about the MCU is seeing it evolve organically film by film. Hulk is great too, probably the last time we will ever see him done this well as he was wasted in later films.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

An Honest Review,"OK, this isn't what the advertisements say, at least its not the best Marvel movie (I think that title stills goes to Winter Soldier). That being said, it IS the best Thor movie.It is certainly an escape from the normal Thor movies. It's an escape from the Asgardcentric feel of Dark World. And, well, the best parts of the first Thor were the parts when he was on Earth.Here we have more humor in the film, which isn't unique for Thor, but this one has more of an Antman feel, or at least it has the humor we saw in the Thor Spots around Civil War.It works, the humor plays very well and it's done, well, perfectly. Thor's humor is almost in the vein of a jovial meathead and a very likable one. Plus, Chris Hemsworth has great comedic timing and sensibilities. He knows how to deliver a joke in a believable way without going over-the-top.It works.And, of course, Tom Hiddleston works exceptionally well with the lead.Mark Ruffalo has returned and he has been gone far too long. Far too long. And, really, Hulk is the best character to pit with Thor, both in his green form and as Banner.I'd go further, but that would lead into spoilers, but it was nice to see a spin on World War Hulk, and it did leave the door wide open for another Thor story...And if they do continue this saga, it would be wonderful to see it done in the same way.This was a great break from the previous Thor films, which, especially with Dark World, felt kind of like a chore.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"Knowingly funny, tongues in cheeks for sure","Apparently ""Thor: Another Thor Movie"" had already been taken? Or possibly ""Thor: Thor More""? Perhaps best would have been ""Thor The Thord""?Regardless, and at this point, probably irregardless, even, there will be a point at which no more movies like Thor: Ragnarok will be made, goofy fun-fests with pointless plots and scenes that do little more than offer a transition opportunity and a setup for another joke. Thankfully there are no entangling love lines to get all caught up in along the way.In other words, perfectly fine films. Yes, you heard it here first. Thor: Ragnarok is a Perfectly Fine Film.It's funny. Taika Waititi knows it's funny. How else could you keep a straight face while pretending to be a superhero or supervillainess based on Norse mythology? We know it's funny because we get a handful of wonderful cameos and meta-comedy (meta-dramedy?), and plenty of inside jokes and Easter eggs to fill a whole 44-ounce popcorn cup. We also take part obliquely in a bonus morality lesson about only playing for or only rooting for the winning team. Is it ethical to choose evil paths if it keeps you alive? When is self-sacrifice going to achieve the most screen time?Jeff Goldblum can do more with a wink and a smile than Ben Affleck could ever do with his whole stupid face. Cate Blanchett has a lot of knives to throw and she seems really angry, so look out. Mark Ruffalo shows up. Thor gets a haircut and a few close shaves.Ahem, there's a really powerful Infinity Gem and something called the Eternal Flame just waiting to be touched and used, and they're, like, just downstairs and to the right, dude.

Very good! A little too much sillyness cost it a 9,"While I also scored Thor-2 an 8/10, Ragnarok is definitely the best of the Thor trilogy. It's wonderfully entertaining, and one-ups most other MCU flicks by having a memorable villain and adventurous soundtrack (electronic synthwave vibes fit really well).It almost gets the 9/10 (so far the two Guardians & Doctor Strange get that), but a little too much reliance on overly-silly humour overweighs the dark tension. Often the jokes are amusing, just not laugh-out-loud funny. Guardians did LOL, while Doctor Strange did not. However the Strange film kept the seriousness above water just enough to buy into it, whereas Ragnarok is more comedy than dark-fantasy.Yet it's the dark-fantasy vibe where Thor-3 is at its best: Hela is a vividly-realised figure, recalling the epic intimidating visual structures of another quasi-comic yet also dark villain: Aku from the excellent Samurai Jack animated series. Cate Blanchett deserves all the plaudits, arguably the greatest MCU villain so far (tho' Infinity War is still to come). While her motivations were written thin, visually Hela is a showstopper: those slow-mo scenes of her wrecking havoc are a thing of beauty......as always I'm watching the 3D-versions in the giant FOV-filling view of the Meta Quest 3 headset. It elevates such visual movies. Highly-recommended for chasers of the ultimate movie-watching experience!Ragnarok does drag a little during the long middle-section on the junk planet, the jury's out on whether Goldblum's character really fit (felt more like an SNL sketch). And typically of MCU films there's a ton of logic-holes.It ends strong, with well-directed action and plenty of visually-arresting scenes.At the high-end of the 8/10 scale seems fair.Next: Black Panther.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
forced and out of place,"**spoiler in the last paragraph**A good number of the jokes seemed to be put there by non-comedians who were trying to be funny. They seemed forced and out of place. Good comedy flows with the context, but much of the comedy in the movie seemed put there just to try to be funny.The behaviors of a couple of the main characters were childish and inconsistent with the previous movies, and inconsistent with the characters in the comics.Chris Hemsworth, Mark Raffalo, and Jeff Goldblum all performed like they needed to go back to acting school. I guess that makes sense since Taikiki Waititi who directed the film had a performance as Korg that made me cringe.Ten gold stars to Cate Blanchett, Tom Hiddleston, and Idris Elba. Without them, the film would be a total loser.**Spoiler alert** Having the Thor character debased by screaming like a scared little girl was a desperate move by the director. Come on man, Asgard's greatest warrior and future king would never do such a thing. I guess Waititi never read the comics or saw the the previous films.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Wowzapalooza,"Wow. Filled with inspired choices, ""Thor: Ragnorak"" is a real treat to watch. Credit director Taika Waititi with many of them. And hope he returns for the planned sequel. Following are some reasons why this film, which I did not watch in 3-D, is impressive and thrilling.The visuals. By now, one could be complacent about quality CGI, but for pure spectacle, T:R ranks among the best so far. The depiction of alien worlds, battle scenes, and many characters are among the wonderful special effects featured in this film.Casting. First there is the inspired casting of Cate Blanchett as Hela, the primary villain. She is determined to conquer Asgard. (But she might have to stand in line, considering the contingent of antagonists who wish to destroy Thor or his beloved home.) Tom Hiddleston is always perfect as Loki. Tessa Thompson is Valkyrie, a confident warrior with uncertain loyalties. Jeff Goldblum is a cocksure Grandmaster with a personality that totally fits the quirky comedic sensibility that director Waititi has given T:R. And there are plenty of other castings and cameos that are delightful.Humor. Already mentioned, the humor is a major component of the film (similar to ""Guardians of the Galaxy"") and should not be taken for granted. There is a real risk in injecting silliness into a film of Gods and legendary warriors battling to the death.The story. T:R has a twisting storyline that feels really inspired. The non-linear narrative is filled with surprises and happy moments of discovery. And there is a precise balance between the light-hearted banter and whimsical sidetracks versus the serious conflicts between The God of Thunder and those who would destroy him, his people, and his world.As a final example of perfect choices made, a certain Led Zeppelin song feels like it was made for insertion into one of the final scenes, like there is a momentary pause while Odin, perhaps, cues up the tune.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Third time's the charm,"Well actually the Marvel movies do seem to hit a quality standard, even when they change and bring new elements to it. New elements being the directors, in this case the one and only Waititi. If you haven't seen ""What we do in the shadows"", I implore you to watch it. If you like dark and cynical humor that is. He really is good at directing but also acting (although his character here is animated so it's more of a voice acting job).Now the Marvel Universe has an overall arc, so it is tough to judge this without having the other movies in mind. I would say it works without any prior knowledge, but it's always better to know the other movies too. So the Universe is sort of an overlong season, although I think it's Phase 3 already if I'm not mistaken. Whatever the case, this movie is funny, has action and is an (fantasy) escape for those who are looking out for one. Don't be hating, either enjoy it or let others enjoy it for what it is",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Way too funny for it's own good,"Thor:Ragnarok is already the 17th movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the third Thor movie. It's directed by Taika Waititi (Hunt for the Wilderpeople) and stars Chris Hemsworth, Cate Blanchett, Mark Ruffalo and Tom Hiddleston. In this one Thor faces Hela who wants to take over Asgard, she casts him out and this time he's thrown on a completely different planet where he reunites with Hulk and tries to build a team to stop Hela.This movie is very funny (even though there are a few forced jokes) and light-hearted. But is that necessarily a good thing? I'm not saying this movie should be humorless. But they really went over the top with this one. I'm used to Marvel joking around, but they usually know when to get emotional. Not here. I mean it's freaking Ragnarok, that's supposed to be really, really epic! And at least serious at the end. The movie is really anything but epic. Just when things starts to get serious it seems the writers chicken out and guess what, here's another joke for you! Would you look at that? Isn't that hilarious? Ha, ha, ha! Don't get me wrong, I laughed at quite a lot of them, but sometimes it really seems like they were trying way too hard. Characters are very goofy. A bit too much. To everyone thinking they got everyone right here, remember this. Thor is a god of thunder. A freaking god, not some random funny dude! I'm not saying he should be serious, Thir never was like that, but this is way too much. There are maybe two or three actually kinda serious scenes in the entire movie that are pretty good, but then it all turns to silliness again and those scenes feel like they belong to a different movie they continued making a spoof of.I know that all this might sound like I hated the movie, but it's far from that, I'll get to the pros now. This is probably the most stylish MCU ever got. Regardless of the silliness it's probably the most creative direction we got from Marvel yet. Even though it could have been more, but that's on the writers. We get this colorful fantasy world with a lot of synth-wave music popping up in the background. And two amazing uses of ""Immigtant Song"" by Led Zeppelin. The acting is pretty good and you can see the actors enjoying themselves in the roles. Also, the ending was pretty surprising, but just as many parts of this movie, was ruined with constant jokes. There were a lot of surprising and entertaining cameos, I loved those as they added fuel to the fun that this movie was.All in all, while it's good, I thought it was a huge disappointment since in my opinion this story should have been handled a bit more seriously. I did get tons fun and laughs, but it's not what I wanted from this movie. This was supposed to be epic. I expected one of the best MCU movies, but honestly I thought it was closer to the weaker ones. But it's the best one of the Thor movies. And it's still a lot of fun with a little deviation in style that felt necessary to freshen the franchise up a bit.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"Visually Spectacular, Grippy so does Best Thor Film till date.","THOR RAGNAROK REVIEW :The one thing i always liked about Thor series is that they never gave a long run time film, they always believed in keeping it short and grippy. Thor Ragnarok wins half race here, rest half is won by Terrific Visuals, Massy Writing and throughout tight screenplay. Film has a quick beginning and may be that's the point where film keeps you hooked and it remains same till the End. Doctor Strange's Cameo is Pleasing. The villain Hela is powerful and her back story is well written. Thor's ""Revenger"" team is Great, you see some more addition in Marvel's superheroes list. That anticipation of Hulk's entry worths the wait as he arrives with the bang. Climax is well crafted, every thing is used perfectly by Director. Background music is decent. Cinematography is Excellent. Visual Effects are so good that i declare this one the as the most Visually spectacular film of Thor Series. Editing is Brilliant, no chance to point a finger. Direction is Very Good, could have been better but when everything looks good i don't think it's fair to talk on minor mistakes of director. Overall, Thor Ragnarok is a Perfect Money Making entertainer from Marvel. Marvel just can't disappoint with a good Superhero film. If you're a Fan of Marvel's superheroes films then Thor Ragnarok is a MUST SEE for you. Classes and masses both will love it, especially mass lovers. No doubts, Film will be a huge success at box, get ready for Highest Grossing Thor Film.

Best Thor film yet,"Thor: Ragnarok is by far the best Thor film yet and easily one of the best films in the MCU in general. It's a really fun, insanely inventive and weird adventure with some mature themes that also manages to bring Thor's character arc to a very satisfying conclusion.Chris Hemsworth is reliably perfect as Thor and much funnier than in the previous ones. Tom Hiddleston is also reliably perfect as Loki once again. Tessa Thompson, Mark Ruffalo and Karl Urban are all incredible and Cate Blanchett is definitely one of the better MCU villains. Jeff Goldblum is a hilarious scene stealer.Taika Waititi's direction is amazing, it's extremely well filmed, really stylish and refreshingly colourful. It's superbly paced and the CG is mostly impressive. The music by Mark Mothersbaugh is amazing, it's completely different to what's come before but still pays respect to the original Thor score.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"Deadpool movie in Superman concept, what can i say?","From Action, Adventure, Fantasy to Action, Adventure, Sci-fi and finally to this.....COMEDY!! I bet marvel already got a superhero movie parody which is Deadpool is great. But this!?? Thor used to be Arrogant, Strong, and Grounded character. To become parody in his own movie, is a joke itself. Well, first thing i imagined when i read ""Ragnarok"" is war and destruction. this is Light comedy movie. If this supposed to be Superhero movie, its a letdown. If this was intentionally to be comedy movie, it nails! I think its a waste for Hela as outstanding menacing villain, and Loki's character (used to be). Valkrie did the good job also, but Thor didn't. In the end, i asked myself, ""What is superhero movie should be?"". Entertaining, so people can laugh and forget, or Inspiring, so people gasped while watching then proud and thrilled to become better person after it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
If Marvel Studios did a 3 stooges movie ... this is it.,"This has got to be the worse, most disjointed Marvel movie to date. From the sublime, to the ridiculous, that kinda sums this up. Other Marvel movies have the odd one liner, like Thor's, ""He's adopted"" from the Avengers, and they where so slight, and infrequent, that the pace of the movie was never affected. Not so here, comedy, it would seem is the most important thing in this movie, and some of the jokes make the universe's mightiest heroes, appear like they are 8 year old, it really is that slapstick, the pacing of the movie dies because of it, at no point was I gripped on the edge of my seat at the action, because it was always broken up by ""Who's on first base"" comedy. The director took a gamble here, and some love it, I think it's awful, it's like Al Pacino doing comedy, it's. just. wrong. The eye candy and effects are all there, and Hella is played in a wonderful deadpan style. But the script is so full of dad jokes, it's hard for the rest of the cast get a real grip of the part they are playing, Heimdall is here, although has lost some of his gravitas that made him Heimdall, and Loki just full of .... nonsense, even by his standards.I sincerely hope the rest of the offerings from Marvel studios are better than this tripe.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"a director totally in sync with his cast - one of the funniest movies of the YEAR, nevermind MCU","In brief: this was a damn space craft full of fun. Thor Ragnarok is Douglas Adams by way of Jack ""King"" Kirby, both from his Thor run and other (MANY) space fantasy comics in look and brawny, iconic feel (and this time, maybe the first time, Larry Lieber gets a screen credit!) Waititi is stupendous with his actors and they give back in kind.If only the action wasn't so been-there-done-that (or maybe it's the CGI being so overwhelming that it consumed the actors in some shots). That said, this continues the goofy-but-serious space-operatic look from the Guardians movies, and it ups the stakes from the previous Thor movies - it's *easily* the superior of the three, the most human and with a more interesting villain(ess), though I wish Blanchett were in it a wee bit more, not to mention Waititi himself playing a rock monster with a droll sensibility - so it stands out from the pack very easily. Even Thor gets an arc this time, which was fairly typical if there at all, and I don't even know if there was one in The Dark World (that movie was so forgettable I didn't recall what happened to Odin at the end of that story.Ruffalo as Hulk/Banner gets fun stuff to do throughout (he gets to talk, a lot, this Hulk, so take that what you will), and everyone gets a moment to shine, from Tessa Thompson to Karl Urban (mostly his arc is serious, but he starts off the movie with a terrific jokey scene), to even the whoever-she-is that has to work as the Grandmaster's secretary. It's not as emotionally full of depth as the Guardians series, but I did also appreciate where the movie ends up as far as the fate of Asgard; even if it's a small way, it felt like Marvel taking a real chance - the first time they did something like that since Iron Man 3 with the Mandarin, and like that it works - and while, again I must stress, much of the action doesn't carry much consequence, as a comedy with that spirit of Adams (from Hitchhiker's Guide AND Long Dark Teatime of the Soul, I almost forgot till a friend reminded me Odin and Thor and Loki were in that), it's firing on as many cylinders as the other MCU movies this year.It's a breezy, wild space adventure. It knows its audience, and it gives winks and nods to how silly it all may be, but when it needs to be serious it can do that too (or at the least, Cate Blanchett gets to chew on some scenery, but not all of it, if you catch my drift - she knows what she's in and is having the time of her life in a way I haven't seen since Crystal Skull).",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Too much infantile humor overshadows the decent VFX,"I always enjoy some humor in my action flicks but this was way overdone. Worse, is that it was infantile humor that seemed to be aimed at 10 year olds. The VFX were decent and the story was ok. Not one of my favorite films of the franchise but still enjoyable. Would I see it again or recommend it? Probably not. 7/10 from me.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Asgard isn't a place, it is a people. Thor must save it against sister Hela.","I watched this at home on DVD from my public library. It is yet another action movie that gives the powered subwoofer a great workout.In Norse mythology, Ragnarök is a series of future events, including a great battle, foretold to ultimately result in the death of a number of major figures the occurrence of various natural disasters, and the subsequent submersion of the world in water.The IMDb summary does a good job so I won't repeat any of in in this short review. What I like most about this movie is the entertainment value. As viewers we know this is all fantasy, a movie like this should not take itself too seriously. This one is funny and absurd at times within its fictional universe. Even Stan Lee, with his usual 'cameo', actually plays a character that gives Thor an unwanted haircut. There is even an uncredited 'cameo' by Matt Damon, playing the part of Loki in a stage play being presented to Odin.A movie like this must use lots of CG and most of it looks really good. Good, entertaining movie. But who is Taylor Hemsworth who has a very short appearance as the Earth girl who wants to take a selfie with Thor?",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Enjoyable if taken with a pinch of salt (or a lot),"From the beginning, it has been kind of confusing, maybe because I had forgotten what went on before this started. There were quite a few scenes where even Thor was confused about why some things are in certain ways but hey, it is just how it is right? Quite a lot of things were never explained clearly.Besides, the thing about Hera seems like a side-story, she was never mentioned, and all of a sudden she is so amazing. Again, even Thor was surprised. And a lot of the concepts in this movie seem quite new as well.Character development wise, it's just a bunch of strange happenings (imagine, Hulk was smiling and happy), plot armor and sudden power-ups. Well, if some of those stuff had proper explanations, it'd be good and all, but many were just ""well just accept it"", hence the pinch of salt needed. Loki is loki as usual, incomprehensible and a catalyst of chaos as usual.In conclusion, either a movie marathon is needed to understand some of the stuff that happened, or basically just take it as a standalone movie but prepare popcorn... oops, I mean salt, to pinch while watching this film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Thor: Reboot,"The total change of the hero and the total change in the atmosphere went very good. We have great hopes for the next Avengers, but after such a Thor, it will be difficult to surprise and fascinate us.The soundtrack is simply beautiful, always at the right time and strongly adds impressions in certain moments.Director Taika Vaititi is just an opening, someone will say that he created in the film a too comic atmosphere. But it was worth it, the jokes are just great. There is no man who does not smile looking Thor: Ragnarok. The humor in the film perfectly dilutes the intense and epic moments. You could add more seriousness or battles, but not the fact that the film would have turned out better.Thor from a little interesting hero thanks to ""Ragnorok"" will definitely fight for leadership in popularity and charisma. He added power, humor, and most importantly in intelligence. He started to plan his actions perfectly and use all the opportunities that are provided to him.In addition to him, the intellect was added by the Hulk, but not so much . He is like bully kid now. Funny and interesting moments with him became even more.The inhabitants of Sakaara are completely different and unusual, far from being patterned, which are very interesting to observe. Asgardians as true wars do not surrender even in the face of death itself and do not kneel before anyone, with a few exceptions.Hella - A great villain. Her motives are perfectly understandable, the power and charisma are simply enormous. She's as pathetic and confident in words as she is on the battlefield. Demonstrating this throughout the film in epic battles. Very rare quality, which makes it one of the most dangerous threats to the universe.And of course Loki! I've never been a fan of this character, but it's hard to argue that he improves every film he participates in. In this picture, he introduces such chaos, humor and interest that he is that zest that makes a great film Masterpiece! To make a masterpiece there must be a star, a puzzle. It is this director for the script and for the cast. Another excellent camera work, editing and soundtrack. Thor: Ragnarok is just that case, all at the highest level.The best film Marvel!

Hollywood at its best...Thor Ragnarok is a masterpiece!,"New characters in Thor Ragnarok.....Surtur, Rockman, Mik, Hela, Grandmaster, Valkyrie, Skurge.....Personally, this movie has great rewatching value. It is not as serious as the first two Thor movies and so the change of tactics by adding humor is really well refined. We have plenty of blu rays to enjoy at home but this is our go to movie to feel good. My wife, son and myself particularly love all the characters and the story that unfolds in an entertaining manner. The women are very beautiful, especially Hela and Valkyrie. Hela's makeup changes time and again and that is the only drawback, but she makes up for the great character she plays as the Goddess of Death. Loki is at his usual mischievous self but it was good to see Thor and Loki get along and reunite in this third Thor installment. There are plenty of new characters introduced and the technology is amazing and futuristic. The ability to leap from one world to another is incredible and they do it with ease. I highly recommend getting the blu ray version....the sound and picture are fantastic as is the movie.In summary, the main reason why I like this movie is because it shows even the Gods have their share of problems such as jealousy and sibling rivalry. At the end of the day, despite all the fighting and betrayals, brothers will be brothers and must get along. This is a strong message to our mortal world to get along despite all wrong that happens around us. This is an amazing movie about being a hero and overcoming personal strife and helping people in need. That is what heroes do. :)To the actors, developers of the movie and all those who put their hard work into this masterpiece, my heartiest thanks as this is a treasure to keep and cherish forever.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

A fine fantasy movie,"I wish i could have evaluated this movie with 10 because it is a really remarkable movie. Special effects,the CGI are all at their best they make the movie seem realistic. Thor also is at his best ,his action scenes ,special powers are at 10. The movie plot is well organized,you will find the story very attractive and challenging. Karl Urban character is my favorite here, Kate Blanchet also plays well the character of an ambitious conqueror , their performance makes the movie attractive and worth-watching.
However it has some drawbacks.
The sense of comedy is highly extended , unlike in the movie Thor(2011) were Thor was serious in acting and communicating ,here Thor has passed the limits of comedy which spoils the movie and his goal, also the rock character Thor´s friend is unimportant his speech makes him childish and is trashing the movie. Also Mark Ruffalo not as Hulk but in original seems like he is acting the role not as an professional actor, his comedious performance makes him dumb and stupid.
In overall it is a good fantasy movie , worth watching and i recomend it to all fantasy lovers.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"While not perfect, Ragnarok is the kind of fun and zany film that Thor needs.","It is an overwhelming pleasure and honor to say that Thor: Ragnarok is a good and fun superhero film, mostly because 2011's Thor and 2013's Thor: The Dark World are the worst films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Director Taika Waititi has ditched the overly serious tone and rebranded Thor (and Chris Hemsworth) as a wisecracking and charismatic hero, and it works wonders here as the film feels like a cool summer breeze compared to the previous cold arctic blast. While not a perfect film, since it does have some problems, this film is definitely exciting and makes for a joyous experience at the cinema.In the beginning of the film, we see Thor (Chris Hemsworth) as a prisoner to Surtur, a fiery demon that wishes to bring death to all of Asgard. While he's imprisoned, Thor also learns that Odin (Anthony Hopkins) has been missing from the throne and that Ragnarok, the apocalypse of Asgard, will happen soon. Thor breaks free and returns to Asgard to find that Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has assumed the throne by disguising himself as Odin. Once he has been caught in the act, Loki takes Thor to Odin on Earth. Knowing these are his last days, Odin confesses to his sons that they have a half- sister, Hela (Cate Blanchett), who is also the goddess of death. Hela lusts for the throne and invades Asgard in order to seize it. While trying to fight her off, Thor and Loki become stranded on the world Sakaar, which is also the planet Hulk has been residing since the events of Avengers: Age of Ultron. Thor needs to return to Asgard in order to save it, but he is forced to fight as a gladiator for his freedom.The film feels much faster than its official 130-minute runtime. We fly through different scenes as the story keeps building up to the climax. It almost feels like they tried to fit three hours of worth of material here and should have either added more time or cut some story elements. It's still fun and stylish but should have been given more time to breathe and play out. There is also a misallocation of screen time for the characters. Odin, Doctor Strange (very brief cameo), and Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) are given much smaller roles in order to make room for new characters such as Skurge (Karl Urban) and Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson). It's a sad thing since the new characters are disappointing in the large amount of time they are given and the much better much better ones are confined to bit parts.Thor: Ragnarok is also a film that heavily focuses on the relationships between the main characters. Throughout the film, Thor and Loki continuously rethink their past differences and remind themselves that they are still brothers. It's a fairly emotional arc that works well considering the experiences both characters have been through in the previous films. We also get a surprisingly great connection between Thor and The Hulk / Bruce Banner. Although they shared little to no moments previously, they come together and form a kind of buddy cop duo. They play really well off each other and are key to the best comedic moments in the film.Chris Hemsworth gives his best performance as Thor and really delivers on making the character funny and interesting. Previously he had been played as a stoic, but confident hero that we tolerated from time to time. In this film, he's cracking jokes and having fun on his quest, all while displaying his own brand of macho charisma. He also has a great sense of comedic timing as he often delivers one-liners at the perfect time.Tom Hiddleston returns as Loki and reaffirms his place as the best villain/anti-hero the MCU has to offer. Him and Hemsworth play brilliantly off each other and really feel like brothers trying to make sense of their relationship. Even though Loki has done some very evil things, like invade New York in The Avengers, we never really get the sense he is all bad. This is mostly because of Hiddleston's ability to make us feel sympathetic for Loki.Cate Blanchett does a really good job as Hela, which creates a main villain that is leagues above the previous ones we have seen in the MCU (does anybody remember Malekith or Whiplash?). Blanchett plays Hela almost like somebody would Medusa, an evil snake-like woman with the powers to kill anybody she sets her sight on. Hela cannot turn people to stone, but she can draw a sword and shoot knives out of her body at any moment.Mark Ruffalo does double duty here as both The Hulk and Bruce Banner. His motion capture work is superb and makes the character of Hulk way more complex and engaging than before. Banner has also been improved on since the last time we saw him. He's starting to lose hope in his humanity as keeps battling for control of his body with Hulk and begins to question why he keeps fighting.The minor supporting cast really stands out here, with Tessa Thompson being the most notable as Valkyrie. She's a rogue Asgardian warrior that has lost her purpose and now spends her time drinking and working for the ""Grandmaster"", played by the wonderful Jeff Goldblum. He gives the film a heavy dose of comedic weirdness and does a great job in a small, but rightly sized role.Thor: Ragnarok is fun and exciting superhero blockbuster that never takes itself too seriously. It's a huge improvement over the previous two films in the series but still suffers from the same fate as other MCU films. I'm excited about Hemsworth and co. returning again in 2018 for the highly anticipated Avengers: Infinity War.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Entertaining but not really a Thor movie,"I rather enjoyed watching this film. The quips are funny; the action suspenseful and the world very colorful. The cast is having a lot of fun and I did too while watching the film. However, the more I thought about the film the more annoyed I got at it. In the end it feels much more like the Guardians of the Galaxy movie than a Thor one.The MCU is always going to have some weird tonal clashes given that their various heroes are different genres; Thor 1 & 2 were really in the high fantasy-royal drama setting and Thor 3 isn't. It mostly a sci-fantasy with a huge dose of comedy. It isn't just comic relief but much of the film is built around telling jokes. Worse, many of Thor's quips feel very Stark-isque and how Thor is written in Ragnarok feels off. Compounding this problem is the ending of the film is utterly at odds with what before in stakes and consequences. The ending is too dark.Thor has never been that close to the Norse myths in the comics or films but I still couldn't get over Hel(a) being Loki's sister (!) or Fenrir being present and not eating umm the sun.

Ample Amounts of Comedy and Action,"This movie begins with ""Thor"" (Chris Hemsworth) having been captured by a giant demon named ""Surtur"" (a CGI with the voice of Clancy Brown) who intends to kill him very soon. But before doing this Surtur tells Thor that his father ""Odin"" (Anthony Hopkins) has mysteriously abandoned Asgard which will now allow him to fulfill the prophecy known as Ragnorok and thereby entirely destroy that vaunted realm. Fortunately, Thor manages to escape from his chains and quickly seizes the crown of Surtur--which is the main catalyst for initiating Ragnorok--and then departs before Surtur can attempt to recover it. What Thor doesn't know is that Odin is extremely ill and upon his death his powerful and extremely evil daughter ""Hela"" (Cate Blanchett) will be released from imprisonment and lay claim to the throne of Asgard-which is possibly even worse than the possibility of Ragnorok ever was. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an entertaining movie which contained ample amounts of action and comedy. Unfortunately, some of the comedy seemed a bit unnecessary and the numerous subplots sometimes made it difficult to follow as well. But all in all it was an entertaining film for the most part and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"Thor Three is very much What We Do In The Shadows with capes. Wait, it did have capes in it. Well, you take my point.","Despite its adherence to the kooky, sometimes slapstick, sometimes realistic, always offbeat, kiwi humour, Ragnarok is also an out and out true fantasy; much more so than Guardians of the Galaxy with its space opera chops, Ragnarok delivers cloaked exiles trekking refugees across lush landscapes, fights inside trippy rainbow light bridges, posturing enthroned becrowned fire demons, the severed head of a gigantic guardian dragon, prog rock album art cover shots sprinkled liberally throughout and Mark Mothersbaugh's delicious score that flipflops between 80's nostalgia synth and Howard Shore's Lord of the Rings. The lack of distinction between the magic and science mentioned in the first Thor movies finally lives up to the magic side of things; the opening and closing title logos almost as good as the film itself, not to mention the comic-con announcement/trailer typeface, all promising a coin-op arcade cabinet of a film that was eventually, actually, delivered.Thor: Ragnarok is a good example of liberal canon and yet also, about evolution of character; Thor, a waning, one-note, foppinsh, stiff do-gooder needing to find a new throughline above the macho sycophants and narcicists that rule the Avengers world. As such we're given an impressively short time on Earth and instead given a micro and macro level view of the workings of the planet Sakar, repurposed here from Planet Hulk to give us a greatest hits skim over deeper, more creative comic bokk source material. But the characters are allowed time to bond here; Thor's way of dealing with Banner and Hulk are hilarious and realistic, the idea that The Avengers just end up using each other is touched upon nicely here the film is allowed to explore the only superpowered Avenger who isn't pretending to be someone he's not. He's a hero and he bloody well knows it through and through, he doesn't have to put on a suit because his Dad didn't love him, he doesn't have to fight his darkside through Gamma exposure, he has to convince and rally those to the cause of good, only to discover (see Ragnarok) that it was good for him to do nothing. He can't fight nature, death and rebirth, because it is the universe. It's all these even if it is hidden, which makes a refreshing change.The film does have a problem with zipping all over the place like a saturday morning cartoon in its effort to (admirably) resolve a bunch of cameos and scenes from previous unrelated Marvel entries, but I suppose it's a refreshing twist to see the entire end credits sequence featuring Doctor Strange played out in full here, it almost feels like the most solid link between disparate films they've crafted yet.The film veers in to slaptick a little too often but when it is let off the leash to be full badass, my god does it go full badass: Thor actually using his lightning powers to decimate his foes; John Wicking his way through Draugrs and using his hammer to flee dirty great creatures and the clearly videogame-influenced ship battles involving characters jumping from ship to ship to disable them directly. A wholly appropriate smattering of Led Zeppelin got my fist and heart pumping and a smirk on my face that said: ""Well done Thor Ragnarok, well played.""But the fact that this film is having so much fun and invites you along to have it too, only makes the misfires all the more bitter: Take Tessa Thompson for example, there's no doubt she was having fun, but her acting style of looking smug and fighting with a truly distracting and hard to understand BRITTOSH(tm) accent, was only the icing on the cake for her character who had no proper catharsis and no moment of a real ending or closure to her story. The fact that she was hired in as the kick-ass female(tm) and not warranted properly and woven in properly cheapened her immensely.Also missed is all the weight and depth and aching, ponderous beauty from Hulk and co. from Planet Hulk - It wouldn't be hard to shoehorn it in to a later entry, but losing Meek and his history and personality from PH and the relationship between Korg and Hulk in PH were particularly standout in comics and were weak here. I suppose there was the faintest hint of the relationship between Valkyrie and Hulk/Banner but it misses some of the most beautiful and impactful nuances of the romantic relationship of PH.I also think more time and attention could have been spent on some of the CGI. Because Taika stages the extras and physicasl backgrounds so well, Asgard has never felt so real unlike most of the other Marvels that suffered from acute greenscreenitis. The CGI background work and sets are generally excellent which means sore thumb sequences such as CGI Hela fighting off the hoardes reminded my of Matrix Reloaded's plasticky blandness, and some of Hulk's moments were played far away with emphasis on acting and movement, leaving a lingering desire to want to see a few close ups of Hulk talking to build a stronger sense of connection and to tame my curiosity as to how they made this Hulk tick.One of the stronger aspects is the strong, almost resolution, to Loki's story. He is the brother in this film and the story deserves him, unlike The Dark World, and it deserves to explore brotherhood in it considering their connection to Hela. Hela is given enough to do, is charismatic enough and has motivation and backstory etc etc but she ends up being mixed bag. Due to the speed and globetrotting nature of the film, she feels like an immovable object, taking 90 minutes to make her way from the rainbow bridge to the warehouse of antique relics. Had she been employed as someone in the way of their journey and not just waiting for them to get back the way Guardians 2 managed to do, it might have not felt like a film of two halves.Anthony Hopkins is another symptom of the film playing catch up with the decisions of prior titles; he starts strong, but really, he's Loki at that point, and when he's himself he is detached and is glossed right over. The emotional side never plays out properly and the best parts of the film's themes are left unexplored. The colonial idea that Odin paid for the vast beauty of Asgard with his bootheels over the countless other worlds is a fascinating and a surprisingly obvious one. It came out of leftfield, but was not unwelcome and tied directly to the titular Ragnarok, smacking nicely of the Crusades. It was powerful and smart but it left Odin unaccountable as he turned in to gold dust and disappeared, there's not enough running time or clever scripting to have Thor or Loki deal with the fact that their empire and their father dealt in so much bloodshed. Maybe if his parting speech made more sense in retrospect instead of being wishywashy forgettable claptrap.However. When a film make a conversation about a vampire stake weapon so deftly that I can't breathe through the laughter, or when Thor waxes about how much he loved snakes and how Loki played a prank on him as children that's so funny I think I'm going to die. When cameos are so brazen and stupid they feel like they belong in Anchorman not Marvel's throwaway Avenger, then the film manages to fully and wholly redeem itself.The films goofy charm is awash with 80's music and glam rock villains and it's no small feat for it to be, for me, the film I wanted Guardians to be when I first watched it. It's the film I like as much as everyone else seemed to like Guardians. Ragnarok isn't as emotional, but I like it more. I liked the Hulk/banner transformation that stirred me, I like that its influences and taste are less crass and more kiwi, and it wasn't the plethora of slapstick humour that kept me laughing alone, it was the conversational, humanising dialogue amidst this alien, fantastical world. And the fantastic array of acting doing its best to make it the most unique entry in to Marvel's machine. And its Taika's little details, the use of Pure Imagination, the destruction of all the hero tropes in to childish, playing-action-man-with-your-mates moments, that prove that a strong director can push past the Marvel factory and yet still play ball enough not to get fired ceremoniously or unceremoniously.Thor: Ragnarok:It's fist pumping hero action. The third act is fun, doesn't feel out of place, comes at the right time and flows well. It's a blink and you miss it, eye popping, influences on its sleeve, side-splitting, niche humoured blockbuster and it's highest compliment is it embodies its themes; it is true franchise Ragnarok: destruction of the known and previously seen, to facilitate a rebirth, of relationships, of what a visionary can bring, of what a film should strive to be, a rebirth of good blockbuster cinema.A Saturday morning cartoon based off of a Final Fantasy game set in the world of Star Wars and soundtracked to Led Zeppelin.

Great story ruined,"Soundtrack was so forced. Somebody obviously has a hard on for GnR. The humor was immature and just a rehash of overused jokes from other Marvel movies.

Producer did such a bad job, which is sad, because the basic sorry was good. Unfortunately, the movie feels like it was just sliced together from other films.

Still one of my favourites from the franchise,"This was a bit of a ""just being on the TV while doing something else"" watch but it is a movie I know very well since it is one of my favourites from Marvel. Who knew that a movie that has nothing to do with the MCU really would be one of my favourites? What a surprise a movie that is occupied with being a movie and less a franchise is more coherent? Who would have thought. Ragnarok is a fun blast from start to finish, it is one of the most fun Marvel movies and also one with some underrated moments from Chris Hemsworth.Thor must return to Asgard and defeat his evil sister Hela and save Asgard from ragnorok happening.Where this movie doesn't shine is when it wants to be more serious and it also has some pacing issues. The constant cutting back to Asgard and Hela is distracting to the more fun and enclosed story on Sakaar. This is of course important to the story but it lacks care. Same could be set about the beginning pf the movie, just something director Waititi clearly just wanted to get over with and I actually love that. It is obvious that Waititi doesn't care that he is doing a Marvel movie, just throwing all the lore in the beginning and end so he can focus on what he wants to make. That is a fun statement to make in a franchise like this. It makes your movie stand out like a sore thumb, but at the same time that is what I want these movies to do, stand out on their own, and this one does it in the best way.The villain in Hela is bad. She is kind of boring and is just an obstacle to pass for Thor. I don´t quite understand her powers wither, summoning black things I guess?There are also some great needle drops in this movie and a great use of a Led Zeppelin song.This is also a movie with great performances. Chris Hemsworth gives a strong emotional performance, think about the elevator scene with Loki, so subtle acting from him there. He also has incredible comedic timing here. Giving more himbo energy now and that works well for the character. Tom Hiddleston is great and fun, Mark Ruffalo is great here to begin incredibly funny in both forms. Jeff Goldblum is so fun too here, overall the comedic timing is great and the jokes land every time with me. The writing team and Waititi´s directing is so strong with the comedy here and Waititi is even great as the character Korg, showing is comedic talent.This is a terrible adaptation of the comics though don´t get me wrong and this is one of those gone and forgotten from the franchise movies that is disregarded quickly in ""Infinity War""(2018), but to me it will always be one of the greats.The cracks started to show a bit more on this viewing. The comedy and action is still strong but the attempts at emotions and anything Marvelesc doesn't really land here, but that is nothing new.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A fresh and fun take on the god of thunder,"""Thor: Ragnarok,"" directed by Taika Waititi, breathes new life into the Thor franchise with a refreshing blend of humor, action, and vibrant visuals. The film sees Thor, played by Chris Hemsworth, facing off against the formidable Hela, the goddess of death, portrayed by Cate Blanchett.What sets ""Ragnarok"" apart from its predecessors is its comedic tone. Waititi's direction infuses the film with a quirky, irreverent sense of humor that lightens the narrative and makes it immensely entertaining. Hemsworth's comedic timing shines, and his chemistry with co-stars Tom Hiddleston (Loki) and Mark Ruffalo (Hulk) adds depth to their dynamic.The film's visuals are a standout, with the bright, colorful aesthetic of Sakaar contrasting the darker elements of Asgard. The action sequences are thrilling and well-choreographed, providing plenty of excitement.However, the emphasis on humor sometimes undercuts the dramatic moments, and the pacing can feel uneven. Despite these minor flaws, ""Thor: Ragnarok"" successfully reinvents the franchise, making it a fun and engaging superhero film that stands out in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
The Best Thor Movie to Exist,"Thor: Ragnarok introduces a whole new spin at Thor's world and character, really mopping up the mess of the two Thor movies before it. Where they lack, Taika Waititi improves in this movie. The comedy is balanced and lands great, the adventure really adds to the audience's and genre's sense of adventure. The action is fun, smooth, and sometimes hardcore. There is nothing that visually compares, and the settings are perfect. The longtime fight between Mark Ruffalo's Hulk and Bruce Banner is taken in a way that we hadn't quite expected, but still interesting nonetheless. Chris Hemsworth's Thor and Banner become the duo we never knew we needed. Tom Hiddleston's Loki begins to evolve into even more of a lovable character for fans. And the introduction of a collection new, fun characters is a great addition to the MCU. While some characters were a little mistreated in my opinion, this movie is a great watch, and never disappoints. It's the redeeming Thor movie that the franchise thrives on, and Marvel really shot off something worth the pain.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

This is exactly what the franchise needed to pick itself back up. This film is exciting and overall...it is funny. The main thing to know right in the beginning is that this film is a comedy, where the jokes surprisingly land on numerous occasions. However, this film does have trouble finding its balance. That is not to say the film is bad, it is actually quite good (notice how I gave it an 7 out of 10 rating), but this film gets lost in the comedy aspect and barely touches on the dramatic aspect that should be touched on, and it was a little disappointing.

A spectacular looking funny if somewhat superficial entry into the franchise,"After the luke-warm reception to Thor: The Dark World, Marvel has decided to shake things up in a big way for the third Thor solo outing, borrowing a lot from the studio's surprise hit Guardians of the Galaxy films.Director Taika Waititi has made a frantically paced, colourful, comedy with Ragnarok, and the result is both a blessing and a curse.'Comedy' is the operative word here, with virtually every character delivering punchline after punchline as Thor (Chris Hemsworth) embarks on a quest to save Asgard from the evil Hela (Cate Blanchet). While the comedy is for the most part great and definitely delivers a fun time at the cinema, the film's need to get to the next laugh as soon as possible can sometime leave the dramatic or character elements wanting. While Thor, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and the other Asgardian characters are dealing with some fairly dire circumstances and the potential destruction of their home, they're never too far from cracking a joke. It's ok that the film doesn't take itself seriously, but the characters don't take anything seriously either. Every time something potentially dramatic happens it's undercut by a punchline. It's as if Waititi feels the need to constantly remind the audience that 'This is dumb, and you're dumb for liking it'.Now if the alternative to the more comedic approach is The Dark World, (a grey, bland, melodrama with Kat Dennings for comedic relief) then I'll take Ragnarok any day. However the balance is a little off here. The film tries to beat Guardians of the Galaxy at it's own game, and doesn't quite succeed.Visually, Ragnarok is definitely one of Marvel's best entries, with a bright colour palette and some spectacular action sequences, the director uses every tool at his disposal to make each scene pop with on-screen creativity.The much advertised return of the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo)is a definite highlight. As Thor is flung to the far side of space he encounters his former team mate in an alien gladiatorial fighting pit and, of course, hilarity ensues.Hemsworth and Ruffalo are on great form and the film is at its best when they are together. While neither actor gets anything particularly dramatic to do, they certainly prove they have comedy chops. I for one would love to see some sort of buddy cop movie with these two.Likewise Hiddleston is always good value as Loki and while Ragnarok may not be the most witty outing for the God of Mischief, its always fun when the sons of Odin get together.The new characters also make fine additions to the growing universe. Jeff Goldblum isn't so much acting as 'being Jeff Goldblum' as the Grand Master but that's far more entertaining than him phoning it in like he did in last year's Independence Day: Resurgence. Tessa Thompson's Valkyrie does a lot with a small amount of screen time and while her arc doesn't quite have the impact it should in her debut outing, it'll be great to see how she develops in future installments.On the villain front however, Marvel is predictably lacking. Cate Blanchett should have brought some menacing gravitas to proceedings. Instead she is left on her own for most of the movie to monologue to a wasted Karl Urban (who really should have a bigger/better role in the MCU) and threaten extras.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Also some of the minor characters like Korg were super cool and interesting as well as funny. The big MVP though is the actor who plays Korg as well as the director; they are one in the same. Great movie and so far the best marvel project yet. I really hope they give this Director another shot at a big one. We shall see",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Molijnir to perfect.,"A second viewing of the film, following the home video release shows that though still highly enjoyable, the film was perhaps so memorable that the rewatch suffered in comparison.The demise of Odin releases the shackles that have held Hela, The Goddess of Death, (Cate Blanchett) imprisoned for centuries. A short battle on Earth sends Hela back to Asgard, whilst Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and Thor (Chris Hemsworth) are cast out of the Bifrost to Sakaar, a planet run by ""The Grandmaster"" (Jeff Goldblum) who insists that Thor must defeat his champion in order to earn his freedom.I loved this film on my first viewing. Seeing the capacity that Chris Hemsworth has to be funny it was a masterstroke to take a cue from ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and broaden Ragnorok into a genuine comedy. It's a fabulously written movie, the story gives everyone a chance to be comical, but in a way that make sense and allows for both Thor and Loki to finish their character arcs and accept who they are. It also introduces some new characters that will hopefully reoccur in future movies; Tessa Thompson plays Valkyrie, a drunk former defender of Asgard and Director Taika Waititi motion captures Korg, a freedom fighter made of rocks. It's actually pretty amazing, in retrospect, how it manages to legitimately include so many characters without making any of it feel forced. The music is also fantastic, from both the 80's inspired Synth score and the use of licenced songs. It looks amazing too, one of the best looking films of the MCU. Sakaar and Asgard are very different Alien worlds but both look fantastic. The fight scenes are all terrific, logical and well shot.So why not a perfect score. Like most comedies, it's not as funny the second time around and much of Ragnorok is based around surprises and cameo's which obviously have less impact the second time. In light of Infinity War too, the film takes on a more bittersweet conclusion.Ragnorok is a brilliant addition to the MCU and really shows the potential that they have to fully exploring other film genres, whilst remaining a ""superhero"" film.

A great Thor film!,"'Thor Ragnarok' is the third Thor movie, and it's a great Thor film, arguable the best. The serious tone of the previous 2 films are disregarded in favor of a more comedic 'Guardians of the Galaxy' style. Thankfully this movie still feels like Thor and actually concludes the trilogy with Thor and Loki's relationship wrapping up in this one and giving a satisfying conclusion to the brothers arc. This movie gives a really good version of the Hulk who is very fun. This movie is overall just fun and that's all it really needed. The villain in this film is Hela who is a fun villain but like most of the Marvel villains, she is quite lackluster and dull. The scenes where Thor is on Sakaar are the best scenes in the movie, but the scenes on Asgard are quite dull and you don't want to stay there for long. The comedy is excellent and it's on of the funniest Marvel movies ever. It's villain is generic, it's plot is straightforward, the chemistry between actors is what helps this movie get off the ground, the fight scenes are brilliant. and the acting is spectacular. Highly recommend this one.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

This film was pure gold(blum),"It is one of those marvellous films that place no strain on your focus because it is relentlessly entertaining. It still looks very much like a marvel film but has somehow managed to achieve a superb balance of combining the dry humoured, quirky identity of a smaller Waititi film with the large marvel proportions. There seemed to be a different comedic set up in each scene almost like a sketch show and in general the film felt almost more like a comedy then an action film in terms of genre. It was really great to see Chris Hemsworth showing his skills as a comedy actor and it wasn't just down to the moments of genius within the written dialogue as Hemsworth shows he has a really funny instinct and great use of physical humour. A great quality of the film too was how meta and self deprecating the characters where and it gave the villains in particular more depth. This was particularly in the case of 'Hella' (Cate Blanchett). Hellas darkness and power are presented alongside moments that ridicule her failed attempts to demand respect. The film also uses its special effects in a spectacularly creative ways. When Hellas Hair turns to horns it is a beautifully fluid action that for some reason caused certain people in the screen I was in to exclaim ""GO KATE"" I don't think they necessarily thought it was the actress's personal skill, but I understand the sentiment. her whole performance was great! there is something about her which really commands your full focus whenever she is on screen. My only criticism would be I would have liked to have seen more Blanchet. I also really felt with this film that the SciFi moments where constructed with great tangibility. Everything in this film looked touchable and correctly weighted which is rare for a glossary high CGI Blockbuster. There is a visually interesting scene taking place in a festival for the Hulk and everything looked like a real life spectacle and yet had the convincing feel of a far away planet. I think what Waititi proves with this film is that he is very accomplished as an action director as well as with comedy as he uses the action sequences to showcase his creative ingenuity. In a flash back scene the texture of the action is that of an old dramatic oil painting in which a fight involving the Valkyries is taking place. The dramatic lighting design in this scene beautifully impressive.

Fun to watch but tries too hard to be funny,"Thor Ragnarok has all of the things you would expect in a super hero / comic adaptation. Stunning visuals, larger than life characters and humour. Perhaps not in the amounts you would expect though.I started off enjoying the movie a lot. Great action. Great cameos from beloved actors. Great visual effects. Great humour. More humour. And more humour. By the time it got to the middle of the film it felt like they were really over-doing the humour. Plenty of humour worked well in the Guardians of the Galaxy movies which always had a bit of a 'cartoonish' feel to them. But the movies centred around the avengers crew in the past, while having liberal doses of humour, were essentially serious action films. Perhaps it's because the guardians are now being brought in to the main Marvel Cinematic universe but I don't think the same tone that works in their movies really works with Thor / Avengers etc.If almost felt less like a superhero movie and more like a Pixar or Dreamworks animated feature. And some of the minor characters (like Korg) certainly would have seemed more at home in an animated feature.When it comes down to it, I found it to be an enjoyable movie but only if I didn't think too hard about it.

The director delivers a true action comedy. What Taika Waititi does with Thor: Ragnarok? It shatters all those hopes in the most hilarious way possible.,"Thor is one of the icons of the Marvel shared universe, being the second hero presented by Marvel, in a first film with a good dose between humor and family conflicts. His sequence was better in terms of action, but it was marked by having an uninspired script, a much more somber tone and a disappointing villain. Since then, the Thunder God has participated in the first two Avengers and has not won another adventure as a protagonist, until now. This third film of the hero brings a completely new tone and is free to not worry about practically not maintaining connections with Earth's plots, being able to plunge headlong into the development of this cosmic world, with extreme freedom and courage.For this new phase 3 adventure, Marvel Studios hired New Zealand director Taika Watiti, from the great What We Do in the Shadows (2014) and Rick Baker's Amazing Adventure (2016), which focus on comedy and achieve excellent results. The director does not act as a screenwriter on this project, but has a direct influence on the creative decisions of the direction of the text created by Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle and Christopher L. Yost, absurdly raising the initial potential of the story.
Here, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is trapped on the other side of the universe. He must race against time to return to Asgard and stop Ragnarok, the destruction of his world, which is in the hands of the powerful and relentless villain Hela (Cate Blanchett).
The plot begins with Thor explaining to the viewer that after the events of 'Age of Ultron', he went through the universe in search of the Jewels of Infinity, but found none. Then he went on a journey of death and destruction until he found himself in the cave of the fire demon Surtur. Right in these first sequences, we can notice the style of jokes much more acid and, still a brief explanation of what the Ragnarok was about. We still see an incredible action sequence between Thor and Sutur and dozens of his followers. The action, jokes and boldness in the camera frames would be just a prelude to the whole rhythm of the two hours ahead. It's ten minutes that already leaves the viewer waiting for a unique experience.We also have Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) when the brothers Thor and Loki come to Earth in search of their father, Odin. This scene is an extended version of the one shown in the credits of Doctor Strange (2016) and it is excellent to see the interaction of the brothers with the Doctor showing their magical exploits in a more than special participation. In this part of the brothers on Earth we also learn that the relationship between Thor and Jane is over and we see the brothers' final encounter with Odin, who reveals that he has a firstborn, Hela, the Goddess of Death, who is arriving after his imminent death, to cause Ragnarok (end of Asgard, end of time).After a confrontation between the brothers and Hela, we see that Thor ends up in Sakaar where he is captured by a waste picker (Tessa Thompson) who was, in the past, a Valkyrie - an elite force of warriors from Asgard. There, he meets the Grand Master (Jeff Goldblum), a creator of Sakaar and the tournament of champions. The actor is one of the great successes of the film with his slow pace of speech and the joking treatment he has with everyone around him makes the character remarkable. We still have Korg (voice of Taika Waititi), of the Kronan race, another great comic highlight. All the grandeur of the character combined with the calm voice and accent of the production director, who also lends a voice to the character, are part of the most hilarious scenes in the production.One of the main moments in the feature is the Tournament of Champions, which Thor is obliged to participate in and beat the champion of the Grand Master to gain freedom. That's when he finds out that the champion everyone is referring to is the Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo). With the confirmation of the Hulk, elements of the story arc of the ""Planet Hulk"" comics were adapted for Ragnarok. The fight between them in the arena and the subsequent interactions between them is formidable, where Hulk, this time, is more evolved being able to think and is able to hold a conversation, although he is still angry all the time. When Hulk turns into Bruce Banner, the fun gets even bigger. Finally, Mark Ruffalo has a chance to have plenty of space on the scene and shines like Hulk and Banner, being responsible for sharp dialogues and priceless scenes.One of the dynamics that works most is the interaction between the members of the new group of ""avengers"" formed by Thor, Loki, Valkyrie and Hulk, who come together to try to save Asgard from Ragnarok. The whole phase of adapting to the new reality, forced exile and the complete lack of perspective on returning and defending the kingdom is marked by good humor. Nobody philosophizes, nobody questions their own nature. Everyone is there for the journey, for the joke, for the entertainment. Without the burden of questioning or developing concepts, Ragnarok allows himself to make mistakes and get it right - in obscene, childish, sarcastic or long jokes, in casting choices and even in exaggerated looks. Speaking of visual, Sakaar's construction - where more than half of the plot takes place - is as bold as the visuals of the 'Guardians of the Galaxy' planets and galaxies. The city is different, colorful, modern, high tech, rustic, wild, chaotic and lawless, all at the same time. There, we can still see several different races and the most different and curious beings. The visual conception of that place as a whole is deliberately exaggerated and daring, which is not a problem. High tech luminous weapons, spaceships and air chase scenes are pure fun and bring many references from the 'Star Wars' saga, which is a delight for those who love the most genuine science fiction. Visually, Watiti paid tribute to ""King"" Jack Kirby. The director, along with the production design team, used and abused straight lines, geometric symbols and hypersaturated colors.In Asgard, Thor and his newly formed team star in incredible scenes against the army and the giant wolf Fenris reborn by the Eternal Flames, highlighting the fight between Hulk and Fenris and the rebirth of Surtur to fulfill the prophecy. The whole final part is grand and exciting, but the film also has flaws. While Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. II finds the ideal balance between weight and lightness, Thor: Ragnarok is in a questionable back-and-forth. The emergence of Hela (Cate Blancett) is not necessarily problematic - the threat is felt and Blancett's choice was right - but there remains the constant sensation of two films completely different from one another, packaged in a single production. The narrative ties of one block to another could have been better resolved. Asgard is the scene of the dominion of the Goddess of Death over a people on the verge of extinction. Without any of that, Sakaar is ... indescribable.Also drinking from the adventures of the galactic team, Ragnarok brings pop songs on his soundtrack, masterfully fitting Led Zeppelin's ""Immigrant Song"" in two scenes and ""In the Face of Evil"" by the synthwave group Magic Sword. Taika Watiti proves to be one of the most creative minds in Hollywood and adds features still unheard of in the arc of Thor's story, being definitely the best in the hero's trilogy. The director delivers a true action comedy, supported by the great supporting cast. The fans therefore yearned for a work worthy of being featured in Odin's son. An epic about Norse mythology, with great battles, huge armies and a lot of seriousness. What does Taika Waititi do with Thor: Ragnarok? It shatters all those hopes in the most hilarious way possible.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
My favorite Marvel film,"Thor shines as the most comical Avenger, especially in scenes with Mark Ruffalo. And I love diving into Norse mythology. It's colorful, fantasy driven, and action packed. Really fun movie! Hemsworth is finally properly utilized for his comedy chops.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"A big ""hulk-smash"" to Thor 2","A much better follow-up from the disappointing Thor: The Dark World (how it got an IMDb average score of 7/10 is still puzzling!). Here, we see the emotional and psychological impact of our hero in a meaningful way!I watched Thor 3 in IMAX 3D with Laser and it was mind-blowing. This resulted in images projected by Dual Projectors on the giant 42 feet high, 65 feet wide screen of IMAX (no cuts in the screen at all!), along with 12000 watts IMAX proprietary sound system that will make your hairs stand each time you see Thor and Hulk fight! The 3D was unnecessary, though.I felt it was a refreshing take on the superhero genre and here it still applies. We always get that story where we find out the reason behind why a hero takes the path again. We've seen it many times with the likes of Batman, Spider-man, etc. but here we see this again in a different manner. This is the main point in this movie and really make you root for the superhero!What's also great here is the director of Green Lantern and story writers are not dwindling on too much on what happened in Thor: The Dark World and the story is progressing using the theme to Thor & Avenger's over the trilogy's second installment.Verdict: The important lesson is to get back up again, no matter how much you lost! My digital score: 7.5/10 More luck for Marvel's next outing!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Too many jokes,"Every 2 minutes they put a joke, if you remove all the funny parts of the movie you will be leave with as much as a half an hour of pure bad jokes. Also the jokes are for a public of children, like when you hit with something and that makes a child laugh, that is what this movie is.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
How can you not love this film,"The funnest movie I've been to in 20 years maybe. Immigrant song scenes were awesome. The action, the humor, the acting, the ridiculousness, the not taking itself to seriously The villains, the dialogue ,everything is in balance. Maybe the best marvel film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Somewhat disappointed.,"I love Norse mythology and the Thor movies but I feel the ruined this movie by having Hela as Odin's firstborn instead of having her as Loki's child as she is in the myths. Also they had Hela and Fenris. But where was Jormundgandr aka ""The Midgard Serpent""?",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Very good but walks a fine comedic line,"Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this movie. Just about all the acting is top notch and it's, well fun. But there is an aspect that you see sometimes in Hollywood, generally when actors get too much input, of ""top this"" or ""I want a funny line too!"". In short, it borders on being to comedic for its own good.But only borders. Overall, the movie manages to walk the line pretty well. Every once in a while I thought I was watching the actor and not the character. But only rarely. I especially enjoyed Jeff Goldblum who was actually pleasantly understated when he had a chance to go way over the top (in a bad way) Regardless, and in spite of Marvel's shameless mangling of Norse mythology, it's good time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
