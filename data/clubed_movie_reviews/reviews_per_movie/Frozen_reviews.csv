Fun and adventurous,A great Disney princess movie filled with wonderful songs and a great story with a pretty shocking twist that I honestly never saw coming.,7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Definitely Understand the Hype,"The Good: Back in 2013, Frozen became a bona fide phenomenon, on the level that I honestly can't recall for an animated movie. Watching this 8 years later as a grown adult, I can say that I totally understand why this movie became a phenomenon.Frozen has three big things going for it...the songs, the characters and the interesting subversion of tropes. I personally don't *love* all of them, but the musical numbers give the movie a bouncy, fun vibe. The characters are lovable and well written; it's hard not to like SOMEONE here, if not the entire roster of characters.The Bad: I don't think the movie does a great job with establishing the central conflict. Despite the first portion of the movie covering it, by the time the movie gets into it, I just didn't buy the relationship between Anna and Elsa until the halfway mark of the movie. Anna's motivations are quite poor and while I get that we wouldn't have a movie without this central conflict, it could have been communicated with a bit more patience.This might also be a nitpick, but I also felt the environment lacked a real presence; Arendelle sort of gave me ""Asgard"" vibes, which means: devoid of people, we move on from it too fast and it doesn't feel like a living breathing world. Maybe it's the cold setting, but I prefer my fantasy worlds to be brimming with life and character.The Ugly: Yeah, it's good. I still think Let It Go is a bit overrated and I've definitely seen better looking animated films, but Frozen is a solid movie and fun for the whole family.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Some People take things WAY too seriously!,"This is really a lovely, enjoyable cartoon. And it's just that a lovely, enjoyable cartoon. And basically a fairy tale. One that moms and dads can feel happy to take their children too. Let it be that. Is there anything truly remarkable about it? Probably not. Are the songs particularly inventive or that much different from all the countless other Disney movies? No, not really, but they are catchy and pretty and fit the movie. And the ""In Summer"" song with the snow man in summer is pretty cute, if not a little jarringly placed! But, catchy.Having said that, some people on these reviews are taking this way too seriously. Why would you give it one star just because other people liked it enough to give it a 10? Is that too show how much smarter you are than everyone else? It really shows nothing but taking a carton movie too seriously instead of just going with the flow. It's not real. It's not a real story. It's a cartoon fairy tale.I give it an 8. It's not perfect but I enjoyed it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Message of the movie is Love.,Frozen is a heartwarming movie. With a fantastic animation and ofcourse Elsa&Anna and Olaf who makes it fun to watch. I've seen several times with my kids and they still think it's a good movie.,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Very Unique,"A great film that fits in the category of The Lion King, Aladdin, Tarzan, Snow White, Pocahontas and The Little Mermaid. I love that they used Norwegian culture and so beautifully in it.

The directorial,"The directorial duo managed to make another Disney animated film an event. Thanks to the fact that they shared the responsibilities very well, they managed to develop a simple story through characters, music, humor and soul that goes into all the projects of this company.The script, which began with Andersen's fairy tale, quickly turns into a disparate block. The writers use only a dramatic basis, which they turn into a completely different story. A distinctive feature of any Disney project has always been not plots, but the subtle skill of artists, the ability of screenwriters to create images, their ability to balance on the border between sad and funny.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

10/10,"In general all the Disney movies are the same, the princesses go through almost the exact same thing. But this one is different. I think it's more mature and more complex. It's about self- love and self- discovery. I think it's a great movie. It made me shed a tear. I re-watch it every year. Have the same chills everytime.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
I like warm hugs too,"Story of two princesses. The eldest, Elsa, becomes queen but she has snow powers for some reason...I guess she was born that way. So she's kind of sad about that. The younger is Anna and she's the goofy but lovably cute girl movies have told us time and again are the best kind. The two sisters argue and Elsa uses her powers in front of everybody. This freaks them out so Elsa runs away. The bulk of the plot is about Anna trying to find her sister and bring her home.Frozen is a good movie but not a great one. It's very loosely adapted from Hans Christian Andersen's ""The Snow Queen."" The theme of sisterly love is nice but the movie didn't really spend a lot of time building that up. It seems like it's there at the beginning and at the end but the middle is made up of focus on other characters. Most of the movie plays out like a rehash of tried & true Disney tropes mixed with clichés from romantic comedies. There's nothing inherently wrong with that and it does work for the most part. The snowman character is the most entertaining but he seems entirely tacked on to the plot. The music is OK if a little too Broadway for my tastes. The animation is very nice. The voicework pretty good. It's not a bad movie and I'm sure kids and young women will like it even more than I did.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
I loved it,"Frozen has great animation, an excelent story, emotions in it, great songs and score not to forget and it has lovely characters with two sisters. It's in the same catagory as the Lion King, a true Disney classicer!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Great Visuals, Unremarkable Script","First of all, I strongly disagree with any assertions that Frozen hearkens back to the great Disney films of the late 80s and early 90s. The music is nowhere near that level, and the storytelling is not nearly as sharp. Even suggesting that this is the best *since* The Lion King rings false with me. I have not seen every Disney film of the past twenty years, but offhand I can say that Tangled, Bolt and Meet the Robinsons are all far superior examples well-written stories than Frozen. In my personal opinion, of course.Second of all, Frozen definitely skews towards the younger crowd, with little to none of the sophisticated touches or wittily mature humor that have come to be somewhat more commonplace in recent animated films. This one is aimed at the pre-teen crowd. Not that that is necessarily a bad thing, but it is worth noting.The overall story is an interesting one, but the execution is rather sloppy and the narrative meanders a bit too much. The dialog, in particular, is not a strength. Unlike the best films, in which every line and every scene feels both essential and perfect, Frozen is more of a loose joyride. Again, there is nothing inherently wrong with that approach, but in my personal estimation, it earns lower marks as a storytelling method.The songs are for the most part unremarkable, and some of the musical sequences suffer from not fully committing to dialog or singing. They just feel hastily-choreographed and not fully thought out. And do not even get me started on the troll song. Yikes.Two of the songs, ""Do You Want to Build a Snowman"" and especially ""Let it Go,"" do work very well. The latter ties into what is unquestionably the best scene in the film on every level. It provides the one glimpse of true majesty, the sort of quality that would explain all of the extremely positive ""this is the greatest"" reviews that are being posted by others. Unfortunately, the film descends most of the way back into mediocrity after that scene.On the positive front, however, Frozen offers a fantastic, gorgeous take on the visual elements of winter. Deep blue ice, snowflakes, white mountains contrasting with colored skies. It is an unspeakably lovely display of a subject matter than CGI animation has never (in my experience) turned its energies to before, at least not like this. Of course, it goes without saying that all of the animation in Frozen, characters and landscapes alike, is excellent.For me, Tangled was much more satisfying than Frozen. I applaud Disney for honing their CGI skills, and for finally adapting The Snow Queen to screen. I just wish that they would have spent more time on the script.With films like this one, a distinction needs to be made between loving it for the visceral takeaway (""it was sweet""/""it had a great message""/""it made me feel good"") and looking at it from a critical standpoint. Now, I understand that one needs to just ""forget about being critical"" and enjoy a film - for me, the best films take care of that themselves. It is the ones, like Frozen, that seem like they clearly could have been much better, that get me thinking about just that.This film is a fun one for kids, and great to look at for adults, but it is far short of being great, or a masterpiece. More focus on an truly excellent story, and it might have been.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Loved it.,"Loved this movie very much. Watched it so many times. I could relate to Elsa so much with the fears she felt, the pain she has and living with a trauma for so long living with the what if all the time the running of when her powers got reveald. And got strongen at the end of the movie. Loved that she has icepowers but is still very human, best queen ever. Good songs especially Let it go, do you want to build a snowman and For the first time in forever.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Good cartoon,"Animation - that's why you can praise the ""Frozen"" for a long time and hard, because from a technical point of view and visually there is complete order (not counting a couple of small shoals that do not play a big role). After all, animation is a long and painstaking business. This is not a movie where you were filmed on camera and repeated several times if you didn't like something. Snowflakes, snow-covered expanses, weather effects, characters, environment, magic, atmosphere - all this is clearly done with love.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Good characters (most of them) but with a bad story,"I have very mixed feelings about this movie and Ive never known how to feel about it, when I first watched I hated it and thought it was the worst movie ever made, but then I rewatched it again and it wasnt that bad, but still not great. On one hand I really love Elsa and Anna and I do think they are really good disney princesses and I enjoy all the moments when they are on screen together or alone. But on the other hand, christoff (I have no idea how you write his name) and a lot of other characters are really forgettable for me and I feel they do little to nothing in the story; but Olaf is another different story, I absolutely hate him, I cant stand him, I think hed super annoying and I wish he melted due to the sun. The story is just OK for me and is very meh, but the ending and revelation of true love was a nice change. Overall I would only rewatch this movie for anna and elsa but nothing more.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Amazing movie for all ages! For the first time in forever....... Frozen,"Amazing movie. It has everything fantastic story(rememberable), amazing music/score, amazing characters(where you can recognize yourself in), emotions and a very beautiful animation. A very good movie you will watch more then 10 times for all ages. Only just a shame about the unnecessary, redundant sequel that takes everything down and ruins all the nice characters!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Let the storm range on!,"Walt Disney is one of, if not, the most popular animation studio of all time.Everyone has watched at least one Disney movie in their life, and today's review is going to be about their highest grossing animated movie of all time (outside of it's sequel and the remake of Lion king).The story is loosely based on Hans Christian Andersen's Snow queen and is set in the Kingdom of Arendelle. There were 2 young princesses - Anna and Elsa, the latter one had snowy magical powers who sadly led the former's life to no good, thus separating the two when they were kids. Years passed, and Elsa has her coronation ceremony, and Anna meets her love at first sight - Prince Hans. When Anna asks her older sister to engage them, she says that you can't marry a man that you just met (and she was right actually). Sadly the princess and the queen argue and Elsa freezes her kingdom on accident. As a result, Anna has to go to the north mountain to return her sister back. On her way, she meets Kristoff, a man who works on the lake to sell ice, his reindeer pet Sven who adores carrots and a lovely snowman Olaf who loves warm hugs.Like most Disney movies, this is a musical and has 10 songs in total. Of course we can't talk about this movie without mentioning Let it go performed by Idina Menzel and Demi Lovato. It's a song about escaping from the sad past and being free! This song won an Oscar for best original song and I can see why. My favorite song other then let it go has to be for the first time in forever performed by Kristen bell. It's a very happy one where Anna is so excited for the coronation because finally the gates have open. The sad thing is that unlike let it go, it doesn't have it's pop music counterpart, which could be performed by either Selena Gomez or Miley Cyrus or even Taylor swift (Because the first 2 were working on Disney channel with Demi back in late 2000s). Other songs include In summer, Love is an open door, Reindeers are better than people, fixer upper and do you want to build a snowman are also great, each in their own way. The only exception is the first song, it's not terrible and it's actually ok as it's own song, but comparing it to others, it's easily the weakest in my opinion (the one where Kristoff is a kid doing the ice work and men singing about cold winter)
As for the characters, each one is important. With the two sisters, Elsa is the one who didn't have the best childhood, as she had to keep her powers under control otherwise she may hurt someone. As for Anna, she's the complete opposite of her sister because she's very optimistic and naive in the contrast of Elsa's seriousness and anxiety. Anna believes in love and that she can fix anything, she's also a little bit stubborn, because listening to others isn't exactly her thing, thus preferring to do things her own way. Kinda reminds me of Rapunzel from Tangled. Olaf is easily the cutest Disney sidekick ever created. He's a little snowman who dreams about summer and adores warm hugs. Kristoff is one of Anna's friends she meets and he's a little bit pessimistic, but still helpful on her journey. Also Hans is the guest from the southern islands who really likes Anna and tries to take care of the town while she's gone. But I won't tell you what happens to him afterwards, because if I do, it may ruin a surprise for you. There are also secondary characters including Duke of Weaseltown (or Wesseltown), Oaken the salesman, the rock trolls and a giant snowman named Marshmallow. Not as memorable as the main ones, but still very important.Last things last, let's talk about it's animation. It's absolutely beautiful. There's lot's of details in every chunk of ice, in every piece of clothing and even a strand of hair. The backgrounds are gorgeous to look at, especially during winter scenes! The designs are great too. It stays true to both Disney and Norwegian styles, which makes this film stand out from the rest. The ice castle that Elsa created is probably the best element of the animation, it took somewhere from 5 to 9 months to animate 15 seconds of it's building, which is astounding in my opinion.The best thing I can say about it is that this is Disney's greatest film since the lion king and truly deserves the title of the best animated feature of 2013. I recommend it to everyone who hasn't seen this masterpiece, especially Disney fans and young girls. But I think even people outside the demographic will appreciate it too. A must see movie!The cold never bothered me anyway!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Deserves the Oscar,"Frozen is a blast of a movie with hilarious moments, dark meaning and emotional message. You will cry, laugh and feel amazing after watching this Oscar deserving movie. With some of the best spontaneous singing I've seen in Disney, this musical movie is also a pleasure to your mouse ears. This is probably the best animated movie I've seen this year, simply marvelous and excellent. The Disney familiar concepts of love and bravery are demonstrated, as well as kindness, determination, the horrors of your fears and stress and the meaning of ""true love"". This movie is guaranteed to make you crack as smile with the hilarious little snowman called ""Olaf"", who is probably my favorite character in the movie. A bit darker than most Disney films, it will also touch and amuse even teenagers. This movie has the same kind of humor as the last movie from these creators, Wreck-it Ralph (which is also one of my Disney favorites, explaining why I love this one). Disney really over did themselves with this one!",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Best movie ever!,"For me the best movie ever. I just love Queen Elsa. The growth she has made from a fearful girl to a very strong woman is amazing. She lived for so long with guild and fear after she nearly killed Anna with her powers. And learned the wrong lesson, why when her powers were exposed she decided quickly that running away from her country was de best option to not hurt anyone with it because she was learned to conceal it not control it. Could not grieve for her parents when they died because there were to much people out there . I felt for her throughout the film. The emotion you feel through the film is really beautiful and the story is perfect. En there were good lessons in it. Let is go and Do you want to build a snowman are my favorites songs. Most of the characters were amazing too. I wished we could have seen more of her father, Prince Hans, the castle, Arendelle and get to know Kristoff background story.For me the trolls have always been your bad guys because of their story Elsa became afraid to hurt someone, her parents thought it better to keep her powers a secret, Elsa and Anna didn't grow up together and all 4 of them were damaged.My least favorite character is still Anna she came across to me as very desperate, said yes to someone she just met, leaves that person who she just met in charge over the country instead of her own staff!, is very naive, argued unnecessarily with Elsa and while she was with Hans was after they fell off the mountain"" in love"" with Kristoff?! Maybe that's why her became evil, he knew of felt it?But ido feel bad for her that still no one told her about the accident when they were kids.I've always wondered what would have happened if Anna hadn't argued with Elsa at the party or When Elsa said: go away and Anna left with Hans how the movie would have gone then ;).For me this movie is underrated but haters gonna hate.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

For the first time in forever a true Disney classic is realized,"When people speak of their favorite Disney movies, the big four of the Renaissance and films of the Golden Age of animation are likely to be mentioned. The past decade has seen Disney movies that were hit or miss. Some considered classics, some forgotten and some close to being classics but not there yet. Frozen changes this dynamic and creates a full fledged classic. Frozen IS not just a classic, it is THE Disney classic of the decade. It could position itself up there with the best of them. Disney returns to its roots with a vengeance. The best animated film of the past few years in my opinion.The story is heart melting, filled with the pure feeling and heart that has become a staple with the best Disney movies. It is a moving story that has family at its center. It is unpretentious in what it is trying to portray. The comedy hits right on the mark and the action packed adventure and thrilling journey make this a tale with a little bit of everything in the exact right amounts. It is a daring movie that is laugh out loud at the some moments and stunning and provoking at others. All achieved in balance. A true triumph in story telling that proves exactly what Disney does best and again proving that they are back to producing top quality films. This is an affecting human story, one that is significant.Startling and stunning, beautifully envisioned, emotionally powerful and relevant. Gorgeous visuals, stunning backdrops and intricacies like you have never seen before. The environments, the costumes, the character movements among other things make this film a gigantic step forward. The brilliant voice talents that breath life into this project need to be applauded and then some. The cast consisting of Kristen bell (Veronica Mars) and Idina Menzel(Wicked!)among many others bring winning charm, superior voice acting and magnificent vocals as well as heart to this tale. The sensational wit and humor, the arrays of different personalities, their emotions, their triumphs and falls make them some of the most interesting characters that people can relate to and some of the best i have seen in animation. The cast fully become the characters.The score and music is perfect. The score is grand. The sound, the texture, the harmony, the melody is in a class of its own. Above and beyond anything attempted by the animation studio in the past decade. I would place the songs up there with those of the 90's movies and 2000's Enchanted. A true all round musical triumph. Songs that will be stuck in your mind and you will be humming them and you won't even know it. And some you will be belting out at the top of your lungs because they are that good. Songs that progress the story and an essential part of it.So you have meticulously crafted breath taking animation, an affecting tale of the bond of family, romance, hilarious wit and humor courtesy of the characters especially sweet Olaf and heart stopping adventure. A true fairy tale that i would say could very well be The Little Mermaid or The Beauty and The Beast of this generation.FROZEN has that Disney MAGIC that has been missing for so long and it comes in full force here.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Best animation ever!,"A heartwarming film with positive messages. It teaches you that true love is stronger than fear and loneliness. And that running away is no solution to your problems.

The characters handsome Prince Hans, mountaineer Kristoff, his faithful reindeer Sven and of course our snowman Olaf.

Forgettable,"*SPOILER ALERT*The only thing that stood out in this movie was the stunning visuals. Unfortunately, stunning visuals alone do not a good movie make. The songs were all too alike and not catchy at all in my opinion, not to mention their lack of strong vocals. I grew up watching movies like Beauty and the Beast and the Lion King with musicians such as Celine Dion and Elton John contributing to their scores. I won't be rushing out to buy the soundtrack any time soon! Another way 'Frozen' contrasts with these classics was the lack of a truly dark and evil villain. Only at the end of the film were we introduced to the antagonist and I felt he was little more than just a misguided jerk who at times could be quite likable (a charming prince). Finally, I thought that some of the adult 'humour' that was added to the movie was unnecessary and not very funny at all. I can laugh (and have laughed) along with many a children's' movie where there was no obvious attempt at adult jokes. A movie that is similar to 'Frozen' that had better music, a better villain and funnier humour is 'Tangled'.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Disney's Most Hackneyed Attempt Ever,"Reviewed by: Dare devil Kid (DDK) Rating: 1.5/5 starsThe worst Disney movie of all time, barring none - period. A contrived, manipulative, and trite attempt at being cute, cuddly, and melodramatic. Even the songs (barring one; the superbly rendered ""Let it Go"" number) - a hallmark of the Disney bastion - seem arbitrary, superfluous, and wantonly composed for lack of a better plot element.There was a time when Disney could seamlessly pull off the sweet and endearing musical routine without trying too hard. But off late, their recent offerings (excluding the terrific ""Wreck it Ralph"") desperately seem to be making an effort to induce us into believing that their characters are all too warm, fuzzy and want to perpetually break out into a musical jig for want of a better option.Disney's last few efforts might have just passed enough muster to be seen, forgiven, and forgotten soon after. Frozen has however, lowered the bar several notches below those easily forgivable and forgettable Disney outings.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Frozen Review,"Disney went back to its roots with this Princess movie, which most will enjoy, however I see it differently. If you are a die-hard Disney/Pixar movie fan, I don't think you will like this movie as much as the classic Disney/Pixar princess movies. I believe the humor in this movie abandoned the traditional styles used in Disney/Pixar movies. While most youngsters will like the non- subtle, more obvious form of humor in this movie (see character Olaf), die-hard fans might not agree with it. This is, for the most part, an enjoyable movie. But I do feel Disney could have put more work into the subtext, making it a deeper, more enjoyable film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
about film,"Sister support, when you are so different and have not communicated since childhood, when you lost your parents, is extremely important.

"Not all you've heard but still enjoyable even though the musical aspect is a bit too Glee ""big smiles, lots of teeth"" showy for me","It was late in 2013 when Frozen came out and it was a year later when I finally got to watch it, although it did not feel like it was a film that had come out so long ago because it does seem to be everywhere: endless DVDs of it in homes with children, songs on CD in cars for children, sing-along versions released into cinemas for this Christmas, and many other things that make it feel very recent and relevant. This success is hard to put to one side, but I did, and I did not go into Frozen expecting it to be the film that so many fans claim it is; which is the right way to go because this is not the perfect film some claim, even if it is really quite good in many areas.The plot is one of them. The film starts a little awkwardly as we are introduced to two sisters, one of whom has magic ice powers, the other does not – we are asked to go with this and the events that follow because they set up the plot. Once over these rushed establishing scenes, the film settles down to be a story of two sisters; the romantic threads involving men are of course a big part of the story, but mostly it is about these two female characters – they are the leads and the story revolves around them rather than who they may or may not love. I like this as a theme and I also liked that it wasn't done as a overreaction – with male characters or any romantic subplot rejected, just that the writing was balanced and felt natural.The story plays out well. I was surprised that the comedy was lighter than I had expected, with fewer laughs throughout the film, mostly from Olaf. As a musical I could see why the songs and the setpieces have been so popular, but also why they didn't work for me so well. There is a real sense of Glee (the show, not the emotion) in all the songs and performances, with several of the bigger numbers reminding me of the type of things you see on America's Got Talent and shows of that ilk. This makes for big showy numbers, but also feels a tad over the top for my taste; catchy and ""big"" for sure, but very specific to what they are doing. They worked though, and I didn't feel they were out of place in the film, just had to admit that they were not really to my preference.In the end it stands as an enjoyable film, with a good blend of story, musical numbers, action, and comedy. Is it as good as the popularity since release suggests? Probably not, but for the limitations of what it does, it does still work.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Why I had a problem with Frozen.,Okay so from the previews I also came to this realization and that's why I did not go see it in the movie theaters. And maybe this would have taken away from the movie but here's what I think should have happened. I really wanted to see both of the sisters end up with someone or be left with the idea of someone at least for Elsa. Now I know that's cheesy but they could have had the prince stay good for the entire movie and then either have him stay with Anna or go with Elsa although I do think Kristoff would have been a better match for Elsa at some moments. They could have made the focus and message still that love will unfreeze the coldest heart. Also with how much Elsa had to give up by staying away from her sister and then losing her parents I really think she out of both of them could have used a love interest. Maybe I'm just sappy but that is why I won't purchase this movie. I think especially in Disney movies everyone who is close to the central character deserves to find love.,7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Ana character is very lovely, story is...","The weak point of animation is close up. Close up in live actor's action is very effective in description of the change in the emotion of the person. Surprise, sadness, shock and no expression. The close up expression of the characters directly affects to the audience's heart. That's because it is a real human face, so it won't be effective in anime.
But 3D seems a little different. The delicate expression of Ana is very well expressed, and when you look at her face, you will naturally like her. The personality, facial expression and voice are very good in harmony. I think that is the reason that this movie made great hit.The bad point is that her older sister's suffering is not well described. The writers had to think of a more effective episode and convey her suffering well to the audience. When she jumps out of the castle and the famous song begins, but I'm not the only one who felt that the part was so sudden and premature in the story.
But if you want to write that part well, it will probably take time. The main character of this movie is not her, so the writers want to avoid it. That's why it went wrong.
So it was a work that was not great a whole, but since the idea of the last was good, it became a shining work. Namely, the love is not only love of men and women. That part was good, impressive. Well, movies are all good when it's the last scene is good. So this movie is slippery safe and got a passing score.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Magical beautiful animation,"Even though it's been 8 years since this movie was released, it's still a great animation. I like the family theme they used in this movie.

Disjointed but mostly enjoyable animation which is undeserved of its praise.,"At the core of ""Frozen"" are lessons on responsibility and how power requires both a calm head and tremendous care. It is also the perfect film for two young sisters to sit down and absorb together, and not just because kids will like the bouncy songs and the funny snowman, but because its central relationship is between two sisters. This is, as far as I'm aware, quite rare - lots of Disney films have of course depicted the tales of princesses, but central to this particular effort is the friendship between two children (eventually young women) who share a blood kinship. The film is designed, it would therefore seem, to impart the message that things do not always go according to plan in families (nor in love), but that they are ultimately worth sticking at.""Frozen"" begins in the setting of Arendelle, a fictitious and seemingly Scandinavian kingdom set what appears to be many centuries ago - it depicts Elsa (Kristen Bell) and Anna (Idina Menzel), who are daughters to a royal family and they live in a palace. For reasons unexplained, young Elsa possesses the very X-Men-like magical ability to turn anything into a wintry, snowy object. This leads to the rendering of playtime with her younger sister Anna a little more exciting than it might ordinarily be, with snowball fights and large slippery ice flumes around the huge interior rooms they occupy being the order of the day.Elsa is heir to the crown, but is considered too dangerous to be around her sister for fate of nearly killing her with her abilities. As a consequence, the girls are segregated against their will until both are old enough to identify with a degree of maturity. By the time this arrives, their parents are dead and Elsa is due to inherit the throne.The years spent apart have forged the girls into two binaries where previously they were one-and-alike, foreshadowing the divide in the family which initiates the film's main body. Anna can barely contain her excitement, for the reason that she is on the cusp of being able to interact with other people at the ceremony and potentially even find a spouse. Elsa, on the other hand, is terrified of being let loose on the world - she isn't fully in control of her emotions. She came close to killing somebody once, and she may accidentally do it again...Something resembling this isn't too far from what unfolds, forcing a berserk Elsa off and away into the wilderness and Arendelle to resemble Narnia. The bulk of the film then comes to form Anna's trek to find rediscover her sibling and try to put things right, while a plot back home is hatched by an unscrupulous Duke who sees his chance to come into possession of the kingdom amidst what I can only describe as a constitutional crisis. En route, she meets an ice-trader named Kristoff (Jonathan Groff), who possesses the wisdom to see that Anna's falling in love with someone at first sight back at the coronation is silly, yet entrusts that reindeers make for better accomplices than people...The film is by no means a failure, but has a hard time balancing the two sisters as duel-protagonists and suffers as a consequence - there is a healthy degree of ambition in what directors Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck attempt, but it all too often feels like a bit of a weekend cartoon in need of some reigning in. To whom ""Frozen"" belongs remains a constant source of ambiguity - it is at once Anna's love story and yet it is Elsa's journey of self-discovery; both characters learn to control their emotions, but are not the primary focus for long enough for most of us to really ease ourselves into their respective stories, all of which leads me to the conclusion that the film is best viewed by young siblings (preferably sisters) who will be able to take something from either strand based on who is the eldest in that family.Certainly, the film looks good - the wintry setting has been brought to life wonderfully well and is certainly able to take its place alongside the likes of ""Wreck-It Ralph"" and ""Finding Nemo"" as an accomplishment of special effects whereby you are plunged into a world entirely different to our own. If I were to accuse the film of needing the character of Olaf (Josh Gad) to provide it with a bit of energy - even to keep it amusing - I imagine few would argue. If lacking in this magical, wise-cracking snowman, whom Anna meets along her way to confront Elsa, the film is not even necessarily funny, and takes on an entirely different complexion. Its songs, whilst on the receiving end of much praise, struck me as somewhat ordinary and too recurrent.Perhaps it is because I am not the target audience for the film that I could not take to it to any tremendous degree, but I do not consider myself shut off from animated films nor Disney's output generally - I left ""Frozen"" a little cold, and far from feeling the enthusiasm I have done for their past projects.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Don't Believe (All) the Hype,"Perhaps the biggest flaw of Disney's new musical, Frozen, is the music. More specifically, it's the songs. None of them are memorable, at least not in the same manner as those from films like Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King. The characters sing to cheesy percussion in songs that sound prepared more for the Disney Channel than a Disney movie. In one instance, a main character looks directly into the audience as she belts out her big tune. That was the moment that I realized the musical numbers were individual music videos tacked onto an otherwise fine film.And, really, there isn't a whole lot to complain about with Frozen. The animation is absolutely gorgeous. rivaling last year's Pixar offering, Brave, for the award for Best Animated Landscapes. It also goes a long way to distance itself from other animated films featuring a bored or discontent heroine who wants to be independent. In fact, the lessons of Frozen all involve selflessness and sacrifice, a welcome change after the narcissistic Brave.The story is a Disney retelling of Hans Christian Andersen's ""The Snow Queen,"" in which we find protective older sister Princess Elsa (Idina Menzel), who was born with the special power to conjure ice, distancing herself from younger sister Princess Anna (Kristen Bell) after a childhood accident forced their parents to hide Elsa's secret.Elsa's secret eventually comes to life when she is crowned queen, and in an attempt to isolate herself, she inadvertently covers the kingdom in perpetual winter. At that point, it is up to Anna, her fiancé Prince Hans, and hunky mountain man Kristoff to save the day.Frozen is brimming with excellent supporting characters, from a goofy Scandinavian sauna proprietor to the lovable living snowman Olaf (expertly voiced by Josh Gad). Olaf is easily the most enjoyable animated character since Dory in Finding Nemo, and like that character, the filmmakers use his comic relief only enough to balance out some of the drama. That is to say, Olaf never becomes Jar Jar Binks. They could have devoted the whole film to him and I would be a repeat viewer.Still, Disney's latest offering is far from perfect. Things wrap up far too easily after too much exposition at the beginning. Characters are introduced and barely heard from again (a magic group of trolls comes to mind). I have the feeling that without the radio-ready pop songs, more time could have been spent on fleshing out the margins of the story and providing an even more unique vision within the Disney universe. Menzel and Bell are perfectly pleasant in their voice work, but their huge duets spiral down into ""Dueling Vibratos.""It's good that Disney is tearing down its own ""princess"" stereotypes of late, and Frozen strikes the right balance of not making its heroines dependent upon anyone but each other. If only it could have found a way to reconcile its great characters with its mostly awful tunes, we may have held Frozen as one for the ages.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Highly recommended movie for kids!,"When the movie release, my family and i immediately went to watch this movie in the cinema. The cinema are full of children accompanied by their parents to watch this movie.It has a very meaningful message for everyone, which is the act of true love can be done by anyone. Frozen also has a very good animation, graphics, and very iconic character design that made it memorable for everyone who watched it.

Disney's Best in 20 years.,"A lot of people criticize Frozen for what it isn't. Their preferred setting, cast, etc. Not for what it is. It is an incredibly touching story with fantastic music, score, script and performances by Menzel and Bell we haven't heard in a long time. I took 117 nieces and nephews ages 18 months to 14 and not once did any of them get up to ' go to the bathroom' or get more snacks. Boys, girls were both drawn to the film the whole time. The younger kids responded more to Olaf than the thematics of it all.The story centers more on the sisters relationship than a romantic one and has a great message.

A decent and enjoyable movie for kids,"I've been a big Disney fan since I was a little girl. Sadly, I didn't see Frozen when it was in theaters. The main reason was I didn't really pay much attention to advertisement for the movie. After hearing how Frozen was getting reviews about how amazing it was, I bought the Blu- Ray/DVD/Digital Copy combo pack in April last year. When I watched the movie, I thought Frozen was a decent entry to the Disney library.My main problem with the movie is the storyline. Some parts were far- fetched like how the parents handled Elsa's powers after the accident. Separating the two sisters and isolating Elsa only caused her powers to get out of hand at times. At least, Anna and Elsa turned out just fine after a decade of barely seeing each other. The addition of Grand Pappie and the other rock trolls was ridiculous. The rock trolls add nothing to the story. Also, they could've explained how to handle Elsa's powers better which would've made things a lot easier for the royal family. I really hated the twist with the movie's villain. It was obvious that it was tacked on last minute.I do like Anna and Elsa a lot. They're both great princesses in their own right. On the other hand, they do make stupid decisions that make no sense. One example is Elsa just running away from her problems and singing about how she doesn't care about what others think and acts like an idiot when Anna comes to see her in the ice castle that she created. Also, Anna stupidly decides to marry a prince that she barely knows. Despite their stupid decisions, I still like the two sisters along with Olaf the snowman.The movie has beautiful animation like Tangled. It also has some great songs like Do You Want to Build a Snowman, For the First Time in Forever, and of course, Let It Go. Other songs should have been cut out like Fixer Upper because they add nothing to the story. I can't see how Frozen is anything like the movies from the Disney Renaissance era. It's good, but not that good. For a kid like me who grew up during the 1990's, it's hard to top movies like Aladdin, Lion King, and Mulan. Despite its flaws, I will still recommend Frozen to others.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Oscars for Animation landing finally on something worthy.,"Frozen – Magic in white all over the screen freezing the audience with exquisite beauty and winsomeness. The story is somewhat similar to the same 'First love's kiss + king and queen' concept just as in all the other animated movies where love and fantasy is involved. Although there is only a little difference to the story-line, it appeals to be somewhat different and beautiful given the sheer brilliance in animation with 'Elsa', the elder sister and queen drizzling the power and magnificence of an ice queen into the screen. Since last four years when Rango, Up and Brave were awarded the Oscars it seemed like some biasing or rather prior booking was involved in the process. This time, it seemed a wee bit more satiable. 'The Croods' was the only contender for 'Frozen'. And definitely in terms of animation 'Frozen' had the capacity to outshine 'The Croods'; and it has to be added that its bad luck for 'The Croods' to have gotten released in the same year along with 'Frozen'. The song 'Let it go' will just freeze your mind and body while 'Elsa' the Ice Queen unleashes and let go of her power unconstrained and without fear. There is beauty and elegance in each swishing moves Elsa does with her wonderful magic in the song. Music should also be given the credit as it is of the highest standards. Though there are over a dozen songs in the movie one would never get frustrated over it. In fact with the starting of the movie itself where the track 'Vuelie' is played, our hearts get fascinated and magnetized towards the movie and we expect something really big - The first impression is the best impression. It's definitely 'true love' in terms of the script which is the base concept of the movie and definitely not Bestiality or Homosexuality like some critiques have put it. The movie is a treat for the eyes. Story-wise don't expect a miracle. But all together there is all the requisite mixing done in the movie enough to say 'It's a Beautiful ride'. Walt Disney has finally after a long time pulled one Oscar for itself and surely it has earned it. The animation, the beauty of the magical ice, the fabulous music and the beautiful faces and gestures of Elsa and Anna will stick to your heart for quite a long time after you finish watching the movie. It's a good pick if you want some relaxation and happiness with honey in your eyes & ears. Way to go Disney – Like shown in the starting of the movie, Mickey's spirit steered you towards this well deserving win. It's all love.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Practically magical in every way!,"This is a huge movie, seriously huge. You can tell the Disney animation studio really put mountains of effort and it shows they're firing from all cylinders now. Music and awesome sisterhood story separate this from many animation offerings of the past. Also the computer generated animation is really cool, pun intended. The quality is top. I have a sister and so i felt this deep connection to this feature. I won't lie i was moved to tears. I ended up visiting my sis and giving her a huge hug which totally caught her off guard. I am really happy to see a movie that can connect worldwide and with something so simple and profound and that is sibling bond and its special quality is demonstrated really amazingly and with a lot of tenderness. I have been singing part of your world and reflection for years and i feel that let it go and most songs i will be singing for years to come. It was new and yet nostalgic and took me back to my childhood years and recreated the spirit of the movies i adored tenfold. It has something for everyone and that is why i loved it so much.

I can't wait to see it again!,"The last time Disney adapted a Hans Christian Anderson fairy tale, we got one of my favorite films, The Little Mermaid. Now, we have a movie that has very much the same feel as Mermaid. Frozen feels like it could fit right in with the Disney movies of the late 80's/early 90's, like The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King. The music is great, and I left singing it; the lead characters are very likable, with memorable sidekicks; and there are even surprises, things you would never expect to see in a Disney animated film!

A Fresh Take on your Typical Princess,"Frozen, which launched in theaters on November 29, 2013 and brought in an estimated $67 million during its opening weekend, has certainly been a hit with both kids and parents. The driving theme in Frozen is the relationship between sisters. While a love story is woven into the mix, the movie is ultimately about the love of sisters, Elsa and Anna. This Disney princess movie debunks the myth that love can be found overnight. The naïve young Anna accepts a marriage proposal from a man she met earlier that day. Anna's sister Elsa, a newly crowned queen, will not bless the marriage. In her rage, Elsa exposes her winter powers that have kept the sisters locked away in a castle for so many years. Elsa's powers make her appear unfit to be queen of Arendelle and the people believe her to be a dangerous sorcerer, and Elsa flees the castle to avoid hurting anyone. Searching for the answer to her sister's strange outburst and solitary childhood, Ana journeys to find her sister and bring her back to Arendelle. Along the way, she befriends a man who helps her through the icy climate to find Elsa and end the eternal winter. Frozen was not a stereotypical Disney Princess movie. While, romance is a part of this movie, the most notable relationship is the relationship between Elsa and Anna. Their sisterhood is set up at the opening, and it continues to pull at the heartstrings of the audience throughout the film. The characters in Frozen are distinct from one another, which makes the relationships more interesting. Elsa is the independent older sister who has hidden herself away for most of her life to protect her sister for most of her life. Anna is childlike even as an adult character but strong and capable. The artistry in this animation is also notable. It was shown in both 2D and 3D. Frozen had crisp graphics, and the backdrops appeared more life-like than animated. The characters looked like they were walking through a realistic set. There were two characters that did not fully fit in this movie: Olaf, the happy-go-lucky snowman, and the Duke of Weselton, a power hungry trader that wants to portray the queen as a monster. Olaf's character was visually out of place with the rest of the characters. It was a good idea to bring the sisters together with the snowman from their childhood, but this character did not work visually. Besides Olaf the snowman, the characters in Frozen were animated beautifully and looked good with the realistic set however Olaf appeared as something out of a typical Saturday morning cartoon, not a major motion picture. The Duke of Weselton was only in the movie for a few brief parts, and he made the audience think that he was the bad guy. But in the end he the audience finds that he has no real importance to the plot. Frozen shows a definite change in Disney princess movies. We got a first glimpse of this transition in the animated Disney princess movie, Brave. Disney seems to be shifting the values of its princess movies from forbidden young love to family love. Frozen had two Academy Award nominations for best animated film and best original song, a Golden Globe for best animated feature film, and ten Annie Award nominations. Frozen is another Disney Princess instant classic, and is something both kids and adults can enjoy. However, it would be just as pleasing and cheaper to wait until it comes out on video to watch. Even for a little girl who loves princesses, the six year old that I took to this movie had forgotten about it a few days later.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Frozen, but still animated","I'm not sure why anyone would see this as an affront to men and boys in general, but I guess that's why we are so different in seeing things and describing them. While for me this does have too much music (two songs less would be nice) and too little of the snowman we came to enjoy in the trailer, it still is a more than satisfying movie.Does it have stereotypes and some weird characters (the round ones, you'll see, when you see them)? Yes absolutely! But does it stand in the way of the story? Never. Even the twist, which is a nice one, can be seen as either good or bad. I liked it, even though it was convenient, but you needed it with the story at hand. There is some darker passages here, but it still is a children's story.

Disney's Animation is Getting Back on Track,"Seeing this near opening day, I had no idea Frozen would explode to be the #1 highest grossing animated film of all time. Like others, I was left disappointed by the trailers, and had ""cold"" expectations.Turns out, it was a pretty good movie. Not the best animated film of all time, but I have no issue with its popularity.In a sense, it is yet another deconstruction of the ""princess"" movie, like ""The Princess and the Frog"", ""Tangled"" and ""Brave"" before it. I'd complain, but the princess Disney films were always the worst ones. More importantly, the film also focuses on sibling relationships, Elsa's powers symbolic for severe introversion. The characters are cute, likable, and more complex than the typical 3D fare. The animation was among the best of 2013, especially for me, who finds something romantic about nighttime snowscapes.There are problems, but most of it can be chalked up to the fact it is a family film. The characters could have been deeper and the musical numbers better, but they're not meant for an adult audience. Even the snowman, while unnecessary, was tolerable, and made my theater explode in giggles. And who am I to argue against the laughter of children? :PDisney had a weak decade in the 00s, with giant bombs that sealed western traditional animation's fate and forgettable 3D titles. If it weren't for Pixar, they'd be worse than Dreamworks. But their latest works have been steps in the right direction. Frozen will likely go down as much of an animated classic as The Lion King or Beauty and the Beast.

just a so-so toons,"if without the annoying singing again and again, i might give this cartoon a 7 stars, but the singing made me become so impatient and so disgusted that i almost gone crazy. the storyline is okay but not great, mixed with several not quite likable figures, the ugly snowman, the poorly crafted terrible snow monster. all the shapes of moose, wolves, houses, palace, ships, mountains and snow were poorly drafted. the cute kid who was adopted by trolls, later became young man with a long and thick jaw, looked dumb and clumsy, another badly crafted figure. but the worst arrangement of this cartoon is still the drive-you-crazy typical formulaic Disney songs, when those figures in this cartoon suddenly started to sing, i just couldn't help thinking that i was watching a Bollywood Hindi film, because only in Bollywood films, either characters are suddenly dancing or singing without any probable cause. if we evaluate the draft artworks of this cartoon and compares it with 'Epic', 'Despicable Me', or 'Rise of The Guardian', it was like comparing ceramic ware with porcelain wares, 'Frozen' just looks so roughly, hastily drafted and designed. the typical yet annoying Disney songs are actually Bollywood crap that we could always do without.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
All Things To All Audiences --The Perfect Epic of Artificial Feminist Adventure,"Towards the end of John Sayles' dark American classic EIGHT MEN OUT, fat cat baseball owner Charlie Comiskey is terrified of losing his whole championship team because they threw the 1919 World Series. But his slick legal counselor tells him not to worry. ""There will be a reform movement, a movement demanding change in baseball. You must be a part of this movement. In fact, you must appear to be leading it.""What does this have to do with FROZEN?Disney Studies is like Charlie Comiskey. They're confronted with a massive backlash, feminists attacking their ""princess"" movies as tired, stale, reactionary, and politically incorrect. Disney's response is to become a part of this protest movement -- in fact, to appear to be leading it.Hence in FROZEN, you have a princess who does NOT meet Prince Charming. Instead she throws a blizzard-size tantrum and goes off and lives in a frozen castle, and this is represented as a heroic feminist act of empowerment, even though no one actually benefits and she doesn't learn or grow in any discernible way.Meanwhile, the princess' cute kid sister meets a handsome prince and falls in love at first sight -- only her prince turns out to be a rat, a Hitchcock style villain who switches sides at the drop of an icicle. This allows her to hook up with a cute ice-chopper, but it's made very clear that this relationship is a lot less important than her relationship with her older sister, who returns from exile and is saved at the last moment by the little sister's self sacrifice. Which is great, no problem there, except that ""bad"" prince just sort of turns bad out of nowhere. And this happens after we've seen him ruling the kingdom better than either sister ever did. But the feminist fable needs a scapegoat, so Hans has to ""take one for the team"" and be banned for life, just like the innocent Buck Weaver in EIGHT MEN OUT.If all this sounds like a tiresome bad review, or a series of snarky criticisms, I really don't mean it to be. I liked FROZEN; at least, the first forty minutes or so. I thought ""Let It Go"" was a real show- stopping number, a true classic. It's just that the second half of the movie drags, and a lot of the characters are forced to behave in ways that aren't authentic just to maintain the illusion that this is a princess movie you can feel ""good"" about watching. Because the happy ending is (sort of) man-free.Or something.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Admirable Twists,"Walt Disney Animation gives Hans Christian Andersen's story, ""The Snow Queen"", their own take by rather telling it as a traditional Disney princess movie, since it's probably too difficult for the original story to a have a faithful film adaptation. The film, like any of the genre's classics, is purely delightful and undeniably heartwarming. Putting all of its traditional elements is no doubt its best feat. It's probably a little too swift and somewhat predictable, but it always hits at the right heart and it really felt genuine. Frozen is getting there as one of Disney's classics, but despite of some flaws, it's difficult to not love the film overall.The major part of the story that has changed is it's now about a relationship of two sisters. It's an interesting choice for the plot, providing more themes to fit to the other. There is a sense that it might break some grounds to the usual form of the genre, though halfway through the film somewhat follows the same mold, which there's the typical fairy tale question about what true love really is, but eventually it manages to deliver something much clever in the end. Instead of fulfilling romantic dreams, it rather acknowledges how powerful real love can bring. It's sometimes a bit obvious, but that certain kind of heart feels quite sincere and it triumphs for it. Whatever else is left about the storytelling is it needs to work more on its pacing. It seems too quick, though animated movies have always been into faster pace, but this one palpably doesn't have enough time for breathing unless it importantly needed to. It's a very minor thing to complain about, but it's hard to avoid noticing it.One thing that it never fails recapturing is definitely the traditional magic. All the things you loved are right here!: great characters, adventurous tone, and magnificent musical numbers.The film benefits by its cast: Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel are both admirable as Anna and Elsa, while the rest are also full of personality. What brings it to the table even more are the songs. There is a sense of Broadway indeed, blending it with its wondrous animation makes it more captivating. The most memorable among is the ""Let It Go"" scene that brings a lot of impact, it's easily the best of its musical set pieces, giving a grand scale of bombast and emotion. The rest of the plot are just comedy and action, but the film has a better core which made these parts the least of what we should talk about.There's plenty of magic and heart to be found in Frozen, in spite of a slight mess through the storytelling. As an adaptation, it is able to be inventive, otherwise it's simply a lovely fairy tale movie that has the charm of the old Disney classics, but really, it's not in those heights yet. It's just a reminder that these movies can still wake up our inner child no matter what age we're in. I mean, why doubt quality?; rich setting, compelling characters, and all. Having these kinds of cinematic experience always feels like a rewarding treat. There are also remarkable songs that are worth listening within its visual splendor.

Refreshing. Continues Disney's 3D animation streak with Tangled and Wreck-It Ralph.,"Coming fresh off Tangled and Wreck-It Ralph, Disney finally feel like they're redeeming themselves after the kid 'friendly' misfires of the 2000s. As they embrace 3D animation, now they feel relevant, charmingly idiosyncratic and built on a much grander scale. They're back to being event cinema. While Wreck-It Ralph is starting to feel like a one-off stroke of genius, Frozen feels more like the sister-film to Tangled, of which was a great pleasant surprise for its laid-back attitude and sharp sense of humour, while Frozen relies on a more urgent tension, it retains that humour and a similar emotional release. Fortunately it has stronger and more confident use of songs which is a tradition sorely missed from Disney. However, in taking the typical mold of adapting an old folktale, it results in quite predictable storytelling and character archetypes. Pleasant, but predictable.It has a few pacing problems in the beginning too, I wish it was more like Tangled in that regard which set us up quickly whereas Frozen spends its first half hour rushing through it rather than settling us in. It's a frequent issue with the film that's a double-edged sword. For example, as the deadpan snowman Olaf steals the show in the second half, he feels like he came from the highlight reel of a completely different writer. While this may give something for everyone and each shard of content is really good, there's something about them that doesn't quite gel. However, Frozen hinges on its lead and Disney has nailed the quirky but feisty young female protagonist where other animation departments struggle. It's great to see a film like this concerned with sisterhood and it hits some really powerful beats. While its path may be jagged and unusual, Frozen is still utterly refreshing and a joy to watch.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

"Not A Horrible Film, But Very Bad On Disney's Standards","Frozen is directed by Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck, and is one of Disney's newest animated movies. The story follows Anna (Kristen Bell) and her older sister Elsa (Idina Menzel) as Elsa reveals to their kingdom of Arendelle that she has secret ice powers, and immediately runs away to build an ice castle and be alone, freezing Arendelle in the process. Anna must team up with mountain man Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) and his reindeer Sven, along with little snowman Olaf (Josh Gad) in order to find her sister and thaw out their frozen kingdom. To start, I enjoy Disney movies, when they're good. I'm not bias against this movie at all. I wish it would've been good, but it just wasn't. The same old Disney formula was used here, utilizing dead parents, a female heroine that needs a man (in this case, two), and a ""funny"" supporting character. This formula has been used so much, it's almost like watching parts of the same story over and over. This is why Disney movies such as Big Hero 6 (2014) and Wreck-It- Ralph (2012) are such a breath of fresh air from Disney, and are generally good films. The best thing I can say about this film is the music. This move has the best music in a Disney movie since The Lion King (1994). With songs like ""Do You Want To Build A Snowman?"" and the ever so famous ""Let It Go,"" It has some pretty good music. Then it has ""For The First Time In Forever."" This song is good, yes, but, it's taken straight from the movie Tangled (2010). All Disney did is change the verses. and insert it into this film's soundtrack. However, the music is still the best thing this film has going for it.The first horrible thing this movie brings to the table is it's elaborate plot. The plot sounds simple, indeed, but there's so many subplots in this film that it's truly hard identifying the overlying, main plot. To list some of them: unfreezing Arendelle, Anna making friends with Elsa, Anna marrying Prince Hans (Santino Fontana), Anna marrying Kristoff, etc. I've narrowed it down to the first two listed above, but I can't figure out which one is the predominant plot.However confusing the plot is, I do have to mention the directing and animation. The animation, mostly, is very good in this film. There's absolutely no complaints to be had with it. There are no ugly shots in the movie at all.The last thing I'll mention is the character, mostly Anna. To save least last, I'll start with Elsa. Elsa honestly isn't too bad of a character, but she is a confusing one. Her emotion is hard to read, but that, at points, is a good thing. Overall I'd say Idina Menzel does pretty good as Queen Elsa. Kristoff is a good quality character as well. His funny relationship with Sven, a reindeer, is probably the most funny thing in the entire film. This leads me into the next character: Olaf. Olaf is a snowman that tries to be the Timon and Pumbaa (from The Lion King) of this movie. However, Timon and Pumbaa were likable, and fun. Olaf just isn't. Josh Gad doesn't do great with this character, however, he doesn't exactly good bad either. Olaf is ultimately okay. Just that.The last character, and definite worst thing about this whole movie is Anna. Anna is a princess that constantly needs a prince. She's not a strong female character at all, and is very disappointing all around. To compare to another Disney princess, I'll use Belle from The Beauty and The Beast (1991). Belle was a strong, independent woman that went alone to save her father, due to none of the ""tough"" men in the entire town volunteering to help. She was at first imprisoned by the Beast, and fell in love with his personality, and what's on the inside, despite his monstrosity of an appearance. Anna falls in love with Prince Hans due to his title: prince. Just due to his money and role in society, she falls for him. This makes Frozen a disappointment for any female character.Overall, Frozen has a messed up plot, and upsetting characters, mixed with great animation and wonderful music. It's definitely the worst Disney film since The Emperor's New Groove (2000). I think Frozen deserves a C, or a 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The storyline and characters.,I LOVED this movie I instantly got attached to Elsa because I can relate to her but the story was fantastic the voice acting was amazing and when it came to Elsa singing let it go I just loved it. It was the part when she realised that she needed to let her fears go and just live with it after all them years of fear of people finding her out and me as a movie reviewer I think this movie is brilliant. When I first heard of frozen I thought here we go another princess and Disney magical movie this will be awful and for a short time I was judging a book by it's cover when I saw this film I though wow that was one of the best films I ever could see and I am very proud of the people a part of this movie to make it what it is today well done and I loved this movie and I always will BRILLIANT.,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The hype can ruin it for you.,"This isn't Disney's best in the last 20 years... Tangled & Wreck-it Ralph were definitely superior.That being said this is enjoyable and is worth a watch. Music is fun, story is pretty good. However, if you go in expecting a modern Beauty and The Beast or Aladdin, I promise you'll want to shut the film off.Seriously! While the music & story is fun.... It's not on the level of Beauty and the Beast, Lion King, Aladdin, Etc.I shut off this movie in disgust the first time 40 mins in! Why? Because I was expecting greatness on the level of Disney classics. I was trying to see how this film was on par with ""Beauty and The Beast""It's not... But, on giving it a second chance a while later, I found myself loving it!Why? Because of the amazing music and entertainment value. However, it's only entertaining from a scene to scene point of view.As a whole the story is full of plot holes and baffling ideas (Read any negative review for more detail). Whole important plot points are shown only to be never spoken of. Also the secondary characters are never really developed enough for us to understand their motivations. (e.g. Why the heck is Kristoff a ice seller raised by Trolls and not the ice sellers in the first scene?)The film does work. But, it really shouldn't from a storytelling standpoint.What makes Frozen a good film is the beautiful world, amazing music, fun characters! Most importantly the excitement of each scene prevents the viewer from ever having the chance to really dwell on these story problems long enough.That being said. The lack of a flow/ connection between some scenes is what prevents it from being a modern ""Beauty and The Beast"".Go in expecting something a little less satisfying then How to Train Your Dragon and you'll enjoy it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Excellent Film!,"Well done Disney, for once you have made a good, animated film. But one of the main reasons people love this film is because of the songs: For the first time in forever and Let it go. Don't get me wrong these are brilliant songs (for young people) but I personally think it is an over reaction... Despite this though, it is a wonderful film to watch! I would like to point out the comedy parts of this film, firstly that it is very funny and secondly, that there is a high point of comedy and a low point; I feel that this is the strength of this film.Overall, it is a good film and defiantly a film to watch with younger children.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Still great on 100th viewing,"I have watched Frozen again and again and it is still great! The songs are beautiful, the characters relate-able and the animation enchanting. My brothers and I like to reenact the scenes. Great for big kids and little kids. Watch with the whole family. My favorite part is when Elsa make her ice castle and realizes that the best thing is to be herself and not hide who she really is... I think this is important to know and all little kids should realize if they hide who they really are then they will be sad, but if they allow themselves to be true to who they are, they will be happy. I think this is a good story and I love to sing the songs.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A very enjoyable and funny musical animated movie that's quite moving,"I've always been very impressed by animated films, I think they're generally of a very high standard. There is a strange apprehension that many adults seem to have about them; that they're silly, just for kids. It's completely irrational. I think animation is actually the ""genre"" with the highest consistent standard. They almost always have far more detail than live-action entertainment. Everything you see was specifically put there, it was built from scratch. Nowadays it's possible to get lazy with the use of computers, but with the right attitude, CGI only opens up more possibilities. It also allows for more exaggeration and symbolism; you aren't limited to the reality everyone is used to. You can set up your own rules which is far more refreshing and exciting.The characters are very strong and human in Frozen, especially Ana. She loves her sister Elsa and just wants to play with her all the time. She loves her so much that it hurts every time she's turned down and yet she is still just as excited to play with her the next time. There is a lot of physical comedy with Ana. She is very energetic and positive and careless. We see her heart and her insecurities, she is very likable.The story is quite adult in some ways. Many families will experience some kind of strain or separation, whether temporary or permanent. Each side has their own point of view and are often trying to do the right thing; it's complicated. People get hurt, years pass and there is anger and guilt and regret. And hopefully, there is still love.The characters we meet are all interesting and quirky. We get a good feel for their personality from the get-go. There are twists that may teach kids to think twice about first impressions. Elsa isn't evil but is conflicted and dangerous which is a nice change from typical villains in movies. The action scenes are done really well. There are only a few parts that are a bit weaker or predictable (the troll song seems unnecessary). The voice-acting is fun and varied, they say lines in interesting ways that bring out more meaning.Olaf is very funny and offbeat. He fills in a familiar position in these kinds of movies but his timing and manner is unique. You aren't quite sure what he's going to say but it's generally very funny. He makes matter-of-fact observations halfway between obvious and profound.Although the music is very nice, I think the transitions were too forced and artificial. A bit too perfect. The songs fall too conveniently into standard show-stopping number formats. Reminds me of Wicked and Glee - let's all stop and sing loudly and proudly and colourfully with shining lights on us. It should be natural, an emotional expression of the character's feelings and desires. Not a show-off piece of pop music with ""hilarious"" lines thrown in. Still, the songs are very good and sometimes funny. But there could be more of a common thread or style running through them and more originality or boldness.It's unfair and naive that the world seems to look down at ""kid's movies"" (any genre other than drama apparently deserves no respect). If anything, they usually achieve more than other films. They manage to move us, make us laugh or sing or smile or cry. They do this without swearing or being excessively violent or sexual (easy ways to affect people or to be ""ground-breaking""). They draw us in with simple, beautiful stories and characters. All made possible by the tremendous amount of talent, passion and hard-work going on behind the scenes.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Another good entry in the Disney Classic Collection,"Overall I liked it, decent story, some amazing visuals and musical numbers. I couldn't recognize any of the voice actors and the story was strong enough that they didn't need big Hollywood talent to sell the movie. One of my favorite parts was before the movie started: you can see the influence past Pixar president and current Disney Animation Czar John Lasseter has as there was a Pixar-esque short before the film, where they took either a classic Mickey cartoon or made a new one to look like a classic toon, and made a madcap mini-movie, which actually surprised me how violent it was, but totally in line with the old cartoons. Back to the feature, on an artistic level I thought is was lacking a bit, but they set the bar so high on ""Tangled"" that there was no way to go but down. While some of the artwork was amazing, I noticed many scenes where textures and shadows were lacking; sometimes the characters seemed to float off the background instead of living in it. Again, I/we have been spoiled. Also there seemed to be a rush to get 8-9 songs thrown in and most of them were forgettable, just there for (unnecessary) exposition. 1 or 2 decent ones, but nowhere near enough to consider purchasing the soundtrack. The ending was kind of abrupt, but still an enjoyable movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"I can't believe this won Oscar over Miyazaki-san's ""The Wind Rises""","I Won't spoil anything but I'll make some points about what i liked and did not. First of all I cannot decide whether this is good or bad.I do not understand how this film got an 8/10 rating.It's not bad,in fact this movie has the most unique and magical princess(Or Queen) in Disney's History(At least for me) And they did not even give her enough screen time. OK lets cut to the chase.There was a lot of potential in this movie,mainly the ice princess concept was really interesting and Elsa was a really spectacular character and she is the only reason i gave it a 6. And it would have been a good tear jerking movie but instead they decided to do a comedy. The plot is really flawed,it seems the makers didn't know what to do after the first half of the movie and just decided to put in random cliché'd Barbie princess stuff. Visually it was spectacular.Hats off to the art team and Animators for their flawless character movements and the Incredible designs for the ice elements in the film.The main drawback is the story and some unnecessary characters.If you are planning to watch this film then do it without expecting much and surely it does not live up to the hype. And it does not even compare to Miyazaki's ""The Wind Rises"" Which lost to ""Frozen"" in the academy awards,Wind rises was a really great experience, I would suggest anyone to go watch that instead of this.This film did not deserve the Oscar is all i can say.It's a good film to pass the time if you are too bored,but if not,just stay away because you will be disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Rekindling A Long-Since Broken Bond,"It's no surprise that Disney has pulled out a new movie for the Disney Animated Features canon. Hastily, I checked out the film on opening day and had to see if what the critics said were true.In a place called Arendelle, two sisters of royal heritage live a splendid life, until one day the older sister Elsa has difficulty controlling her cryokinesis (ice powers) that it ultimately strikes her own sister Anna, endangering her young sibling and herself. With their parents gone and fearing she may do more harm than good, Elsa flees Arendelle to start a new life at the cost of leaving her caring sister behind.Since the film is loosely based on the works of Hans Christian Andersen (author of the story 'The Little Mermaid' which Disney eventually adapted back in 1989), I acknowledge that the critics were right and Disney has one-upped themselves with a compelling and heartfelt story of how the Snow Queen came to be. The voice cast which include Kristen Bell, Idina Menzel, Josh Gad, and Johnathan Groff portrayed characters with such ease and likability along with their unique talent in singing sympathetic, yet upbeat songs that may give chills (no pun intended) running down your spine most notably Idina Menzel's solo of ""Let it Go."" That is the exact impression I felt as a kid watching those classic Disney animated films like 'Beauty and the Beast,' 'Aladdin,' and 'The Lion King.' Now in my mid-20s and with this new ""Revival Era,"" it seems 'Frozen' is matching the ranks of the Disney Renaissance that spawned those animated hits throughout the 1990s.I felt a strong sympathy for these royal sisters of Arendelle. Anna cares very much for her troubled sister no matter what, and she'll do anything to strengthen their childhood bond again. The story itself intrigued me the most (even with an unexpected twist near the end, but I won't spoil it there) because it's basically the theme of ""a bond long-since broken by fear and uncertainty, tries to be rekindled with the power of love and compassion."" I literally heard the audience laugh, react, loudly applaud, and cheer that I can already sense Oscar nominations will not be ruled out. And on a personal note, it's good to point out that there are a few easter eggs referencing past Disney animated films hidden in some scenes, something that's been done since Walt Disney's lifetime and can be surprising if found. No doubt the DVD/Blu-ray release will also be a hit. A definite return to Disney's heyday of animation glory that happened over twenty years ago. 'Frozen' is a movie audiences - kids and adults young at heart - can relate to.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
It's great Disney musical!,"First of all i have to say that i am not a big fan of not only Disney musicals, but musicals in general, But for what it is and that is animated musical it is great.

"Over-hyped, but reasonable","This is a film with plenty to like, but much to hate alsoMuch has been said about the plot line issues etc, so I want to focus on technical mattersFirstly, Idina Mendzel, is totally wrong for the role of Elsa as scored. The title song is actually not well pitched for her and it shows in the higher ranges, it's well characterised, but otherwise it gratesSecondly there simply are too many songs for the plot line. I don't think as others do that they are bad songs, but they are unnecessary unless it's a musical, but it's not meant to be suchThirdly: whilst the animation is smooth it's extremely stylised at times and at others very lazy such that it isn't like many Disney films, that are pleasant on the eye, it's just not that pretty. In particular Elsa just doesn't look natural.Finally: it's just hugely derivative of tangled, from the music to the production",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A Disney film with an icy twist,"Frozen is a Disney animation with a great show that is put on, with big songs that many people will be hard done by to not hum afterwards and a style that just looks seamless, this is truly one of the finer movies Disney have produced. It also has some crazily quirky characters and they all play along in a bigger plot which isn't that easy to predict, or should I say, not your typical Disney princess story. The film in my opinion is just about a very good one and here below is why I felt that about it.The story as said is kind of a big adventure, not to ruin the main storyline for those of you planning to watch it but it contains a lot of different people and places which just make it generally good fun. It contains humour that can be for some very funny, typical animation style humour but without it the film would seem stale and unloved. One major part of the story and a reason I think so many people love this movie is the songs, the score and the lyrics then sung over are fantastic and really make this a movie to remember but also brings it out in a warm glow as well.The voice work for the movie is nice and I think they picked the right people for the job(and not only for the singing). Kristen Bell is just one of the voices you may recognise and her portrayal as Ana is fun and different yet not so different from other Disney princesses. Idina Menzel as Elsa has by far the most powerful voice in the movie and her singing is really brought out in possibly the most famous song from this movie ""Let it Go"". I liked Josh Gad as Olaf, his little voice matches Olaf perfectly and you will see why, and he also provides a lot of the humour.Of course adapting a Hans Christian Andersen story is going to be difficult, but I think Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee bring it well to the screen and there safe handed direction really works. The writers also do well, not sure how much of the original story is there but in any case the writers seem to do it some great justice. The look of this film is amazing, such slick animation with a beautiful flow of things, and when any things like ice is involved, the detail put into every little bit is immensely done well and just wonderful to look at among everything going on too.Main criticisms, well it has to be said the film probably isn't as good as certain people may have you believe, yes it's a fun Disney animation but that can also be the problem, over the top drama which can after a while annoy but it may not also. I said it has animation like humour before and that is also why I didn't think this was the perfect animation film, there aren't a lot of laughs to be had and even when characters such as Olaf try to provide that comic relief, the jokes aren't delivered that well, I will add though that kids will probably laugh a lot at this.Of course I will recommend this to any Disney fan, you can't get much more than this in there long line of films and is fast becoming one of the best known modern Disney films as well. I think this is definitely one for the children and don't tell boys they can't enjoy it, I think anyone of age or gender can have a great time with this film. If you dislike a good old sing song and a melodramatic kind of story then really, this isn't at all for you, some people will absolutely hate this but I think it depends on why you watch movies.Overall a Just About Very Good movie and one film that was hard to give a score. I think it may be so hard to rate because of the amount of people who say it is the best thing they have ever seen but then many also have heard people say that and feel it is overrated. Just go along with it, and even if you feel this isn't your type of movie then just try to enjoy it, don't hate it because of the characters or songs and you may just have found a gem of an animation movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Depicts love in the modern age,"With a smile on my face, I can say I finally sat through Frozen tonight. I turned off my phone and left aside any note-taking, just absorbed the film for entertainment and on that level, it succeeded on happily keeping me interested. Who doesn't love classic Disney animated musicals? With my short attention span, as I child I bounced from one film to the next singing along and rooting for the happy endings. Frozen hits the refresh button on the classic beat-bopping fairy tales.Pixar has defended the honor of animation for the past decade, but Frozen makes me thankful that children of this day-and-age will be able to have the same childhood memories I had. When the film began and the first song was belted among ice-workers, a feeling came over me and I thought, ""this is the Disney I know.""Frozen's iced snowy visuals sparkle with the beauty we expect every year from the Christmas season and the costumes are drawn with a cool-bite. Like any animated film you'll find, there are the occasional unavoidable gags that are intentionally written for laughs from the target audience.The melodious songs enchant the viewer and draw jumbles of enjoyment from the children in our hearts. The Oscar nominated song, ""Let It Go,"" blows its notes like wind from a hurricane.The characters are etched out with their wings spread, in particular the two central sisters and their relationship, with the voice working pitching the tones of the animations with ease. The characters are given distinct personalities, traits that are compatible with the modern era, and will hopefully separate them from future Disney characters.I had a bold, reoccurring thought during Frozen: this may be the most liberal, intelligent, and humanly-vast of any of the Disney musicals. The olden Disney musicals, bless them and all their brilliance, show love quite superficially compared to the execution Frozen puts out. A prince will not be perfect and love requires us to be accepting of flaws that are eventually revealed.Walt Disney Pictures have taken a commendable step in what they subconsciously teach their younger demographic about love and romance. Cinderella, Snow White, and Aurora did not have adequate time to fall in love with their princes, so how did they know it was love? Frozen says with a firm statement the thing adults tell teenagers persistently (even though teens refuse to believe the wisdom), ""you don't know what love is."" Nothing is taken away from the romances those classic princesses, Frozen clarifies the modern definitions of love.Frozen sets certain examples that will hopefully sink into the mindsets of some of the future youth. The evolution of our society and feminism take even further steps in the adaptable emotion of love, the painful effects of isolation, and also refusal to accept of one's flaws. Frozen's modern depth and insights relieve me from dooming it a pleasurable animation.Grade: ARating: 8Stars: 4/4",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Visually stunning but not much of a story,"I just finished watching Frozen and there were many positives. To start, the visuals are truly stunning. I was amazed at how the artists played with the medium of snow or ice, which could be flat and white and boring, but in this film is exciting and beautiful. The story unfortunately seems to have been an afterthought, with all efforts expended on the polished music and animation (by comparison the story is a rough draft, and you have to wonder what the writer or writers were thinking.)The film rushes through emotions and events and expects the viewer to manufacture the appropriate feelings. I found myself unable to enjoy the ride as I usually do. Done right, this film could have made viewers gasp and laugh and cry. For me it did none of those things, I felt like I was trying to keep up...love, conflict, fear, resolution...the script bounces from one to the next and it doesn't make much sense.Even children's stories (even the most basic fairy tales, the little mermaid or the nightingale) have more depth and development. Even in other Disney movies, like Aladdin, we understand where feelings of inadequacy and greed and friendship and love are coming from.This movie was all about the neat tricks but lacking in the kind of substance that makes kids fall in love with stories and maybe even learn a little about them. It was enjoyable to watch but when the credits began to roll I felt disappointed. The master storytellers--so present in other animated films--were absent here.Kids are smart, and when we fail to grasp that, we do them a disservice.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Best Disney film in 10 years!!,"Frozen 7/10- Coming in to this movie, I had no clue what to expect since the trailer I saw for the movie did not really give any key plot details. I had hopes for the movie since the directer, Chris Buck, also directed my favorite childhood movie Tarzan. I was pleased with the results.The first part of the movie got me thinking it was gonna be just a regular princess meets prince and they fall in love type movie, but I was pleasantly surprised. The movie did not even focus on any romantic relationship as much as it focused on the relationship between the two princesses Anna and Elsa. Elsa has special powers where she can turn stuff into ice or snow. This movie makes that seem like a good thing at first, but as it wears on we see that Elsa cannot control her powers and now puts everyone around her in danger. She has to be isolated from everyone, including her little sister Elsa. Elsa does not understand why she can never be with her sister. Elsa one day comes out to be inaugurated as queen, but when her emotions get out of control, she puts the kingdom into an eternal winter and then shes flees to the mountains. Anna must go get her so she can get the kingdom out of an eternal winter.The movie gives a lot of very funny laughs that everyone can enjoy. The characters are all refreshingly original, but the way they are presented is probably what makes them all so likable. Now, just like every other animated movie, the characters at some point break out and start singing. Most of the time, this part of the movie I detest, but I found myself enjoying a couple of them. Don't get me wrong, I find that a character singing out of no where with no one else around to be silly, but at least the ones where the situation made sense for it, I enjoyed. The plot though is very cliché and I wish animated movies would at least try to make themselves different from the others. This movie is at least very fun which is more than enough for me. This movie is not as good Tarzan, but in my opinion, it is the best animated movie of the year.Frozen brings joy to nearly everyone in the theater at one point or another and it is no doubt a great family movie.For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Not a Masterpiece but Some Great Characters and a Beautiful Look,"Frozen (2013)*** (out of 4)The latest Disney outing has a few flaws but there's still enough magic here to make it worth sitting through. Princess Anna goes searching for her sister, the Queen, who has special powers, which accidentally freeze their village. Anna hopes to bring her sister back home but there's a villain who has other ideas. FROZEN is such a visual beauty that one can really overlook the flaws and just sit back and enjoy the film. I'll start off with the flaws, which are the songs. It's not like we just get one, two or three songs but it really feels as if five-minutes doesn't go by before we get yet another. There are a couple stand out musical numbers but I just really felt that there were way too many and it ended up taking away from the story and the characters. Speaking of the characters, each of them were simply marvelous and they certainly helped draw you into the film and make you care about what's going on with them. The Anna character was one of the most charming in recent years. The sister, the hero and the snowman and reindeer were just flawless characters that added to the romance as well as the comedy. The constantly back and forth between the snowman and the reindeer was priceless and the two certainly could use their own movie. The one weak character turned out to be the villain who was someone we've just seen way too many times in these type of animation films. The visuals in the film were just amazing to see on a big screen and especially the beautiful snow-covered valley. I really thought the effects were wonderfully done and I especially liked a sequence early on where the Queen rushes across some water with the ice sparkling as she touches it. FROZEN isn't a complete masterpiece but it's another charming winner from the studio.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
frozen goodness,"Captivating for the entire family, Frozen is the perfect combination of humor and musical numbers with an underlying seriousness of the importance of family. From talking snowmen to castles made of ice it's no wonder the Disney film has won in over 30 different awards show including two Oscars. The detailed effects inspire the artist in all of us while the songs ignite the singer. The talking snowman excites the little kid in us while the family aspects could warm even the Grinch's heart. Whether you are three or 83 there are important lessons scattered throughout encouraging all of us to embrace the uniqueness that makes us who we are. Persistent themes include bravery against your fears and kindness to both those whom you love and those who you might not get along with and the consequences of demonstrating both.

From the outside Anna's sister, Elsa looks poised, regal and reserved, but in reality, she lives in fear as she wrestles with a mighty secret-she was born with the power to create ice and snow. It's a beautiful ability, but also extremely dangerous. Haunted by the moment her magic nearly killed her younger sister Anna, Elsa has isolated herself, spending every waking minute trying to suppress her growing powers. Her mounting emotions trigger the magic, accidentally setting off an eternal winter that she can't stop. She fears she's becoming a monster and that no one, not even her sister, can help her.Frozen is one of the coolest comedy-adventure ever to hit the big screen. Practically magical in every way!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Brilliant. A total must see.,"Most people class Disney films as children's movies, but so what if they are? Allow your inner child to come out during this masterpiece. There aren't that many Disney movies that people can still call masterpieces, the only other Disney film I can think of that is a masterpiece is Fantasia. I have to say that this has to be one of Disney's best musicals, ever! As a Disney fan, myself I have to say that the Disney movies nowadays are still magical...like Tangled, Maleficent and The Muppets, but aren't as magical as the 'old ones' as some people like to call them. For example; Sleeping Beauty, The Lion King and Toy Story. So if you haven't already seen it,what are you waiting for?!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Frozen: Good, but below of their own freezing forces","The new Disney animation, "" Frozen"" , combines classic elements of the genre: princesses, prince, love , singing, adventure , humor and a great challenge .Inspired by the fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen , "" The Snow Queen "" , the movie is about the story of two sisters , raised in the same house, but separate . Anna , youngest, lived in every corner of the palace. Elsa, is older and owns a huge freezing power, was isolated from an early age by parents following a critical incident with her sister, who almost died frozen. After years of imprisonment, and the death of parents, Elsa's coronation as queen marks both the reunion of the sisters, as the beginning of the conflict such as the lack of power of the new queen . As a solution, Elsa search again their isolation , although Anna depart to their rescue ."" Frozen"" is a visual spectacle of colors , designs and plans agreed. Some characterizations of environments and characters , even remember much "" Tangled "" (2010 ) . The soundtrack is very good , although there are exceptions to the singing of the characters in some scenes . The secondary characters as comic relief work very well and help the narrative . And the scene where Elsa builds his new refuge and assumes his powers is a flawless beauty , one of the most well done scenes of Disney animation , match making with the outcome of "" Beauty and the Beast "" (1991 ) .The story , with a strong premise and well-balanced secondary resources, however, is not so well told . Despite the pro-activity of breaking with commonplace such as "" courtly (idealized) love "" Anna , or the fact that they are two princesses , princess and the main narrative is the brunette one, not the blonde one. Direction does not equates to the enormous job of writers (screenplay) to transform the ""Snow Queen"", of the fairy tale, in one of the first multi-dimensional characters of Disney princesses . The absence of building a relationship and more dialogs between the protagonists, added the option for the focus on Anna and their two (2 ) love interests, makes the movie shallow. There isn't a strong link between the sisters, after they grew up, harmonizing the outcome of the plot, or the discovery of Elsa then. Though the movie presents something less expected on the issue of "" true love "" , its appearance sounds forced. I get the impression that we have more involvement with the outcome because our memories of family and brothers, instead something that appears in the movie.Finally, I refer again to the "" Beauty and the Beast "" for a parallel . Beast and Elsa are the counterpoint , the hero and anti-hero. But in the first case , we understand and engage with the changing monster prince, but the second , I was feeling : nice, OK , it's doable (believable).

"Fun(ish), forgettable, Disney fantasy.  Won't bore you, but won't change your life!","This is Disney at it's simplest and surest - a plain and fun fantasy about a princess with magical powers, a handsome prince, a couple of goofy characters to provide regular light relief, and a couple of really mean villeins, of course.Very 'Disney' in it's values - the family is no. 1, good people are beautiful and young, bad people typically ugly, old and have eastern European accents, animals are cute. Actually, the film does break a couple of these rules, but one is very conscious that this is Disneytopia, right down to the emotional manipulation and total lack of depth to any character. Yes, I know it's a kids movie, but all the same ...Pros: passes the time and gives some smiles, although no big laughs for the adults, or for the children really.Cons: animation is a little lacking - TV rather than big-screen quality much of the time. Also, there is a LOT of singing, and nothing particularly memorable! (E.g., ""Something, something ... let's build a snowman, ... something."") I'd have preferred a bit more goofing around with the fun characters.Overall: my wife and I saw it on a Sunday evening with a lot of young children in the cinema - not a lot of reaction from them, while it held the attention, would have like to have heard more laughter. Definitely a middling 7/10 from me. Spend an afternoon at the mall for the same (or less) amount of money and have more fun.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
In two words: Lacking emotion,"Since Disney's decision to drop drawn animation for 3D animation it was uncertain what quality of animation we would get. However, after the great movie experience that was ""Tangled"" Disney has proved that they can indeed continue quality work in a new format. Just to be clear for this review I'm dividing Pixar and Disney as separate companies.In my opinion the strength of the old drawn Disney movies lies in the character development and atmosphere. Together with a good pacing and songs to draw me into the moment, these movies have become a warm feeling of nostalgia for me. I understand that change is needed in order to keep things new and fresh and that is why I'm complimenting Tangled on a good blend of new and old, especially story and character development.Now what about Frozen, well I'll be honest with you all this movie really needs to take itself more seriously and they should recut it. Compared to Tangled it seems like Disney has lost focus during development, which is a shame because it really had potential to become something good instead of the decent movie that it is.Let me first start with what was bad about it. - The movie spends too much time on comedy relieve moments when the movie clearly doesn't need it and because of this some moments really suffered.Like old Disney movies Frozen also has singing moments to develop the story further and this was done well for the most part. However, some songs really weren't necessary and it felt that they were there just to be there. This dragged the movie down resulting in an uncomfortable story pacing midway.The biggest problem that I have with this movie is actually character development, more specifically the development of the antagonist (if there is one) and the side characters. The movie spends too little time on developing anyone else apart from the protagonist and because of this; it was hard to really feel for anyone. Ask yourself this question: how can you feel for someone if you don't really know him/her. If the protagonist doesn't REALLY know her own sister or anyone close to her, how can any emotional feelings develop? This is a shame and I hope Disney will not continue this trend because they were very good at conveying emotions.Plus there are some other minor things that could be considered nitpicking (e.g., Disney's subtle departure of their old story telling).So is there anything good about the movie? Well yes there is.The saving grace of this movie is the protagonist. She is funny, likable and the only character that really shows any growth from beginning to end. Through her eyes we really do experience wonder.When the moment is right the humor in this movie is very funny and refreshing.3D animation is very well done and beautiful to look at. Especially the beginning.Music is good especially the background music. The singing music was done very good by taking the situation and furthering the story.If I've made the impression that I didn't liked the movie believe me this really isn't the case. However, it isn't the perfect movie people are talking about. It dragged and it was unfocused but still fun to watch. It gave me the chills of enjoyment.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Nowhere close to Disney classic,"Went to see Frozen because I heard that it got some good reviews and it looked like it might be something enjoyable. As far as Disney movies go it looked great. This animation on was par with Tangled which I really thought was beautiful. The movie started well and the first musical number was good so I thought that it would just get better. But then something happened the story just started to fall flat. The story began getting less interesting and the music started to get really forgettable. In fact when I left the theater I couldn't remember a single melody, that's unfortunate. On a side note I agree with some who feel that the story was slanted too much toward the uninteresting sister Anna instead of Elsa who was the Snow Queen. It was like they were afraid to talk about her struggles and went down the happier, easier path of Anna, love and perkiness. This was a real missed opportunity for Disney to do something memorable for kids who through no fault of their own are different than others. They could have used Elsa's story more effectively and the music could have reflected her beauty and danger better. Too bad. I gave it a 7 for the animation mostly. It's not a classic but it's pretty to look at.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Greatest Movie I Have Ever Seen!,"That pretty much sums it up, this movie is entertaining, emotional, empowering and just downright incredible. The music is amazing and the lyrics are excellent, all of the characters are perfect, especially Olaf with his humour and charm and not to mention Anna and Elsa, who are both just incredibly gorgeous, what I would give to marry one of them! They are just amazing in their differences and similarities; Anna being talkative and outgoing, and Elsa more Graceful and conserved. Seriously though, I really don't understand why some people don't like this movie. This is the easiest 10/10 I will ever give out to any movie. I'm now hoping for a 'Frozen 2', fingers crossed.

Fun Children's Movie!,"Frozen is not the best Disney or Pixar movie by far but it is a very good movie and one of the best of recent years, it definitely deserves an Oscar compared to some of the other recent animated movies that have come out.The film is an animated movie version of Han Christian Andersen's story ""The Snow Queen"", however little of the finished film seems to be related to this story, it is more of just a jumping off point for the story tellers.The story is about two sisters, one who eventually becomes queen and one who is her younger sister, a princess. The Queen has the magical ability to make it snow and to make things frozen. It is a dangerous power she can't control and she ends up having to go off into the woods to live alone because she could kill everyone otherwise. Her sister Elsa goes off to find her leaving a stranger in charge (for some strange reason, why would she do this?) and meeting her love interest.The effects are great and it is a very good story, especially for children, but there are some logic flaws and it is just not quite good enough to be an excellent movie. Totally worth seeing though, especially on the big screen if you have the chance!",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Not bad but greatly over-rated,"I enjoyed this movie but not as much as most animated Disney movies. I certainly don't think it measures up the classics like Snow White and Cinderella, or more recent ones like The Lion King and Beauty & the Beast. The story was pleasant but fairly forgettable. Likewise the characters. There were some funny moments but no laugh out loud moments like Disney movies often deliver. The token comic character (the snowman) was terribly cliché. A lot of fuss was made over the movie portraying a strong female character. To be honest I think Brave did a far better job of that. Rather than the giggling girl gushing over a handsome prince we got in Frozen, Brave gave us a strong young women who was completely capable and independent. Brave also didn't have female leads who looked like Bratz dolls. A lot of fuss was also made about the Let It Go song. Again I thought it was a decent song but nothing terribly catchy or memorable. Certainly not up to the standard of songs from The Lion King or The Little Mermaid. Overall I found this movie to be pretty mediocre. Fun viewing but I wouldn't go out of my way to watch it again. Most Disney movies I'm happy to watch multiple times and often have. Certainly don't think this movie warrants all the praise that gets heaped on it. Below par for a Disney animated film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A wonderful story told in a magnificent way. Fun or all ages.,"I was engaged in the movie from the very first note until the last line of credits. (you gotta stay until the very end, there is a funny statement by Disney, followed by a 30sec. animation to wrap-up part of one of the stories, by the way).The music is magnificent, graphics are jaw-dropping (3D is a must). I watched both versions, loved both but for the short at the beginning the 3D is suggested.There are undeniable similarities with Tangled, on the main character faces and other dynamics in the movie, but it stands by itself for the story, its powerful message and for the best animation ever.Frozen offers a wonderful entertainment for all ages and it will definitely be a movie to own in a near future.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Frozen,"Review By Kamal KThe story is heart melting, filled with the pure feeling and heart that has become a staple with the best Disney movies. It is a moving story that has family at its center. It is unpretentious in what it is trying to portray. The comedy hits right on the mark and the action packed adventure and thrilling journey make this a tale with a little bit of everything in the exact right amounts. It is a daring movie that is laugh out loud at the some moments and stunning and provoking at others. All achieved in balance. A true triumph in story telling that proves exactly what Disney does best and again proving that they are back to producing top quality films. This is an affecting human story, one that is significant.Startling and stunning, beautifully envisioned, emotionally powerful and relevant. Gorgeous visuals, stunning backdrops and intricacies like you have never seen before. The environments, the costumes, the character movements among other things make this film a gigantic step forward. The brilliant voice talents that breath life into this project need to be applauded and then some. The cast consisting of Kristen bell (Veronica Mars) and Idina Menzel(Wicked!)among many others bring winning charm, superior voice acting and magnificent vocals as well as heart to this tale. The sensational wit and humor, the arrays of different personalities, their emotions, their triumphs and falls make them some of the most interesting characters that people can relate to and some of the best i have seen in animation. The cast fully become the characters.The score and music is perfect. The score is grand. The sound, the texture, the harmony, the melody is in a class of its own. Above and beyond anything attempted by the animation studio in the past decade. A true all round musical triumph. Songs that will be stuck in your mind and you will be humming them and you won't even know it. Songs that progress the story and an essential part of it.So you have meticulously crafted breath taking animation, an affecting tale of the bond of family, romance, hilarious wit and humor courtesy of the characters especially sweet Olaf and heart stopping adventure. A true fairy tale that i would say could very well be The Little Mermaid or The Beauty and The Beast of this generation.FROZEN has that Disney MAGIC that has been missing for so long and it comes in full force here.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Most Overrated movie of all time!,"Yep Frozen, the beloved animated movie of 2013 is very overrated. The story is okay at best, many clichés and just plain annoying characters really hurt this film for me. Okay i'll admit it, Frozen probably isn't targeted at my age group, but that still makes me wonder how it got all those amazing reviews when the film is clearly targeted at younger children. This doesn't mean Frozen is a bad movie(I gave it 6 stars) it's just very heavily aimed at children, so expect the annoying characters,jokes that just aren't humorous, and the predictable plot. The redeeming factor of Frozen is it's soundtrack: the soundtrack is something special every song on it is great! 'Let it Go' is naturally the stand out song but others like 'Do you want to build a Snowman' are also great. Songs aside Frozen is just another typical animated movie, full of clichés, predictable outcomes and annoying characters.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Such different sisters or a successful experiment of the Evil Corporation,"A family musical. It was in the recent 2014. I still worked in the Soyuz chain of stores, and I remember perfectly well what a buzz there was about this cartoon at that time. How everyone praised him, how he instantly disappeared from the shelf, because he did not stay long. Moreover, they bought an expensive DVD edition for four hundred rubles, and, of course, they snapped up Blu-ray, and of course Blu-ray 3D for a piece (who, of course, had such money and suitable equipment). I was so tired of this nonsense that I couldn't stand it and bought myself a Blu-ray for seven hundred rubles and watched this cartoon - and was pleasantly surprised and even partially agreed with most viewers that they praised this creation of the Evil Corporation. I decided to review it recently - and the cartoon is still good, beautiful, and on the eve of the New Year I decided to write a review on it. And here's my brief opinion for you - A successful experiment of the Evil Corporation. However, I must warn you that I will indicate not only the obvious advantages of the cartoon, but also the disadvantages, which are also there, and you should not forget about them. This concludes such a long and tedious introduction and gets to the point.So, the obvious advantages:
1. The script - finally, thirteen years after the release of the first ""Shrek"", the Evil Corporation decided to change the basic concept of its cartoons, which has already filled everyone's teeth, and not only turn everything upside down, but also make fun of it. Of course, the beginning of the ""Cold Heart"" is stamped, but it's even good, because they were afraid to scare off their key audience from the very first frames, so the beginning is ordinary, but then it started. Two princesses, and sisters. One is cheerful and cheerful, the other is sullen and withdrawn, while without five minutes the queen. They quarrel, because of which the second escapes, turning the kingdom into a land of eternal cold. Now the first one needs to find the second one. Along the way, there are friends, and so on. In short, I am sure that you have watched the cartoon and you know everything perfectly well. The script is based on Andersen's fairy tale ""The Snow Queen"", from which only the names of the characters remain in the ""Cold Heart"". The main villain here is none other than the prince. What a turn! A bold move, and especially in the Russian version, because it is duplicated by Dima Bilan. The ending is predictable, but we approached it a little from the other side, and I must say, quite convincingly. A bold experiment, especially for the Evil Corporation.2. Humor is childish, naive, funny, playful, and at the same time not annoying. Both an adult and a child will laugh heartily. Humor here does not shine with originality, there is no double bottom, word games or super-intellectual jokes, rather ordinary humor associated with romance, adventure, friendship and blood ties.3. Animation - that's why you can praise the ""Cold Heart"" for a long time and hard, because from a technical point of view and visually there is complete order (not counting a couple of small shoals that do not play a big role). After all, animation is a long and painstaking business. This is not a movie where you were filmed on camera and repeated several times if you didn't like something. Snowflakes, snow-covered expanses, weather effects, characters, surroundings, magic, atmosphere - all this is clearly done with love, and not just because of the big money of one big Corporation. Artists, designers, programmers - all these people have done a great job so that we, ordinary viewers, could watch this beauty through televisions after a hard day's work. You can sort out the animation for a long time, literally by frames, but I've already said it decently, so we'll finish this.4. Bright and charismatic characters - both our main young ladies Anna and Elsa, men Christoph and Hans, Sven the deer, and secondary, representatives of other kingdoms, residents of Arendelle. But my most favorite character was, is, and will forever be the funny and kind snowman Olaf, dreaming of a hot summer. Each of them, something, and is remembered. Of course, they are all hackneyed types, but they are well served here, and some even changed their character traits, which was a bold move for the Evil Corporation, again, I repeat.5"" ""Let go and forget"" - in the original ""Let it Go"". The song that, after the release of this cartoon, literally conquered the whole world, and only the lazy one did not sing it (I'm just one of those). And the Russian version has become no less a hit in the former USSR than the original English one. The song is about the struggle with oneself, about feelings that are bursting out, about the strength of the person himself. It is impossible to count how many times the song was remade, how many voices did not sing it. The song is great and deserves its popularity. And the rest of the songs from the cartoon are good, but ""Let Go and Forget"" stands at the top, and after all, it was she who snatched the Oscar.So, no less obvious disadvantages:
1. Feminist message - if you calm down your delight and think about the cartoon, then this fact will become obvious - all representatives of the male tribe are represented here either by fools or scoundrels. There is no third one here. But women are both strength, and courage, and courage, and fortitude. Even the main message about true love here clearly echoes the entire scenario line. Why did the writers present the men so one-sidedly? What have we done to them? It's a shame damn.2. Logic - there are many questions to the logic of this whole fairy-tale world, and if we delve into it, it turns out that the script is not so ""brilliant"" as many believe. The script echoes emotions and feelings, but the viewer forgets about logic at this time. Awareness comes later, when feelings have cooled down and emotions have subsided.3. The third dimension is already purely my pen, but I am madly in love with classic two-dimensional animation. I grew up on it, and I can't stand this fashionable third dimension of yours. That's why I can't watch most modern cartoons. There are exceptions, but there are quite a few of them.A little bit about the main characters:
1. Anna is the Princess of Arendelle, kind, cheerful, cheerful, who loves her reserved sister Elsa. The classic princess of the Evil Corporation. A cute and kind character who is simply impossible to spoil. She behaves like a young and flighty girl, and this is not surprising, especially if you remember the conditions in which she and her sister grew up. Yes, and a good name. Anna means ""benevolent"". Throughout the cartoon, she shows courage and determination, perseverance, because she is ready to sacrifice her life for her sister. A whole pen!2. Elsa is Anna's older sister, unlike whom she is withdrawn and preoccupied with her magical power, which she is not able to control. Having flared up, he escapes to the mountains, while enveloping his kingdom in eternal winter. What can I say, it had to happen sooner or later (thanks to short-sighted parents). But at heart she is as kind and cheerful as Anna. And what an outfit she conjured up for herself! Mmm, fantastic!3. Olaf is a talking snowman that Anna meets on her way. A cute and kind character who dreams of summer. He also shows courage and determination at a crucial moment, and a very deep and wise thought comes out of his mouth, which cannot be forgotten.Of course, such an experiment paid off, and thanks to ""word of mouth"" brought a huge profit. Therefore, in 2019, a direct sequel to ""Cold Heart 2"" was released, which I did not watch, but I may take a look (but I'm afraid to be very disappointed), but a few short films should be checked out immediately. So I'm wrapping it up.What a pity that after the release of the first cartoon, the Evil Corporation took a different path, which will not lead it to the best end, and we will not see any more masterpieces. Although ""Cold Heart"" is clearly not a masterpiece. It's just a good cartoon that will not leave anyone indifferent.As a result, we have a good cartoon of the Evil Corporation with a non-trivial script, the most magnificent animation, an excellent song, good humor and the right moral message.My rating is 8 out of 10 and my recommendation for viewing!P. S. I wish you all a Happy New Year! Let all the bad things remain in the old, and in the new let all your most cherished dreams come true. And Olaf congratulates you too (he asked me to personally tell you!). Good luck and health to everyone!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Review of Frozen,"Frozen's not a bad movie but it certainly isn't one of Disney's best. The film had memorable songs, unfortunately, those songs are also annoyingly catchy, not too different to songs such as What Does the Fox Say? and Never Gonna Give You Up. As for the characters, they don't really have much to bring to the table. Elsa was an interesting character, but the rest were all meh. Anna and Kristoff were Rapunze and Flynn, Sven was Flynn's horse if he was a reindeer, Olaf was Patrick Star if he was a snowman, and Hans, not that great of a villain. Overall, the film had its ups and downs, but it is good enough for me for it to earn a solid score.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A Lot Of Fun,"Because I have younger siblings, I am exposed to Disney animated movies more than I probably would be by myself. Usually, when I see one of the better ones, I can pinpoint exactly what I like about it. For Toy Story, it is the ability to relate to the characters. In Tangled, for instance, it was a story so sad you couldn't help but root for the protagonist. With Frozen, however, I can't put my finger on ""one reason"" why I liked it so much...it was kind of more of a ""package deal"".For a basic plot summary, Frozen tells the story of two sisters born of royal blood, Elsa (Idina Menzel) and Anna (Kristen Bell). While very close as young sisters, the women drift apart in adulthood after an accident in which Elsa's ice-creating magical powers hurts Elsa. Determined not to hurt anyone ever again, Elsa absconds the royalty and creates her own castle far into the wilderness. The only problem? She has left her hometown in a perpetual state of winter. As such, young sis Anna sets out to find Elsa and set things right, along the way meeting up with mountain-man Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) and snowman-come-to-life Olaf (Josh Gad).Like I said, there is no one thing about this movie that really makes it stand out compared to previous Disney efforts. It is just the combination of everything that make it such an enjoyable experience. The story is engaging, the characters are interesting, humor abounds, the visuals are astounding, and the music is enthralling. There never seems to be a lacking moment in the whole 104-minute spectacle.So, despite not being able to hang my hat on that ""one attribute"", Frozen is primarily such an enjoyable experience because it has a little bit of everything. I could see myself watching it again in the near future!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Over-hyped for sure, but not bad. Worth a watch or two.","I'd say Frozen is worth your time. There are a lot of clever ideas to be seen in this spectacular effort which threw Disney back on top of the animation hierarchy after a slowly coming back with the previously released ""Wreck-it Ralph"", ""Tangled"" and ""The Princess and the Frog"".I at first fell into the ""hate it""-camp, but decided to watch it anyway to form my own opinion. I was positively surprised.I think the musical score has a the most memorable numbers to come out of the Disney company since ""Tarzan"". ""Let It Go"" is a catchy tune and even though it has been played to death it certainly deserves credit. The scene in which it is played is simply astounding. ""For the First Time In Forever"" serves the movie well, because it moves the story forward just like ""Do You Wanna Build a Snow Man"". That is the purpose of songs in musicals. I wasn't very keen on Olaf's and the Tolls' songs to be honest. The Trolls' song felt out of place and Olaf's did not add very much to the story.It was pleasant to have Olaf as a more quiet comic relief instead of loudly yelling ones from movies like ""Treasure Planet"" and ""Bolt"". Olaf's relationship obsession with summer was funny and had a good and heartfelt pay-off in the end.The animation is along with the music the highlight of the movie. It was beautiful, nothing more to say.The movie also makes fun of earlier Disney clichés like falling in love with one you just met. That is clever, and I enjoyed it all the way through.Sounds like a flawless movie? Think again! The villain is not good. Even though he explained his motivations which were decently clever, it felt forced. It was one of those last-minute villains.I think overall the hype has killed a generally well done movie. I think Frozen is good, but not among the greatest Disney animated movies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

I don't understand the hate for this.,"For those who rate this movie below a 7. That is not correct, sure opinions are opinions, but that doesn't mean this movie is the worst in the Disney line-up. In fact it is one of Disney's best in years. The story while lacks in some areas, works well in its favor and follows well with the characters we get to know. The characters are very memorable, from the quirky Anna who never gives up on Elsa, to Olaf who was created from the good side of Elsa who only a wants to be with her sister. The songs are one of Disneys, best returning to that classic form we all know and love from the reinassance and golden ages. Is it the best? No, I grew up with the Reinassance from the Little Mermaid to Tarzan and can say Frozen stands alongside the classics. The animation is one of the best Disney has ever done that will still be good years from now to look back on. The only minor flaws to the movie is the transitions into the songs, the ""villain"" of the movie, and the setup for the ending.Overall, the movie does not deserve the hate is getting and deserves the praise. This is the something that happened to the Lion King back in 94, except the internet didn't exist so it wasn't that big of a deal. If you haven't see the movie yet, I and many other Disney fans can recommend this film. Don't listen to the 1-5/10 ratings on here there more than likely either jealous, on the hate wagon, or just forgot what makes a Disney movie great. I love and grew up with all the classic Disney movies and consider this part of the classic line-up. Ignore the hate and enjoy a great movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Frozen is a wonderful movie,"Frozen is a wonderful movie that everyone needs to see, because it is a heartwarming movie for the whole family to enjoy.

If you like Disney movies then you will love Frozen it is a magical movie that is just a movie that everyone will remember year after year. Now there is one part that maybe a little scary for the little ones but besides that they will love the playfulness in this movie that won Oscars. It is one of my favorite Disney movies and I hope it is one of your favorite Disney movies too. It is just not a kid movie it is fun for the whole family to enjoy. So grab some popcorn and a soda and watch Frozen in 2D or wonderful 3D hope u enjoy everyone",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Why is this movie so adored?,"Most likely from my summary line, you have guessed that I wasn't thrilled by this Disney animated film. I hadn't watched one of Disney's (new) animated movies for a number of years, since I started to find them formulaic and repeating the same elements over and over. I only broke down and watched this one after hearing so much hype and praise for it for so long. And after watching it, I'm glad that I didn't shell out any money to see it (I got the Blu-ray from my local library.) I admit that it's not completely awful - the movie does LOOK good, with first rate animation as well as bright and vibrant colors. But the scripting leaves a lot to be desired. It's a pretty predictable (and very Disney) script, with plot developments and character actions that you'll likely see coming a mile away. And the comedy relief is bland at its best, and downright annoying at its worst. As for the songs, they all pretty much sounded the same, made worse by the constant forced rhymes and other clunky lyrical elements; even the Oscar-winning ""Let It Go"" is a disappointment. Any animated movie produced by Walt Disney during his lifetime is much better than this one (even ""The Sword in the Stone"" was better than this!) Incidentally, I heard that they are making a sequel to this movie. Oh boy, I can hardly wait.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Not great, but good for what it is","Frozen had a good concept going for it with some great moments between anna and elsa, which were the best parts of the movie. it also had some really nice looking animation and some catchy songs i guess we'll see how that goes, but i felt there was an over-abundance of singing in the first twenty minutes. i feel like we could've had an incredible ""up"" moment here were this span of time is told visually with a strong soundtrack playing over it (not a song). maybe that's just because i thought of how great the first ten minutes of up are though, but i really think it could've fit well here. it really started to lose it's steam after the conflict began for me but it turned around with the midpoint, which is good, but i feel like more substance could've been put in that beginning portion. i also saw the main ""villain twist"" coming a mile away, that could've been from my inner conscience remembering the movie or an inner sense of pessimism towards the greed of being in line for the crown, or just knowing disney twists. by the end i was invested in the relationship of the two sisters, although probably not as much as the younger audience the movie was aimed for. i chuckled a few times, but a lot of the comedy didn't land particularly hard for me, although i understand this is a children's movie. there was also a really odd transition after one of olaf's jokes that completely took me out of the movie. overall i think it was a fine movie and im looking forward to the sequel because from the trailers it seems it digs deeper into the dramatic elements eluded to in this one. 6/10My Rating System:1/10- hot garbage

I really wanted FROZEN to be perfect :'(,"I am an all-the-way Disney girl. Always have, always will.QUICK COMMENT: Everything expected from Disney. Heart-melting moments, light humor, clever twists, happy ending, cheerful songs, stunning picture, etc. GO Disney! I gave this an 8/10 because of the mediocre songs and the occasional voice mismatch. (explained below)VOICE MISMATCH: In the beginning, I was captivated by Frozen. But when Elsa started to sing in the ice castle, I was rudely awakened from my dream back into reality by the mismatch of Idina's voice as Elsa. I couldn't believe my ears. I even checked on my remote control briefly to see if someone pressed anything that changed the sound setting or whatever. For the first time in my life, (after watching various Disney movies like 300 times), I couldn't bring myself to believe what I was watching. The graphics seemed separated from the soundtrack. This really breaks my heart because I am a Disney believer :'( I want everything Disney to be perfect. This is so unlike Disney.It's not just me, most people around me agrees with me. And the ones who didn't agree could see where I was coming from. Finally another person wrote this in his/her review:***"" Idina Menzel was miscast. Her speaking voice was almost acceptable, but singing-wise, it didn't suit Elsa at all.""***I think he/she sums up my only complaint very well.But please don't get me wrong. I love Idina Menzel. She is beautiful and massively talented. The problem is, I can never match Elsa with her voice. I am truly disappointed by the casting decision :'( But maybe its just me. Anyway, overall, it is still a very Disney movie. Enjoy it and love it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A chill movie to relax,"I like it. It's good. I don't have any problems with it. The songs are good for a kids musical. Definitely not one of my favorite movies or anything crazy like that. Just a normal, sit down and relax movie. I think it deserved the Oscar, considering all the animated movies from 2013, although I like Despicable Me 2 a bit more. Nothing else to be really said about this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A wonderful story with sing a long songs,"Frozen is a wonderful Disney movie in the true spirit with sing a long songs and lovable characters. Kids go mad for the toys and are singing all the songs every minute of everyday.I credit Menzel and Bell for the storyline, film score.Its a film that can be enjoyed by children of all ages including the big ones! Personal experience shows during the theatrical performance none of the kids wanted for bathroom or snacks there were just engrossed in the film.I can honestly say that its been a while since a film could do that. Now the only critique is the kids won't stop playing it over and over. Thank god for digital otherwise I think they would have worn out a VHS tape by now :)",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Disney at its best,"Frozen brings me back to Disney's renaissance. I haven't felt so immerse and loved a Disney (not Pixar) movie since a long long time. It makes me wish the characters were real, makes me want a sequel (and that's saying A LOT considering Disney's history with sequels). As I said before, it brings me back to the good old Disney days, but it's also a big step forward, why? Because Frozen breaks the traditional clichés and things that were characteristic from the old movies (doesn't mean they're bad, it just that we're not in the damsel in distress' era). I don't want to spoil a single thing about the movie, if you haven't seen it, DO IT. It's a must watch, and it's not a kids picture, but a family one. It has received a lot of hate nowadays, after thinking about it and looking at some comments I understood it. The hate comes in a great part because of the movie's popularity, everywhere you go you see Frozen. After some time you star thinking ""ha, why is this movie so popular? It's not that good, no, I hate it, everything about it is bad, it's not the new Lion King"" etc. So they start overanalazing the movie and try to find every flaw it can have, almost every complaint it's about plot holes (when actually, you can understand almost everything if you use logic). In summary, Frozen is a very good movie, worth watching and a big step for Disney.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"It's Good, Not Great, Just Let it Go","I had a unique experience in watching ""Frozen"". I was late to the game, everyone seemed to be talking about it and singing its praises. I looked forward to it with some anticipation, it had been a long time since Disney released a film that has this type of hype around it. Previous ones were all based on well-known fairy tales, so I knew going into the movie pretty much what I was going to get. But with ""Frozen"", I had no idea what the film was about. I hadn't even seen any trailers for the thing, people were just telling me to see it.I finally got an opportunity to watch the film. I was really enjoying it, the film had just concluded its big ""Let it Go"" musical number, and then the fire alarm went off and we all left the dollar theatre. I became really curious how the film was going to end. I started coming up with my own predictions for where the movie might go. I then had to go and rent the movie to finish where I left off. I started from the beginning and this time watched until the end. And boy, there is a serious drop in quality going from the second half from the first half.The quality of songs peaked with ""Let it Go"", which won the film an Oscar. But, ""Make a Snowman"", ""First time in Forever"" and ""Love is an Open Door"" are all quite good as well. I don't hear many supporters for ""Summertime"" or ""Reindeer are better than People"". And ""Fixer Upper"" is one of Disney's worst songs, and that's the final song of the movie. The movie kind of forgets that it's a musical part way through.Like most movies, ""Frozen"" went through a lot of different drafts. One of the main sticking points with the writers was what to do with Elsa. And up to the second to last draft, Elsa was still planned as the main villain of the picture. But executives found that they could sell more merchandise if they kept her as a hero. Due to this late in the game change, there are a lot of plot points that just feel forced. A lot of plot contrivances and dumb decisions that lead the second half feeling disjointed.Now, I don't want to sound overly harsh on this film. Just due to how its seen as a modern animation classic, I feel the need to bring it back down to Earth. The songs I mentioned are really good. Olaf does a fine job as comedic relief, not overstaying his welcome (in this film anyways). I like how more of the comedic beats can come from our main characters. Anna can have some real funny moments. And the voice actors all do an incredible job. I like the ending conclusion and think that what makes it work is the sisterly bond built up in the first half.So, I'm not completely cold hearted. There are just some elements of the story that I think got overbaked with too many cooks.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
My favorite Disney movie,"When Frozen came out I didn't care much about it, and I don't ever want to watch it, I think it was for kids. But when my classmate told me that Frozen is a very interesting and funny and great movie, I released I was wrong. My sixth sense told me that I must watch this film. Before I watch this movie, we sang the songs that are from Frozen in the music class, that's my first time listen Frozen' s music, the music is so beautiful that I never hear before. After that I wish I can watch Frozen, and that day came.I brought my heart to feel the movie, my brain to memorize the movie, my ears to hear the movie, that's all I got. I went to cinema with my family, I was exciting. After watching Frozen, I found my favorite Disney film. Disney had made many good film, but this is a one I fall in love with. I love the main character Elsa, even she is so afraid of her power...She is a great sister, she cares much about her sister Anna, Elsa hid herself because she didn't want to hurt people and family, especially Anna, she wants to protect them from her. That's the reason why I love Elsa. And I was so jealous of Anna, because she has a nice sister who is so cares of her.Anna is a optimistic and innocent character, I like her personality, but I like Elsa more. I can see a different me from Anna. And I like the part when Elsa hugged Anna, it made me cry. I remember ""Only the true love can thaw a frozen heart"". I thought the Anna's true love is Kristoff... I think no one guess right the end. And there is a part I like too, yes, is the part that Elsa was singing and made a ice castle. ""Let it go"" the song told me everything. The film taught me, don't listen to the people who want to hurts you, just be yourself. Elsa had hide and be afraid of her power, she has carried a big pressure when she was young until now. And this time, she can let it go, be herself, don't need to care much.Actually, I learned many things from Frozen, the things that are important and useful in my life. Frozen is one of my favorite cartoon film, it is a most powerful film I have seen. I watched Frozen five times, and I still want to watch it. I want to say my thank to Disney, that they have made this greatly film. I wish there will have many greatly film come out, the film like Frozen. After Frozen Fever came out, I was more exciting. Perhaps there is Frozen 2.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
This movie is Disney's best,Believe all of the hype. Cause it's real. The story is inspiring and takes unexpected turns. Just amazing. The music is honestly some of the best you'll ever hear. I would give this movie 100 stars if I could.,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Let it go (someone's gotta tell this),"Quite possibly one of Disney's best, esp. considering that it's been a long time in the making, this adaptation of 'The snow queen' is a nice little throwback, that 'Tangled' and 'The princess and the frog' set out to achieve earlier without (much, esp. of the rousing kind) success. Well-etched characters, a good screenplay, retaining tried- and-tested formulae without making it seem like re-treads, this one's a keeper (and oh, I'm choosing to ignore a couple of plot-holes along the way).Loved the tracks 'Let it go' (the movie-sequence one more than the version rendered during the end-credits), 'Do you want to build a snowman', and 'In summer'.Missed the post-credits sequence (was not aware there was gonna be one), so others reading this can wait and listen to Demi Lovato render 'Let it go' (and compare it with Idina Menzel's own) before it comes on (the Marvel takeover seems to have 'influenced' Disney for these kinda sequences, huh?).(On my 2nd viewing, I waited all the way until all the credits were done, just to have the projectionist in PVR Bengaluru Audi 9 switch it off, leaving the video on, so that our imagination could fill in the gaps)Got to watch it on 3D with Dolby Atmos, so there was that. Might end up watching it once again, since I'm traveling next week. Btw, this one needs 3D viewing, and the excess ticket fare IS justified, so go for it.FYI, the BW Mickey Mouse sequence (pre-title), though not laugh-out-loud hilarious, is cute, and seems to portend a new direction for Mickey and gang (including Big Bad Pete, though a vvvv imp character is missed). Developments awaited... Question - will the trolls become the next Minions and get their own movie?",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Is There Really Anything New Anyone Can Say About Frozen at this Point?,"Strangely, of the two theatrical Frozen films, I'm more familiar with the sequel than this one. That said, Frozen will probably be - for the foreseeable future - THE film that I think of when I think of Disney.This may be an unpopular opinion, but this film stands head and shoulders above the films (that I've seen) which are referred to as ""Disney Classics."" I understand that some of the misdirection of certain character tropes is a bit on-the-nose most of the time, and the story maybe isn't the most airtight ever imagined, but what this film lacks in certain areas of writing, it makes up for in the characters and the soundtrack.The characters are extremely likable in their own way. I remember many reviews of this film when this was new saying that Olaf either had the potential to be annoying or was annoying, but I found him to be fine. His voice acting makes him to be a more unique character as far as side characters in these types of films go and I think it was well executed.The humor in this film is quite good. I didn't laugh at all of the jokes but the ones I did I thought were genuinely funny. The strongest joke in this film, for me, (not to give away any spoilers) has to do with a sled.The soundtrack for Frozen is superb. A lot of the same motifs are brought back again, and again, but every time that happens, it's recontextualized by the imagery in the film and does not feel repetitive as a result. The songs are like listening to an album where every song is Top 10 material while also being substantial in their own individual ways. The first 35 minutes or so of this film are hit after hit and it just keeps going. I cannot compliment the quality of this film's soundtrack enough, and this aspect alone is what sets in apart as superior to the vast majority of the classic Disney films.As someone virtually untouched by the insane popularity Frozen received in the year after its release, I'm able to experience this film from a fairly neutral perspective and as a result, I can say that this film raises the bar for what makes a modern Disney classic. I think this will stand the test of time and I reckon those who experienced this film as children will probably have the same attachment to Frozen as older generations did with films like Cinderella or Beauty and the Beast.I can't recommend it enough.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Let It Snow!,"This film is recommended.What film could be more appropriate on a extremely cold winter night than Disney's computer animated film, Frozen. The film is loosely (very loosely) based on the Hans Christian Anderson fairy tale, The Snow Queen. In this new version, catered for today's modern audience, we meet two sisters, Anna (Kristen Bell), the good princess (what else!) and Elsa (Idina Menzel), the slightly cold but mostly misunderstood older sister (of course). Both are polar opposite in looks and personality and have that Disney cuteness going for them, but character-wise, they are distinctly different, even if the film adheres to the same crowd-pleasing conventional formula (with a few unexpected twists along the way).This plot involves the estranged relationship of two princesses. Elsa, who becomes Queen, has secret uncontrollable super powers that create endless snow and icy cold fronts that end up distancing her from her younger sibling and plaguing her kingdom. Anna sets out to rectify this problem and on her journey meets a handsome prince (there's always one per fairy tale), voiced by Santino Fontana. She befriends a handsome mountain man, Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) and for comic relief, his not-too-bright silent reindeer friend named Sven. We also have an even dumber sidekick, Olaf, a funny snowman who yearns to experience summer. (This character flaw leads to a wonderful musical number, In Summer, with a dream sequence that is one of the film's more successful moments.)Solidly directed by Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee, both of whom co-authored the script along with Shane Morris, Frozen has scenes that rival many Disney classics in their artistry. (Particularly memorable are an outing with trolls and the film's glorious sequence when the kingdom is trapped under a snowy mix and goes from lush greens to icy whites.) But, like other animated films of late, the film runs into script problems that prevent it from becoming a truly great children's film, with too many overly adorable interludes. Much of the dialog uses too many anachronistic phrases and modern jargon that seem totally out of sync with this tale. A few more re-writes could have taken this film to that level of excellence. ￼ Still, the animation is first-rate. The action sequences are beautifully staged and vividly detailed with lovely textures contrasting the reflective ice and powdery snow. Disturbingly, the two main female characters are such dated generic princess types with huge bug eyes and ultra-thin Barbie waists, perfect for the next new line of Disney toys but certainly not PC correct. (So much for the feminist movement!)Frozen remains a worthy visual achievement. The 3-D effects are effectively handled. The voice-over work by Kristen Bell, Idina Menzel, Jonathan Groff, Santino Fontana and especially Josh Gad is perfection, with Alan Tudyk and Claran Hinds also providing strong support. Most of their Broadway talents come in handy with the film's strong musical score by Christophe Beck and jaunty songs by the husband-and-wife songwriting team, Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez. (The power ballad, Let It Go, sung by Menzel is the film's musical highlight.) ￼ Frozen is wholesome family entertainment and a fine musical treat for all ages. The film a hearty blend of stylish animation and charming story, one of Disney's best efforts in a long while. Frozen will thaw the heart of many a Grinch this holiday season and delight many moviegoers with its visual splendor. GRADE: BVisit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.comNOTE: Back in the early 1940's, Disney wanted to produce a film about Hans Christian Anderson, incorporating his stories into a mix of live action and hand-drawn animation, with one of the fairy tale segments to include The Snow Queen.

Pretty well done,"Another well done movie by Walt Disney Animation Studios. Great voice cast, great music, and a great heart-warming story like all of the studio's past films (and certainly ""heart-warming"" in this one). As usual with pretty much all of the studio's films (especially their 3D graphic ones), very nicely detailed and very well made central characters. The glass in Elsa's ice palace was especially very realistic looking.

This is a compelling movie for both adults and children. This is easily a 10/10 and must see.,"Frozen (2013) is a movie we watched when it first came out and 1,000 times again since then.

This film immediately stepped onto the Disney Classic list upon its release - this had the perfect storyline on par with the all time greats. The animation was fantastic, magical and compelling.

Characters are as you would expect in a Disney movie/fairy tale. Rakishly charming males. Fiercely petite females.

I mean, I thought the rock trolls were oddly placed in the movie. Their purpose didn't really make sense to me. And as for the songs? Meh. I thought they were mostly forgettable. The story was okay.

A nice try but overrated for its simplicity,"I watched Frozen back when it was a big craze, and honestly, I don't quite understand the overwhelming hype. Sure, the visuals are impressive, and ""Let It Go"" is catchy, but once you look past the surface, it's a pretty standard Disney story with very little depth.The tale of two sisters, Elsa and Anna, who struggle to connect because of Elsa's ice powers, has potential but ends up feeling overly simplistic. The characters lack complexity, and their motivations aren't always clear or relatable.The conflict feels too easily resolved, and the plot twists are predictable, especially when it comes to the main villain. It's also hard to ignore how quickly the story wraps everything up after building so much tension around Elsa's powers. The animation is lovely, but even that doesn't fully compensate for a plot that ultimately doesn't offer anything memorable. For kids, it's likely a magical experience, but for older audiences, it feels like a pretty movie without enough substance.

One of Disney's best,"When I first saw the teaser trailer for Frozen in the theater, I was only mildly interested. Sure, it was funny enough, but nothing really special; just a snowman and a reindeer engaging in some slapstick. Then, when the movie came out, all I heard about was how good it is, how amazing the songs were, and things like that. This lead to me getting very interested in seeing it, and eventually I got the movie when it was released on DVD. And I loved it.Frozen is a heartwarming, well-done, and beautifully animated movie proving that Disney is back as a quality animation company. The songs are great; my personal favorites were ""Let it Go"" and ""For the First Time in Forever."" Olaf, despite what I had initially expected, was (in my opinion) Disney'd best comic relief sidekick since The Lion King. He wasn't even in the more emotional/serious scenes, and during the scenes he was in, he was actually pretty funny. I liked that Frozen focused more on familial love than romantic love. The twist at the end is surprising (or it would be if it hadn't become a case of It Was His Sled). Also, Elsa was a complex, interesting character, and she's definitely one of my all-time favorites.My only complaint is the fact that Disney has gotten really lazy with their models for female characters. Anna, Elsa, and their mother are pretty much the same woman with different hair colors, hair styles, and eye colors. I believe a Disney animator actually said that they took Anna's model and tweaked it slightly to make Elsa. I know they're related, but come on. The fact that they also look remarkably similar to Rapunzel (and that Honey Lemon in Disney's upcoming Big Hero Six looks just like Rapunzel) really doesn't help matters.Overall, Frozen was a great, enjoyable movie. I would definitely recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
a bit disappointed,"SPOILERI must say that after all the noises made around FROZEN, my expectations were quite high. I took my kids to watch it at the movie on a Saturday morning, it was played 3D so we were all very excited. Unfortunately the movie (at least the story line) did not meet the level of quality I had expected. I thought the movie was going to be about the Snow Queen Elsa, I mean her as the main character. Instead most of the movie is seen through the eyes of her sister Anna, who is funny, charming and all but that's it, that was a let down to me. The beginning was promising but .. Plus to be honest, I did not find the songs particularly nice, (except the very first one sang by the men cutting the ice) Most songs were even annoying at a point, sorry for the fans. I was also disappointed that Elsa did not have a love interest, someone who would discover and appreciate her qualities, her gentleness, and re vive the flame in her lonely heart (this is so not Disney), I honestly thought that Kristof who fulfill this role due to his love for ice and snow etc, but no, he ends up with Anna who has already experienced a romance with prince Hanz ? Poor Elsa. Now the positive point is the animation, the 3-d effects, WAOW that is something. Well done to the crew who worked on that! OVERALL, i give it a 7 for the visual quality of the movie but to me it will not be as memorable as other princess Disney movies. My daughter too was disappointed she said.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A heartwarming feature.,"I hate musicals, I really do. Never liked them. But when it comes to animation, I am more forgiving but still I do not prefer them. Frozen I must say is a pretty darn good one in this case.The story is a heartwarming sisterhood bond at its core layered with frozen fantasy. And it was handled pretty well. You cannot help but enjoy and delve into it. IT is refreshing to see a female lead animated movie that is well told. Both the sisters are great and have good character development and are very likable, especially the younger one. And that is mainly because of awesome voice acting by Kristen bell. I just loved it. Other characters were good too. Really liked that living snowman, he was really funny.The animation was great. The frozen stuff looked awesome. Also, Disney sure knows how to make great looking female characters. Both the sisters were beautiful. I feel like I have a crush on both of them. :p :pThe soundtrack was pretty good with some great pieces in it. Most of the songs were good too. Let it go especially, by far my favourite one in the movie. That being said, the frequency of the songs was a little too much and it was really annoying. There were certain moments where they really shouldn't have added a song.Overall, a very good heartwarming animated film.7.8/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Quality Disney production, maybe a little too much singing","Those who have not seen Frozen probably still heard ""Let it go"", a song from the movie that went viral on social media and was impossible to escape. It is a good song and Frozen has several good songs, all of which would be great on a separately sold album, but it feels like Frozen is trying to stick all this music down the viewer's throat. Together with the score, the music takes up so much of the movie that it leaves very little space for the movie to breathe.The score was written by the seasoned composer Christophe Beck. It is haunting and magical, with use of very high-pitched notes to give it the icy sparkle. The action scenes are filled with aggressive percussion that would not feel out of place in an epic war scene. A bit of Norwegian choir gives the score a local colour. The one negative is that there is no main theme. Christophe incorporates some of the phrases from the songs to create cohesion, but there is nothing structural to sink your teeth into.The story is about a Nordic princess with ice superpowers that end up causing her and her kingdom a lot of trouble as she struggles to control those powers.What is nice about the plot is that it is not obvious or overly simplistic. The whole thing has a welcome asymmetry about it. From the moment I saw the positer, I had Andersen's Snow Queen fairytale in my mind, and while the movie is inspired by and borrows from Snow Queen, it is also doing its own thing.There's been a discussion about the non-standard ending. I have mixed feelings about it. It breaks with the old Disney standards, which is both refreshing an annoying. On the one hand, the modern political landscape has made it impossible for the prince to save the princess, and whenever I feel like gender politics have invaded my movie, it immediately ruins the immersion. On the other hand, breaking with the old formula is refreshing.There is nothing special about the acting though. A few months after seeing the movie, the only memorable character is the comic relief snowman, Olaf, played by Josh Gad. The rest of the characters are a bit generic. Of course, the two male and the two female leads are pretty and shaped like protagonists. Their voices are not memorable either, other than Idina Menzel's ability of hitting some really high pitches.Frozen paces itself and knows when to strike the viewer with the money shot to make an impression. The ice effects are pretty. The snow does not require a lot of texture or colour, but does poses its own challenges when animating its movement. There is not much texture, and there is a soft rounded look to everything.In short, there is a little too much overhyped music in this musical, but it's nice to see an off-beat Scandinavian adventure.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Frozen is a wonderful movie,"Frozen - expecting it to be as good as tangled. You will be singing the songs over and over.Nevertheless, Elsa's ""Let It Go"" sequence is among the finest moments ever created in Disney history, and as a whole, the film is visually breathtaking.A true triumph in story telling that proves exactly what Disney does best and again proving that they are back to producing top quality films. This is an affecting human story, one that is significant.This is my favorite movie of the year so far, and may even be my favorite movie in years. I highly recommend this one!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
I love it!,"I love this movie. It makes me want to be like a princess in a movie. Disney did a good job with this one. I love how everyone came together to change things and make it better. Frozen is a good movien, and I would suggest that everyone go see it. I hope they make another one (sequel). It would be awesome. It would be nice to bet the voice for one of the characters. They are so fun and funny. I just love really good animated movies like this one. They are good for the whole family to see. Frozen is so beautiful to watch, and they did a good job making the characters believable even though they were animated. You forget you are watching animation.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
It Does the Job,"This is a good family animated movie that does exactly what it needs to do.First it is entertaining for the kids and it has enough fun characters and funny lines and exciting things happening to keep them paying attention through the whole thing, which most parents know is half the battle of taking your kids to see a movie! All the kids in the theatre seemed to enjoy it.Second it is entertaining for parents. At least it is entertaining enough. Unlike most kids movies some such as Frozen have some great lines or side jokes in there that are clearly just for us and there are some good payoffs.Third it's a good story that will hold even adult people interested with some real characters you will care about and you will be invested in their problems.Not quite as good as the hype I've heard but one of the better animated movies out there.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Enjoyable, but not for everyone.","With Frozen, it is obvious that Disney has gone back to the template that made ""Beauty and the beast"" a smash hit. Unlike most other animated films of the past decade, Frozen leaves behind visual spectacles and wacky comedy, in order to focus on making a romantic film aimed at a young female audience. It's a film about love, friendship and singing catchy tunes. This is the kind of film that, if you were planning an evening at the cinema with your family, you might want to let your husband and sons watch something else. They might enjoy it, but the odds are against it. Technically, the film is flawlessly animated and put together but without breaking any new ground in terms of visuals. But then again, Disney knows that their targeted audience is not really interested in that.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Quite the film,"Disney has made many films that have become classics like ""The Little Mermaid"" And ""The Lion King"" of course that was during the Disney Renaissance where they would make musical animation films with powerful story telling, Animation work that is top notch as well as Songs that have remain hits today like they were back then.Frozen has that feel that it could begin the second Disney Renaissance since it is one of the few films from Disney that has a story and musical feel to it.My nieces love this film and I have to say it is quite the movie it just has a lot going for it.The plot of the film is that Anna (Kristen Bell) must search for her older sister Queen Elsa (Idina Menzel) who has the power to create snow and ice and has accidentally turn the Kingdom into a frozen ice winter. Anna teams up with Mountain Man Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) his trusted Reindeer Sven and a snowman Olaf (Josh Gad) to change what Elsa has done. Hans (Santino Fontana)Frozen story is quite strong and clever for a Disney film.What is the strong point of the film is the music which is wonderfully done. It helps move the film along as each piece of music written for the film match it just right. Of Course the film features original songs which are what make Frozen famousMy top five favorite songs are 5: ""Do You Want To Build a Snowman"" 4: ""Frozen Heart"" 3: ""Love Is a Open Door""/ ""In Summer"" 2: ""Let It Go"" 1: ""For The First Time In Forever"". Each song for the film is well written and express emotion from the characters. Plus who knew Kristen Bell could sing I mean it really impress me to know she could sing like a bird sure we knew Idina Menzel could sing but wow Kristen really is impressive with her singing voice when you hear her in the film you'll be impress.As for the voice acting it is superb, with each cast member matching each character right and you can feel the emotion of the characters they can make you laugh, feel for them. They really brought these characters to life like Anna, Elsa and Olaf.The Animation is beautiful with great effects and backgrounds that really are quite amazing to look at, the characters are well design well animated it just feels like they took the time to match each animation to the Tee. You can look at the film and be impress with the artwork.Disney for the first time in forever brought an amazing film to the picture and the haters can let it go.The film is great for the whole family and it is hard to not be impress with the animation and music. This is a film you can't miss.I give Frozen an 9 out of 10. Frozen is a extreme work of art.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"A multi-million dollar snow cone with bland flavor, yet serves it's purpose.","Short and simple review: While watching Disney's ""Frozen"", it reminded me of one of those homemade snow cone machines you buy for kids. It served a purpose, but there was nothing great about the taste, overall you were not better nor worst for trying it. By that I mean that the over-all movie was no different/better than any other Disney release that goes straight to video (Example: The list of Tinkerbell movies, The Aladdin sequels, etc). A few points: *The music*. I have in the past enjoyed the singing in Disney movies, but this one was lacking in the ""I love that song"" category. I felt as if this movie had no central sound, no unique ""ethnic"" theme as previous Disney attempts. Most of the music was a blend of what some would say are generic choir music and modest attempts at copying the past Disney hits.*The Villain*. Again, this is something that draws you in to ""root"" for the champion in a Disney movie. But this movie really had no villain until 3/4ths through the movie, and when the ""true"" villain came to, it was a ""shocker"" only because it didn't make much sense (based on the character's previous actions) and seemed truly forced as a way to ""wrap-up"" the movie in a semi-Disney fashion (I guess you have to see someone fail, right?).Missing much that one would say makes a great animated movie, this movie may have been better served as a straight to DVD/BluRay item. However, the movie does keep the children entertained and there was several comedic points created by the character Olaf.If you are looking to take the children to a matinée, this isn't a bad choice, however most adults will find the story ""basic"" and without the charm of previous Disney movies.Your children may forget this movie in a week or two, and you will as well not long after you leave.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Disney fairytale when it is really good,"Disney really has returned to former glory with its latest animation films, this is a true fairytale, very beautiful, very classic and very likable.Visually this film rocks, it is truly beautiful and very remarkable what you can do with animated snow and ice :)The story is great, a very good Disney transformation, my kids loved it and especially my 5 year old daughter was really captures by the story and the characters, she sat on the edge of her seat most of the 85 minutes it lasted.This is entertaining, visually beautiful, lovable music and just a true fairytale coming to life.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
I'm glad it's a good movie,"I'm glad this movie is good because my kids love it so much. I've seen it what seems like hundreds of times now. The best part is when my 2 year old daughter dances and sings to ""Let It Go,"" doing all the hand movements and stomping her foot on the floor like Elsa does.Anyway, this is a good story and the animation is excellent, I'm sure Disney would have nothing less.

Filth,"This movie is so profane that I can't properly review it or describe anything in the movie without violating IMDb's guidelines. I know. It's a children's movie and you think I'm joking. I'm not. Watch the scene where Anna hits herself in the mouth with a curtain tassel and ask yourself what the metaphor is. Listen to the coded language like ""chocolate"" and try to figure out what that means. Ask yourself what the metaphor for the white tangled cord dripping off the reindeer's antlers is. This movie is loaded with innuendo. It's literally every 30 seconds. Normally, I'd be okay with that. But this is not an adult film. It's a children's cartoon aimed at children. Why is Disney trying to pervert today's kids? This is sick. Nobody knows how to decode symbols in film anymore.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Amiable Disney flick that will entertain most.,"Inspired by (rather than adapted from) Hans Christian Andersen's The Snow Queen, Disney's latest offering, Frozen, is a light, amiable singsong through the ice and snow that will entertain most, delight the young and eventually fall into place behind The Lion King, Aladdin and numerous other classics in the Disney catalogue.Princesses Anna and Elsa are as close as good fairytale sisters can be until Anna inadvertently unleashes her ice power upon her younger sibling and almost kills her. Her parents decide the best way to prevent it happening again is to hide Anna from the world, and prevent her from seeing Elsa by locking her in her room. Their parents die some time later, the isolation continues, much to the dismay of Elsa, until the decision is made to open the gates to the world for Anna's coronation. In a bout of misunderstanding, Anna (Kristen Bell) almost terminates Elsa (Idina Menzel) again, horrifies the townsfolk and takes to the hills. Elsa recruits reluctant ice salesman Kristoff (Jonathon Groff) and his trusty reindeer, Sven, and aims to bring her back to end the winter that has sprung up in her wake.Frozen has the feel of a musical (à la Les Misérables) rather than a comedy film with songs (The Muppets) inasmuch as the songs aren't used as condiments to the meal but as principal ingredients, and there is a danger of this wrenching the viewer out of the film instead of propelling them along with it. Most of the songs very quickly fade in the memory and, with a solitary exception, I cannot name a single one less than a day after the event. The exception, however, is the mighty fine (and, I predict, the soon to be Oscar-winning) Let It Go.In a film that lacks magic, this is the sequence that makes the ice truly sparkle and stands out as the moment Frozen becomes a film worth watching. In the transformation of Anna as dejected queen into icy vamp, she firmly supplants Ariel as the most fanciable animated character on the big screen.The animation in this sequence also comes alive. From the opening scenes of water and ice being cut into blocks, the backdrops are the stars of Frozen but in the latter part of Let It Go, the character animators finally hit their strides and we are given a character that is as watchable and complete as the scenery.Disney has, in the past, become a byword for schmaltz and sanitized stories. Take another look at Pocahontas and The Hunchback of Notre Dame for stories that have been watered down for delicate audiences. Here, again, Disney holds back on the trauma and, whereas in Bambi we were left in no doubt as to the fate of his mother, here it is almost a suggestion and glossed over quickly. So much of Frozen feels like a trip of shortcuts when it should be a journey of adventure, false turns and new avenues.Frozen also suffers from the lack of a bona fide villain. Yes, the Duke of Wesleton (Alan Tudyk) has his moments and for an awful moment it looks as though Anna may transmogrify into something evil but there is nothing we can really sink our teeth into. The comedy character, Olaf (Josh Gad), the snowman, adds some comedy variation but even he is amusing rather than outright funny.Frozen is a sweet, easy fairytale that will distract your children from killing each other one rainy Saturday and most Disney animations are worth having on the DVD shelf eventually. But therein rests the issue: this is a Disney film and not a Pixar event.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"""Frozen"" Left Me, uh, Cold","This is a seven minute cartoon stretched into a full length movie, mindless pap. About the only revelation worth mentioning, Kristen Bell, can sing and the Disney studios can make a lush looking cartoon. Any parent with a kid under 8 will understandably be grateful for a full length babysitter that isn't some slasher flick, but I had the misfortune to go with three other adults thinking, there may be some tunes worth humming, and it would be nice to see what the Disney studio can do with plot and music. We found ourselves stabbing ourselves in the thigh trying to stay awake and commenting, white noise would have a better plot.Every song is overplayed Broadway pap. This thing was built to bring to the stage to showcase the music, which is cloying and pretentious. The moral of the story, accept who you are for what you are, is a sledgehammer looking for a brain to bludgeon.There are ways to appeal to everyone in a cartoon world, but not everything is as intelligent, or as ancient, as Rocky and Bullwinkle.Which brings me to Sherman and Peabody, which has me foreboding and in trepidation,--but that, as they say, is another story.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
spectacular,"not for animation, details or voices. but for courage. beautiful in deep sense its beauty is the art to be different by common recipes of genre. an adaptation who shatters rules and habits and expectations in a nice, smart manner. a different Snow Queen who preserves the spirit of story but gives to it few lovely ornaments and few slices of pure joy. an experience more than a show. in essence, extraordinary work. and each scene is more than technical product but wise science to present in the best form profound problems for each age. not only a Disney but more a Pixar. and, essential, far to be a season story. spectacular film, delicate work, maybe, after years, a classic,impressive work.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Great music combined with magical animation,"An enjoyable and exciting adventure tale for the whole family, which also includes many terrific musical numbers, Frozen successfully recaptures the magic and thrill of Disney storytelling. By uniquely placing the story in a Scandinavian setting, Disney further adds to the wide variety of films they have designed through the years, while also having the chance to showcase the truly mesmerizing animation techniques. Although the film is visually very impressive and has an extremely memorable soundtrack, with Idina Menzel's Let It Go being particularly captivating, the story itself does come across as one lacking depth and intensity. Despite the well-developed characters, the film is far less complex when compared to other notable Disney pictures, with the twist in the storyline also being somewhat predictable. All in all, however, the humorous aspect of the film and the strength of its music does ultimately prevail, making Frozen a fun and entertaining experience, thus again proving the ever-lasting magic of Disney animation.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Families will treasure this Disney film classic,"Life is good when you get the opportunity to escape from reality for a few hours with this new animated Disney film classic that will surely appeal to all ages and the child within us all. This is a Hans Christian Andersen story that provides the viewer with an adventure in the snowy wilderness, young love, a beautiful musical score, and a humorous tale with a funny snowman named Olaf, and a pretty smart reindeer named Sven.The heart of the story surrounds two royal sisters named Anna and Elsa who were being raised by their parents the King and Queen in a kingdom named Arendelle until they encounter a series of unfortunate circumstances. The King and Queen are lost at sea during a terrible storm, and Elsa, the older sister discovers she possesses magical powers that allow her with a simple touch to turn everything in to ice and snow. Elsa almost kills her little sister Anna by the touch of her finger when she freezes the castle and then her kingdom and loses control of her magical powers. Fearing she may harm her little sister Anna again, Elsa decides to abandon her kingdom after being crowned the new Queen and instead heads up to the highest mountains to live alone in her self made ice castle where her magical powers are out of harms way.Young Anna cannot bare to be without her big sister Elsa so she departs from her kingdom of Arendelle and she heads up in to the woods for the adventure of a lifetime. Her adventure is not without danger though as she encounters a pack of wolves, a giant and angry snow man, and a group of singing trolls. Anna receives assistance on her journey from a young handsome woodsman named Kristoff, his reindeer named Sven and a cute and adorable snowman named Olaf. So on they go through the woods seeking out Anna's big sister Elsa to bring her home to the castle they both grew up in and played together in until that fatal accident that scared Elsa from playing with her little sister Anna, ever again.Frozen will keep you in your seat until the very end and we soon find out that true love can conquer all fears and all dangers. You may even find yourself holding back a few tears if you have any siblings that you shamelessly quarrelled with.I am not a fan of three (3D) dimensional feature films as I personally feel that the special effects actually take away from the magic of this wonderful Disney film. Call me old fashioned but the 3D effects I find more a distraction in Frozen. If I had been provided an option, I would have preferred to see the non 3D version.Having said that, I will however suggest that you get to the theater early so that you don't miss the very smartly done short cartoon that preceded Frozen. This Mickey Mouse short cartoon melds both an original 1930's black and white Mickey Mouse cartoon with a current 3D Mickey Mouse cartoon. The animators took the original 1930's Mickey Mouse cartoon and weaved in and out of the original black and white cartoon in to their 3D colorful characters during the chase scenes. It was quite a unique feat, but only when done in a short cartoon, not as effective in the feature film, Frozen.I rated Frozen a perfect 10 out of 10. You and all of your family will just love it. The musical score is also one of the most popular cinema musical scores produced of all time and is sung by young children all over the world.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Clearly one of the most overrated animated films of all-time,"I generally love animated films (either long or short ones), and the gross sales of this particular Disney film, along with its IMDb rate (8.0) have made me greatly anticipating this one. Unfortunately, i was very disappointed. I admit that the musical aspect of the film is nicely crafted, and the characters are lovable and nicely designed. But, the movie lacks originality, lacks sense of humor (only the reindeer sort of saves the day), and the plot is somewhat shallow. Everything seems to be just a reproduction of older ideas and characters. I do not want to give away any plot spoilers, so instead i will list more than a dozen of animated movies that easily surpass this one: Toy Story 1-2-3 Shrek 1-2 Finding Nemo Wall-e Incredibles Ice Age 1-2 Wreck it Ralph Antz Despicable me 1 Monsters inc. So, i strongly believe that its enormous worldwide gross sales achievement is probably due to good timing and publicity, and not due to its overall quality. 6,5/10 for me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

"Could have been much, much better (this is a 20 year old's POV); doesn't deserve the hype","Sorry, but if you think this movie was original and unpredictable, I beg to disagree. That, or you're young or you just haven't seen enough movies.That said, I think it's more the scriptwriters/director's fault that people like me don't enjoy it. The talented (talented being an understatement) voices are there, but the premise, the ""big"" reveal of the ""villain"", the progression of the story are some of the movie's failures.The story behind Elsa's power? That back-story alone may well be more interesting than Frozen's. The villain? The reveal didn't play out realistically, it seemed fake/scripted/out of place. And finally progression, not a spoiler but a grand staircase leads right to Elsa's ""hiding place"". How convenient for Anna. And she and the ice guy reach it practically the next day -.- Frodo and Sam'll have something to say about this. I mean, didn't Elsa want to isolate herself? So grand staircases are supposed to drive visitors away, amirite. (sarcasm) I'd also like to add nil character development.Anyway, those points above, among others, made me unaffected by supposedly dramatic events (I'm looking at you Elsa&Anna's parents), made this a forgettable movie for me.

An animated winter warmer,"Full of heart and humour, Frozen is a delightful film. The heavy and dark subject matter sets it apart from the traditional Disney style along with subtle postmodern mockery to the old Disney formula. The relationship between the two sisters works very well and is very touching from the get go supplying the films drama and emotional moments.The snowman Olaf supplies the comic relief and if it wasn't for him the film would be very depressing, when he livens up the characters he livens up the audience. One aspect of the story does resort to traditional Disney conventions which ruined it a little for me because of the radical new direction the film seemed to be taking. That being said the story is great but some of the songs just come out from no where with little warning and unlike Beauty and the Beast, aren't as memorable and have little variety with some sounding quite corny however some do show what the characters are going through. There are some genuine plot twists too that no one will see coming.Overall a great film perhaps not as innovative as Wreck it Ralph but Frozen is way ahead of it's competitors at Dreamworks and offers a charming story with three dimensional characters and a great message for kids about true love. The animation is also stellar and is very creative in terms of it's character design.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Trying too hard,"I have seen this movie about a hundred times now because my significant other is obsessed with it. I, however, dislike it more and more with each viewing. I'm not so much picky about plot and don't nitpick too much when it comes to children's movies, but this movie was so far below par for Disney it's unbelievable. There is very little character development throughout the feature, I find that at the end of the movie I couldn't care less about the heroines or their relationship. I also agree that this music is hurting for substance. The songs aren't memorable at all...unless you've seen it a billion times.I'm also disappointed at the lack of interest Disney has in developing compelling male characters. This movie felt like a huge dig on men I'm general, either they're stupid or scheming or nondescript. There's no substantial male figure in it at all, and I get that the focus was on the female protagonists, but I felt it was a huge disservice to the other gender in general.And the ""you're a snowflake"" undercurrent is getting very verrry old. Seriously. It portrays feelings as the ultimate compass for people (I.e. Elsa's character) ""just go with how you feel and everything will be great yo!!"" Yeah... Not so much. When are feelings reliable?It just felt like they tried to replicate the success of Tangled, but then majorly slacked off when it came to putting in the effort of crafting a compelling story, score or characters.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Elsa is not an evil queen but someone who tries to protect the ones she loves, unfortunately in a wrong way. Anna's goodness is not based on pure goodness but on inexperience that turns against her.

"While it doesn't quite live up to other Disney Classics, ""Frozen"" is still a gorgeous, entertaining, near-flawless and exceedingly well-made family-adventure.","So, it's been about a year since ""Frozen""- one of the biggest and most rampantly popular Disney releases in quite some time- hit theaters. A year for audiences to get over the initial ""high"" of seeing it for the first time and review it with a more objective, critical eye. I find that often, after a few months, my opinion of a film will have changed somewhat, and I'm usually slightly more analytical and critical to it's strengths and faults. Which is why I held off on reviewing this particular film right away.So, looking back a year later, does ""Frozen"" still hold up?Yes. Yes it does. Rather magnificently.While it's never QUITE able to live up to other Disney Classics, and it does have a few dodgy moments here and there, ""Frozen"" is a shockingly well-made film, boasting not only immensely impressive visuals and direction, but some of the best musical work in an animated family film I've ever heard, in addition to some wonderfully developed characters and great humor. It's another near-flawless example of Disney doing what it does best.We follow two princess sisters- Anna (Kristen Bell) and Elsa (Idina Menzel), who were the best of friends as children. However, Elsa possessed a strange magical ability- the ability to create snow, ice and cold through her hands. Unable to control his power, the sister's parents have a wise mystical troll erase Anna's memory of Elsa's abilities, and keep them separated through much of their lives for their own respective safety, so Elsa can try and learn to control her powers without inadvertently hurting her sister.Years later, after their parent's deaths, Elsa emerges from solitude to be crowned queen. However, after a mistake reveals her powers to the people of her kingdom- thus causing the concerned public to see her as a potential threat, she leaves to live alone, accidentally covering the kingdom in an eternal winter. And so it is up to Anna to try to help her sister learn to control her powers, and end the dreaded winter. And along the way, Anna is joined by a colorful cast of characters, including a good-hearted ice merchant (Jonathan Groff), his pet/companion reindeer, and a unrelentingly-optimistic snowman called ""Olaf"" (Josh Gad) who was unknowingly brought to life by Elsa's powers.The cast is absolutely perfect. Bell is absolutely fun as a quirky, spunky princess who goes through a comical-yet-emotional journey for the sake of her sister, and is endlessly likable. Groff and Gad round out the supporting cast perfectly, bringing a great deal of charm and charisma to their roles. (Though Gad does occasionally come off as a bit annoying early on.) And other supporting roles by actors such as Santio Fontana and Alan Tudyk are great compliments.However, the shining star is Idina Menzel. She breaths such an immense life into Elsa, and gives the character so much heart, pathos and depth, I would venture to say her performance easily should have earned her an Oscar nod, despite being a voice-only role. And I was very happy when her song ""Let it Go"" won the Oscar for Best Song. I know it was written by the rampantly talented songwriters Robert and Kristen-Anderson Lopez, but Menzel is what truly elevated the song to greatness.Production is top-notch. Direction courtesy Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee is astounding. The duo bring the world to life in such an incredible way, and their choices elevate the already strong material to new bounds. The script (written by Lee from a story treatment she also co-wrote) is also phenomenal, and is highly admirable from a character-development standpoint. In just 100 minutes, the film is able to fully establish, craft, develop and pay-off a world and characters in a way that most other films can only dream to.The animation is superb. The snow and water effects looking shockingly true-to-life, while the character and setting design is nicely stylized while also feeling organic and ""true."" It's able to construct everything so well, that despite being animated, you swear you could actually touch the snow, touch the buildings, touch the characters, etc. And it thankfully never delves into the ""uncanny valley."" And of course, the music (score by Christophe Beck and songs by the aforementioned due of the Lopez's) fits in so perfectly.I could really gush on and on over how much this film does right. However, that being said, there are a few things that hold it back from perfection, which is where the film loses a point.I do think that there are some pacing issues at times in the storytelling. The film moves just a wee-bit too fast at times, particularly in the first 45 minutes, which is a bit of a negative. I also feel that the scope is somewhat limited. Everything feels a bit too small and intimate for the sort-of tale that's being told. And I think the film is uneven in how it presents certain characters and situations. (A few characters get a ton of screen time early on, only to be sort-of ""forgotten about"" later, making them feel misused. Or other characters like the trolls, whose only appearances are brief and more akin to cameos, despite their important roles in the story.) I also do think a few too many jokes fall flat.But I can forgive those flaws when it comes to the big picture. This is a fantastic film from any stretch of the imagination, and I'm happy to own it on Blu-Ray. It's definitely one of those films I will be revisiting consistently, and enjoying each and every time.I give ""Frozen"" a near-perfect 9 out of 10. It most definitely lives up to the hype. It just isn't quite flawless.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Come, who hasn't seen Frozen yet?","This Disney musical is fun. Flat-out fun. The humor was great and the visuals continue to stun. And it looks like Disney is finally starting to learn how to use 3-d animation to their advantage (another great example of this is 2012's Wreck it Ralph). A good way to describe this film is that it's self-aware. It knew it was treading some similar Disney cliques, and it just had fun with its silly moments. The characters were charming, especially the snowman (yeah, big surprise there). Also, the songs, although a bit cheesy near the beginning, were a wonderful from start to finish. Frozen takes a fairy tale and has fun with it. The animation was wonderful, the characters were charming, and the story was very immersive (was I the only one shocked by that twist near the end?). Frozen is a sweet treat for all to enjoy!",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Nice cold,"Yet another sumptuous PIxar animated feature and the first in a long time to actually be an adaptation of a classic fairy tale (Hans Christian Anderson's ""The Snow Queen""). With a catchy soundtrack, witty and amusing dialogue and excellent artwork, this is one of the best latter-day Disney's and was deserving of its runaway (or should that be skateaway?) box-office success.Young Queen Anna's ice-throwing powers are very-well illustrated by the animators on top of their usual mastery of movement, background and facial expressions. The songs come at you a bit like a snowstorm, thick and fast, but they are always apropos the plot and invariably stirring and moving (the soundtrack album topped the US Billboard album chart for weeks on original release, which must say something about the standard of composition).Sure, the big-eyed, idealised forms of the human characters arguably overdoes the ""cute factor"" but it's not as if Pixar is going to abandon the formula which has brought it so much success from ""Toy Story"" onwards. I actually thought, about a third of the way into the movie, that the story was going to be carried wholly by ""human"" characters with no talking animals, in fact there was a nice spoof on this early in the film with Kristof having an amusing ventriloquist-type conversation with himself and his faithful reindeer Sven, but of course, the introduction of talking multi-part snowman Alf just couldn't be resisted. Funny as he is, I suspect commercial considerations aimed at the infant ""want-that-toy"" market were at work.Also predictable was the introduction of a bad-guy protagonist just to reinforce Disney's perennial need for a whole ""good versus evil"" battle, but again, this time the quarter from where this arises was unexpected and seemed forced. In films of this type, I think it's better if the baddie is identifiable from the start rather than slipped in under the viewer's nose as occurs here. And while I'm carping, couldn't a better film title have been employed too, I mean I know they seem to like snappy one-word titles (c.f. ""Up"", ""Brave"" et. al) but what was wrong with tributing Anderson's source story properly?Anyway, I did enjoy the film, there was lots of pithy and funny dialogue, the songs were varied and amusing and by the end, my heart of ice was probably melted, but while I would say it was one of the better Pixar productions, I wouldn't rate it as the very best. Maybe the inevitable sequel (""Deeper Frozen"" anyone?) will rectify some of the minor failings I detected here.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

"Frozen is a good movie, perhaps great. But I wish it could have been more.","It's refreshing to see a story where misfortune is the most prominent evil, and even more refreshing to see it from a Disney movie. Even though there is a villain, one who is motivated mainly by greed and power-hungriness, he takes a back-seat for most of the movie.The beginning was my least favorite part. The plot was convoluted, rushed, and there were many scenes that were too saccharine for my taste. The music of the movie was bad, just plain bad. Only one song was decent (mostly because of the great emotion of the scene itself, which mixed both joy and sorrow).But then, what was good? The humor! Although a few jokes fell flat I caught myself laughing out loud more than a few times. The story continuously pokes fun at Disney's older conventions, and threw me off more than once. Despite the shaky start the writers managed to pull the threads together, and at the climax of the movie I found myself crossing my fingers, saying ""please, please, please let it happen!"" And then it happened.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

FROZEN at the music and animation,"Highly recommended for kids. ""Let it Go"" song makers should be awarded an Oscar. Stood frozen watching the movie because of the stunning visuals and sets. Brave's princess Merida is shown as doll. Rapunzel and Flynn (from Wreck it Ralph!) too make cameos. An enjoyable movie for a man of my age too (I'm 30). The story is decent, filled with comical elements and emotions to my taste.The movie is highly predictable (quite common for a Disney cartoon or any) and was messy at some parts. Haven't seen the snow queen movie (which was the movie's prime inspiration), yet I could predict what could happen next in the movie. In spite of these shortcomings , I feel this movie is Oscar deserving for bringing back the long-lost Disney's classic and the song. If you are a Disney's admirer then Watch it now esp. with the kids.Let it Go... Let it Go...

Shallow and choppy,"I've been a huge fan of animation in the past and i consider it to be an art-form equal to other types of entertainment like movies, books, music, painting, etc.. I always hated how animation is stigmatized as childish and immature. Now, i know that this is a movie for children although i don't know what rating it has, but all the hype that this is getting and the way it was promoted to me on the internet including this website, it was just absurd. I read people making insane statements like ""this is the best animated movie ever made"", i saw that it was rated 8 on IMDb, staying strong on the top 10 for weeks or months now, and it got nominated for an Oscar and it even won it, that just cant be ignored, i felt forced to watch it. Therefore i feel i have the right to review it as an adult, but i'm also going to say what my opinion could have been if i had seen this as a child.Keeping it as short as possible:Story: Its just terrible. Situations created out of nowhere, it feels incredibly fake, its inconsistent and it has no logic at all. As a kid i think i would have tolerated the unexplained and dumb situations but i still would have thought its a dull movie. Although i think little girls might find it very entertaining.Screenplay: Even worse, for all i know it could have been written by someone who is 10 years old, not worth saying many words about it. There is a funny side in the movie but definitely is not because of the screenplay.Music: Oh yeah, keep in mind that this is a musical, expect them to start singing out of nowhere in any moment. The songs sound all the same, show tunes with stupid lyrics like ""Be the good girl you always have to be..."". It was a torture every time they started singing anything.Animation: There are some nice and panoramic landscapes in the background, probably the best side of the movie but still nothing incredible.Character design: Just terrible. They still keep using these doll looking style that makes the characters look unreal and soulless. I was still a kid when this kind of animation started and i never enjoyed it. I thought it looked kinda cool at first but still there was something empty in it. All i have left from them now are just a cold memories, like i was watching movies without characters. They're just plain ugly.Its been done for 20 years now, its time to stop with this realistic computerized animation thing. Animated movies are not meant to be realistic, their strongest point are their unlimited possibilities to illustrate stories and take them beyond reality. It got old now and they are all starting to look the same. Just go back to 2D animation or move forward and make something new and innovative but please somebody put an end to this crap.From the point of view of a little girl it might be an enjoyable film, but its a disgrace that they nominated it for an Oscar while they keep ignoring good movies like they've done in the past with Perfect Blue, Animatrix, The Grave of the Fireflies, and the list goes on. This just isn't material for the Oscars. I could go up to 3 but i'm going to rate it 1 because of how much people are overrating it.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

"Nice and Satisfying, but not amazing","Frozen has become massive hit and that is something that really surprises me. It does not have much strength as a story, and its plots is not very compelling or special. It's a nice little movie that kids and their parents will enjoy.But this movie does not come very close to the truly powerful films we have seen in the past. It does not stand at the same level of Mulan, or Tarzan. Seeing people deem it as a masterpiece is fairly strange. It is as if standards have declined heavily. Could it possibly be that people are being easier on Disney because they haven't been able to produce good movies? I don't know.In due time, this movie will be forgotten. Hopefully Disney will eventually be able to output a good movie that will truly impress, the way Mulan and Tarzan impressed the world.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"A more sensitivity film, more music that develops the story, fun characters and protagonists, but not so shallow. It combines classic and modern without weighing either hand","Since Pixar was bought by Disney and John Lasseter took over the animation department, Disney has alternated animations with more adventurous themes aimed at boys, such as Bolt and Wreck Ralph, with the inclusion of new royalty candidates, such as The Princess and the Frog and Tangled. And all of this without ever letting the scale tip too much just one way or the other. There are elements in the four films above that appeal to both boys and girls. When the time came to introduce a new princess, Disney creatives went after another classic in children's literature, the fairy tale The Snow Queen, by the Danish Hans Christian Andersen, the same from The Little Mermaid.For those who know Hans Christian Andersen's original tale: forget everything you know about the story. The version that Disney created for Frozen keeps elements of the fable and, especially, its essence, but here there are no goblins, mirrors and shards that turn good people into bad ones, rose bushes that revive memories. In its place there is a strong lesson of love, as it could not fail to be since it is the studio of Mickey that we are talking about. However, unlike others like Beauty and The Beast (1991), in which romance is the motto, here we talk about the delicate relationship of two sisters and how the beautiful power of creating ice separates them. The script by Jennifer Lee (screenwriter for Wreck Ralph) for Frozen was approved and she signs the co-direction of the animation alongside Chris Buck (Tarzan, Surf's Up).The youngest Anna (Kristen Bell) adores her sister Elsa (Idina Menzel), but an accident involving the older woman's special powers during childhood caused her parents to keep them away. After their death, the two grew up isolated in the family's castle, until the day when Elsa was to assume Arendell's reign. With the reunion of the two, a new accident happens and she decides to leave forever and isolate herself from the world, leaving everyone behind and causing the kingdom to freeze. That's when Anna decides to venture across the ice mountains to find her sister and end the cold.Frozen takes up something that Disney seemed to have left behind a long time ago: the musical moments that permeate the film all the time, reminiscent of classics such as those previously mentioned and also The Lion King (1995), The Little Mermaid (1989), among others. They are beautiful songs composed by the couple Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez, the ones that stick to the head. And we still have the beautiful soundtrack composed by Christoph Beck (Buffy - The Vampire Slayer and the trilogy If You Drink, Don't Marry). Then we also have great main and secondary characters, who are able to thrill and make the audience laugh at the right times, merits of a very well written script. This time, who steals the show whenever he appears is the kind and naive Olaf, who never manages to understand Kristoff's name, yielding some of the most comic dialogues in the film. However, everyone has their charisma, especially the protagonists, Anna totally outgoing and talkative, Elsa reclusive and of few words, however, both filled with layers as it has not been seen in a studio animation for a long time.It is the generic and somewhat cliché Disney model for a new animated film (or franchise), which, however, works perfectly. Okay, it doesn't bring anything new in terms of history, but it's still a lot of time spent. However, not everything is perfect. Magic trolls are basically exposure devices), in addition to Elsa's power being very poorly exploited. There is no explanation for her appearance, no surprise that she is the only one like that, nor any kind of training for her to learn to control something so fantastic and, as she herself experienced, dangerous.Because it has its origin in fairy tales, obviously some clichés are expected, and even necessary, considering that they are stories that depend on basic archetypes to exist. However, Jennifer Lee works her characters very well and allows them to develop their own characteristics, especially Elsa, the most tragic figure in history. Of course, there are a few slips, especially when it comes to the love triangle between Anna, Kristoff and Hans, which was solved in a forced and somewhat easy way. But the development of the two protagonists and their conflicts manages to overcome any romantic buzzword of the genre, giving the film a beautiful differential in relation to other productions of the genre.But these are just details in a script that knows how to captivate the audience and apply twists as rarely seen in an animation geared towards families - always very predictable in their outcomes. Despite its clear obviosities, the script manages to play with the viewer by presenting false villains, people full of ulterior motives and a love triangle that begins to heat up as the film progresses. However, they are all stratagems to mislead the public of the real intention, which is to promote the reunion of the two sisters and remove the doubt whether Elsa really became a bad queen or just lives in isolation for fear of hurting others.The production design is one of the most daring of the animations of the last years, with beautiful and detailed ice sculptures that are a dazzle for those who are in the chair. Something that further favors the quality of the film, which is already born full of merits. When the climax happens, Frozen shows that, freezing, there is nothing. Quite the opposite. It is an animation that warms the heart of those who watch. As cliché as this may sound. Tears will soak the armchairs in the room, but the happy ending makes up for everything, as in a beautiful fairy tale. In addition to the icy flakes, we have the forests and all the reflections and transparencies of the ice create a beautiful 3D look, but which can also be enjoyed in a normal cinema.The story flows naturally and the entertainment levels are always high. Whether these are due to incredible musical sequences or exciting adventures, this film never stops having fun. This is what Frozen, in the end, is: a joyful, fun and entertainment-filled movie. It follows Disney's formula for creating a variation on a story we've seen before. The characters go through a traumatic event when they are young. They have to grow up as they struggle with the consequences of that trauma. Eventually, they overcome this obstacle and live happily ever after.At the bottom of this whole adventure, ""Frozen"" is a film about self-acceptance and discoveries. While Elsa always repressed herself, running away from who she really was and seeing her powers as a curse, Anna was never able to get to know the world, with her anxiety about having adventures and new experiences, which turns her into an anxious and very naive young woman. Male participation in the story, with Kristoff and Hans, is supporting, with the sisters' dramatic arcs being the true center of the narrative. The moral lessons are always there, about self acceptance, importance of the family, the need for affection, acts of true love. But it is commendable to realize that none of these concepts are symbolized in the image of a man. Both princesses have to learn to find their strength within themselves.Finally, with captivating characters, charming musical numbers and an important and realistic message to pass on to the 21st century audience, Frozen represents the evolution of fairy tales, which highlight the importance of real and lasting love, built over time and coexistence. In this way, the main message conveyed by the film is summarized in the phrase of the Great Pabbie, who says that ""only an act of true love can thaw a frozen heart"", and that sincere love is revealed in the appreciation of friendship between the sisters, who must overcome life's fears and obstacles together. A recommendable film for everyone who still believes in love and, above all, for all those who need to start believing again.Frozen is not going to change the course of animation history. Nor is it the best film in the studio since The Lion King (1994), as it has been considered. But it symbolizes several right steps. More women directing and writing relevant films, more sensitivity, more music that develops the story, fun characters and protagonists, but not so shallow. This animation explores very well what Walt Disney and John Lasseter do best, combining classic and modern without weighing either hand.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Forget the hype.  Enjoy the movie for what it is.,"With the massive hype bomb, fans overrated it and hated over-hated it. Disney's studios did a great job at stylized 3D animation, viral songs, as well as characters like Sven and Olaf. The CGI ice is well done, which matters in this movie. And more metaphorically, it symbolizes the loss of love.It's more of a small twist on formula than a feminist revolution but having two fully fleshed female characters never hurts. It has some positive message such as being careful who you marry and surrounding yourself with people you love is more important than isolation (something which anyone with any kind of mental illness can relate to).

More than meets the eye.... and heart.,"Well, at first I thought this movie wasn't going to be that great. But on one fateful day, I heard the infamous song :Let It Go"". After I heard the song, I knew that I had to see the movie. For those who have not seen the movie, I highly recommend it. Not only because it is one of the best Disney movies ever, but because of the morals in the story. This is the first Disney movie that I don't get tired of, simply because of the morals in it. But for starters, this is the first Disney movie to EVER prove that you can't marry someone you just met. Some will use you for their own benefits, and use your own emotions against you. Love. Many of Disney's movies have stuck to the act of true love being a kiss from a guy or girl. But this movie shows that the strongest love, is in family. And their are a couple of extra bits about love. Love is putting someone else's needs before yours, and the infamous quote from and infamous character: ""Some people are worth melting for"".

"Watch it once, at most, and prepare to be disappointed (especially if you're a Classic Disney fan).","I really don't understand all the praise this movie has been getting. Plot holes, passable songs, casting errors, etc. make this movie one of the worst Disney movies I've ever watched in my whole life. If you like illogical movies with one-dimensional characters, you're in luck because this will be your favorite movie! That said, I have very high expectations when it comes to Disney movies, so of course, I will be more strict when giving this movie a review. If this movie had not been a Disney movie, I might have given it a 4. ""Let it Go"" is incredibly overrated. The best song, in my opinion, was either ""For the First Time in Forever"" or ""Love is an Open Door"", NOT ""Let it Go"". I watched this movie once and will never rewatch it ever again because it was so disappointing. Furthermore, Disney should have chosen someone else to voice Elsa. Idina Menzel's voice is way too mature for the young queen.The only good thing that came from this movie was that, in comparison, it made every other Disney Princess movie a million times better. In fact, I had never really been drawn to Tangled and The Princess and the Frog until I re-watched them after watching Frozen and realized that both movies (along with the Classics) are way out of Frozen's league. So I guess I can thank Frozen for making me realize how much more enjoyable older Disney movies are.This movie does not deserve all the hype it's getting, but I guess anything is possible with good advertising. Quite honestly, whoever advertised this movie should be given an award for making this mediocre movie become so popular. Without the advertising, I know that this movie would have failed horrendously. ""The Best Movie since The Lion King""? False advertising, but hey, it worked. I fell for it (unfortunately). ""From the directors of Wreck it Ralph and Tangled""? Sure, but don't even try to pretend it's anywhere as good as either one of those movies.Anyways, way to go, Disney! You've lost yet another big fan. (Judging from the other reviews, I see quite a few other Disney fans also think Disney has lost its magic.) However, I'll give you one last chance to redeem yourself with the next princess, Moana. Otherwise, it'll be your third strike (after Brave and Frozen).

Ice Princess with Warm Heart,"I'll admit I do have a place in my heart for the Disney fantasy films, from childhood to adulthood most of them are timeless to me because they had heart. This is another film whose heart is in the right place.I really love the animation, it's CGI animation at it's finest once again and used the right way. From the character animation, background which capture a swiss Bavarian setting, however what impresses me the most is the ice power effects which are just beautiful. It is just awesome to see Elsa use her powers; my favorite sequence from that is seeing the construction of the Ice Palace.The songs are hit or miss, but that's true with a lot of musicals. But to me the two songs that stick out are ""For the First Time in Forever"" and my favorite and no surprise ""Let it Go"" which is just a beautiful song about just doing what you feel and being yourself.I really like the story in a strange way this fantasy story is also almost like a ""X-Men"" tale (if you read the comic series or seen the live action films you know what I'm talking about). But that it's simply a great love story, not so much just between both a guy and and girl which we have, but between siblings.I really like the main character Elisa (voiced well by Idina Menzel). The depth to her character is pretty tragic and you really feel a sense of pathos for her. She's sort of like one of the mutants in the ""X-Men"" comic book series. Like the mutants she's born with a special ability, though here it's deemed as magic. Though the main dilemma is she doesn't know how to fully control them nor does she entirely understand them.The poor girl is pretty much forced to being a control freak, she has to constantly keep her powers and emotions in check even from doing the simplest things like keeping a mere pencil from becoming an icicle from picking it up. Or even just touching people as we see her wearing gloves throughout the first half of the film, much like with ""Rogue"" on ""X-Men"". One scene that I'll admit is a bit heartbreaking is whenever Anna has always knocked on Elisa's door and asks for her to play but she never comes out. But you can tell from the emotion on her face she really wants to come out but can't because she's afraid she'll harm her again with her powers, despite the fact she already is hurting her; it's just awful it's no way to live.The other character I like and is my favorite is Anna (voiced well by underrated actress Kristen Bell). She is just great, she's beautiful both inside and out. She funny, she has great charisma that is just crackling like fireworks, she has some of the best lines in the film highly energetic and fast moving, and feisty which is a trait I love best.However what make it great is the back and forth between them which I think is beautiful, it's a great sibling relationship even like that one little moment when both of them say ""Choclate"" at the same time which was sweet and kinda funny. This good relationship is all the more reason why I want both of them to win because it can be forever if they want it. For Anna it's to somehow get though to Elsa somehow. I love the fact that Anna accepts and loves Elsa for who she is regardless of the fact she has powers, and is doing everything in her power to help her, which to me is part of what love truly is.And personally I felt that's why Elsa powers were getting out of control the powers are connected with her emotions, it was because she wasn't allowing herself to feel things and have or experience certain things in her life. When that happens it usual would bring negative feelings to yourself and a not so positive outlook on life, and her powers are making things bad because she feels bad. It just shows why it good to feel things. As Doctor Number 5 in ""Doctor Who"" once said ""Emotions also enhance life.""Even like the two supporting characters: Olaf (voiced by Josh Gad) is surprising a fun, funny, even charming character. Olaf's persona sort of reminds me of Frosty from the Ralkin and Bass ""Frosty the Snowman"" Christmas special which is great because this character isn't all laughs but does have heart, just like Frosty he's someone you want to be friends with. But I like that the guy has a dream which is to be in the sun, which is of course impossible but it's easy to emphasize with, we have those kinds of dreams of attaining the unattainable.But the one I like the most is Kristoff. Kristoff isn't a stereotypical pretty boy protagonist, I love the fact he's kinda a underdog, he's pretty much a blue collar worker, doesn't have all the breaks, he doesn't get the girls, he's not too smooth, but he has a good heart, big dreams, and isn't afraid to help or step up when he should. Love the back and forth between both Anna and Kris, which I think is a very good chemistry, the banter between them is fun, funny and warm you already know from this chemistry that both are right for each other which is all the more reason why I want this guy to win; we want Anna with a guy we she knows best.If the film has a message, it's simply about being yourself and not being afraid of what you feel, embrace and express your emotion. But also just simply what true love really is.This film will melt and warm your heart.Rating: 4 stars",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Disney's Second Renaissance?,"Disney seem to have been doing rather well in the past few years. It's first renaissance (beginning with The Little Mermaid in '89) ended abruptly in the late 90s and was replaced with the meteoric rise of Pixar, which could seemingly do no wrong, releasing hit after hit. Even Dreamworks was more consistent! But 2010 marked Pixar's peak (Toy Story 3) and Disney's return. Tangled was an excellent return to form, and Wreck-it Ralph was great fun. But it is with Frozen that Disney has captured the magic once again, in a wonderful movie deserving of its massive success.Frozen is a beautiful film where nothing really goes wrong. The music is Disney at its catchiest, the visuals are picturesque, and the characters are irresistibly charming. Loosely based on the Snow Queen, Frozen focuses on two sisters, Elsa and Anna, dealing with Elsa's cold-based magic and its consequences, both physical and mental. Elsa regresses and becomes a recluse while Anna becomes overly hopeful. While it doesn't discuss the psychological issues too deeply, the subtext and emotions are there for pondering.Along the way the two sisters meet other colourful characters, primarily Kristoff, an ice trader, and Josh Gad's adorably hilarious snowman Olaf, the best sidekick since the Genie of Aladdin. His pleasant naivety is heartwarming, to say the least. The film has been much lauded for its 'progressive' elements, notably that its main relationship is not romantic, but between the two sisters, and other subversions of genre that to state would spoil the plot.Though with regards to plot, that may be the weakest part. Frozen went through numerous rewrites along a complicated development process, and it can be seen in the final product. Characters and traits are set up early on that are forgotten or abandoned in the second half- for instance Kristoff is established in the film's first scene as an ice trader whose love in life is ice, yet there is never any kind of reference to this in the proximity of Elsa, who has limitless magical control of ice. Nefarious looking characters never really amount to much, and possibly one too many red herrings are used seemingly solely for the purpose of pulling the rug out from under the audience. And while none can doubt the brilliance of Let it Go, the Elsa at the end of the song is not the same as the Elsa in her next scene. Also, rock trolls.Yet, this is to complain about minor qualms. The plot works, pleasantly surprises, and is ultimately a backseat to the characters. There have been many plot comparisons to The Lion King (which are well-founded), but the plot in Lion King drove the narrative, whereas in Frozen the characters are the drivers, first and foremost. An equally compelling comparison is to Tangled, except the traits of the single Female protagonist are divided between the two sisters here.It would be boring to simply state the wonders of the art style and the charm, so one could be somewhat picky. Frozen's soundtrack is great, but has the same problem that a few Disney films suffer from, namely that one great song overshadows both the other songs and the rest of the film itself- the best example being Mulan and 'I'll make a man out of you'. 'Let it Go' is this to a T. Yet it's entirely forgivable, not just for being a great track, but also for being the best looking piece in the film, creating the gorgeous ice palace before the audience's eyes.Frozen confirms that Disney have returned to form- hopefully something that continues. It's fantastic fun, appeals to all ages, both genders, while being positively progressive in ways that blockbusters seldom are- not just animation or kids films. Disney are still determined to focus on over-privileged Royalty at the expense of commoners, but otherwise Disney are moving full steam ahead. A magical success.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Still remains incredibly entertaining despite the Disney clichés,"Well, I finally watched that Frozen movie all the kids have been talking aboutand it was good but it isn't exactly the thing everyone has made it out to be. Elsa (Idina Menzeljeez, John Travolta can you pronounce anything right?), the princess of Arendelle, possesses ice and snow powers but one night hurts her sister, Anna (Kristen Bell), and this causes her parents to make Elsa repress her powers, to push them away and push people away, they are viewed as dangerous and uncontrollable. And then in a ridiculously fast montage of events, their parents die but we also experience what is one of the best pieces of music I've heard in a movie in quite some time, ""Do You Wanna Build a Snowman?"" But seriously, we go through like 10 years in less than ten minutes and Anna is 18 years old throughout the film and Elsa is 21 years old which is certainly older than most Disney protagonists I'm sure.Truly, the musical pieces are what carry this film from its very cliché plot elements without them the movie would feel more cliché than it already is, it's very typical Disney which isn't entirely a problem by any means and was more or less expected I think. But I also think the musical pieces wear thin by the 45 minute mark, the best pieces have already passed (""Let It Go"" and ""Do You Wanna Build a Snowman?"") and the other pieces don't really hold a candle to them which is quite unfortunate for the movie's lasting appeal as a full piece, the first half is better than the other half for sure as the latter half falls into typical plot conventions and the music justisn't that impressive.The animation is absolutely gorgeous though and as time goes on I've begun to love CGI animated films more and more especially if they continue to look this good. The setting, based on locations in Norway, look absolutely incredible throughout the entire piece and just goes to show the era of technology we are truly living in right now in the realm of animated films. I could certainly look at more of this for quite some time and would love to, visually; I'm extremely excited to see what Disney has up next.The movie as a whole though is actually more focused on Anna over Elsa, she is truly the main character as she learns what ""love"" is and trying to recover her relationship with Elsa after so many years have passed which I did not expect and I think it mostly works. The movie has a slew of side characters as well, Jonathan Groff as Kristoff, an iceman (he literally sells ice) who helps Anna out throughout the film and his side kick reindeer Sven who serves as decent comic relief throughout the film. Josh Gad as Olaf, a snowman who also serves as comic relief and has one of the better musical numbers about summer and lastly, Santino Fontana as Hans, a prince from the Southern Isles. These characters are interesting enough-although not very in depth-to keep the viewer entertained, I enjoyed them but they aren't incredibly memorable.My only real ""flaw"" of the film beyond the problems of obvious Disney clichés was the transition of Elsa early on in the film. She goes from extremely repressed about her ice powers but then immediately belts out ""Let It Go"" and feels very free from them and doesn't care anymore which is justuhhI don't know, weird? I feel in the minority about this, I think a transitional phase should have been placed before she belted out ""Let It Go,"" it would have made the transition feel more authentic as a whole. Regardless, Frozen is a welcome entry into Disney recent revival since The Princess and the Frog, I'm happy to see Disney really in a period similar to the 90s era, each year we are getting a fantastic film and it doesn't seem to be ending anytime soon and as a lifelong fan of Disney, I'm really happy about all of this really but I would like to see a straying away from some of the clichés.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Wasn't too bad, but not one of Disney's better ones.","After all the hype I heard about this film, I had to get myself to watch it. Very loosely based on Hans Christian Anderson's The Snow Queen, Frozen is about newly crowned Queen Elsa, who has magical powers that can turn objects into ice. Under duress, she accidentally freezes her hometown and turns the season into infinite winter. Meanwhile, her sister, Anna, teams up with mountain man Kristoff and little snowman Olaf to find Elsa and convince her to bring summer back to the town.After watching it, I thought the film wasn't too bad. It has a somewhat intriguing intro that shows Elsa accidentally hitting Anna unconscious with a blast of ice from her powers, making her shutting herself out of the real world so she could protect Anna. This all leads to the intriguing parts where Elsa grows up to be Queen and looses control of her powers, turning the town into snow and all the residents against her. Finally, it all leads to a somewhat exciting mission by Anna and company to find Elsa.The plot itself has some exciting and thrilling sequences, but it is consumed by many moments when the characters tried to insert comic relief. It seemed that whenever there is an opportunity, the characters attempt to be funny, doing away with any moments that are supposed to be suspenseful or serious. This is especially true with the Olaf character (I frankly thought he was annoying).Most of the characters were OK, but didn't stand out as too memorable or had qualities that blew me away like characters in the movies Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King did. They acted like everyday people who tried to be hip or funny. Only the serious and powerful, yet vulnerable Elsa had any redeeming qualities.The songs in the film weren't bad and were quite catchy; the song ""Let It Go"" that I hear kids belt out everywhere wasn't as cringe worthy that I thought it might be.Lastly, I thought the animation work was OK. I have a partial liking to hand drawn animation, as I believe it looks more lively, colorful and vibrant. The CGI makes it as if I was watching a Pixar-made movie.Overall, it's a pretty average Disney film. It has its exciting moments, but does not have that special ""Disney touch"" that makes earlier animated movies in the 1990s and earlier iconic.Grade C+",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Overrated, but good nonetheless","My Rating: ***1/2 (out of ****)Frozen opens up with rhythmic chanting through the Disney and WDAS logos and the opening title. This is immediately followed by a scene involving a group of ice harvesters slicing ice from a frozen lake and singing about ice, fear, and frozen hearts. This opening sets the right tone and foreshadows some of the film's underlying themes. It also has something of an ambitious feel to it, as if this film were daring to aim for the level of Beauty and the Beast and some of Disney's other best films. In my opinion, Frozen is not as good as these films, and it is not a masterpiece by any means; and frankly I think it's overrated. But I still found it to be a good movie.Frozen is the story of sisters Anna and Elsa, the princesses of Arendelle. Elsa has magical powers to create ice and snow. These sisters were very close when they were little, until an incident where Elsa almost kills her younger sister with her powers. Their parents take Anna to some trolls who save her and erase her memories of Elsa's powers. After this, the sisters are separated and grow apart over the years. Years later, their parents die at sea, and three years after this, Elsa reaches the age at which she can become Queen. On coronation day, Anna meets Hans, a prince of another kingdom. She falls in love with him and wants to get engaged – that same day. In the ensuing argument with Elsa, Elsa inadvertently releases her powers. She then flees, unintentionally leaving the kingdom in a magically induced winter. Anna goes after her, along the way acquiring the help of an ice harvester, Kristoff, and his reindeer, Sven.Despite the immense hype surrounding this film, some negative reviewers have claimed that the film is shallow, simplistic, messy, and empty. In my opinion, however, not only is it not, but it's also heavy with subtleties, symbolism, and subtext; and I found it to be relatable and thought provoking to a considerable degree. I will admit that the storyline itself is fairly simple and predictable. But overall, I found the story to be decent and effective, with some valuable morals including, but not limited to, the true meaning of love, overcoming one's fears, and accepting people for who they are.The primary factor that makes the story work is the characters. The relationship between Anna and Elsa is what constitutes the film's emotional core. I was able to relate to both both of these characters, and Kristoff, to some degree. The animators really took the time to craft these three characters, giving them well-rounded, well-nuanced personalities, genuine emotional depth, and excellent physical appearances; not to mention the superlative voice performances by the cast. The animators even paid excellent attention to all of their mannerisms, tics, facial expression, and other details (even very small ones). These three characters felt to me like real people, and not two dimensional stereotypes.Another strength of the film is the music. Christophe Beck did a good job composing the score; and Robert and Kristen Anderson-Lopez did a good job writing the songs, my favorites of which are ""For the First Time in Forever,"" ""Let It Go,"" ""Do You Want to Build a Snowman,"" and ""Frozen Heart."" The songs are not excellent, but they are pretty good, and they help develop the characters and move the story along pretty well.Some modern filmmakers, especially Michael Bay, could really learn a thing or two from movies like Frozen. I cannot deny that the animation in Frozen is very good, and the film would not have worked without it. Fortunately, however, directors Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee actually care about other things as well: character development, relationships, heart, storytelling, and so forth. The film actually has a warm, genuine heart of its own under all of that digital snow and ice. Also, instead of just serving as a flashy distraction, the animation is actually used to service the script (not the other way around).Now, again, I honestly think the film is good, but there is still a lot of room for improvement. In addition to myriad missed opportunities, this film has its flaws. I found the film's second act to be a bit insipid and a little too heavy in comedy. Sure, it was funny, but it occasionally upset the comedy/drama balance, thereby preventing the second act from having the same emotional punch that the first and third acts have. Also, I felt that the story was slightly rushed and compressed. In fact, the film contains enough material for a TV miniseries. The film is solid and coherent as it is, but I still think a slightly longer running length would have done it a lot of good. Oh, and the villain is pretty weak - contrived and paper-thin (yes, there is a villain, but he is secondary to the primary conflict).Personally I think Frozen is the best of the five Disney Revival films so far, beating out Tangled by a whisker. Disney has successfully moved into the 21st century. For the most part, they have succeeded in combining their older elements with modern ones.Frozen is now the highest grossing animated film to date. At the same time, it's also receiving the harsh backlash that films this successful often receive. I personally think Frozen is overrated, but it's still good – charming, heartfelt, humorous, emotional, and overall entertaining - and it's one of my favorite films of 2013. Disney may not have the charisma they used to have, but at least they still know how to make a good movie.For more reviews, and my full review of Frozen (what you have just read is a truncated version of it): visit my blog: http://robertsreliablereviews.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Served, a little less Tangled, a lot more Frozen!","I am not always a big fan of Disney Animated movies. What with all the adorably naive princesses and prince charmings I always felt it was way too mushy for me. There were a few exceptions though Wreck-it Ralph, the best among them. Wreck-it Ralph followed similar child friendly, Disney style but instead of focusing on fairy tales and princesses, it was based on the world of video games and boy that was some ride. Yet another exception was 2010′s Tangled, which was a very enjoyable take on the Rapunzel fairy tale. The gorgeous visuals and intriguing characters all came alive with Tangled albeit with its own twists, and thus Disney got its formula.Enter Frozen. Disney's foray back to familiar territory after a short Wreck-it break. Without spoiling much, Frozen is based on the fairy tale, The Snow Queen and as family friendly as Disney animated goes, it doesn't have the least of dark side the fairy tale had. Its kinda like a prequel to the fairy tale with lush lovable characters and queen itself shown just a little bit 'misunderstood'.Being a Disney flick, it's undoubtedly a musical and all the tracks were so good that you could shake a leg to it. Wonderfully animated characters accompany the music which makes it a audio-visual treat. The characters themselves had enough personality to pull you through the narrative from start to end. The snowman Olaf was exceedingly hilarious and somehow reminded me of Sid from Ice Age.When I watched Tangled, I was bowled over with the visual quality, it had rich environments filled with colorful and well animated characters. Frozen was almost on par with it on the animation and graphical quality but somehow looked bland. Blame the snow, white and blue shades that saturated the locales it was slightly less visual than Tangled. But then again there was this particular scene where a character lift up another and the look and texture of fabric on the characters looked so absolutely fantastic that I forgot I was watching an animated movie. I know it could be just me, but I am glad I felt so and RIGHT THERE there an animated movies wins!In the end, Frozen, came as a surprise coz I wasn't interested when I saw the previews and I was less fascinated coz I was getting this instead of a Tangled sequel. But I am glad to say that I was pleasantly amused and entertained with Frozen. Kids will love it without doubt, but its a real feat for an animated movie when it can get adults glued to their seats and Frozen does just that.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"The golden key of Disney ""Frozen""","I like ""Frozen"". It is an animated film with several songs that are well known and popular. When we see the movie, we can listen to the songs. So it is not boring. After many people saw it, they listened to the songs and hummed them. Especially the song ""Let it go"", it is the most famous one. The song mixes well with the scene in the movie and expresses Elsa's feelings well. Also the song was sung by several celebrities. I often listen to it. The influence of the movie is amazing. The number of spectator is more than ten million. Many products with these characters of the movie were sold. ""Anna"" is one of the characters. she liked her sister ""Elsa"" so much. Elsa had the ability to freeze anything It made her life gloomy. So she wanted to be isolated and went away from Anna. I felt sad. I could understand Anna's feeling, because when i'm alone, i often feel lonely. I hoped that she would meet Elsa again soon while i was seeing the movie. The sisters had a close relationship. Even though Anna was young, she did anything to meet her sister and was very brave. So i like Anna.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Load of poop.,"Terrible songs, sounded like they were sung by Idols rejects. Really bad sound mixing and mastering. The characters singing voices changed for each song. Easily the most unpolished animation I've seen. A real shame to the creator of one of the greatest movies ever, Mary Poppins, which they blatantly ripped off in one scene. Doubtful anyone who rated this movie more than 2 would even know this though. The fact that this film did so well represents everything that is wrong in society today. I'd to recommend this to no one. Totally appalling. On the other hand, perhaps my expectations were set too high after hearing this was better than Toy Story.. what????",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A 'Frozen' Experience,"This Walt Disney movie is an enchanting musical extravaganza which captures the attention of the audience right until the end. The story line is centered around a Princess, Elsa who is born with magical powers. Unable to control her mystic abilities, she flees to the snowy mountains to live in solitude. Her younger sibling, Anna along with mountain man Kristoff make attempts to save her, but to no avail. Thereafter, an interesting turn of events lead Elsa to return to save the Kingdom from despair.The technology used in this movie is undoubtedly 'state-of-the-art', which coupled with melodic music and brilliant dialogues make it one of the best animated movies to date. Each character is given ample screen time and have been excellently portrayed. The scenes with snow covered castles and landscapes are breathtaking and leaves the viewers hungry for more. An unexpected and innovative twist at the very end lightens up the mood. A simple and linear story line ensures people of all age groups are able to understand and appreciate the essence that the movie imparts.The movie also encourages its viewers to realize the difference between Infatuation and True Love, which in practicality is misconceived by many. All in all, 'Frozen' is a must watch for everyone. Even if the genre does not excite you, the experience will not be disappointing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A brilliant addition to the Disney collection,"Disney has done it again with another animated masterpiece. Frozen has blown Tangled off the shelf, in my opinion, and set the bar for future Disney films. They even managed to bring back the appeal to both adults and children with witty characters and smart dialogue. While Its characters have all the potential to make a cliché storyline, it still manages to make itself unique and widely popular. But what sets it apart from other films in the Disney collection is their unorthodox representation of love. Frozen strays away from the immediate love at first sight ideal to the point of condemning it. It's as if they are attempting to remedy their previous fantastical message with one that is more realistic but still make a great story. Overall, a fun film for all ages and well worth 2 hours of your time.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Great Message of Love and Family,"I thought that Disney's ""Frozen"" was wonderfully done. The central message was that of love, family, and self-sacrifice- which was pleasantly original and if I might add, needed these days. There are some sad/touching parts that might make you tear up a bit- especially if you have sister- and you may want to read up on before taking the kids. It wasn't nearly as scary as ""Tangled"" and the humor was funny and appropriate (the occasional ""butt"" is said). The CG effects with the ice were really cool too. The music was weak compared to the older Disney classics but I must say better than the other recent Disney/Pixar films. A must-see for the family!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Not impressed,"I was not as impressed as everybody else. I found this to be yet another well done, professionally made Disney product, nothing more, nothing less. I fail to see any signs of greatness in it, other than perhaps the soundtrack. I found the story to be rather shallow, appealing only to kids (but I suppose it was made for them in the first place), the animation rather 'fake' looking for today's standards, geared only toward 3D viewing. You could see it was all computer animated, and while we know that all animated movies nowadays are made that way, it shouldn't be that obvious. It almost looked like a Japanese Manga at times...All in all, a decent movie kids will surely like, but otherwise nothing special.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Disney In Excellent Form!,"Frozen is one of the best films to come out of Disney Animation in recent years. Tangled and Wreck-It-Ralph were excellent, but Frozen tops them all. The story is simple, but it is an excellent one. The film is great for people of all ages. Children will get the delight of a talking snowman and adults will be enthralled by the mature themes the movie present. As for the music, it can't get any better than this. ""Let it Go"" is the most catchy and wonderful song. It's one that will be stuck in my head.Chris Buck's and Jennifer Lee's film is about a princess named Anna who takes a trip with a mountain boy and his reindeer in order to find her sister, the Queen Elsa who has magical powers in the form of turning everything to ice. She must find Elsa before the kingdom falls to corruption.The film has a nice voice cast. Kristen Bell delivers a fun, youthful performance as Princess Anna. Is Idina Menzel ever talented! She was excellent as Queen Elsa and when she belted her rendition of Let it Go, my heart just stopped. We also have some good supporting turns in Josh Gad and Ciaran Hinds.Overall, Frozen is one of the best Disney Animation films of this century and certainly rivals the best of the very best. The songs are excellent and worth singing along to, the animation is crystal clear, and above all, there is a story that is worth telling. A story about true love and how even magical, icy powers won't keep true love away. This is a delight for both kids and adults alike. I fell in love with this film and I clamor for a sequel, a good one though. I rate this film 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A nice bedtime story,"I have to admit that I agree with a lot of criticism about the plot. The story is kinda weird and most of the things don't have reasons, settings and even connections sometimes. However, I believe that this movie is not about the story: it's about the theme. Frozen uses songs, animation, beautiful scenes and simple dialogue to express its theme. It's different from most of the movies we have seen, and I believe that's why some people hate it so much. It's like the bedtime story we all love as kids: it doesn't make sense - but it's just great, and I do feel that I care about all the characters. (although I can't really remember their names after the movie) It's a movie that is so simple that you directly touch the core. I'm deeply moved, and I believe that love can melt snow. These two are all a great bedtime story needs. I minus 2 out of 10 for its plot, but I think the rest 8 out of 10 is well-designed.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

All my other friends agree with me, The Lion King is much better. In my opinion, it shouldn't have been the #1 animated movie of all time. I like Ice Age much better, it has just enough grim humor. Let It Go is the most overrated song EVER and it isn't anything special. I wish people could stop treating like it's a movie only for the gods to see. It wasn't bad though, I like it. Let It Go is actually the laziest-written song of them all, it isn't anything special still.

"Best animated film of the 2010s - a cult classic, with an enduring place in geekdom","Ah, Frozen. It's created Frozen Fever for the below-10 crowd. Around 2015-16, it was all Frozen Frozen Frozen in the girls' toy aisles. Frozen's merchandise and third-party products have given it a life of its own, beyond the mere movie that inspired them. When I first saw the movie, I gave it a 7. But a couple of years afterwards, with plenty of Frozen merchandise under my belt, I feel like I should give it a 10 - cult status, a franchise, a pop culture phenomenon, like LOTR, Twilight, and Star Wars. I'll settle for a compromise, and I'll give it a 9 for this review.Frozen's most endearing and enduring aspect is the beauty of the characters. The scenery, majestic castles, and ice castle are beautiful, too. Elsa is one of the most stunning characters in the history of animation. She's like one of those gilded country singers. I still don't know what she did all day cooped up in her ice castle, but a girl can dream. Anna is very pretty, too. She has a gorgeous, multi-colored costume that looks faux-Swiss or Nordic or whatever.Anna's princely love interest, Hans, is nice-looking, in an average way. Kristoff, oddly enough, is way handsomer, so I don't know why she didn't fall in love with him immediately. Do these animated characters have eyes or not? Humans are, unfortunately, visual creatures, so beautiful visuals in a film really speak to us, and lead to much more. Frozen inspired a clusterf--k of affilated merchandise, coloring books, memes, Pinterest pins, dreamy ""princess"" art, DeviantArt musings, etc. It's the cult of the princess in American pop culture. Little girls like it, and they don't know why they like it - it's just marketed to girls, and it fits the popular conception of what girls should like.Frozen is good because it inspires you to dream, and it's escapism, and it fits into the Pinterest-y dreams that young American women are suckered into.Frozen's songs are maybe second-rate, but they're still good. Mainly I know that Idina Menzel sang Elsa's songs in Frozen. Menzel is a semi-celebrity for the geek and Broadway crowd. She's the most famous Wicked actress, and for that, she's beloved.Of course, the surprise element of the sisterly love between Elsa and Anna is one of the hallmarks of the film. It's creative and innovative. You'd think it's another prince-saves-the-princess film, but that's been done too many times in the history of Disney. In 2013, Disney needed to think harder.Frozen is a gorgeous, perfect fantasy for girls and women. It will forever have its place in pop culture geekdom, like Harry Potter, Star Trek, Narnia, etc. It gives Beauty and the Beast a run for the money. Frozen and Beauty & the Beast fans have a lot of crossover. Both are girly, pretty fantasies with gorgeous mansions, landscapes, and lead characters. Beauty & the Beast has the deeper, more profound story, but still. In this age of Pinterest, Instagram, and third-party merchandise, it's not the story that's the king - it's the mere visual, or meme.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A Phenomenon,"Frozen truly has become a phenomenon beyond what anyone could have thought before the film was made and released. Not since the Toy Story films or The Lion King, has an animated film been so popular with the masses. Both boys and girls love the film and its characters.For the boys who love this film, they have Olaf; and the girls, they love Elsa, Anna and Olaf. It is very good to see the new Disney princess films are directed for a more wide audience than they were 20, 30 or even fifty years ago with Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty. Olaf has become very popular among the adults who've seen the film as well.Myself have not liked many of the Disney animated films over the years, but this is a stand-out hit among all genders and ages. Its not hard to see why once you watch the film. I hope that the Disney company continues to make films that the whole family can see together.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
I wanted to put it higher. I really did.,"I'm gonna start by saying I like this film. I really do. And if you have a few hours to waste pop this on and it will wittle the time away. But...but... It isn't as good as tangled, (which I will review later.)Let's start with the problems. Number one, there are too many main characters. I'm not saying that the characters are bad but with the exception of Anna and Olaf none of them get the screen time needed. (Bear in mind Olaf is a comedy sidekick and therefore does t need as much screen time.) number two. The characters seem to tread on each other's toes. Two princes, two princesses, two comedy sidekicks? It's a bit much. And finally and this is something that drives me mad, the fixer upper scene. I don't know where to begin. The last song is just painful!!That being said this movie has its pluses. The plot twists are brave (not quite done perfectly but not bad) the comedy is fine for a chuckle (thank you Olaf, comedy genius) and the songs, with the exception of fixer upper are very good, ( a special mention has to go to let it go and for the first time in forever reprise which is my personal favourite.)All in all a GOOD film but is it a great? I'm not sure that it is",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The Definition of Meh...,"When I first saw the trailers for this movie, I immediately felt like it was the definition of a generic Disney movie (Which I might add that they haven't done recently at all), complete with recycled characters.The only stand out element of this movie is that it is the only Disney movie I can recall that centers around the relationship between two sisters, much like how Brave was one of the only Disney movies featuring a story about the relationship between a mother and daughter.But this characteristic aside, there is little that I found redeeming about this movie.The moose's personality and mannerisms were a COMPLETELY recycled attributes of Flynn's horse in Tangled (An awesome Disney movie).The graphics and special effects for the monster hit theme song Let It Go were definitely overrated. Beauty and the Beast had just as good of a moment -- if not better -- in the sweeping camera ballroom scene.Oloff. F'ing. Oloff -_- The obvious cutesy sidekick character in this movie. He was SO self-aware of his ""cuteness"" that it was completely saturated and contrived. I couldn't stand him, aside from his brief musical number. That was OK. But save for that scene, zero redeeming qualities about this centrally featured supporting character.I don't even care enough about this movie to critique it any further. By the end of the movie, I said aloud ""That's it?"" Watch it and judge it for yourself before falling for the hype.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Not even close to a Disney classic!  Instead it was Barbie princess land with ice.,"I just took my 3 year old to see this movie for her first theater experience and I wish I could take it back.I saw the reviews and thought this movie would be perfect. I'm thinking Aladdin, Beauty & The Beast, Ice Age, Finding Nemo, Brave, How To Train Your Dragon....something on that level and instead got a poorly written, super cheesy, princess Disney musical. I expected a cool, fleshed out fantasy world with mystical powers and an intriguing story. Instead, it was a barbie doll princess castle, high school pop pile of pretty graphics. None of the songs were remotely memorable. The language felt very much of our time, in a bad way, and made it hard to get lost in the fantasy world. Keeps it from ever being a classic.I wish I could take it back.....and the clothing change to the super sexy, high slit, hip shaking, bouncing boobs, ice queen was a little disturbing. Gave it that extra malibu barbie prestige. Just what the movie needed.",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Very enjoyable,"Its defiantly worth watching, even though most of us are in high school, we still cant resist watching a Disney movie like this; no matter how embarrassing. The story is good, songs are good (and very popular now), and everybody else is watching it also. Be sure to watch it at some point. More of a great airplane movie though, not so much theater just because of the genre. The characters in this movie are good, and the voices fit relatively well. Its easy to follow along with and makes you feel happy for some reason. Like being too old for Disney parks but going anyways...if that makes sense. Once in a while you can tell that they couldn't figure out how to make something flow so they just went with it unrealistically but who cares, its the only negative.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A great Disney film overall!,"Disney's FROZEN is a really great film by all means, but is it perfect and amazing than High School Musical 2, which is also a movie distributed by Walt Disney Pictures? Yes, it is. Is it far being the best Disney movie ever made? Simply and positively, No. Is the movie better than any other musical film? Yes and no.Inspired by a fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen, ""The Snow Queen"", FROZEN tells the story of a fearless princess named Anna, who sets out an epic journey alongside a rugged iceman, Kristoff, his loyal pet reindeer Sven, and a naive snowman named Olaf, who loves summer to find her estranged sister, whose icy powers have inadvertently trapped the kingdom in eternal winter.Watching this movie for the first time, I had no idea what the hell was this movie was going to be about or if I was going to like it or not because the trailer did not give any plot details away.I really hoped I could like this movie because the director of this film, Chris Buck, also directed another Disney film, TARZAN. I was pleased with the results and not pleased with some of the things.The first few minutes of this movie got me thinking it was going to be just a regular girls movie about a princess meeting a prince and they fall in love kind-of-a-movie. The film did not focus on any romantic relationship at all as this film focused on the two main characters Anna and Elsa.Elsa (played by Indina Menzel) was a character that I had mixed feelings over when I first saw this film and the CGI is well cool on her character and her powers are just fantastic to see in Disney Digital 3D, way back in November 2013.Anna (played by Kristen Bell) is really fantastic and she is a character that you would like to see throughout the whole film and the animation and CGI on her is really amazing. Kristoff (played by Johnathan Groff) and his reindeer Sven are cool with the animation really done on them as well too.Hans (played by Santino Fontana) is really a good antagonist for the film and the way his animation is done on him was just impressive as hell, but I really think his character is simply evil.Then, finally, my favorite character of the entire film, which is the little snowman Olaf (played by Josh Gad) and his CGI and animation is really great and is really fantastic and I thought it was really amazing to see a living and breathing little snowman on screen.Those performances in the film were just excellent. The songs in this film is really amazing and just a joy to hear. My favorite songs in the film is ""For The First Time in Forever"", ""Let It Go"" - both the Indina Menzel and Demi Lovato versions, ""Do You Want to Build A Snowman?"" and the song that Olaf sings called, ""I Love Summer"" and also, there may be way too many songs in this film, but as a Disney movie musical, it works.The musical score composed by Christophe Beck and his musical score is just amazing as his musical score for Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel were simply incredible. But back to the musical score, his score is just extraordinary and his female-choir that he used for this film is just amazing.The film gives you a lot of very funny laughs that everyone can enjoy and laugh at. The characters, like I said, are all original and very amazing and fantastic and just incredibly well-done and is very spectacular.The only criticism I have is that there are parts where the characters just break out into song, and don't get me wrong, they do this in all musical movies, but with FROZEN, it is no different.I find one of the main characters already singing and just break out singing in this film and I'm sometimes, while watching the film, ""Come on, man! Do you really have to do that?"".The plot is very cliché in a few areas, but it's still an enjoyable plot and I wish that some animated movies stay true to their original source material, but for whatever reason, with all or some movies, this film can't seem to do that.This movie is as fun for my sisters and all kids and teenagers, because it is a Disney musical released and it is the best Disney film in 10 years and to hear that this movie took a long time to make, really helped make this movie the best that it can be.The film is not as good as TARZAN or the Disney / Pixar's TOY STORY film franchise and it is not the best Disney film in the world, but it could not have been done better and it also could have been a hell of a lot worse.FROZEN will make you laugh, cry, sing and have you re-watch this movie for a good 26 days or a good 10 days and it is a definitive great family film.This is the way a Disney musical film, live action or animation, and all musical films in general should be made. It should be about the plot, characters and music all at once.This film gets a 8 out of 10 - again, not the best Disney film in the world, but it could have been worse, but it is a great film overall.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Lovable Classic Disney Tale with mediocre elements,"I get why it is getting love... not sure why it is getting this much love. The story is nice, the animation is gorgeous, there is the standard comic relief characters (Olaf and Sven are very enjoyable) and there is a message to the whole thing... I hope because it is slightly beyond me what the message is. Face your fears? Love is the answer? Snowmen will melt in the sun? Maybe it was just below me.Either way it is enjoyable and funny film that is entertaining and has a bit of twist to it. Which is all nice.But it is an unimportant film with characters who adults at least should find it hard to related to as there is very little explanation or redeeming qualities to them. And the bad things they end up doing is just brushed off in the end. The songs are abysmal, trivial and really below the standard Disney set in the 90s for animated musicals.For all the things I didn't like about the film I can forgive all except the songs. Had they dropped the songs I could have enjoyed it far more. And it honestly feel like they knew this as the end 20-30 minutes feature no songs whatsoever. Did they just drop them?But this is me as an adult. Kids will love it for sure. All my points in the first part is still relevant. And kids will respond to this. And they might find the songs more appealing than me. And maybe not care too much about the character flaws.So do not avoid the film... just don't expect too much for adults to love about it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Interesting new Disney princesses,"Anna is the happy-go-lucky princess of Arendelle who loves her older sister Elsa. However Elsa's uncontrolled icing powers almost kills Anna. The trolls take away Anna's memory of Elsa's powers while their parents try to help Elsa control and hide her powers. When the parents are lost at sea, Elsa hides herself away especially from Anna. During Elsa's royal coronation, Anna asks to marry Prince Hans of the Southern Isles. The sisters fight and Elsa loses control of her powers. Elsa runs away and Anna sets off to find her. Anna enlists the help of Kristoff and his reindeer Sven. They meet the magical snowman Olaf created by Elsa. Once again, it boils down to an act of true love.This is an interesting if somewhat uneven Disney princess story. The opening exposition is a little clunky. It could do with some more careful rewrites. The story wants to follow both sisters. It's probably better to keep the POV on Anna from the beginning. This is above all else about sisterly love. The big midpoint reveal may work even better much earlier. It could have been an aside to the audience. The love story would be simplified and clearer which is more fitting for a kids movie. The songs are all big bombastic Broadway tunes. The catchiest part is the chorus of 'Let It Go'. These are interesting new princesses but I'm not sure they are going to be at the same level of the other legendary princesses.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Bad storytelling and sickly music,"This is not good. 10 minutes into the story, I'm assuming it's a 20 minute film. The songs are not good, the American accents are too sweet, and the conversations are extremely flimsy. This is not a well-told story. It's fully predictable, and I'm sure Andersen wouldn't approve of the naivety in an attempt to mesmerise a child's imagination. This is so overly-Disney, it would probably make Walt Disney shudder thinking that story has been devalued has at his company. Ugh!Even the opening music is mislaid, a combination of either African chanting or Native American ritual. My guess is that we were being taken into the great white north of the Inuit tribe in the Northern Territory of Canada. I'm fairly certain this was an animation project given to older Disney employees who reminisce on the old days.",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Awesome movie,"I absolutely love this movie, it's cute, funny, adorable and very magical!
I don't get some of the overly critical reviews on here at all, the songs are catchy, the characters extremely likeable. My 2 year old and I have watched this over and over again, which is more than I can say for a lot of other Disney movies. 
Some have said they don't agree with the matching up of Kristof and Anna and think he would pair better with Elsa...I could not disagree with this more!!
Kristof and Anna have a very obvious connection and spark, they bounce off each other like most couples would do. Anna is much more down to earth than Elsa as well, therefore a far more fitting match.
Everything about this movie is really fab!
I really do wonder if the other reviews come from people who have watched the same movie.
Looking forward to the second one :)",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Best animation flick of the year,"Apart from having a fast paced first and especially third act, Disney Animation's Frozen definitely captures its audience with stunning visuals, memorable music and a heart warming story. It definitely brings back the charm that has been well-known and expected from a Disney film. The voice performances of Kristen Bell, Idina Menzel, Josh Gad, and the rest were absolutely spectacular in song and out. It is everything expected out of a Disney film and more. The only negatives are of course the fast paced first and third acts. I won't say much about the first only that it had a lot of background to cover, and not much time to do it in. The Third act is fast-paced and is noticeably faster than the second and at times may be a bit hard to follow. Some say that it is the best Disney film since The Lion King, I say that it may just be better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Refreshing but not as good as I had expected...,"I had high expectations with this film, it being the Academy Award winner for best animated motion picture and being the highest grossing movie of the year 2013 and highest grossing animated movie ever. Despite the trailer of Frozen looking really good, and many people praising it, when I finally got a chance to watch this spectacle of ice and snow, I was left disappointed. Based on a loose and clichéd storyline that starts off really well, it gets slow and boring and only at the climax where there's an interesting twist. The visuals of ice and snow are terrific, so are the songs, and I think 'Let it go' deserves the academy award. The snowman, Olaf keeps you entertained but he can also do only so much. The only good thing apart from Visuals and songs was the relationship between the two sisters. And the scenes having both sisters are the only good moments in the film, be it when they build a snowman or one sister sacrifices herself to save the other sister, and vice-versa. Apart from that, only the snowman, Olaf, makes you smile and feel good. Everything else feels like fillers. I did enjoy the film. It is not a complete failure, but I was left disappointed. This may be the highest grossing animated film for reasons beyond my understanding but I have seen better animated films by Disney.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Three Requirements That Make Frozen a Good Movie,"Movies are a huge part of the American culture. Some movies however are not ""up to par"". There are three requirements that a movie must fulfill to be a great movie. These requirements include an inspiring plot, characters with an internal battle, and a fitting resolution to the conflict of the story. One great example of a movie that includes all of these requirements is Disney Pixar's Frozen.The storyline of Frozen is an inspiring story of two sisters, their journey of a lifetime, ""and the bonds of sisterhood""(USA Today). When the sisters are finally reunited after years of solitude and separation, they have a hard time seeing eye-to-eye. Anna and Elsa go through struggles and trials as Elsa tries to find herself and control her powers. These struggles fulfill the next requirement for a good movie.Another storyline in the movie is Anna's love life. After not seeing anyone for years, Anna immediately falls in love with prince Hans. Throughout the course of the story Anna begins to realize her feelings for Christof. Anna's love stories show young women that it is better to wait and learn more about a person, than it is to jump straight into a relationship. Anna love story with Christof, however, is not the main love story of the film. One of the main stories in the movie is about a sister helping her older sister overcome her fears. She is trying to convince her sister that even though she's different, she has worth and she's not a monster. Elsa runs away after accidentally revealing her powers and is labeled as evil by other characters in the movie. Anna, however, ""still believes in her sister, so she ventures into the cold and cruel world outside the gates of Arendelle in search of Elsa""(Chicago Sun-Times). Throughout the beginning of the movie Elsa is trying to hide who she truly is. This is relevant in today's society because people are afraid of what the world will think them. Anna is the inspiration the humanity needs to become more comfortable with itself.The final trait of a good movie is a good conflict resolution. Elsa could not control her powers until she realized that Anna's love was enough. Through her love Arendelle is saved and the kingdom is returned to Elsa's control. This shows that even when everything is out of control and one feels lost, someone's love can save them. This also shows that people should show love and kindness towards others because it will help people through their daily lives.Frozen is a great movie that shows passion, struggle, and triumph. It is an inspiring story with an internal battle within Elsa, and a love that resolves the conflict of the story. Overall Disney has made a great new princess story that will live on for years to come.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Surprisingly Charming,"I didn't watch this movie in the cinema, whether it was because i felt it was a threat to my masculinity or for some other reason. I ended up watching it on DVD a few days ago, because i wanted to see what the hype was about since everyone i'd talked to said it was amazing. i found myself actually really enjoying the movie, it was very original compared to the stereotypical Disney princess movie and i really liked the premise of it. The characters were actually all great, even Else and Anna who i didn't see myself liking at first yet found them very likable. Olaf was obviously hilarious as well. i also really enjoyed the music, which has become very popular with fans. Kirsten Bell and all of the other voice actors did a great job, i was very impressed. im giving it 8 stars, which is very good.

An Unexpectedly Great Animated Family Movie,"Honestly, I thought Frozen would be just another Tintin or Chicken Little, solid but not spectacular movies that are aimed at young children. However, what I found was anything but. Frozen is one of the best non-Pixar animated movies, and one I want to see again.Story- 9/10The story of Elsa and Anna is touching, beautiful, funny and enjoyable. I can't remember an animated film with a story this good since Toy Story 3.Acting- 9/10Well, voice acting is always harder to rate than screen acting. However I found the characters to have good voices that weren't annoying singers.Direction- 10/10Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee did amazing directing in Frozen, with beautiful scenes and character speech and movement.Stray ThoughtsThe singing was brilliant, one of a few Disney movies that have songs that are worth paying and/or downloading. The animation was impeccable and the humour was well thought out and genuinely funnyOverall- 9.7/10Absolutely loved the film, with many strong and memorable moments.

strange,"it is a cultural phenomenon. without any clear explanation. because it could be reduced at different influences, with not the most inspired story, feminist, ambiguous, chaotic, artificial, predictable in many scenes and with ambition to represent a kind of revolution in domain. nothing wrong but the only pillars who sustain it are the visual delight and the songs. and that does it a strange animation. because, at the first sigh, it is return to the old fashion Disney. but the message is profound different and it has the seal of contemporary relativism. for the new values who proposed to children. for the political correctness who becomes its basic message. for the visual effects who are more and more important , transforming the story in insignificant detail. sure, beautiful show. but nothing more. because the message of an animation movie is more significant than the technological magic.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A Sweet Disney Offering But Over-Hyped,"Frozen is a heart-warming Disney adventure following the story of two sisters: Elsa (voiced by Idina Menzel) has the power to create ice and snow, but an accident leaves her frightened and isolated from the world; meanwhile younger sister Anna (voiced by Kristen Bell) is determined to bring Elsa back out into the world. When their kingdom is plunged into an eternal winter Anna sets off on an adventure to save the kingdom and her sister.This is by no means a ""Christmas"" film, as in there is no Santa or Christmas setting, however I guess it can be classed as a festive film what with it being set in winter! It has a typical sweet-Disney styling: there are catchy songs and likable characters – in particular, Olaf the snowman (voiced by Josh Gad), who provides warm-and-fuzzy moments. The morals of the story and theme of the importance of family are quite endearing, and the characters of the sisters are very relatable. The story itself is fairly simplistic, but different to other Disney films (and apparently inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's ""The Snow Queen""), with a couple of some more complex emotional scenes as well. As a children's film adults can expect to only be mildly entertained by the charm of the animations, and maybe the occasional chuckle at a rare adult joke – It's not got the same enjoyment factor for the adult audience that some other animated classics have (I still love the likes of Monsters Inc (2001) and the Toy Story for example) but perhaps that is because I grew up with those films and appreciated them when I was younger!Frozen is a sweet animation with songs and characters that children will love. I'm a bit too old to be captured by it in the same way that a younger audience would - there was a lot of hype surrounding this film and it fell slightly short of my expectations, but still heart-warming. Good luck on getting ""Let It Go"" out of your head afterwards!",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

A great comeback to the classic Disney style!,"During the Thanksgiving weekend, I prepared myself to try to catch this in theaters with my siblings (OK, it's the same review as before, but it's in another account I made almost four months ago in case you don't know) to see if it would really exceed my expectations like the trailers had promised. Later, it turned out that it did and to my surprise, it's a great comeback to the classic Disney style that reminded me of the Golden Age and the Renaissance. Seriously, I'm placing this in one of my top 50 favorite Disney animated films.The story, loosely based on the fairy tale from Hans Christian Anderson, is very compelling it succeeded in bringing back the old formula that made the other Disney films successful. It has the princess, a handsome hero, the villain, a comic relief, and musical numbers. Not only that, it has wonderful characters.Anna is a likable heroine with her fearless quality and will do anything to help her sister, Elsa. Elsa almost looks like a Disney villain, but her back-story and the way she is seen as a monster due to her ice powers made me felt sorry for her. Kristoff is an endearing second main character and helps Anna in the rest of the movie. Olaf and the reindeer are no doubt great comic relief characters. Their humorous moments make them scene-stealers. Hans looks like a prince charming at first, but as a villain, his motives explains the reason why he's evil and he's very convincing. The voice acting is solid with Kristen Bell, Idina Menzel (known for playing Elphaba in Wicked), Jonathan Groff, Santino Fontana, Josh Grad, and Alan Tudyk.The writing is strong and the dialog is witty. The music score from Christophe Beck is great and the songs are great. Not as memorable as the other Disney films, but has a lot of energy, which makes them epic.The best part, however, would have to go to the animation. The character designs are solid, but the best thing is the visuals. Arendelle is great, but the Ice Castle made by Elsa is beautiful to look at. Disney, the way you did that is so timeless I'll never stop looking at it.Overall, Frozen is a great comeback to the classic Disney style and is easily one of the best films of not only 2013, but the best Disney Animation Film in the history of Hollywood. This deserves a thumbs up from me! :)",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"It may be merely a modern revamp of a done-to-death formula, but Frozen is irresistibly smirk-inducing and will charm the pants off you","When Disney is on top of their game, as here with Frozen, no other film can come close. Except for maybe another Disney movie. True to form, Frozen offers some life lessons in the form of metaphors formulated to appear blunt to adults and go over children's heads, for the purpose of discussion with children.It also cleanses your views on the world, relationships and love, and resets your psyche to a giddy, unbridled optimism. Yet, for the sake of resonating profoundness, Frozen doesn't skimp on the expedient depth and occasional darkness. I was grinning like an idiot throughout most of the film.To watch Frozen is to be enticed, enthralled and enchanted. To enjoy it is to say you have a heart.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The worst kid movie I ever took my  5 yr old grandkid to,"My wife and I are fairly young grandparents and take the grand kids out for a movie time to time A good movie to me is one that I see the kids enjoying a film and also if the adults enjoy the film is an extra. I took two kids 5yrs old and 7 to see ""Planes"", and hearing some rather bad reviews was expecting a boring movie trying to capitalize on ""Cars"" and sat down to take a nap. It turned out I really enjoyed this movie along with the kids.Now to this ...movie...? I actually had more fun watching the coming events than this weak weak weak movie. I looked over at my wife after 5 or 10 minutes and her face told me the same thing I was feeling. I was ready to walk out after spending $50 for a terrible 3D movie and would of thought I was saving time instead of spending $50 and being punished to sit in that chair and waste another 5 minutes on this garbage.The shifting plot...singing...singing and singing for no reason ( Music is suppose to accompany plot and be almost unnoticed). This was like sitting in an opera and the music was so overwhelming that you couldn't pay attention to the weak weak weak weak plot.I also watched the kids faces...and in that time (5-10 minutes) they also weren't even looking at the screen but were more engaged in watching the other bored kids in the movie theater.I was far more proud of the kids ( 5 yrs male and 7 yr old female) for being good even though neither of them faced the screen the majority of the movie.And this movie is not a movie for all ages... it is more of a movie for no ages. It tries to be a romantic movie and tell me what 5 year old is interested in romance...or singing romance...They invented a snowman monster...for whatever reason which made no sense, because supposedly the sister Elsa banished herself because she was afraid she would hurt her sister or others from her powers...now suddenly she is sending a monster snowman to try and kill her sister and her accomplices? What .. what? The movie is full of disconnects that your brain tells your heart yo are being used and manipulated in this movie and a computerized formula was the guiding director in this piece of garbage movie.I've watched Cars 1 &2 (cars 2 not so good either) , Planes, Toy Story 1,2,3, and other kid movies a hundred times on DVD with the kids and still get some enjoyment from it because of entertaining stories that have plots that make sense.This movie...is terrible....did I mention that before...I would go over all the details but I noticed the other one star reviewers covered it pretty well.The part that amazes me is seeing that some people gave this 5 stars and also say the kids were laughing up a storm. Maybe their theater got a totally edited and rewrote script? I can't believe it would be possible for anyone to possibly give this 5 stars.Oh well difference of opinion is what makes the world go round.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Disney bringing magic back,"I went to see this movie the other day and I absolutely loved it.

It has been a while since I've seen a movie like this, except for Tangled perhaps (Dispicable me was also great but it's from Dreamworks), it made me feel like I was a child again watching one of the old Disney movies.I recommend it to children and adults because it is essentially fun and if you're older, it will take you some years back.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Not ""Tangled"" or ""The Little Mermaid"" good, but a good movie anyway.","The reasons I like this movie are because, The animation is just sensational,{Best I have seen in a Disney movie so far,} It made me chuckle several times, A couple parts actually made me want to tear up, {Not like the ending of Toy Story 3 but still,} and a couple of the songs really were very good.The reasons I think this movie could have been better are because, the plot could have been better {For little kids its great but just as many adults see Disney movies,} The majority of the songs just didn't grab me. I could sit here for a long time and get specific why I don't think this is the best Disney movie but I will just say that in general, Frozen just didn't capture my attention or imagination like Tangled, Beauty and the Beast or The Little Mermaid did.

A Bit Disappointed,"I have to say, I expected much more of this movie. This may be because so many people seem to like it. And because it's a Disney movie.Yes, the graphics are beautiful, but, and I'm sorry for the people who did like it, the characters were horrible. Let's start with Elsa. Such weird character development she has. The song 'Let it Go' was quite nice, I have to say, but in the beginning of the song she's still afraid and all that stuff, and at the end she's like a bitchy girl. If you know what I mean.And then Anna. Elsa's sister. Well, it all goes so fast if you ask me. She meets a guy and wants to marry him the same day she met him!!! What kind of logic is that? She thinks she's funny but she's definitely not. Again, sorry people who do like her.But the worst character of all is Olaf the snowman. Have you seen that guy? His sense of humor is just so terrible. And his song is so ANNOYING. I really wanted to skip it. I really thought he would be a funny character.I'm not going to describe every character, because there were also a few good ones. Like Kristoff. He and his reindeer. Heh, that was quite funny, actually.The story was cliché, but it's sometimes nice to have a cliché.

I'm no Disney lover but...,"Hey,I'll try to be as brief and informative as I can be, i'll start by recommending this movie, it's worth the watch and has a lot to offer: the visuals are fun and creative (you probably know by now that the effects on the ice are absolutely gorgeous), it has a number of fairly funny moments, and the first few minutes; i thought were very moving and well done. It addresses important aspects of human relations in a very smart way, while still being enjoyable for kids. Obviously one of the things the movie gets almost perfectly are the musical segments, every single song (except maybe the troll song, which wasn't by any means a ""bad"" song) were very well done, and succeeded in conveying the right emotions at the right time. (This is coming from someone who absolutely hates musicals and musical segments in movies).You might have heard that this movie has a feminist moral or something along these lines, be sure to ignore these comments and see for yourself, Disney simply did a very good job of writing a strong and attaching female character, I am very skeptical of any political agenda here. It's just a very fun and well made movie.It is also worth noting that Disney did take a risk by poking fun at some of their past material (i'd rather not explain in detail to avoid any kind of spoiling even minor) which explains some of the negative reviews it got from the hardcore traditional princess Disney fan base.With all this said here are a few minor complaints I have: I would say that the most legitimate criticism you could make would be the lack of depth in Elsa's character. Don't get me wrong though we do see her evolve at the beginning, but you simply don't feel like you know much about her by the end. Also she looked a little weird to me, something about the makeup they gave her, but that's a nitpick. It also has an obvious short, old, no redeeming quality, wig wearing villain which the movie could have done without in my opinion.Overall it does it's job very well with beautiful music, visuals and a very clever ending. It is most definitely worth your time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The new Disney Crowd Pleaser,"Frozen has a good amount of child-like mystique, and mythology of its own, and it uses it quite well throughout the film. The characters are, indeed, something to behold. Though they do delve into their own type of humor a tad often, it doesn't distract from the light-hearted drama that makes it an interesting film. Then there is another distraction that does get a little heavy after a while, and that's the start of the songs. They have songs very often throughout the films, and the beginning of them just seem out of place and forced into the scene. Though they are rather catchy and decent songs, they really could have done without them. A lot of the antagonists could have used a little more characterization, seeming to just shout ""I AM A VILLAIN"" when you first see them, although there is the cloak and dagger effect that I rather liked. All in all, it was a solid film, just not one of Disney's better animated movies. Definitely a good family sit-down.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The world has lost its mind!!!!,"Thank heavens Walt Disney didn't live to see this complete Snow Queen ripoff with the least effort in animation techniques,Screen writing,musical dialogues,Character developing that most probably made Walt Disney turn in his grave anyway! it was acceptable as an all right 6 star animation in the long drought of fairy tales in Hollywood animations ,but to get this much credit ?has the drought been so long that people have actually forgotten what a good animation looks like?Seriously! first with the stupid disgusting Croods ,then this along with most of the movies made since 2013.it seems like Holly Wood producers actually had prepared themselves for the end of 2012 to be the end of the world & now they're just too tired & demotivated to give a damn! This leftover whatever thing that is left of Holly Wood is down on the road to be the laughing stock of Bollywood & Even much lower Cinema industries.

"Frosty Winter, Warm Hearts","This year Disney teaming up again with Pixar presents us a winterly fairy tale so warm that will certainly thaw our hearts.Inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale 'The Snow Queen', 'Frozen' follows Princess Anna on a quest to bring her sister Queen Elsa back to her kingdom which owing to her icy powers is accidentally trapped in eternal winter. Full of optimism and courage Anna is determined to bring her sister back and restore her kingdom to flourish. En Route she encounters Kristoff, an ice trader with his reindeer and Olaf, a crazy and hilarious snowman.They are back and they are good this time. 'Frozen' is packed with an amazing and smartly written script, some hummable & memorable sing- alongs and striking visuals (whoa, the technology has made possible rendering as never seen. The lighting looks so natural). This is what Disney excelled at. Its like a tribute to the legacy of all those movies we enjoyed as kids - The Lion King, The Little Mermaid etc.The best factor about this movie is its closeness to real life issues despite being a fantasy tale. Notice, there is no scheming villain here in here to interrupt the journey. All there is, is the conflict with inner selves and difference in perceptions. The humor and the optimistic approach towards relationships will appeal to folks of all ages and stir their emotions as well. In all, a tale that will melt your heart and leave you wondering only if our world were as beautiful.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Such different sisters or a successful experiment of the Evil Corporation,"A family musical. It was in the recent 2014. I still worked in the Soyuz chain of stores, and I remember perfectly well what a buzz there was about this cartoon at that time. How everyone praised him, how he instantly disappeared from the shelf, because he did not stay long. Moreover, they bought an expensive DVD edition for four hundred rubles, and, of course, they snapped up Blu-ray, and of course Blu-ray 3D for a piece (who, of course, had such money and suitable equipment). I was so tired of this nonsense that I couldn't stand it and bought myself a Blu-ray for seven hundred rubles and watched this cartoon - and was pleasantly surprised and even partially agreed with most viewers that they praised this creation of the Evil Corporation. I decided to review it recently - and the cartoon is still good, beautiful, and on the eve of the New Year I decided to write a review on it. And here's my brief opinion for you - A successful experiment of the Evil Corporation. However, I must warn you that I will indicate not only the obvious advantages of the cartoon, but also the disadvantages, which are also there, and you should not forget about them. This concludes such a long and tedious introduction and gets to the point.So, the obvious advantages:
1. The script - finally, thirteen years after the release of the first ""Shrek"", the Evil Corporation decided to change the basic concept of its cartoons, which has already filled everyone's teeth, and not only turn everything upside down, but also make fun of it. Of course, the beginning of the ""Cold Heart"" is stamped, but it's even good, because they were afraid to scare off their key audience from the very first frames, so the beginning is ordinary, but then it started. Two princesses, and sisters. One is cheerful and cheerful, the other is sullen and withdrawn, while without five minutes the queen. They quarrel, because of which the second escapes, turning the kingdom into a land of eternal cold. Now the first one needs to find the second one. Along the way, there are friends, and so on. In short, I am sure that you have watched the cartoon and you know everything perfectly well. The script is based on Andersen's fairy tale ""The Snow Queen"", from which only the names of the characters remain in the ""Cold Heart"". The main villain here is none other than the prince. What a turn! A bold move, and especially in the Russian version, because it is duplicated by Dima Bilan. The ending is predictable, but we approached it a little from the other side, and I must say, quite convincingly. A bold experiment, especially for the Evil Corporation.2. Humor is childish, naive, funny, playful, and at the same time not annoying. Both an adult and a child will laugh heartily. Humor here does not shine with originality, there is no double bottom, word games or super-intellectual jokes, rather ordinary humor associated with romance, adventure, friendship and blood ties.3. Animation - that's why you can praise the ""Cold Heart"" for a long time and hard, because from a technical point of view and visually there is complete order (not counting a couple of small shoals that do not play a big role). After all, animation is a long and painstaking business. This is not a movie where you were filmed on camera and repeated several times if you didn't like something. Snowflakes, snow-covered expanses, weather effects, characters, surroundings, magic, atmosphere - all this is clearly done with love, and not just because of the big money of one big Corporation. Artists, designers, programmers - all these people have done a great job so that we, ordinary viewers, could watch this beauty through televisions after a hard day's work. You can sort out the animation for a long time, literally by frames, but I've already said it decently, so we'll finish this.4. Bright and charismatic characters - both our main young ladies Anna and Elsa, men Christoph and Hans, Sven the deer, and secondary, representatives of other kingdoms, residents of Arendelle. But my most favorite character was, is, and will forever be the funny and kind snowman Olaf, dreaming of a hot summer. Each of them, something, and is remembered. Of course, they are all hackneyed types, but they are well served here, and some even changed their character traits, which was a bold move for the Evil Corporation, again, I repeat.5"" ""Let go and forget"" - in the original ""Let it Go"". The song that, after the release of this cartoon, literally conquered the whole world, and only the lazy one did not sing it (I'm just one of those). And the Russian version has become no less a hit in the former USSR than the original English one. The song is about the struggle with oneself, about feelings that are bursting out, about the strength of the person himself. It is impossible to count how many times the song was remade, how many voices did not sing it. The song is great and deserves its popularity. And the rest of the songs from the cartoon are good, but ""Let Go and Forget"" stands at the top, and after all, it was she who snatched the Oscar.So, no less obvious disadvantages:
1. Feminist message - if you calm down your delight and think about the cartoon, then this fact will become obvious - all representatives of the male tribe are represented here either by fools or scoundrels. There is no third one here. But women are both strength, and courage, and courage, and fortitude. Even the main message about true love here clearly echoes the entire scenario line. Why did the screenwriters present the men so one-sidedly? What have we done to them? It's a shame damn.2. Logic - there are many questions to the logic of this whole fairy-tale world, and if we delve into it, it turns out that the script is not so ""brilliant"" as many believe. The script echoes emotions and feelings, but the viewer forgets about logic at this time. Awareness comes later, when feelings have cooled down and emotions have subsided.3. The third dimension is already purely my pen, but I am madly in love with classic two-dimensional animation. I grew up on it, and I can't stand this fashionable third dimension of yours. That's why I can't watch most modern cartoons. There are exceptions, but there are quite a few of them.A little bit about the main characters:
1. Anna is the Princess of Arendelle, kind, cheerful, cheerful, who loves her reserved sister Elsa. The classic princess of the Evil Corporation. A cute and kind character who is simply impossible to spoil. She behaves like a young and flighty girl, and this is not surprising, especially if you remember the conditions in which she and her sister grew up. Yes, and a good name. Anna means ""benevolent"". Throughout the cartoon, she shows courage and determination, perseverance, because she is ready to sacrifice her life for her sister. A whole pen!2. Elsa is Anna's older sister, unlike whom she is withdrawn and preoccupied with her magical power, which she is not able to control. Having flared up, he escapes to the mountains, while enveloping his kingdom in eternal winter. What can I say, it had to happen sooner or later (thanks to short-sighted parents). But at heart she is as kind and cheerful as Anna. And what an outfit she conjured up for herself! Mmm, fantastic!3. Olaf is a talking snowman that Anna meets on her way. A cute and kind character who dreams of summer. He also shows courage and determination at a crucial moment, and a very deep and wise thought comes out of his mouth, which cannot be forgotten.Of course, such an experiment paid off, and thanks to ""word of mouth"" brought a huge profit. Therefore, in 2019, a direct sequel to ""Cold Heart 2"" was released, which I did not watch, but I may take a look (but I'm afraid to be very disappointed), but a few short films should be checked out immediately. So I'm wrapping it up.What a pity that after the release of the first cartoon, the Evil Corporation took a different path, which will not lead it to the best end, and we will not see any more masterpieces. Although ""Cold Heart"" is clearly not a masterpiece. It's just a good cartoon that will not leave anyone indifferent.As a result, we have a good cartoon of the Evil Corporation with a non-trivial script, the most magnificent animation, an excellent song, good humor and the right moral message.My rating is 8 out of 10 and my recommendation for viewing!P. S. I wish you all a Happy New Year! Let all the bad things remain in the old, and in the new let all your most cherished dreams come true. And Olaf congratulates you too (he asked me to personally tell you!). Good luck and health to everyone!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

A good Disney film,"In the fictional kingdom of Arendelle, this animated Disney musical tells the story of two sister princesses. One of them has a sometimes uncontrollable power to turn her surroundings into ice and snow.This is a pleasant movie whose songs and stories are rather good but perhaps not as good as other Disney animated musicals. This is not meant as a criticism; it's just that the bar has been set so high by those other films that it's hard to hit such a high benchmark.The benchmark is met, however with the fine singing and acting voices. And it is clearly surpassed in the stunning animation. The beauty of the Arendelle kingdom as well as the ice palaces and structures created by Princess Elsa fit the true magic that is expected of the Disney empire.

Another Disney Champion,"The holiday season is here once again, and I cannot think of a better way to spend it with your family then taking them to see ""Frozen,"" Disney's newest animated masterpiece. Returning to the musical renaissance style that was explored by 2010's ""Tangled,"" ""Frozen"" to tell its version of Hans Christian Anderson's classic story, ""The Snow Queen."" Despite its loose relation to the source material, Frozen still manages to be a charming, heartfelt musical event that families of all ages will enjoy.In the magical kingdom of Arendelle, a young princess named Elsa (Played by Idina Menzel of ""Glee"") possesses the power to freeze anything and conjure snow and ice with her mind. After nearly injuring her younger sister Anna (Played by Kristin Bell of ""Veronica Mars"" and ""Hit and Run"") as a child, her powers are kept a secret from the kingdom, and Anna's memories of her powers are erased to protect her. This introduction scene is short but sweet, and it really gives the audience a good sense of Elsa and Anna's relationship. Elsa is forced to shut Anna out of her life despite how much she loves her, and Anna just wants to spend more time with her sister, and can't even know why she can't for her own protection.When Elsa finally becomes old enough to be coroneted as queen, an incident at the ceremony reveals her powers to the whole kingdom. Fearing that she will be persecuted by the other kingdoms and her own people, she runs to the mountains in hiding, building herself an ice castle to spend the rest of her life in. In her despair, she brings an eternal winter upon Arendelle. In a rather progressive plot point, Anna bravely decides to venture out on her own to find Elsa and bring summer back to the kingdom. For a princess, this is quite a movement from the days of princesses waiting for their prince to save them.Anna is an extremely well developed female lead. In addition to her interesting back story and progressive nature, she is far from a flawless Mary-Sue type character. She is rather clumsy and awkward, and is willing to fall in love with a man she just met as evidenced in the song ""Love is An Open Door."" The latter trait at first comes across as cliché, but luckily, the film acknowledges the latter flaw to let her develop throughout the film.On her journey, she will meet the bulky but immensely likable Kristoph (played by Johnathan Groff of ""Glee""), a male lead that is just as clumsy as Anna. He is joined by his reindeer, Sven, an adorable character that charmingly falls into the ""All Animals Are Dogs"" trope that honestly never gets old. Also joining the troupe is a snowman Elsa and Ana made as kids named Olaf (played by Josh Gad of ""The Book of Mormon""). Many Disney films have a comic relief character that is there ""for the ride,"" however, Olaf is perhaps one of the most useful and likable comic relief characters I have ever met. Throughout the film, Olaf helps the characters on their journey and does a lot more than make jokes. He is even given a bit of depth, having his own song, ""In Summer"" that details his comically ironic curiosity for summertime.In addition to the witty, smartly written script, the musical numbers are all charming and smile-worthy. From grand-scale numbers like ""Let it Go"" to charming, character-building numbers like ""Fixer Upper,"" Frozen provides plenty of musical splendor to please the whole family. Expect a sing-a-long version to pop up soon.On top of this, the animation is stunning to say the least. From the droplets of frozen rain on the trees to the ice-built castle of Elsa, viewers will be astounded by the scenery and beauty of the world introduced to them.Frozen is a wonderful experience to add to Disney's legacy full of quality entertainment. Almost every cliché it faces can easily be brushed aside and it is certain many will adore it. There is no doubt in my mind that this film will be adored for generations.

Great Movie,"One of the worst Disney animated movies I can recall seeing. 75% inane songs, way to obvious plot even for Disney. Very, very little mizah. Bland characters and just plain below par compared to what Disney and other animation studios have been able to produce in the last 10 years. The usual villains and sidekicks appear but with nothing new to offer.I could not stop myself from skipping at least a minute from most of the songs. The voice acting was, well, bland is the best word. Absolutely mediocre. I was thoroughly disappointedDo not by any means pay to watch this and be sure to be in the company of easily amused small children",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
This is the Disney I love!,"After looking forward to seeing both ""Epic"" by Blue Sky Studios and ""Frozen"" by Disney, I saw both of them this weekend.The main character of ""Epic"" looks like a twin of the main character of ""Frozen"". Also, one movie deals with cold vs warm and the other deals with decay vs growth. Finally, both movies rely a lot on beautiful nature shots. For these reasons, I felt I should review both together.""Frozen"" was much better than I expected. Frozen reminded me a lot of traditional Disney classics like Snow White, Dumbo or Bambi. Yes there was singing, but the singing was surprisingly traditional without sounding corny and outdated. Unlike in most cartoons that involve singing, in ""Frozen"" it enhanced the experience rather than being a turn-off.""Frozen"" also had a rather well-developed story. It wasn't a traditional good-vs-evil story where the good were perfect and the bad haven't got a single redeeming quality. It also wasn't yet another generic ""we must remain ourselves and fight tradition"" story like Mulan, Brave and so many others out there. The characters felt more real than I'm used to in a Disney flick and combined with some humor that actually works, that makes ""Frozen"" one of the most entertaining animations I've seen in a long time.""Epic"" was an ""epic failure"" in all of these area. The characters were bland and generic. The story was bland and generic and felt like they mixed ""Arthur and the Minimoys"", ""Antz"" and ""Ferngully"" together, then filtered until nothing interesting was left.The humor didn't work either. As silly as the talking snowman in ""Frozen"" may look, he actually did work as a comic relief. His actions were funny, his words were funny and he complemented the heroes of the movie well. In ""Epic"", a snail and a slug served the very same purpose, only they were annoying as h***. Think Jar Jar Bing annoying and worse.The only thing that works in ""Epic"" are its visuals. If I just wanted to look at pretty pictures, both ""Frozen"" and ""Epic"" would be equally beautiful. The problem is that a movie is more than pretty pictures. A movie is entertainment and needs to entertain. While ""Frozen"" was much better than I expected, ""Epic"" was much worse.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
It's really a lovely movie,"I loved it so much. It was fun, lovely, dramatic and dark at some points. The animation was outstanding... i think it's the best animation i've ever seen.

"Amazing animation, heart-touching story, and catchy musical numbers","One of my pet peeves with both live-action and animated movies is that they can never get snow right. This was the first time that I have been impressed by the animation effects of the snow, ice and everything else. It's nice to see that Disney can make a computer animated movie that rivals anything by the other major studios. I was originally a little put off that it would be a musical, but after having watched it, Let it Go has been stuck in my head. It's also interesting that they chose to go with a non-Disney resolution to the major problem. The characters are all lively and funny, with the setting portrayed beautifully.

"Frozen in  ""Frozen's"" small setting radius","The souls of feminists unite as Frozen finally breaks through old Disney cliché's. Young women can attach to Disney's prototypical fantasy world of princesses and castles, but Frozen does not let them dream infinitely as the film's conclusion shows the love and strength within all women's hearts; strength in the confidence women have as individuals and equals.While the movie's message is powerful and well overdue, the fact is Frozen's flaws are impossible to overlook. Disney fell short in creating a dream world, as the entire setting happens within one town, never stretching beyond outlying mountains. The film's plot begins and ends within a two day span, leaving viewers with the hopeless task of believing monumental character change occurred in such a short period of time. The audience is also expected to understand the depth within each character as young adults, based on single, insignificant, events that happened in childhood. Disney's difficult task of designing films for all ages will always create plot rifts, but the film's strong themes warranted more depth within the movie.The film is simply not on the same level as Disney's previous classics, but Frozen will be remembered as the catalyst in re-shaping Disney's gender ideals for the better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

"Great family movie, but a couple of minor complaints.","Very enjoyable Disney movie about family, loyalty, and personal responsibility with very good songs, a couple of which I can see becoming as popular as other previous Disney movie hits (A Whole New World, A Friend Like Me, etc.). However, the only things that ""took me out"" of the movie were 1) Elsa's transformation (a little too sexy for a kids' movie and even though I'm not a dress designer, I kept thinking what a missed opportunity not to utilize a snowflake-lace design on a much more modest neckline!), 2) the geographical confusion, (where was this supposed to be? Scandinavia? a northern British territory? Did they think the general public wouldn't appreciate a true Nordic film with appropriate place names so they had to Anglicize it a bit?) and 3) the minimal explanations/resolutions to the dramatic elements except for the most obvious conflict point/twist near the end (my 10 year-old neighbor had to ask me what happened about a couple of things because they happened so quickly on screen - perhaps to reduce the scariness factor, but it was a bit too quick!).

Why would you open a film about cold, ice & snow with African themed music? Why? Where's the context for that music?This sums up Frozen.

An icy adventure with heart and music,"""Frozen,"" directed by Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee, is a Disney animated film that has captivated audiences since its release in 2013. The story follows two royal sisters, Elsa and Anna, who live in the kingdom of Arendelle. Elsa, the elder sister, possesses magical powers that allow her to create ice and snow, a gift that becomes a burden she must hide.The film's animation is visually stunning, showcasing breathtaking winter landscapes and magical ice creations. The characters are charming and relatable, with Anna's adventurous spirit and Elsa's struggle for self-acceptance forming the emotional core of the story.One of the film's standout features is its music, composed by Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez. Songs like ""Let It Go"" and ""Do You Want to Build a Snowman?"" are not only catchy but also serve to deepen the characters' emotional journeys.While ""Frozen"" occasionally follows familiar Disney tropes, its fresh take on sisterhood and empowerment, along with its memorable soundtrack, make it a standout.

Exceeded my high expectations,"I was expecting a lot from this new Disney flick, but it exceeded my expectations. Let's begin at the animation itself. Wow, just wow, it looked absolutely gorgeous. The style is very much like that of Tangled. They look so realistic and beautiful.Apart from the amazing graphics there were some great songs. Of course there are songs, this is a musical. I see people complaining about the amount of songs and i must say there are a lot. But is that a bad thing in this case? The voices were very nice to listen to, the lyrics were very cleverly put together and the music was really nice. Disney really outdid themselves this time with the musical songs.Humour, yes there was a lot of great humour. It was not over the top, nor was there too much. There were funny parts in the entire movie, suitable for adults and children. I even think some of the humour was to far fetched for children and only really understandable for adults which made it fun for all ages.The plot was different from most of the Disney movies i've ever watched. It wasn't just a princess story, it was so much more. The characters were very well made and believable and also very likable. Olaf the snowman and Glen the reindeer were very fun and really added something to the story other than being just filler.All in all, I enjoyed this movie very much and rate it very high on my 'best Disney movies' list. Disney really showed everyone what they are still capable of and that they continue to create really great animation films. I can't wait what they come up with for their next feature film. Frozen was one of those movies you can watch over and over and never get bored off.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Stop the Disney trolls!,"We know the point about Disney's bad pass after the Box-Office failure: John Carter & Lone Ranger, and artistic & economic failure from WDAS. However, seriously, stop this over-trolling about Frozen with 10/10 rates from virtual IMDb accounts.This movie isn't the future of Disney animated movie, at least if Ari Folman's movie ""The Congress"" wasn't a real future prediction coming from 2050's Hollywood.It's not a masterpiece, the plot is forced and rushed, the songs are awful, inconvenient and unbalanced, and worst for a ""music"": noisy. Even the boring sidekicks look interesting against stupid awkward princess which plays like a evil bad Disney's caricature, or a cabaret star ""Last return"".it's seems extremely efficient for $$$ payback, but it's a shame to exhibit the heart of occidental culture like a Grotesque's cheeky cabaret.In a good mood, I could give it 5.5/10, but for this excessive favoritism, it's less than 0/10 if could rate like thus.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Thoroughly entertaining if not overdone (****),"For nearly twenty years now, Pixar has dominated the animated scene by making far superior films than the competition, including their mouse-eared partner's in-house efforts. Now that Pixar creator John Lasseter appears to be in charge of Disney's animated projects, it is clear that a changing of the guard is taking place. Old is colliding with new at Disney, and the culmination of this event takes place with the stunning ""Frozen"", a beautiful, touching film with better than average musical numbers, and an unfortunately bland title. If this is where new Disney begins, amazing cinematic experiences lie before us.The symbolic merging of old and new begins before the film itself in the form of a new film short starring, of course, Mickey Mouse and friends. What appears at first to be an old ""Steamboat Willie"" cartoon quickly comes to life, going from black and white to color and three-dimensional characters. The short is clearly representative of what has made the company great in the past, and what is expected to come. As a bonus, children today may be familiar with these old characters due to the popularity of the newer ""Mickey Mouse Clubhouse"" show. Seeing them rendered in 3D isn't a shock to their system like it is for us; conversely, they may be shocked to see the 3D characters in black and white. This interesting amalgamation of technology and nostalgia not only gives us some laughs, but sets a specific tone for ""Frozen"".The film itself begins with a montage of melancholy. Young sisters (and princesses to boot) Anna and Elsa are playing in the palace, when younger Anna prods Elsa to 'use her powers'. It appears that Elsa can make and manipulate the cold from her fingertips, and in a freak accident, Elsa harms her sister to the point where Anna needs 'magical' treatment, and cannot remember the injury. These events lead to an understandable, if not shortsighted overreaction by the king and queen to isolate their 'dangerous' daughter until she can learn to 'control' her power.Unfortunately, they can't control turbulent seas, and they perish- leaving Elsa and Anna alone to mourn their parents and grow up separate from each other. The distance between them becomes exaggerated over time, until they barely know each other by the time Elsa becomes the queen. Perhaps the original story by Hans Christian Andersen tells us (I haven't read it), but there is no mention in the movie of a curse put on Elsa, or an evil witch, or some poisoned fruit she eats that causes her to have powers. It simply exists, meaning Elsa transfers all of the blame to herself. She's been isolated and riddled with so much guilt, self-doubt, and angst that you can't help but feel for her. Keeping that in mind, when her bubble bursts (and it does), it's frightening and gratifying all at once. She escapes the kingdom, retreating to the mountains to be alone. Her 'outburst' turns into one of the most magnificent animated spectacles you'll ever see; exquisitely beautiful, yet strikingly dangerous as it covers the kingdom in 'eternal winter' (it's called 'eternal', but how do we arrive at that conclusion? There is no explanation)Anna goes after her sister, meeting the rugged yet approachable Kristoff (an ice salesman) and his pal reindeer Sven along the way. Naturally, they join the search. These two have an interesting relationship as it pertains to animated films- Sven doesn't talk, but Kristoff holds a conversation with him nonetheless. As other critics have pointed out, a Disney movie of yore would've given Sven the ability to talk; shifting the way that it's presented gives the film a different, and dare I say better, dimension. Another character joins the fray on the way to confront Elsa- a snowman named Olaf (Josh Gad), who can talk. Olaf is a memorable character, in the same vein as Donkey from ""Shrek""- a silly yet endearing sidekick. The movie's biggest laughs come from him.The inevitable confrontation between Elsa, her sister, and the frightened citizens of the snow-covered kingdom resolves itself soon enough. The conclusion is satisfying, sure, but more important is the way in which it concludes. The heroines, one a queen and the other a princess, are allowed to persevere without first securing a 'Prince Charming', or tying their fates to the procurement of a love interest. I love that the filmmakers respect their audience, children and adults alike, enough to give their female leads a different solution. What results is far more powerful and satisfying.Again, we can see the changing of the guard clearly through the lenses of ""Frozen"". It's not a perfect film- in particular, I'd say some of the lyrics in the musical numbers are downright comical, and the title is particularly lame (why not just go with ""The Snow Queen""?). On the whole, however, ""Frozen"" strikes a near-perfect balance between emotion and comedy that brings traditional Disney storytelling into a new age. It's by far the best animated film of the year, and although it may not sit at the head table with other Disney heavy-hitters like ""The Lion King"", I think it's fair to say it's not far behind.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The Disney I Remember as a Child...,"I am a huge fan of children movies, I have watched Lion King close to 20 times, as well as Aladdin (only the original), and a few other classics.Toy story,bugs life were all awesome. But in this movie lies something different. A hilarious snowman, a loving pair of sisters, and a fabulous story.I loved this movie so much I really just can't wait to order the DVD and just watch it again and again and again.Humor, got it...Good morals, got it...Family love, got it. Something new? Most definitely!Great for kids and adults a like. Really impressed with Disney on this one. Great job!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Loved it!  Can't get the songs out of my head.  Can't wait to see it again!,"I loved most everything about this movie...and what I didn't love, was more than made up for by what I did.CGI: Stunning. Left me feeling awestruck with what they could do with Elsa's ice powers. The animators did such a wonderful job of balancing realism with the imaginative to create a near-perfect visually stunning movie.MUSIC and VOCALS: Loved how musical this movie was. Now, not every song was a grand slam for me, but there were more than enough to keep my mind occupied for hours. Let it Go, First Time in Forever (especially the reprise), Let it Go, Do You Wanna Build a Snowman, Let it Go, Love is an Open Door, Let it Go, Fixer-upper...loved all of these songs. Idina was as amazing as usual with her vocals. I had no idea that Kristen Bell had such a strong Broadway resume and such great chops. Thoroughly surprised and impressed.HUMOR: This was a bit of a mixed bag for me. Anna made me laugh A LOT in this movie, as did Christophe (sp?). The trolls and Olaf weren't my favorite comic-relief characters, but they weren't annoying. The humor in the songs was awesome ""finish each others' sandwiches""...too funny.CHARACTERS: I thought the characters were great. I loved what they did with the two princesses with one being the clumsy, down to earth, speaks before she thinks type person, and the other being more ""proper"", but absolutely fierce from a personality strength standpoint. I liked the male characters well enough...like others have mentioned, there's no Flynn Rider in this movie, but they aren't bad. It was really nice in this movie to see very strong female characters without some of the over-the-top feisty characters of prior Disney movies like Brave, Aladdin, etc. No defiance necessary in this one.STORY: Perfect. So different than just about any other Disney princess movie created. The romance was cute and warm, but the absolutely unconditional sisterly love was a real breath of fresh air. It was really touching. I liked the twists quite a bit, and they did catch me off guard.Disney MAGIC FACTOR: Very high. This movie elicits such a sense of wonder, fascination, warmth, humor...the list goes on. You leave the theater kind of walking on a cloud, not unlike leaving the Magic Kingdom.Loved this movie, and can't wait to see it again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Chappy Watched: Frozen,"It's a Disney movie so you can't really go wrong.Awesome animation with lots of detail - even down to the littlest of things, that you would expect to come from a Disney film, with a great voice cast and also a good and enjoyable story.There are some funny bits for both the kids and adults, also some jokes that the teenagers and adults will get.I've read a few things about the similarities between this and Tangled, there are some but not enough that I would be calling this the winter version of Tangled.Definitely worth a watch. Will be buying this on day of release!!!",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Disney's best film in a long time,"I feel proud to live at a time where I can see this in theaters. This must be similar to what it felt like to be in the golden age of Disney. I'm really struggling to find the words to convey how amazing this movie was, and how honestly depressing it was that my theater was nearly empty for the showing.I'm keeping the story summary brief and spoiler-free. Once upon a time, there were two sisters, Elsa and Anna, princesses of the kingdom of Arendelle. The elder sister, Elsa, was born with the ability create and control ice and snow. She was forced to hide this power due to an unfortunate accident, and, as a result, when her powers came out during her coronation, they were too powerful for her to control, and resulted in the kingdom being locked in a blizzard during summer. She runs away, and her sister, Anna, goes out to bring her back. And that's all I'm saying.The first ten minutes had me crying and then near the end I dropped my soda. I can count on my fingers how many recent films have made me cry, I can count on one finger how many films have made me drop a soda. Nearly everything about this film was jaw-droppingly amazing. The animation, especially a section where Elsa shows the full extent of her ice powers is absolutely stunning. The film is a Disney musical, so it has a lot of songs. There were only two real misfires out of the entire soundtrack, and nearly all of the rest were great. And yes, even the Disney Princess of a main character, Anna, seemed like a real person, and is far better than any Disney Princess I can think of. And Elsa is as close to perfect as I can imagine, she's animated beautifully and acts realistically. Well, as realistically as a Disney Princess with Ice Magic powers. The other characters are also nearly all great, and even the comic relief snowman (who the trailers are focusing on way too much)has some surprising moments.No film is without its flaws, but some films are good enough that you can suspend your disbelief for them. No, they don't explain why Elsa has the ice powers, other than that she was born with them. Yes, she can use them like a pro after suppressing them for most of her life. Yes, there are several moments when everyone should have died. Thing is, the rest of the film is so great you don't focus on that. I can't think of a better film to take the family to this Holiday season, so get out and see this future Disney Classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The one word Disney titled films continue to be hits,"After the recent successes of Tangled and Wreck It Ralph various members of both creative teams combine to create this latest Disney animated film and thankfully it manages to keep up the roll that the studio seem to be on.Frozen is similar in look to Tangled and combines all the stunning visuals and strong characterisation that made that film so strong. People expecting a straight adaptation of The Snow Queen will be left disappointed as apart from a few character names Disney re-invent the story for a whole new generation. The character of Olaf also continues the long tradition of scene stealing sidekicks.Although the plot is a little complicated at times there are enough twists to keep you entertained and the songs are memorable enough to have you humming them as you leave the cinema.Overall, not classic Disney but good enough to continue their good run of form.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Really good Disney film.,Frozen was definitely a cute and well made movie. The voice animations were fantastic and Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel did an incredible job as Anna and Elsa. I thought some of the spontaneous outbursts of song were a bit forced and took away from the moments a bit and I thought they could've made some of the emotional elements a bit deeper. That last part is what tends to separate Pixar from the rest of the bunch but Frozen still mostly delivered. I thought it was a bit over-hyped because I don't think it's the greatest animated film ever but it's still a great film and definitely the best of the past year or two and I definitely suggest checking it out.,8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"FROZEN (Chris Buck & Jennifer Lee, 2013) ***","Given the mass of animated features of late, it becomes hard to discern which stable any given title derives from; given the Walt Disney Studios' monopoly of the market for so many decades, their efforts remain among the more popular but not necessarily the best with respect to both box-office performance or, for that matter, when accolades are doled out. So, when the film under review copped 2 Oscars (Best Animated Feature and Original Song ""Let It Go"") at last Sunday's ceremony, I thought of checking it out now rather than wait for the Christmas season – for which period I usually leave such family-oriented fare!In retrospect and, to my surprise, the end result was generally very satisfactory – evoking favourable memories of some of the brand name's better efforts of the last 25 years! The narrative is inspired by a Hans Christian Andersen fairy-tale (of which I also own but have yet to watch a 1966 live-action Russian version). The icy setting is appropriately elaborate and nicely detailed, while characterization is reasonably appealing – at least where the two female protagonists are concerned, and especially with respect to their unusually tense relationship, as well as the obligatory comic-relief sidekick (represented by a garrulous snowman called Olaf who has a carrot for a nose, is constantly getting dismembered and, at one point, even deadpans about having been impaled on a jutting piece of ice!). On the heroic side of things, we have a stocky woodcutter and his sympathetic reindeer but, oddly enough, the orphaned princesses are shown growing up sans guardians!Conversely, the rogues' gallery – involving an elderly foreign tradesman and a young, deceptively handsome but opportunistic visiting prince – seems decidedly weak in comparison; similarly, the would-be sinister elements – a group of wise and friendly trolls on one hand and a giant snow creature (whom we thought had been disposed of but reappears for the, by now inevitable, post-credits sequence!) on the other – somehow feel like an afterthought! The climax, too, is sort of underwhelming because the sense of awe expected, after considerable build-up (and the film clocks in at a hefty 102 minutes), is rather lacking!; still, the songs – which are definitely not what I look forward to the most in efforts of this type – prove surprisingly tolerable on this occasion...which brings us back to ""Let It Go"", whose live performance during Oscar night was not only introduced by John Travolta apparently struggling with a bad hair day, but he also went on to spectacularly mispronounce singer Idina Menzel's name (incidentally, the star quality typically found among the engaged voice artists is conspicuous in its absence here) as Adele Dazeem while obliged to wax about her ""wicked"" talents!",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
One of the most overrated animation in 2013,"I have no idea why most people really love this movie. 'Frozen' is a typical Disney's princess animation movie that having almost the same formula from others. It actually has a quite convincing premise, how the two princesses were separated because the other one has an icy power. The middle of this movie is undeniably interesting, they got me curious what would happen at the end of it. Unfortunately the ending is not what I expected, it's lame and seems to be forced in such big conflicts. The conclusion is just too ordinary for Disney studio. Overall, 'Frozen' is still above average of other disappointed animation in 2013. It's an entertaining movie to see with family especially for kids. But still far away from Disney's classic like 'Lion King', 'Beauty and the Beast' or even 'Tangled'.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Mess of a story, doesn't live up to the hype","Last Disney animated movie I have watched was already a long time ago. But always had good memories of Disney magical and musical worlds that they created.There was so much hype around Frozen and with the fact that they won 2 oscars with this, I finally put myself to watch it.Oh how I regretted my decision. The precious memory I had of Disney's magic was totally gone in an instant. Has Disney quality story telling really come down to this? Disappointed. Really don't know what the hype was about. It was a mess of a story with too many potholes. The Kingdom is portrayed as static as your typical Disney theme park. It had no soul, no atmosphere.The narrative of the story was rushed, you don't get any background explanation why Elsa was born with her powers and why others did not. The trolls saved Ana once, why couldn't they do it again, yes they said it was her heart this time not her head, which is a lame excuse, but okay. Besides, they misled her that she needed a true love kiss, which spun the story into confusion. If an adult finds it confusing, imagine how kids feel watching this?Talking about kids, the message of the story is not a good one for the kids. Ana was getting head over heels with the first man she meets (Hans), and then loving another man she meets even shorter of a time span than the first one. Crazy thing is she didn't knew she loved Christoph until her life needed to be saved. But turn out she doesn't need a mans true love to save her life in the first place. That was some crazy stuff happening right there, and it will send a wrong message to kids that fooling around with love is apparently okay according in this Disney movie....as if Disney says doesnt matter who you fool around with, as long as you find true love...Apart from the catchy song ""Let it go"" the queen Elsa really was not a memorable character. She was not coherent in her ways, indecisive and at times borderline evil and mental. Not a likable character. She was able to control her powers for all these years, and suddenly losing control over it doesn't make sense. Why doesn't Elsa push forward Ana to be queen, if Elsa was so afraid of letting people know her secret powers?And then the not so convincing silly plot twist where Prince Hans turn out to be this scheming evil person. Where it yet again send kids into confusing why this Prince charming seemingly turn into a bad person overnight. That is some lazy screenplay writing right there. Mess of a story, enough said. One star given for the effort, that's it.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"The complete package, topped off with bags of charm","Version I saw: UK cinema screening (2D)Actors: 7/10Plot/script: 9/10Photography/visual style: 9/10Music/score: 9/10Overall: 8/10Everyone I know who has been to see Disney's 'Frozen' came out raving about it, and rightly so. It blends classic old Disney, sassy new Disney, a clever subtext that delivers an important message, two strong female leads, stunning visuals, great songs and avalanches of charm.Inspired more by the style and context of Hans Christian Andersen's work than his particular story 'The Snow Queen', the stated inspiration for the film, Frozen follows Anna and Elsa, princesses in medievalish Arandelle. Elsa becomes a shut-in to hide her ice-controlling powers, then flees when she is unable to keep them concealed. The feisty Anna chases after her.It is hard to overstate how much love I have for Frozen. I love the two main characters. I love the authentic relationship between the sisters. I love the supporting cast, the clever script, the attention to detail throughout the design of environments. Somewhat to my surprise, I love the songs. I love the story, and the message.As with any story in which someone is rejected and cast out for being 'different', the plot of Frozen can be viewed as a metaphor for homosexuality. Like all the best allegories of this kind, the story does not depend on it at all. You can perfectly well view and enjoy Frozen as being purely about magical powers in a medievalish setting... but as a metaphor, it has several details that I find extremely commendable and refreshing, and it's very modern, very worthwhile, and presented with perfectly balanced subtlety: not too intrusive to interfere with the story, yet obvious enough to get through to the watching kids, for whom this lesson will be a very valuable one.It's the complete film experience: fulfilling, heart-warming, worthy, thought-provoking, visually stunning, intelligent and clever and visceral. Just go watch it, if you haven't already, and prepare to be delighted.For my full review, see my independent film blog on Blogspot, Cinema Inferno: http://cinemainferno-blog.blogspot.co.uk/2014/02/frozen-2013.html",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A Classic Disney Movie That Will Be Treasured,"If I had to give Frozen one word it would be enchanting. The characters, the layout, the plot, it was all so amazing and never disappointing.

This is a great movie to see to get into a family spirit, which is perfect for the holiday season. Like all Disney classics it doesn't disappoint with humor and love. The music was amazing, catchy and simply beautiful. Sometimes the music does not go well with the movie or the plot. That was not the case with Frozen.

A few laugh out loud moments, for sure and ideal for younger kids especially , after all doesn't every kid wish she could bring a snowman to life?

Happy Anniversary & Happy New Year!,"I certainly DON'T think this movie is overrated (or perhaps people know something I don't know), but whoever is making those accusations, WHAT exactly are they comparing it to?? For people saying this movie or the song ""Let It Go"" is overrated, what exactly are they comparing it to?? Almost 99% of the mainstream movies and music out there are immoral unethical garbage in this culture just to make a fast buck without anything meaningful in the plots or lyrics.This film is especially SO FAMOUS in Japan where I was born and raised and in fact still live, and I'm really looking forward to how children of this generation are going to turn into GREAT people in the near future, because of the impact of this magical flick. (Though I'm a little confused as to why ""Wreck-It Ralph"" isn't as popular since SO many people from Japan love to play video games). ;) This film can teach children (especially girls) and also adults to let go of the past, to become self-reliant, and real love. This is something worthwhile children can learn from and help to create a potentially better future.BUT... if there is a downside to it, I maybe got a little confused to the hype of this film; I saw it, and wondered a bit if I saw the same movie everyone else did, 'cause the story looked really SIMPLE; someone leaves, others go off to get them, and they all come back. The end. It MAY seem that way, but they do make up for it with all the great songs, the amazing soundtrack, colorful & memorable characters, funny humorous and feel-good moments, breathtaking landscapes, lovely & realistic animation, the unexpected plot twists, and the overall valuable important messages it teaches.Look at what young people have to grow up with these days: constant violence and sexual immorality on TV and music and Internet, government corruption, global environment disasters and wars, etc. At least children have something good to learn how to act in such a stressful future they will one day have to take control of.As for the haters commenting (usually on YouTube but probably here in comments later on as more ppl read this), they are unthinkable bi-products of our mostly violent media culture.Believe it or not, I'm a GUY who likes this film, even if the two main characters are female. I LOVE the music too - I could listen to it over & over. (But hey, if ""Frozen"" is a film that girls can relate to, then ""Big Hero 6"" is a film definitely boys can relate to.)And what else? Positive emotions are contagious. In other words, when people are happy it spreads to other people much faster and farther than negative emotions which have a weaker effect on others; LOVE really is the biggest power there is (besides the love of God.) So as advice to children, take the advice of this famous movie and its famous song! Let go of the past, avoid evil people who only want to drag others down, focus on being with friendly people and live your life to the fullest. You deserve it. If you have a bad day, increase your positive energy even more.AND also... an immoral unhappy society usually degenerates into a paranoid police state. A society that promotes real love, forgiveness, respect, and friendliness have better chances of keeping a freer society. And the positive values mentioned above are what everyone is being taught through the message of the entire movie, especially at the end.Plus, the singer, Idina Menzel, who voiced Elsa & sung ""Let It Go"", and the the guy who voiced Olaf are Jewish! I've a got a real soft spot for Jewish people, and I think it's all the more reason to like this film. And I'm glad Disney won the Oscar it SHOULD have for ""Wreck-It Ralph"", rather than the disappointing ""Brave"" bomb.I do also think this flick is rather ""Christ-like"" in it's message; whether it be ""Some people are worth melting for"", or Anna ""sacrifices"" herself to save her sister.PS: Oh, and if you're wondering why I say ""children"", and not ""kids"", kids are offspring of goats - and Satanism has the head of a goat.

Wonderful,"We had to pay more to see a later showing but it was worth the $35.

I thought it was merely okay,"The story was not super-compelling for me. There just wasn't enough on-screen time to really develop the relationship between the two sisters. I realize screen-time and Arendelle-time are different, just it didn't come through for me. It didn't make me cry. It was a cute enough story, and that's all I can say about it.It was insufficiently racially diverse. Out of all those people in the crowd scenes, they could have made some of them people of color. I mean, it's a fantasy land with magical snow and talking snowmen! Surely, compared to a talking snowman, having some people of color wouldn't be the end of the world??Calling it ""Frozen"" was a pretty bad decision. By giving it a juvenile, humorous title, they've taken away the mysterious, magical, serious feel of a fairy tale. And it does have funny moments, but at its core it's intended to be a heartwarming and emotional story, not a slapstick. Disney needs to quit making titles worse.On that note --- it wasn't The Snow Queen. I'm still waiting for a Snow Queen movie. The Snow Queen is charming in a very different way, a story not about princesses, but about an ordinary girl. Gerda is like Frodo: she loves her quiet life but goes out anyways to rescue her friend. Along the way she matures and grows. I want to see the sorceress with the enchanted garden, and the robber girl, and the passing princess, and the old women who talk about Gerda's inner strength. I want to see the ending that isn't flashy romantic happily ever after, but rather a relief muted by the passage of time.The scenery was very beautiful. Let It Go was a lovely and memorable song.

Most over rated Disney film in decades,"Just watched this on PPV, and wasted $6. Among all the recent animation films I have seen, such as Ice Age and similar, this was one of the worst.It was totally formula, and not even a very good formula. I have seen Anime where the plot made more sense. Nothing is explained about WHY any of the characters would do various things - like why did those ""loving parents"" just lock the sister up in a room instead of .. you know, maybe trying to cure it or find out WHY??The dialogue was stilted and the plot totally predictable, but the songs were 3rd rate at best - reminiscent of really bad musicals from the 50's. The basic plot made no sense, none of the characters did anything that real and/or normal people would do (even in a fairy tale). The overall plot resembled a Korean makjang rom-com more than a Disney movie. The plot had so many holes in that it resembled Swiss cheese.There have been a lot of good animated films out in the past few years, but this is not one of them. The only reason I can see for the initial very high ratings is that they were given by die hard Disney fans, who would be far more inclined to see the movie in theaters as soon as it came out.",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"An OK movie, nothing special. An Over-hyped Movie.",There is nothing about Frozen that makes it a terrible movie but nothing that makes it an amazing movie either. Maybe that's just because i'm an adult male. The plot is okay but nothing special. The characters are likable. Olaf a talking snowman is used for comic-relief and does a decent job. There is plenty of music to go around. The songs are catchy but most of them with the exception of let it go and do you want to build a snowman are forgettable at the most unless you have watched the movies multiple times. Kids like this movie which is probably why Frozen has had such a cultural impact. A movie which kids will love and adults will consider satisfactory.,7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

It is no Lion King however. No movie will ever come close. No much to complain about. Great characters and screenplay. One problem I had was the running length. 1 hr. and 43 min. was wayyyy to short for this movie. Had it been along the lines of 2-2 1/2 than it would've been much better.

If you don't like musicals do not see this!,"I don't usually feel the need to write reviews on any films that I watch but this one evoked such frustration from me I felt compelled to put my opinion into the mix of reviews on IMDb.I, like most peopleprobably saw this film advertised in a trailer whilst watching another. As far as I remember the trailer showed nothing of this film being a musical. Now I'm one of those people who just cannot stand musicals. If you are reading this and that includes you too I urge you not to waste a penny on seeing this film. Not only is it practically back to back singing the actually storyline is just recycled Disney garbage. The heroin, the quirky character and the obligatory serious character. It's a rehashed and poorly made Shrek and not a patch on any of the Disney Pixar films like Toy Story. The adult humour you usually find in animated films these days which always appeals to me is virtually none existent and is in my mind plain and simply aimed at young children and/or musical lovers.Now I'm aware of all the critic reviews by all the big papers and magazines. A couple of snippets I saw plastered across the cover art about this being ""Disney back at its finest"" and ""The best film this year"". Who are these people that right such utter rubbish I ask myself. Were they watching the same film as me!? There is no way this is Disney at its finest and unless it's the only film I've seen in a year it most certainly isn't the best.If it wasn't for the fact I felt so utterly robbed by going to watch this film I probably wouldn't of written a review but as movies get more and more expensive to watch at the cinema with their high FPS footage, 3D viewing and D-Box force feedback seating I felt it needed mentioning to help the unwary avoid the same mistake.In conclusion, if you are unsure about this then simply wait till it's out on TV or borrow it from a friend. Then realise you'll never get those couple of hours back in your life that you've just wasted watching it.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
just amazing,"Disney has pulled a corker out the bag Best film ever to come from Disney since it began the story lines great and the songs are amazing if haven't watch this yet watch it i would strongly recommend this to anyone with a family or even if your grown There are no stupid pointless scenes or stupid songs , i would happily debate against someone who thinks this films pointless or doesn't like the songs . Now usually people only ever read the rough , negative comments about films but in my belief and a lot of other members belief that those comments are wrong this film beats the little mermaid , Tarzan , beauty and the beast and most of all the lion king.

Frozen,"What was undoubtedly supposed to be the modern Disney classic in the likes of The Lion King, unfortunately, falls somewhat flat. Frozen is of course in many ways a very typical Disney film. Sadly, it never manages to capture the magic that films like The Lion King do. Although it is filled with wonder, as it should be, something about it just doesn't feel right.What surprised me the most, after 7 years since last seeing this, was how much I enjoyed the songs. Although Let It Go became the mega-hit we now know it as, I actually enjoyed the other songs more. They felt very Disney-like and set a wonderful tone from the get-go.Unfortunately, that's where the magic ends. There is really nothing special about anything in Frozen. As expected, the story is very predictable. But that didn't bother me. What bothered me, was that the great Disney films of that past don't suffer from a predictable story. They still manage to create such a wonderful and special experience that you could care less that you know exactly what's going to happen next. Frozen never manages to do that.Another annoyance, be it a relatively small one in the grand scheme of things, is the seemingly compulsory sidekick. What is it about these newer animations that apparently require an annoying side-kick? It is just to sell more merchandise or am I supposed to believe that kids actually like these characters so much that there needs to be one in every animated film. Olaf, the sidekick in Frozen, is just another one to add to the pile of them. I suppose that their purpose is to bring some comedic relief, and perhaps kids do find them funny. But watching these films as an adult, I can't help but be annoyed by them. Especially when they are completely useless. Olaf brings absolutely nothing to this film, and every scene he is in would've worked just as well without him.Enough with me ranting about this film. Because ultimately, Frozen is a decent Disney film. It's nowhere near as good as the Disney films from my childhood, but maybe that's just nostalgia talking. And as far as I've understood, most kids absolutely loved this one. And at the end of the day, that's what matters. These films are aimed at kids, and if adults can enjoy them too, that's just a bonus. I certainly enjoyed this film despite all its flaws. I suppose I was just expecting to feel some of that Disney magic of the past, and sadly I never did.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Magic!,"While Pixar's animated movies are becoming more of a chore to watch, Disney has been making some good stuffs, be it the lovely Tangled or brilliant Wreck It-Ralph. With Frozen, they have surpassed their recent works. Frozen is a story of two sisters, one of whom happens to be in the possession of magical power. As they grow up and it becomes more difficult for the elder sister to control her powers, their relationship drifts apart, that once had been affectionate and loving. Disney has always been known for strong female leads in their stories. And Frozen is primarily a female driven story where the males are but in supporting roles. And its allegories to female empowerment and their vital roles in the society are touched with subtlety. In fact, one may very well reason that it is not about female empowerment at all. It is about sibling love and the burden of genius that is not to be feared, but embraced. But I beg to think differently. For me, Frozen is about how the society entraps the inherent power of the women by making them fear their own potentials. But then let us not talk about the message of the movie. Let each one interpret his own. Coming to the less subjective parts of the movie, Frozen has some of the best music that a musical has to offer. The songs are great. They are funny, witty and touching all at the same time. The one that plays in the beginning is quite reminiscent of The Lion King's powerful and intense Circle of Life. Secondly, the dialogues are a lot of fun. The animation is, as usual, colourful where ever it can be! Disney may be following the same old age formula of kings and queens, princes and princesses, magic and love, but it still manages to bring a freshness to its proceedings. Frozen may be inherently ancient in its setting, but in its tone it is very contemporary. This modernity is set up in its exchange of dialogues between the characters that manages to pick up the vibes and attitudes of our young generation. Actually, for once I thought they were going to do a Twilight here (I mean it in the good sense, not like the crap that the Twilight movie was), but they didn't. After all, it is essentially a kiddie flick and they need to keep things simple. Alas! The screenplay is fluid, moving at a comfortable pace with lots of fun, adventure and wit except for one place where I thought a revelation was bit jarring as it didn't seem to fit with what happened earlier. Frozen, a testimony to Disney's adaptability without sacrificing the soul, is your typical Disney musical fare, but let that not make you judge it poorly, as it contains enough of fun and innovation to keep you thoroughly entertained and the story relevant. This sibling love story is going to remain 'frozen' in your hearts for a long time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Frozen a typical Disney,"Just when we thought Disney had lost its classic themed cartoons with beautiful rhythmic yet meaningful songs this movie landed. As I started to watch it and as soon as the first song came i was back in the time of those old Disney classics. This movie has the very same feel and a very beautiful story with a very mature twist, adults will learn from it a very deep meaning presented in a very simple way, that's typical Disney.About animation i would say it was awesome very well researched the rhythm of the snow the castles(pretty much like the Disney castle) lightning was amazing, Characters looked mature and yet had a soft feel, once again both for adults and kids(very well put). Sound effects would surely give a feel of soft snow and i believe somewhere you will shiver if you are totally immersed in the movie.There were a few scenes which i didn't like and i thought were too fast and needed details a few more added minutes would be nice to put a bit more feel to those scenes. And the dressing of one particular character and the way she walked i felt it was little seductive, or may be its just me perhaps others would not mind it.Overall a very nice simple and beautiful story(although a little bit in haste) must watch with the whole family and be ready for the one epic scene with a epic twist.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Let it Go!,"Since the release of Tangled Disney Animation Studios have been having a mini-revival under John Lassister and Frozen sees Disney goes for a full return to fall musical princess story.In the kingdom of Arendelle Princess Elsa (Idina Menzel) is born with the ability to create ice and snow. But when her powers cause her younger sister, Anna (Kristen Bell) to have an accident and have her memory erased. After that her parents shut Elsa away and try to teach her to use her powers. When the king and queen die at sea Elsa has to become the queen and ends up loosing control of her powers at her ball in her honour when Anna announces she is engaged to Prince Hans (Santino Fontana). Anna sets out to find Elsa convince her to winter.The heart of the relationship and interactions between the sisters. Menzel and Bell were excellent together, they had the best songs, strong chemistry and their singing voices complicate each other, Menzel's powerful voice, to Bell's more higher pitched voice. Their songs particularly felt like Disney had their eye on a stage show, with one little line where Anna says Arendelle is in deep, deep, deep snow had a stage quality to it.Menzel is best known for her lead role in Wicked and Elsa does share some similarities. Both characters are isolated who are struggling to control their powers. Even the songs Let it Go and No Good Deeds have a similar tone and style.Olaf the Snowman played by Josh Gad was heavily promoted in the trailers and he seemed like he was going to be an annoying creation. He turned out to be a charming little character who did offer most of the jokes and humour for the film and does at least have a kind heart and meaning to princesses. The other areas of humour came from Anna being crummy and her interactions with Kristoff (Jonathan Groff).As you would expect from a Disney Animated film the animation is of a top level, with excellent character designs, the scenery and art direction and camera angles, movements and placement. There are some solid action sequences to also liven events up.Frozen starts at a brisk place, having an introductory song and there are five songs in the first five thirty minutes. The songs slow down after 'Let it Go', but I personally would have like more songs, particularly from Menzel and a little more from Bell. They two worked so well together and Menzel only sings in three songs. I would have preferred it if the film was a bit more like the Les Miserables film where there was constantly singing or at they be more songs during the running time.As a musical Frozen is strong, but at a plot it a typical Disney film and the plot points can seen coming from a mile off, especially in the final act.Frozen is an enjoyable film that fans of Disney animated films will enjoy and shows there is plenty of life in the Disney Princess genre and animated musicals.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Great Family Movie Focusing More on Girls,"Overall, I thought that Frozen was one of the best Disney animated films to be made in recent years, purely because of the quality of the songs and the storyline. To me, it's not the best (not like The Lion King or the classics that I grew up with), but Frozen will be a great addition to the new generation's list of classics.Although a great family movie, I had mixed feelings about it because it was highly focused on girls. It's not as suitable for a more robust and wide range of viewers, but for girls, this movie would be great entertainment and fun.The characters were great, the story was good (albeit predictable), and a couple of the songs were memorable. To me, that makes a good Disney movie and deserves a 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Graphic Beauty Boring Melody,"An Oscar winner, great reviews and ratings. Does it justify its Cinematic excellence. Over all a very boring movie. Over loaded with unnecessary songs. The movie is simply not for the masses, perhaps only for toddlers. Nothing too dramatic, a simple story with meaningless songs. Its more cramped up with songs than a musical. Although earlier Disney movies with songs have been par above the norm. Music is pathetically sequenced and dis-jointed lyrics soothes you to sleep. The only saving grace for the movie is its graphics and well thought out use of animations. Story telling technique is bad. It's at the most just an ordinary Disney movie. The media hype and bagging the Oscar has just added to its brand value. It's not even worth another watch. Maybe in years to come some will realize what a waste of time it has been. Overall worth a watch but be prepared to be overdosed with silly songs and music.",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A classic Disney Fairytale,If you accept it for what it is (an animated fairy tale musical) it's actually pretty good. Disney Animation Studios who struggled with computer animation in their first films has finally matched Pixar in animation quality: the snow/ice environments are gorgeously rendered and the character animation is just excellent. Disney drew inspiration from Austrian/Scandinavian countries for the look of Arendell. The story is loosely based on Hans Christian Andersen's 'The Snow Queen'. There's also a good mix of comedy and drama with a great voice cast. Turns out Kristen Bell is not only beautiful but also has a great singing voice. I'm fairly certain the 'best original song' Oscar will go to Frozen. Though it might not be for everyone it will certainly appeal to people who loved Disney's previous classics and for Disney it was a return to a winning formula as Frozen almost made 1 billion bucks at the box office.,8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Geeky Randy's summary,"Scenic blockbuster about a free-spirited and optimistic princess who teams up an iceman and his loyal reindeer to track down the princess's older sister (the newly appointed queen) who lammed their kingdom after her cryokinetic powers of freezing anything at will was shamefully exposed. Don't forget the loving trolls and the hilarious snowman Olaf in tow. Takes a good 10–20 minutes to actually grab you, and is less for the boys than it is the girl. Musical numbers, while catchy and well-written, occur too frequently a few which do very little to help drive the plot. Another big-budget with all razzle-dazzle and little heart; however, this outing is worth the wasted time and money in comparison to others that fit the same criticism.

Very Good Disney Musical Animation,"I'd have to call this feature more of a musical than anything else, as every scene has a song or two--and all are very well done.The real question for me was, ""Did my 8 yr. old daughter like it?"" This is, after all, a movie for kids of all ages, but basically a movie for kids. Anyway, she loved it--more than ""The Guardians"" (which she really loved) and a couple of other titles that are her favorites. Her favorite part was the music itself, although she loved the story, too.This isn't a tough movie for adults to sit through, as it is very entertaining. And, a nice surprise comes at the end when you think you already know how it will all end up. It doesn't, as there's a slight twist, but of course its a happy ending.Great Holiday movie for young and old alike.

An excellent introduction to the movies,"""Frozen"" will always have a special place in my heart because it was the first film seen by my granddaughter Catrin (one month short of her third birthday). We saw it with her little friend James (just three months older) who was also making his first visit to the cinema. Both sat through all 102 minutes totally transfixed and then at the end cried because they did not want it to finish.This offering from Walt Disney Animation Studios tells the tale of two royal sisters from the kingdom of Arendelle: Queen Elsa who has a power to freeze things that grows uncontrollably, leading her to flee the kingdom, and Princess Anna who is determined to find her sister, while coping with two very different suitors, a crazy reindeer and a talking snowman. The visuals are magical even in 2D (we judged that the 3D version would be sensory overload for a first movie on the big screen) and there are plenty of songs and humour plus a ice monster that had the kids jumping.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Far from a Disney classic,"I've rated this film 5 out of 10 for the following reasons:1) The narrative is disjointed.2) The music is forgettable. Some of the lyrics are distractingly inept.3) The classic ""good versus evil"" theme of Disney films is badly handled. Prince Hans' transition from good to evil is thoroughly unconvincing. Queen Elsa's hovering between love of power and love of others is similarly so.4) The sidekicks — specifically the snowman and the reindeer — who, as usual, are intended to provide moments of humour and to point up what is good are one-dimensional, with the snowman in particular being irritating.5) The animation is no more than so-so in quality. It's time animators stopped relying on the kind of facial distortions found in Japanese comics, e.g. oversize eyes, unfeasibly round cheeks and turned up noses. These have become clichés.I understand some backwards Americans have criticised the film for promoting homosexuality. This is arrant nonsense. It is merely a pale shadow of the glorious Disney films of yesteryear.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A First Rate Disney Product For The Youngest Audiences,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Frozen"" (2013) is a one amazingly looking good feel animated movie for a youngest members of a family. Adults surely won't like it as much as ""Shrek"" or etc. because this is a more friendly and cheezee movie oriented for the youngest audiences. Yes, it is cheezee as hell if you ask me, with especially some songs scenes looking more like an Eurovision song contest then actual movie, and with some songs (which become very popular) to which if i would need to ever listen to one more time again... don't ask.Overall, ""Frozen"" is a beautifully looking, sometimes a bit (but just a bit funny) animated movie targeted especially for the youngest. It is a good nature movie, and its pacing is the best thing for more adults - at running time 1 h 35 min it almost never dragged. It is a good movie to see it once, but it isn't as original or exciting as i kinda hoped it would be.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A Song of Ice and Snow,"By now, if you aren't a three-year-old – in which case I would be puzzled to see you reading this –, you know what to bargain for when watching a Disney production: ravishing animations, a feel good story teaching morals, more or less fun for the whole family, but also a rather unoriginal script abounding with clichés.Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee's Frozen preserves the modus operandi, but is one of the most exciting and entertaining features the film studio has forged in recent years nevertheless. This also applies for the music incorporated in the 102-minute-long retelling of Hans Christian Andersen's The Snow Queen, led by the lovely ""Do You Want to Build a Snowman?"", the comical ""In Summer"", and, of course, the film's powerful flagship ""Let It Go"", yet getting slightly hoary and tedious during other numbers. For a one- time view, the breathers in quality, such as a ridiculous stone troll family, a strained twist in the final act, or the cloying 'act of true love' stepping in as a deus ex machina, are pardonable due to an excellent voice cast and plenty genuine laughs for the young and the old. However, Frozen will hardly go down as a Disney classic in view of all these flaws.If you seek a good family film, the men and women at Disney are who you can bet on to deliver and with Frozen, they've found the right mixture of fun, romance, and peril yet again. But that also makes it an archetypal Disney animation – yet again.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Good to Watch with Family,"It was indeed a pleasure watching Frozen with all the hype which was around this movie. It is an excellent promoter of love between siblings and is highly recommended for all parents having kids.An interesting thing about this movie is the versatile and funny character of one sister while the other even though being similar sacrificing her emotions for the sake of her little sister.The dialogues in the entire movie are pretty clear and understandable even for the children below 5.All songs are beautifully composed and have catching tone. Especially for girls, the dresses worn by both characters are awesome.The cinematography is pretty good, however the male lead could have been given more time on screen and dialogues.The story plot is however the only slightly predictable one but it is expected for movies having a moral ending.On the whole, a highly recommended movie especially for parents having two or more children (or planning the same).",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"If you love Diney animated movies, you will love Frozen","I love Disney animated movies. My favorite being Beauty and the Beast. And when I saw the line in the Frozen trailer calling it the best movie since The Lion King, I was skeptical. And adding the fact it was starting to look a whole lot like Tangled, I was worried this movie wasn't going to be good. Now, I don't know about it being the best since The Lion King, but I really enjoyed and loved this movie.The movie is loosely based on Hans Christian Anderson story, ""The Snow Queen"". I never read it, so I can't compare the two, but I just thought I mention it. So, moving on from that. The plot was good. The first half was pretty standard. Exactly what you would expect from a Disney movie. The second half was what really made the movie. The plot twist I never saw coming. Especially, from a Disney movie. There was only two things I didn't really like about the plot. One being the ending felt rushed. And the second was that there was a few things that felt like they were just tossed into the movie. Some worked. Some didn't.The Music was great. It had a very Broadway feel to it. Do You Want to Build a Snowman? in the beginning gave you the back story of the main characters, Elsa and Anna, in a quick ad fun manner. Let It Go was by far the best and most memorable song in the movie. And there wasn't a song in the movie that didn't serve a purpose.And now to the characters. Frozen is about two princesses, Elsa and Anna. Elsa, the older of the two, is pretty much what you would think a princess would be. Minus the icy powers of course. Add in that secret and you get a great complicated character that I would've liked to dig deeper into. Anna, on the other hand, is more spunky, stubborn, and hot headed. I liked her a lot, also, just not as much as her sister. As for male characters, there's the Prince Has and the ice salesman, Kristoff. They were characters that fit what they were and they were fine. And they got better as the movie went on. Other characters were the reindeer, Sven, and the snowman who wants to live in summer, Olaf. They were more comedy relief than anything.Overall, I loved it. It was fun, enjoyable, and heartwarming. It even made me laugh at times. It wasn't perfect but what is? And plus, it fits the time of year. So what do I say? I say go and see this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Frozen ears.,"Well, for an uninitiated person like me, getting to understand Frozen was pretty difficult, also not having watched Tangled. But since I at least heard about all the infamous Disney Princesses, I suppose this is the ""CGI in the morning"" remix of something. So, obviously things like cuteness, certain craziness and cliché are granted, expected and even appreciated by fans. So while it can break another movie, I guess a Disney Princess movie can be cut some slack.What could be said about actual pros and cons? Well, the movie has surprisingly nonlinear plot. I expected dumber. I am glad that I was disappointed. It also has reason and morale, which I acknowledge way above other things. But I suppose morale is a feature of Disney, at least based on what I remember from childhood. And, with all due disrespect to unnatural cuteness - animation is really brilliant. Modern eye-candy in good sense.One thing, however, that I found totally unbearable and sick - is the singing. I remember the magnitude of singing from Lion King, the quality of Rio, the songlist of Madagascar. Now those are films that you can just listen to over and over and over. But this... I at least am glad there are those who also notice it, but I am nonetheless shocked that some acclaim it as ""standard"" for Disney. This isn't singing, this is... ""barely trying"". Maybe it's also a feature that has to be cut slack for a Disney Princess movie(note that only Princess movie, not just any Disney), but in comparison to other movies - it is a disgrace.And of course things like ""Loldead"" moment in the beginning, ""scalped"" and absolutely clichéd greedy old man, the donkey snowman... Such things just make you hiccup with awkwardness. It's not a big minus, but not contributing either.So it's a fairly good movie, positive and healthy(more or less), but it could've been better if Disney tried to be less...

Good Movie,"I did enjoy the movie, though I wasn't too excited about seeing it.Only watched it because I wanted to see what all the hype was about. Overall, I enjoyed it but it just felt like it was missing something. I don't know if it was because I thought the snowman should melt (not out of hate) or because the love story alone was just too predictable. There were so many things I felt that the movie could've done with the concept of the movie. It didn't really have me on the edge of my seat, and it's probably because I just have a deep hatred towards musicals. I understand it's a child film and such but it seemed like it was trying too hard to get to the heart of everyone, when they could've easily pulled that off in numerous ways. So, my overall review is it was a great movie, but it could've been tons better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Frozen Is Disney's Extravagant Celebration & Embracement Of Its Own Legacy,"Packed with singalong songs, eye-popping visuals & presenting a wonderful story of sisterhood, Frozen is another worthy animation out of Disney canon & presents this legendary animation studio doing what it does better than anyone else; a fairy-tale musical. The film tells the story of Anna, an optimistic, cheerful & lively princess who sets off on a journey along with a rugged mountain man, his reindeer pet & a wicked snowman to find & bring back her estranged sister, Elsa, whose magical powers, which she has never been able to control, have brought her entire kingdom under an eternal winter spell.Even though there are minor moments of silliness in the story where it felt like the film is trying too hard to be funny, the story & script still manage to deliver for the most part. It features a dynamic set of characters & relationships we can invest our emotions in, is brilliantly voiced by its cast, boasts a wonderful score accompanied by even more amazing songs and is enveloped with an astonishing beauty thanks to its dazzling visuals. Overall, Frozen is arguably the best animated film of the year, one of the best animated musicals to come out in a long time & marks a third consecutive year when Disney has outclassed Pixar. Definitely worth a watch.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Nice film, but overrated","When I first saw the trailer, I thought that Frozen was going to be one of the best films I have ever seen. I was really looking forward to watching it. There was a lot of hype before its release, so I was more and more interested in seeing it. When I went to the cinema, I was ready to watch a movie in which I could give 9 or 10 out of 10. But it did not meet me expectations. There are both positive and negative aspects of this film.On the one hand, the special effects were really good and the 3D was perfect. The characters were cute, especially Olaf, who made the film better and funnier. Another thing that should be mentioned is that the movie carries strong messages. Finally, the soundtrack and generally the music were original.On the other hand, the plot was not very appealing. Moreover, the times when the film was boring were not few. I was very disappointed because of the fact that I could predict what was about to happen. Finally, the villain was not really special, actually he/she was totally uninteresting.To sum up, Frozen is a cute and nice film, but it is overrated and overestimated. Personally, I believe that having won lots of awards is not really fair.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Adorabley Flawed,"This film had it's cute and oh-so funny moments but with such of a rave I was expecting it to be better. Don't get me wrong, I thought this film was good but I just felt that there wasn't enough to make the film stand out from all of the other Disney films.Pros: The soundtrack was beautifully crafted and very catchy. Idina Menzel's voice was just filled with spirit and emotion.I personally felt that characters like Olaf and the S'ven stole the show. I mean, who would have thought a little quirky snowman and a Reindeer could steal the spotlight! They were both so adorable and lovable.Cons:Although the graphics were AMAZING, I felt like there was still some detail missing. The graphics made the film looked realistic but I think the background/scenery could have been more vivacious and vibrant to make the scene appear fuller and less empty.The film was personally also very predictable. I'm not going to spoil any specific scenes but from the beginning I already had a feeling on how the movie was going to end.Conclusion: I enjoyed the experience of watching the film more than the film itself. The movie is great for all ages and genders and is also a great movie for families.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
An amazing Disney animation.,"OMG! When this film out, it was big. And I mean BIG. I have never seen a movie that popular before. The hit Frozen had between 2013-15 was just MEGA. I remember seeing clips of the film. I heard the songs an unhealthy amount of times, including Let It Go. So when i first watched the film as a ehole, I knew it waa goos, but I thought it was going to be like liom king in how overrated it was and that the film itself wasn't going to be food. But I was absolutely SHOCKED by how funny, action packed and heart warming rhe film was. I loved the characters, soundtrack and that amazong animation. It is defiantly Disney's best 3D animated film. The first and second times I watched the film, I gave it a 10/10 rating, but after watching it a 3rd time, it has sliped to 9/10 and that is due to the fact that I am a little tiresld of seeing. But the film is still amazing. It's just that the impact the film had on the world has kinda left me a bit tires of seeing it. But I still 100% recommned this film to children and adults alike. 😁👍🏾",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Your kids will love it,"This is not necessarily the best Disney movie I've seen. Actually all the best one are Pixar. But This was incredible fun, entertaining and well made. The Oscar winning song ""Let it go"" is almost as catchy at the Lego Movie Song ""Everything is awesome""almost If you know about ""The Ice Queen"" you kind of know what his is about. Two sisters are torn apart because one can create ice, but can't control her abilities. The other sister is kept hidden from her until they are adults when the family secret comes out, so to speak. So Ice Queen runs off in the scene where she sings ""Let it go"". The younger sister goes looking for her and falls in love in the process. I wasn't really impressed with the themes or morals, pretty standard. Your kids will love it. Be prepared to buy it on Blue Ray for them.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Don't drink the koolaid,"Many people have pointed out the flaws of this movie so I won't go over it again. Simply put, I fail to see how this movie comes even close to being ""the best Disney film of all time"". Best animation maybe, but that is it. A film is some where in the neighborhood of 80% story, 20% everything else. At least thats how it should be. Even low budget films with a good story are far better than this. My main concerns were glaring inconsistencies, plot holes, garbage clichés all over the place, fairly predictable, corny humor (some was clever), unexplained phenomenon, and lack luster music. The music was OK?, I guess. The voice talent was good to excellent, but I just couldn't get over the lack of substance to the lyrics. The lyrics were bland, repetitive, and at times confusing. I'll just leave it at that. Just as a side note, the sing along that was going on in my theater was really annoying. No I was not at a sing along screening, I saw this movie after it had been out for a long time so I suspect that the little girls singing along were seeing it for the 4,755th? time. I also waited for the applause at the end, but by heavens grace it didn't come. I get that this is a kid movie, so normally I wouldn't have reviewed it, or seen it (wife coerced me), but I feel the need to push back against the hysteria among adults about this movie. It baffles me. Why are adults so nuts about this puff piece? All fluff, no stuff. It had some potential but it wasted it. It could have been excellent, but instead it indulged all the old tired clichés from days gone by. Nothing new to see here folks. Except some excellent animation, if that's your thing. Which for me it is, but unfortunately that's only 20% of a movie for me. So that's why the 3 start rating. 20% for the animation, 10% for the story. I really wanted to give it 1 star to counter balance all the 10 star ratings on here, but that's just not fair. Oh well.",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A Future Classic,"Many have been touting this as Disney's best movie since The Lion King, and brings Disney back to its Renaissance era. Frozen gives us not one, but two incredibly strong female characters, while still appealing to both genders.The animation is amazing, especially with how complex some of the ice and snow scenes were. This is one of the few movies this year that is truly worth giving 3D a try. The music is also worthy of note. While not every song was perfect (a few seemed unnecessary and just a way to fill up time)""Let it Go"" should definitely be considered for nomination.No movie is perfect, and Frozen's plot and character development are its weak points. It is unfortunate that Disney decided to skimp on Elsa, the movie's most fascinating character. She is also the one with the most personal development from beginning to end. It would have been nice to see a darker or more chaotic tone, but this is a Disney movie, so it is expected to be light. The tropes of magic and true love also seem to be heavy handed, forcing the outcome in a predictable manner.Despite this, Disney still manages to make the audience care for most of the characters, most of whom are nicely fleshed out by the first act. By the time the movie finishes, you may even care a little or the snow man.With all this I think Frozen could compete with, and possibly beat, The Lion King as Disney's best movie. That may sound like a bit much, but its worth seeing it in theaters, at least one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
It has those Broadway feels.,"Usually, Disney Animation's Music amaze me when they're composed by Alan Menken (The Little Mermaid, Hercules, Tangled), even though I know there are many other good ones.But, Frozen has a different feel. In those movie above, I feel like I want to be in the movie. But this one, made me want to make a Broadway musical out of it. I can feel that in a couple of years, somebody will make it happen as a musical and I would love to see it!The music made for this movie is just amazing. A plus for the beautiful voice of Idina Menzel, who owns it in the movie version of ""Let It Go"" which is by far one of the best musical numbers Disney ever made.The story also surprised me. The thought of the typical Disney Princess Movies (true love's kiss breaks all the curse), but actually it's more of the family side of love. Because family loves you unconditionally and it brings me down to tears.The graphics were also stunning and took my breath away. It was overall very beautiful and HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Good for children - not for adults,"As a consistent fan of Disney I knew that I would eventually see this movie. When my friends told me how great it was I got more excited - yet another Disney classic! Unfortunately the film did not meet my expectations. The songs (with a couple exceptions) were not particularly memorable, the story seemed to jolt ahead in leaps and bounds, and the plot twist (if you can call it that) was entirely too predictable.Still, I heard a lot of kids laughing in the theater. Olaf, the comic relief, was quite funny and appealing to even the youngest.Ultimately, my recommendation is this: if you have kids, see it; if not, don't expect the magic of The Lion King or The Little Mermaid - it's more on par with Brave.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
It was okay.,"well this is my first review so forgive me for any grammar errors. Lets start with the fact that frozen is like a copy of tangled, Rapunzel and Anna have a lot in common for example they both are locked inside for their own good, they want freedom, and they both look alike.i have a feeling that the creators of tangled ran out of ideas so they had to make up a character who can't control her power and have her own parents lock her up instead of teaching her how to properly control it. they shouldn't lock her away and make her afraid of herself.i also feel like the characters would've been better off in 2D instead of 3D, in 3D their eyes are enormously huge, their noses are like buttons,their lips so thin,and it looks like their wearing lipstick or eyeliner.I'm not saying i don't like the movie i actually really like it, maybe because of the song frozen that was amazingly done by Indina Menzel.

Elsa when she make the ice castle it was very petty, her clothe was very pretty,i like the snowmen his very cute i thing his name is Olaf and i like the song Elsa sing and the song Anna sing,the name frozen is a good name for this movie and Elsa she become the snow queen she create the big Snow Monster, this movie is 3d i love this movie i think you like it too.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Disney's on a major roll, and Frozen hits the mountain top!","THE GOOD. After seeing this movie a second time, I like it even more. It's just a glorious masterpiece of animation! But lets go into the details: the main characters, Anna and Elsa are very well written and well developed characters, especially compared to previous Disney princesses (who they take a jab at occasionally). Anna is an incredibly fun princess and Elsa is quite tragic but still very relatable. The other characters are great, even Olaf the snowman, the character that everyone thought they would hate turned out to be very funny! The story is very well thought out and nothing is said or done that isn't revisited. There is two twists at the end that are very unexpected and fit the story perfectly, nothing like the story I thought I'd see. A big staple of Disney has always been the music, and Frozen's soundtrack, orchestral and songs, surpass the standard. ""Let it Go"", ""First Time in Forever"", ""Do You Wanna Build a Snowman"", all the songs are fantastic and memorable. The songs here give Beauty and the Beast a run for its money! And as usual from Disney, the animation is beautiful. The environments seem very Skyrim-esque, the graphics of the ice is flawless.THE BAD. I don't have much to complain about but there are a couple of things that distract me. Even though the animation is amazing some of the textures they use for characters and various things seem a little low- res. ""Fixer-Upper"" is quite a pointless song, as fun as it is. And the film seems to take quite a few queues from the X-Men films, from the basic setup to some of the shots the film uses.THE BOTTOM LINE People say this is up there with Beauty and The Beast and The Little Mermaid, and well... they're right. It's gorgeously animated, fantastic music, memorable characters and great story. Frozen will surely stand the test of time as one of Disney's greatest.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Watch the (2010) Frozen instead,"Having only seen half the movie years ago at a then friends who I'm no longer friends with nor care to be now... flash to now I'm watching the whole thing on STARZ it's not too bad, just overhyped in my opinion. I'll say though the color for the animation is beautiful & its got a sweet story with great morals!

I just don't see it,"When I first heard all about Frozen I got very excited. "" Wow, a new Disney movie with stunning animation and quirky characters!"" What I got was a bland mess of reused character models, poppy songs with no value whatsoever, an over the top feminist storyline (note: I am totally cool with feminism but here it was overblown), One of the most annoying Sidekicks ever in a Disney film and overall just a down right mediocre film. It's funny how the people who love this film to death have panned such classics as 2001: A Space Odyssey. This just blows my mind! Whats so damn good about this film. People say the animation, the animation is reused from every other current Disney films. Anna, the girl from Epic and the girl from Tangled are all the exact same model but with different hair. That's pathetic Disney. Some say that this movie is a masterpiece, I say go and watch some Hitchcock films instead of this feel-good piece of crap.",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Change!,"FEW spoilers, not many only to explain key areas! Disney seem to have had a complete make over! And frankly it's not bad! Since they did Tangled they seem to have gone for this wide-eyed girls with floating hair. I do like it, it's very pretty. I'm a classic Disney fan, grew up watching the classics and of course I miss the old type of animation but these things have to move on, they have to develop their techniques. The animation is more life like in the ways of movement, such as fabric and hair.In the case of characters I struggled to see a main character although it was obviously Anna (though they pronounced her name weirdly), but in a way I liked that, you were always seeing a more in depth look at each person. As for endearing characters obviously Olaf was the sweetest! He was a very funny character with a sweet nature, a representation of the two sisters' childhood. As for sisterly love I liked the way Disney took it, a family love not a girl meets boy kinda love and that in the end family matter too. I also loved the ""don't rush a relationship"" lesson cos you never know who the other person is going to be like. And again, family looking out for you! It seems Disney have taken a step back in some ways when they got to Kristoff, almost an chilly Aladdin! He was sweet and in the end was the real prince in shining armour but I think we all figured that out, AND his gallant steed!So overall a new and very successful journey for Disney and I hope to see more different stories again that are not all about love like the classics are (sleeping beauty, snow white, etc. I love them but kids need to know it's not all about finding your true love). Im very happy Disney have decided to take this role and I think maybe its because of the colab with Pixar? They have changed tremendously since working with them. But change is GOOD!",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A refreshing musical that you can't let go of...!,"Well I had to come back here and increase the rating by 2 points just because I can't let go of the music from my head. But to be honest I didn't find the plot to be perfect because I found a few flaws in the movie. Yes it is a a feel good animation movie so I guess that doesn't matter much.The plot is actually a bit clichéd but had its share of subtle surprises. Maybe the twists were so subtle that the movie didn't excite me that much. That being said there was enough comedy and action to keep you watching.I don't want to analyze the movie too much based on its Oscar win as I'll be hugely leaning towards Despicable Me 2. But when you take into account of the completeness of the movie, I don't think that an Oscar is undeserving.What really steals the show is the music. You just can't let go of the music. It was like the first time in forever that Disney seemed to come up with a cool musical after Lion King...!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Disney back to the roots,"A very liberal take on the Hans Christian Andersen ""Snow Queen"", has Walt Disney animation forcefully returning back to its roots, whilst learning heaps from their fruitful cooperation with Pixar. With top-notch animation directors Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee instill heart into proceedings, but reimplanting the musical magic of the pre-1960s classic cartoons. Princess Else (Idina Menzel) was born with a tremendous gift, able to create beautiful icy structures out of nothing. However her power is so immense, creating a risk to her loved ones. Despite the loving care of her parents she becomes afraid of her rampaging powers, especially after she accidentally injures her sister Anna (Kristen Bell). Else locks herself away, becoming a recluse detached from her beloved Anna, who slowly grows up full of joy of life and explosive happiness, untouched even by the death of her parents.When Else turns 18 she is to become queen of the kingdom, but fear causes her to cast a spell of eternal winter to encapsulate the land. As Else runs away into the high-rise mountains, Anna goes after her in an attempt to save the kingdom. She is soon joined by the ice seller Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) and his trusted reindeer dog Sven, as well as by the magical snowman Olaf (Josh Gad) in a touching adventure fraught with trials and tribulations...""Frozen"" possesses a musical zest, which hasn't featured in Pixar movies, but once was a hallmark of Disney animations. These traditions are effortlessly immersed into the beautifully told epic journey of friendship and timeless love. The amount of singing and dancing, especially in the opening half of the movie, comes somewhat as a surprise, but even more unexpectedly it never seems out-of-place as if coming from a bygone era of filmmaking. Seamlessly capturing the inner child, ""Frozen"" adds some spectacular imagery in ice, making it a magical journey for both kids and adults. Rife with some witty humour as well as the odd bout of slapstick, this is almost the perfect mix. Even the ending is sung in the perfect note, despite my misgivings of a trite well-worn route. That said Disney's newest feature is hardly adventurous, rather treading a easily anticipated dramatic path, which settles to deliver the expected in a fabulously enticing manner with beautiful surrounding, exquisite costumes or endearing characters (with the heat-loving snowman and the dog-deer Sven a special treat).Of special note is the lack of a defined villain, as the story is built around the concepts of human frailty, lack of internal confidence and mistakes that lead to terrible consequences. The antagonist is a tragic character of old, not by definition or nature, but by fate.Some quibbles should be made about script logic, especially the character and contradictory actions of Hans (Santino Fontana) raising an eyebrow or two.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Disney's best film since the 90's,"It seems that Frozen, much like Disney's other more modern animations, is one of those films that you either fall head over heels for, or you find it a bit unremarkable. Personally I loved this film and found it to be a great addition to the long line of classic Disney animations. I would even say that Frozen could be the best Disney film since the Renaissance in the 1990s (The Lion King, Aladdin, Mulan, Beauty and the Beast etc.) and is much better than Tangled, which many people have been comparing to this.Beautiful animation, fantastic character design (if you exclude of Olaf) and a great soundtrack make this a must see.My only problem is that the plot seems fairly rushed and weaker than other Disney films, The main villain's motives didn't seem developed enough as other Disney villains (or as scary for that reason, and Elsa didn't have enough screen time for my liking.One of Disney's darker films with breath-taking songs make this absolutely magnificent.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Bad Characters, Music, and ideas.","I have a truly unpopular opinion here haha. I thought frozen was terrible. Very boring characters along with a boring plot. It didn't even feel like a Disney movie. I would have given it a higher rating if the animation style was ""Disney"" like but it wasn't. The music was bad and the voice actor choices were terrible (Elsa sounds like she's 50!).Olaf the mascot character was extremely annoying and out of place the whole movie. What was even the point of those rock troll things anyway? It feels like they were just thrown in there last minute. Though I do like what they did with Hans. He is cool.

Despite the title a very heart warming film,"An overall warm family friendly film with an overwhelming cuteness behind it, If you thought that TANGLED was good you are missing out if you haven't seen FROZENPossibly one of Disney best animated movies ever made, (i don't include pixar films as I have a different list for pixar films)Many charming characters with some deep emotional back stories, some brilliant family friendly comedy,Very well story boarded and has light and dark edges of cinematics which will keep you gripped to the edge of your seat in the action moments,Possibly the best Disney movie soundtrack i have ever heard, The songs are very catchy and there are some amazingly talented singers within the cast which power house the performance of the movieAs the later years of Disney are around us this film goes to prove they can still make the movies that both adults and kids enjoy9 OUT OF 10Damian Hockey",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Traditional in the best sense of the word,"Walt Disney's ""Frozen"" takes us back to a time when animated films were literally royal affairs, overflowing with handsome princes and beautiful princesses, magic spells and comical sidekicks, Broadway-style songs and happily-ever-after endings. In this case, it's the Princesses who take center stage, and they're pretty resourceful and feisty, as befits the modern era.The story, based on ""The Snow Queen"" by Hans Christian Anderson, features Elsa (Idina Menzel) and Anna (Kristen Bell) as royal sisters, the former of whom has magical powers, the latter of whom does not. The problem is that Elsa's use of her power is erratic, to put it mildly, and in an attempt to protect Anna from any possible fallout, Elsa has hidden that power from her little sister for most of their lives. On the day she is crowned Queen of Arendelle, Elsa inadvertently casts a spell on the world, plunging it into eternal winter. It becomes the job of Anna, with the help of some colorful assistants, to get Elsa to un-cast the spell and return normalcy to the world.With screenplay by Jennifer Lee and direction by Lee and Chris Buck, ""Frozen"" isn't the most cutting-edge of animated features, particularly in contrast to many of PIXAR better-known offerings, but it has an elegant, classical appeal that makes ""old-fashioned"" seem cool again. The score by Christophe Beck isn't instantly memorable but it at least it's more snappy than sappy, and the shimmering visuals compensate for a touch of spottiness in the storytelling.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Frozen review,"Love is shown in this movie through the acts of the characters and the relationship between Anna and Elsa. They find out a lot about love not only from each other but from other people along the way. I think that is an important message to learn because we learn love from our family and friends too as well as ourselves. That is why this is such a great movie. Frozen has a powerful message in it and it is cute! According to IMDb.com, the award-winning Walt Disney movie and computer animated musical film Frozen, won an Oscar nominee for the best animated feature film of the year. It also earned an award for having the best original song, ""Let it Go"", along with many other awards. Among Frozen being an Academy Award winner, there are also many different reasons it is a great movie. It is about love between family and people she meets along the way and that's what makes Frozen uniquely different and better than the other Disney princess movies, in my opinion. This is a phenomenal movie also because the audience is for all ages, kids to adults, any age is guaranteed to enjoy this movie! The actors in this movie make for great personalities and a great story. Kristen Bell is a great actress and singer who plays the voice of Anna, who is a very daring and determined girl who try's everything to save her sister. This is important to the theme of the film because Anna is trying to find an act of true love and her fearlessness and determination makes her unstoppable. Josh Gad is an actor who plays Olaf. Olaf is portrayed as a very friendly, happy snowman which makes the movie even more cute! This also relates to the film because Olaf's friendliness and being outgoing helps Anna along her journey. If it wasn't for Olaf, Anna wouldn't have been able to find Elsa or give true love a meaning. Jonathan Groff plays the voice of Kristoff, who is an outdoorsman that helps Anna along in her journey. Kristoff being the outgoing, friendly guy was important because he stuck by Anna's side the whole journey and made supplies so they could get to Elsa. Idina Menzel plays the voice of Elsa, the queen of Arrendelle, as a fearful and reserved princess. This is important to the theme because it creates a problem in the plot and makes it very interesting and gives Anna a purpose in the movie. The directors of this movie are Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee. This movie is about princess Anna trying to save Arrendelle from a never-ending winter, but in order to do that she needs to find her sister. Elsa sets off a never-ending winter from her magical powers coming out when she was upset. On Anna's journey, she meets a guy that isn't good for her. She thinks she finds the meaning of true love but Hans turns against Anna and shuts her out because of Elsa's powers. Anna meets Kristoff, he stayed by her side the whole journey and helped her on her way to find her sister, Elsa. On their way, they also met another important character, Olaf. Olaf showed Anna what true love was. Olaf led Anna to Elsa's castle and Elsa's magical powers froze Anna's heart, an act of true love would be the thing that unthawed Anna's heart. Love is portrayed in many ways in this film. It has a strong message throughout the film and that is what I like about it a lot. One way it is portrayed is by Kristoff. He is by Anna's side the whole journey and when Elsa froze Anna's heart, Kristoff was there right by her side making sure she was okay. Another way love was portrayed was by Olaf. He gives love a whole different meaning. He explains love is ""when you put someone else's needs before yours"". He stood with Anna by the fire waiting for her to unthaw even if that meant he melt because he said ""some people are worth melting for"". He also stood by Anna's side and helped her find Elsa when they met. Love is portrayed between the sisters a lot. Anna always wanted to be close with her sister, but Elsa shut her out because she was scared she would see her magical powers. When Elsa left Arendelle after she set off the winter, Anna was leaving shortly after determined to find her sister. Another way their relationship shows love is by when Prince Hans was about to kill Elsa, Anna seen Hans going towards Elsa and intercepted his sword before it hit Elsa, as she was doing that Anna froze into solid ice. Elsa came running over to her after that happened just feeling terrible for what she did. Anna's sacrifice to become frozen by saving Elsa from getting killed by Prince Hans was an act of true love and that is why her heart unfroze. This film is not only one children can enjoy but adults too! It has a great message about love portrayed in it that adults can recognize by the relationships created in the movie! Kristoff, Olaf, Anna and Elsa all discovered what true love was throughout their journey. Without a doubt this movie will keep you engaged every second; there is never a dull moment. You will see amazing visual animations and watch the characters as they discover the strength within themselves. The actors and the characters in the movie keep you entertained because they all have different personalities and characteristics, from happy friendly Olaf, to reserved and fearful Elsa to fearful and determined Anna. I personally enjoyed this movie very much so and would highly recommend it to any age group!",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Not A Fan Of Musicals, But This Was Good For One","I wanted to see a movie a few days ago, and my mom did too. So I took her to a theater and she wanted to see Frozen, because she heard from a friend that it was really good. I wanted to see Saving Mr. Banks, but whatever. As I went into the theater, I had a hunch that it was going to be a girlie princess movie. Well, I was right. Except for the exception of maybe 5 scenes, the movie was a complete girl movie. OK, maybe that is a little bit of an exaggeration, but it was fairly girlie. I am a guy, so, you know. I decided that I wouldn't make a big deal out of it, so I kept watching it. I am glad I did. I enjoyed because my mom enjoyed it so much, and because there were a few good laughs. The movie was very good for a princess movie, and I'm not ashamed to say it. Olaf was hilarious, and I loved every scene he was in. So, if you go see the movie and don't like it, wait until Olaf comes in and maybe you will like it a bit more Sometimes, I was thinking that the movie would have been a little better if there wasn't so many songs, because I counted, and there were about 9-11 songs. Some of them catchy, some of them not. If there were only, maybe, 5 songs, that would have made the movie a little better, I think. My mom thought it was good, so I was happy. The acting was superb, and I don't say that lightly. That was one of the reasons I gave this a 6. The movie's sense of humor was a little bit sophisticated at times, and I enjoyed those parts, and sometimes it was just stupid. The humor, I mean. Like I said in the summary, I usually don't like musicals at all, but this was actually pretty good for a musical. I enjoyed about 4 of the songs, and all of the others I didn't think were needed. The story has 2 different sides to it. There is the side that is completely used up already, where a girl falls in love then figures out it was not true and then falls in love with the guy raised in the cold and the mountains who treats her not so good and then eventually they end up falling in love somehow due to something really confusing that could have been simplified. I hope that wasn't a spoiler because you should have seen that coming before you started watching it. Then there is the other side of the story that hasn't been used that has magic powers and a talking snowman and a bunch of other things I can't say without it being a spoiler. Overall I did like this movie, but just not enough to give it higher than a 6. It's pretty much like a movie that you didn't mind seeing, but wouldn't see it again by yourself. If you were to see it with a friend, maybe. I think you would enjoy it a lot more than I did if you musicals, because there is an abundance of music and singing in this movie. Also, I would recommend it if you like fairy princess movies. OK, maybe not FAIRY princess movies, but princess movies. Or animation movies with romance, for that matter. t is most likely targeted to 4-11 year old girls, but there was the exception of some old guys seeing it (old meaning about 30). Another reason I kind of liked this movie is that there was a really tough guy with a leather jacket and boots laughing at all of the jokes really loud. He seemed like he enjoyed the movie. Anyway, I do recommend this movie to you if you like princesses, romance, well, a little bit of it, animation, or you want to take a little kid to watch the movie. Hope you found this review helpful.

Winter is coming,"Hey, guys! I've found some cool particle effects for the snow and ice here! Let's make a movie!Bad writing (confusing with no order and random scenes with no cause and effect, mixing Nordic, Russian and Dutch culture and so on). Some good music, too good for the movie. Reindeer that behaves like a dog (same approach again). Snowman that tries to be funny but fails every time. A classic Disney let's-ruin-a-potentially-good-story concept. Guys from Pixar probably went crazy. Disney studios is doing to Pixar what P.L. Travers did to Mr. Disney. For all the good moments of this movie all credits go to guys/gals from Pixar.

"Fun, thought-provoking Disney winner...","1st watched 2/28/2014 – 7 out of 10(Dir-Jennifer Lee & Chris Buck): Fun, thought-provoking Disney winner as they continue the tradition of entertaining animated family-oriented feature films. This is a story about two sisters who are separated from one another at an early age due to the older one's special powers accidentally harming the other. The parents are told to do this to protect the younger one, Anna, by an elder rock-troll after healing her. The parents(who are King&Queen of a town called Arondale) then die in an accident, but the separation is kept in place until the elder of the two sisters is coronated as Queen of the city. During the celebration, the elders ice-creating powers is revealed and she banishes herself up a mountain and unknowingly brings upon a frozen winter-like condition to the area. The movie is based on the Hans Christian Anderson story ""The Snow Queen"", which is what she now makes herself isolated from other people. Anna, then decides to seek her out in a quest up the mountain to hopefully reverse the process.(By the waya perfect movie for the horrible 2013-2014 winter season that doesn't want to go awayalthough I don't think Disney knew this was going to happen while making it) This is a song-filled(almost too much so at times) new classic that, in my opinion, doesn't deserve it's PG-rating. The movie even has a meaningful theme by the time it ends, with some added laughs primarily from a re-animated snowman named Olaf, romance, action and some mystery as we try to figure out how the happy ending is going to happen. Some of the plot twists don't make a lot of sense, but this is only a minor flaw to an otherwise well done new Disney film that I'm sure will be enjoyed by families for awhile as it's promoted to home video offerings.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A Blizzard of Pure Disney Magic,"Well, my fellow readers, Disney has still got the touch. After going through bayous, high towers and video games, the folks at Disney Animation goes into the business of a winter wonderland with its new feature film, Frozen, and it excels with flying colors and a touching spirit that reminds one of the past ""Disney Renaissance"" films of the 90's.Based on the fable of the Snow Queen, this story is about two sisters of royalty, pampered Anna (voiced by TV's Kristen Bell from House of Cards and Veronica Mars) and Elsa (voiced by Idina Menzel from Broadway's Wicked), who has the power of snow. When they were younger, Anna and Elsa used to play together thanks to Elsa's magic. But, Elsa accidentally used her powers on Anna and her parents decided to hide Elsa from the outside world, protecting her witchcraft. Years pass, and soon Elsa becomes the new queen of Arendalle, after her parents' death from a boat accident. But, soon, when she has an argument with Anna, she mistakenly uses her powers and as a result, turns Arendalle from a spring place to a winter nightmare. Elsa then runs away, seeking isolation from the troubles she caused. Anna decides to find her with a help of mountain man Kristoff (Jonathan Groff of HBO's upcoming show, Looking), his reindeer Sven and a moving and can't stop talking snowman named Olaf (Josh Gad of Broadway's Book of Mormon).The plot is like Sleeping Beauty meets Edward Scissorhands, because Elsa is like a female version of Edward. They both were hidden from the rest of the world, but the difference is that Elsa has snow magic, while Edward has scissors. Jennifer Lee (who co-directs here with Chris Buck) has written a funny and likable script with a bit of the talking style you often hear nowadays on teen TV shows.The animation is lavishing with stunning special effects and a real storybook-like texture to the characters. My favorite scene in the film was the amazing sequence when Elsa decides to make her own snow palace. My fine complements to the people at Disney Animation for a great effort.Plus, the voice cast fits the characters perfectly. Bell and Menzel, respectively, are a perfect match to bring Anna and Elsa to voice life while Gad makes Olaf one of Disney's funniest sidekicks creations since Mushu (Mulan), Sebastian (The Little Mermaid) and Genie (Aladdin), with a sly and wacky attitude and a Martin Short-like voice.The musical score by Broadway vet Robert Lopez (Avenue Q and Book of Mormon) and his wife Kristen is marvelous. It's filled with some hummable tunes including ""For the First Time in Forever"" and ""Let it Go"" (the latter performed astonishingly perfect by Menzel). This music may last in your head for days, maybe weeks.As I said in the beginning, the spirit of this film contributes to the Disney animated films of the past such as Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King. Like these mentioned films, Frozen has the goods of a pure Disney film: a working story, love or hate characters, top-notch animation and a wonderful score.This is a charming and winning Christmas gift for all from ages 3 to 103. Plus, in this ""kiddie film"" wasteland of bathroom jokes and copycat home video material, this is the perfect family film for everyone to see. Heck, even your pet may love it.Hopefully with some big box office returns, it could finally put The Lone Ranger mess out of Disney's misery.Note: Preceding the film is a brand new Mickey Mouse short, Get a Horse, where Mickey accidentally comes out of his black-and-white film, trying to save Minnie from Pegleg Pete, straight into the movie theater, and some mayhem happens. It's delightful and proves that Mickey's still got it after 85 years of entertaining moviegoers all across the world.Rating: Frozen: ***1/2Get a Horse: ***Parent Advisory: Frozen is rated PG for some action and mild rude humor. Despite that rating, it's a perfect find for all ages.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Nothing Special,"I really don't see what the big deal is with this film. What does it offer that the previous Disney films didn't? I don't mind the princess vibes and love for them, but this films feels like Tangled to me. I rarely say a film is over-hyped, but this is an exception. It not that I don't think this is a good movie, it has clever moments. But nothing about this kept me on the edge of my seat like I did with How to Train Your Dragon. Or have many heartwarming moments like The Lion King. One thing however that does stand out to me is that awesome song ""Let it Go"" which I fell in love with the first time I saw. It's almost as good as ""Circle of Life."" And for me that's saying a lot about it. Other then that it has some witty humor and a clever story arc, but ultimately I'd rather watch How to Train Your Dragon again then this. Here is how I grade it: Animation/Visuals: B+ Voice Acting/Cast: B Music/Songs: A- Characters: A- Story: C+ Overall Grade: B-",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"""the movie is too beautiful""","I wanna be short about the story because I don't want to spoil anything. It's basically about two sisters, princesses, one of which has magical powers. Those magical powers could be harmfull to others because she can't completely control them. That's all I'm gonna say about the story...The story is simple but well written and it doesn't feel like it's been done a million times before. The characters are interesting and lovable and the animations is beautiful.Almost forgot to say: this movie is a musical, but it works, they girls sing their feelings to each other and it just simply works. The songs are all at least more then decent and performed well.The only two things I'd like to comment on are these: the movie is too beautiful, the animation is just too smooth, the princesses are too pretty and the potential love interests off the two are too handsome. It feels too fake and it would've benefit the movie if it felt more real. Yes, even an animated movie benefits from some down-to-earth-ness. Second, it could've been a little funnier. Especially the opening where the story and characters are introduced was a bit boring. After that it got better and better. One of the few Disney movies where the ending was good and didn't feel completely predictable either.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A bit overhyped by great music and CGI,"I don't watch a ton of animated stuff and I'm not 8, so I may not be the target market, but I had to watch it due to all the hype around it.

"A fantastic movie, when compared to other animated films.","It's hard to deny the worldwide phenomenon that is this movie. While I'm sure parents now twitch any time ""Let it Go"" comes on, the fact of the matter is many factors led to the success of this film. Starting in the mid-2000's, Disney saw they had a problem and set about trying to fix it. By rehauling how they told stories, and how they approached the characters in these stories, they soon were back on top of the animation industry (while Pixar continues to be content pumping out Cars sequels).Stunning visuals can only get you so far in a Disney movie, and Frozen (2013) certainly takes the cake when it comes to visualizing snow and ice through computers. What makes Frozen work as a story is its complexity. No one character is completely good or completely bad, each having their faults and limitations, as well as their good intentions and personal desires. This makes identifying the villain a little bit like it is in real life: is it Elsa, who accidentally turned the weather to winter and is fighting to maintain her freeing isolation? Or is it Hans, who probably has a disadvantage at home and just wants to bring his leadership to his kingdom? Either way, the moral of ""sacrificial love"" is one that breaks from the standard ""fairy tale"" storyline.I think what sets Frozen apart is its music. Sure, most Disney films are considered ""musical,"" but it's the Broadway-esque styling of the songs that makes them so memorable. And while the songs are heavily weighted to the first half of the movie, the certainly run the gamut of emotions. From sappy love songs to a goofy snowman aria to the ballad of an independent woman, almost every character gets their say through song. Still, Disney missed a few opportunities to incorporate Foreigner songs into the soundtrack (i.e. ""Cold as Ice"" and ""I Wanna Know What Love is"").A fantastic movie, when compared to other animated films, I give Frozen 4.0 stars out of 5.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Bit overrated,"Pros: Amazing CGI = brilliant visual effects, with a great OST that will make little kids sing-a-long all day. Cons: Flawed characters and story that makes half the film almost boring.The characters and story are not as powerful and moving as Disney's most loved masterpieces the little mermaid, beauty and the beast, the lion king, or even pocahontas.There isn't much depth to the plot and the characters seem out of place. Anna is too nice for no reason, Elsa isn't given enough screen time for the audience to recognize her as the main-heroine. The bad guy, who is some prince from who knows where.. why was he there again?There are bits where some people might start tearing up but it no where close to leaving any lingering effect after ""the end"". The drama and tension have no time to build up.Olaf the random snowman guy was there doing nothing particular, Sven the reindeer could have played a bigger role. (remember flounder and sebastian from the little mermaid?)Disney has definitely been gaining back it's magic JUST NOT YET, worthy of its glorious Disney heritage.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
This is a movie worth melting for,"Princess Elsa of Arendelle (Idina Menzel) is next-in-line for the throne - and she has ice powers. After an accident, Elsa is isolated from the rest of the world in fear of her powers going out of control and is forbidden contact with anyone - including her younger sister, Anna (Kristen Bell). Years later, after her parents pass away, Elsa is crowned queen and a party is thrown. All is well, but then Anna, who is upset with being constantly rejected by Elsa all these years, finally confronts Elsa, and accidentally causes Elsa's powers to go berserk and Elsa flees the kingdom in panic, unwittingly setting off an eternal winter everywhere.
Anna must brave the elements, team up with a rough-and-tumble man called Kristoff, his trusty reindeer Sven, and a lovable snowman called Olaf, to find her sister and restore summer.
For quite a few years, I had been putting off watching this movie as I wasn't sure about the magical elements of it - sounded too much like the White Witch and The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, in my opinion.
But, earlier this year, I finally decided to borrow it from my library and give it a go, seriously expecting it to be a waste of time.
Boy, was I very wrong.
I love this movie!!!
It is, quite frankly, one of Disney's best animated movies of all time!
The animation is top notch and has serious attention to detail. The acting is very fantastic and everyone is perfectly cast for the roles - especially Kristen Bell, who plays Anna, and Josh Gad, who plays Olaf.
The story was very entertaining and engaging - it grabbed my attention from the very start. Has plenty of twists and turns - nothing is what it seems. The villain is great and perfectly believable - far from cheesy. I don't get why there have been complaints about who the villain turns out to be. With regards to the complaint that we had no idea beforehand, I would say it was done that way to lead us up the garden path, to make it more of a surprise. And they succeeded. Well done and hats off to Disney.
There is nothing wrong with Olaf - he really makes this movie something special. He's cute, adorable, and will steal your heart in a second. Bonus points for the fact that Josh Gad improvised a lot of his lines - his comic timing was absolutely spot-on.
The climax is so good. Amazing, amazing. I'm practically jumping up and down in my seat every time I watch it. Well, with the whole movie, really. Embarrassing, since I'm not a child.
There is not too many songs. In fact, I wish there was more of them. I love each and every one of the songs and have memorized Let It Go and the first First Time In Forever song. Not sure if that is a bad thing or not.
And it's not just for little girls. It's for anyone of any age.
It has great themes of sisterhood and coming of age. Of love, of letting go of your fears.
A true classic and a must watch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Does start to wear thin after a while, however - some of the characters and plot devices are quite silly.I was also expecting the music to be overly child-orientated but they're generally OK. Some are a bit of an ordeal but some are actually quite pleasant. On that note, ""Let it go"" is OK, but is vastly over-rated.Kids will enjoy it. Adults can give it a miss.

Number 1 at U.K box office for weeks and weeks. WHY?,"Admittedly I'm not exactly the target audience for this movie but I'm utterly mystified as to why Frozen is such a big hit. The plot is dire, full of clichés, boring and predictable. Apart from the ice palace scene, which was admittedly pretty cool, the animation is unremarkable. The endless songs are uninspired and grating. It's just so obnoxiously Disney, everything about it, the gurning animals, the sickly sentimentality, the songs, everything. For some reason the writers have gone back in time to the stuff they were putting out in the 80's and early 90s. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed films like Beauty and The Beast, Hercules, Lion King, Aladdin and so on, but that was over two decades ago. Besides, nobody else was putting out big budget animated movies anyway and we didn't have anything to compare them to. There is absolutely nothing original or groundbreaking about this movie. In an era of films like UP, Wall-E, Toy Story, this kind of output is baffling to me. Remember when Shrek came out and brilliantly mocked the fairytale, twee, sickly sentiment of Disney? It's like things have come full circle. And people seem to absolutely love it! It's very puzzling to me, what am I missing?",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Good stuff, but not up there with the Toy Story trilogy","Moving countries is a sure way to put all sorts of parts of your psyche to the test. The new culture(s), the change in weather patterns, missing your favourite café or radio station or park, the relationships to build .. all of these and so much more splash around the surfaces of the consciousness. You are out-of-place: you know it, others know it. It's obvious.When we moved to South Africa nearly 5 years ago we experienced all of this. It felt like we were constantly missing out on something. It's not so much destabilising as it is the creation of a whole new identity. Much of what you had become accustomed to building around you as part of your sense of self is gone and you have to do it all over again. One of the things I discovered I was missing out on was a name for this experience of missing out on things. I don't know if it's especially popular in this country or this part of this country, but I kept hearing and noticing 4 letters as part of speech. FOMO. It sounded like the name of a music festival; it would be casually slipped into a conversation and the locals would laugh. 'FOMO! Ahh...' Like the new car I hadn't seen before, it was suddenly everywhere.It stands for Fear Of Missing Out, and apparently it's a thing. I don't know where it came from and I'm not especially keen on finding out, but some people were having counselling or prayer ministry to deal with their FOMO. I was missing out on missing out.Another area I was missing out on had nothing to do with moving to South Africa, but has more to do with the fact that my wife and I don't have children. Though we both love films, this does mean that we tend to avoid seeing films that are aimed at more of an all-age audience and tend to concentrate on more 'adult' fare. (no, not that sort of adult). This means that sometimes we miss out; over the last couple of years it felt like we'd Missed Out in a very big way. Because, you see, we hadn't seen Frozen.Frozen is one of those animated films that has become a huge cultural icon. 'Let It Go' is everywhere. People are always posting hilarious versions of it on social media relating to news events or life in general; comments would be made about the cold not bothering me anyway. There were debates about how feminist it is, or isn't. None of which I watched, understood or partook in. I was Missing Out and I didn't like the feeling. Or so I thought.So we recorded it off the television, and did the decent thing last week. We watched it as originally intended - with an eleven year old who's currently staying with us along with her mother. Do you think you have ever Missed Out on something? Not only had the 11-year old not seen Frozen before, she's never seen snow or ice (we live in Cape Town).Most of you don't need me to tell you that Frozen is a really good film. The songs really do work; Let It Go is proper ear-worm fodder; the snowman and the reindeer are classic creations. I laughed out loud several times, as did the 11-year old. Finding ourselves thinking about fostering I thought ... if I was responsible for an 11-year old girl for whom I was responsible, would I want her to see this film? Yes, probably, I thought. Not only is it great fun but it's refreshing to see an animated princess who has agency and decision-making power and who isn't defined by the colour pink or her choice of man. It's got a way to go - I was a little troubled by the subtext that a woman's emotions affects everything and everyone around her - but this is much better a role model for young girls than many an all-age film I've come across before.For me it's a good animated film; up there with Up and Wall-E but not in Toy Story trilogy territory. But here's the thing; it was better when I hadn't seen it. Not having seen it had actually become part of me; a small part of me, but part of me nonetheless. I had gained a bit of cultural kudos from not having seen it; I was the person who hadn't seen Frozen!!! Now I was one of the crowd, just like everyone else. I was laughing at the jokes. I understand the lines about the cold not bothering me - but the thing is, it kind of does. It was a bit better on the outside.That shouldn't surprise me. People tend to experience me as a bit 'alternative'; just this week a friend in the same group discussion as me started laughing as soon as I took the microphone because he 'just knew you'd say something subversive'. I guess he was right; I talked about the way a certain passage of the Bible was used in demonic and dangerous ways by evangelicals like us.I need to watch this, though. Defining myself by something other than what Jesus says about me is very dangerous territory. I may prefer being a little on the edge but He says I'm chosen and accepted and in. If I'm not careful I could find myself frozen out just to make sure my fragile sense of self is intact. Better to get that from Him, not whether I've seen a given movie or what I think about a certain passage.Frozen is a good movie; I'm glad I've seen it. I do miss missing out, though.Not to worry.

Frozen Adds A New Classic in Disney History,"Frozen is yet another Disney animated movie, but unlike many in the past few years, this one really works! To start off, it's a strong story, one that is based on the fairy tale ""The Snow Queen,"" by Hans Christian Andersen. It tells the tale of two sisters of royalty in what is a kingdom of a fantasy world, but very much feels like Scandinavia. The older sister, Elsa has a magic power that everything she touches turns to ice. This is both a power and a curse as she finds out with her family. Her younger sister, Anna does not know about this power of her sister's but eventually comes to learn about it. From there, the story takes us on an adventure of Anna looking to find Elsa who leaves the kingdom unexpectedly.It is an exciting story and is filled with other tremendous characters that add great life to the film including Kristoff, who is a Viking-type that loves the cold and has a reindeer named Sven. There is also a snowman named Olaf who wants nothing other than to know what the summer is like. Their personalities not only add much humor, but also a lot of heart to the plot.Another great quality of the film is the animation. And I will say it is great! It may be some of the best I have ever seen, beautifully showing the winter and the settings around the kingdom. It was a joy just watching the landscape shots unfold here.The other surprising aspect to it was the songs. Yes, it's a musical, so anyone who doesn't like them, it may not be their cup of tea. The songs though are very strong, giving not only some great messages in them, but also some beats that will keep sticking in your head after it's over.With all these aspects, the film pans out to a fun, adventurous and sweet tale that people of all ages will love.

A worthy entry to the long line of Disney's greatest animated musical classics,"Frozen is the latest successful animated musical entry from Disney after Tangled. The story is heartwarming, emotionally engaging, unpretentious and enjoyable to watch at the same time. It also provides a good plot twist before the climax. Much like Tangled, Disney managed to return to its old roots by recapturing the long lost Disney classic magic that enthralled the hearts of young and old.The story's main focus is on sisterhood love compared to romantic ones in the past. However, it does redefine the meaning of true love and and provides a clear moral message to the current younger generation: know the person you fall in love with, not just based on looks and appearances.The animation is top notch and stunning to watch. The soundtrack for the film is fantastic: the lovely songs ""Let It Go"", ""For the first time in forever"", ""Do You Want to Build a Snowman?"", ""Love is an Open Door""...are all good in its own right.Both princesses in the film are unique, independent, strong, brave young women which can serve good inspirations for many young girls out there. Young Elsa and Anna were so cute and adorable. Elsa is a very interesting character, it's quite rare for Disney to create a female character who is both complex and sympathetic at the same time. Sees herself as only a force of destruction, feeling that she doesn't belong in the Kingdom of Arendelle, it's actually quite heartbreaking to see Elsa forced to suppress her powers, withdraw all her emotions and tragically isolated from the outside world at a very young age just to protect her family and people.Come to think of it, it's actually quite a shame that she's not paired with a partner who truly love and understand her other than her sister (Although the current plot is not bad, it's just that it would be better if Elsa have a loving partner and her sister as well. She deserves it.).Overall, this film is definitely a worthy entry to the long line of Disney's greatest animated musical classics for the years to come. Finally, Disney returned to its former glory. Highly recommended to any family or Disney fans who loved the classics.Animated short film - ""Get a horse"": Although it blends in the classic black and white look and modern 3D animation of Mickey, Minnie, and Pete, but nothing spectacular or worth mentioning here compared to Pixar's thoughtful animated shorts.Rating: 8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

A little thin in the plot department, mind you, but that's where the Disney wizards compensate with stunning visuals, effervescent voice acting and of course that legendary, now iconic song, belted out by Idina Menzel's Elsa high atop a snowy peak. I heard that song played into oblivion before I ever saw the film, and didn't ever think I'd be able to enjoy it again without getting the ol' eyelid twitch, but seeing the real thing in the context of the film, with a little help from my home theater system, well.... let it go indeed. Menzel and Kristen Bell are touching as the two sisters, Anna the doe eyed princess with the world at her feet, Elsa the fierce and independent rebel who doesn't fit in. Her magical abilities with snow and ice allow for some unbelievable computer effects, and the ice palace she creates is a gem of a set piece, intricately woven and detailed to the max. Their castle down below is designed with traditional Germanic decoration in mind, a nod to the inspiration they have no doubt received from Hans Christian Anderson's original storybook, The Snow Queen. Like I said before, what's there in plot is spread pretty thin, but it's no matter, because this one is fuelled by visuals. Sweeping mountains packed it powdery snow drifts, ornate castles, beautifully designed costumes, sleds, dresses and animals, including Sven the rambunctious reindeer. It's a jewel of ocular achievement. Oh and I might add, that Swedish sounding dude who runs the little shop way up the mountain is probably the funniest character Disney has created in years.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
