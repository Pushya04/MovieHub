"A slow burning, provocative gem.","There has been next to no fanfare for the release of this murder mystery. Which is surprising, considering the talent involved in front of the camera (Jeremy Renner, Elizabeth Olsen) and behind it (writer-director Taylor Sheridan). Fresh from joining the ranks of top-tiered screenwriters after the amazing one-two punch of Sicario and Hell or High Water, Sheridan continues his stellar run with a heart-wrenching study of loss and grief wrapped in a taut crime thriller narrative. Also having a crack at directing, Sheridan allows the snowy Wyoming setting to completely envelope the characters in a world that feels like it has no exits, both physically and emotionally. When this Native American community is hit with a homicide it feels like another tragedy in a long line of tragedies; their shock is replaced with deeper sorrow, their outrage is replaced with solemn defeat. Entering the scene like a fish out of water, Olsen's junior FBI agent Jane Banner must traverse the tricky cultural complexities if she's to understand the clues in front of her. Luckily she has Renner's local hunter Cory Lambert to assist, himself battling with a past family disaster. Renner and Olsen are both in terrific form, the former hiding his grief under a stoic veneer, the latter balancing big-city attitude with a genuine desire to find justice for the victim. Veteran character actor Gil Birmingham is also superb as a father unsure of how to deal with his earth-shattering loss. If this all sounds a bit heavy, well it is, but Sheridan's careful to inject a healthy dose of suspense and mild action to keep the drama gripping rather than overbearing; the finale in particular turns the movie on its head in an unpredictable but extremely effective manner. An intelligent, slow burning and provocative viewing that enthrals from start to finish, Wind River is an understated gem that deserves an audience.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An Engrossing Murder Mystery That Respects Its Subject _ and Audience,"""Wind River"" is a gripping murder mystery-thriller written and directed by Taylor Sheridan (Best Original Screenplay Oscar nominee for ""Hell or High Water"") starring Jeremy Renner, Elizabeth Olsen and Graham Greene, featuring an unusually strong supporting cast that includes many fine Native American actors.Renner and Olsen play a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service tracker and an FBI agent, respectively, attempting to solve the murder of a young woman whose body is discovered by Renner under mysterious circumstances as he patrols the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming.The film scrupulously avoids clichés and is tightly edited with nary a wasted moment, yet never feels rushed or artificial in performance or plot. Everyone and everything is there for a reason, and best of all, the audience is given credit for being able to keep up and connect the dots.The violence, which is absolutely necessary, is kept at a bare minimum as a narrative device, explaining and clarifying rather than assaulting the senses.Every character, even the most heinous, is portrayed as a fully developed human being rather than as stereotype.We learn how the Native American culture is victimized in a way that takes us inside their world and their souls, but the journey is skillfully handled and never heavy handed.The photography is perfectly rendered, celebrating the icy Wyoming scenery in a muted style consistent with the mood of the story.Renner, Olsen and Greene are excellent and believable, but in no small way this is an ensemble piece whose potency and effectiveness derive from the palpable passion and belief of everyone in front of and behind the camera.This is an engrossing story well worth your time and money, and kudos to everyone involved for having faith that a discerning audience will find and appreciate it.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Renner's potrayal of a broken man who is keen on hunting any kinda predators, Sheridan's superb writing, the snowy landscape as another character makes this a must watch.","I saw this few days back on a Blu-ray. As an avid fan of Taylor Sheridan, was looking forward to this without watching the trailer. It is a very beautifully shot, well acted and distressing crime drama. The vast landscape becomes more than a vivid backdrop, it becomes a character in the film.
Wind River is able to showcase Sheridans directing and storytelling strengths.
From the dark border area (Sicario), to the scorching plains of Texas (Hell or ...) and to the frozen mountains in Wyoming in Wind river, the writer/director managed to make the landscape a character in the film. Jeremy Renner potrayed the role of a broken man who is keen on hunting the predators very well n he deserves an Oscar for his performance. The less said about the plot is better because one has to see this film rather than read about its plot.
The film has a very strong social message.
The films conclusion with the message was very horrifying n distressing.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
So Truthful,"Although very, very small errors crept in this story it is very true. As someone who lived right off the Wind River Reservation and whose husband worked for the Northern Arapaho tribe (one of three non-native employees) I can say that without a doubt this is what happens too many times on the res there. The natives often live in deplorable conditions but it's not all the other guy's fault either. However, the treatment of women and the disappearance of women, and yes men too, is horrific. There is often no closure. Things are so confusing and convoluted and corrupt that it's no surprise these things happen. We've since moved away but some of the experiences and events will never be gone. I wish that the people there, on and off the res, can find some resolution to the atrocities. It's a beautiful area and everyone should visit the Wind River mountains. It's on most people's way to the Grand Tetons and Yellowstone. Stop at Brooks lake and see the beginning of the Wind River. And the rest of the beauty there. Just don't go up on the res unless you're with a local.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Well worth a watch,"A pretty good murder mystery. It is a pretty basic movie to be honest but I think that is one of the reasons I liked it so much. There are no big twists you basically watch what the ""detectives"" find out as they investigate.It moves along quickly. It's well written and the acting from everyone is really good. There is not much CGI which I like. The little bit of gore there was looked like practical affects. Renner is top notch in this one. Would totally recommend.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Suspenseful! A perfect thriller!,"The screenwriter who gave us ""Sicario"" and ""Hell or High Water"" has come back with ""Wind River"" which he also directed and I am now convinced more than ever that Taylor Sheridan is one of the best storytellers of our time. There's something about his thrillers that are just so cunning and sharp and profound, like a great American classic, even novelist Dennis Lehane probably couldn't come up with materials that are as skillfully played as this. And with ""Wind River"" Sheridan's personal artistry mission to do some effort to right the wrongs that the system has committed against the Native Americans, continues.The story is about a rookie FBI agent (Elizabeth Olsen) who teams up with a tracker/hunter (Jeremy Renner) with a tragic past in order to investigate the murder of a local girl on a remote Native American Reservation.Sheridan has tackled themes surrounding the Native Americans before but with this latest one, it's not so much that he's preaching about it but he ties it into this entire fabric of community where you sense the clash between outsiders and locals, between whites and natives, so there's a level of frustration about that arises from this murder investigation that brings up all kinds of cultural suspicions, on top of which there's also a game of jurisdictions. It's a complex yet cleverly woven thriller that starts out as a whodunit and evolves into a thirst for retribution. And the fact that it's set in a very cold harsh environment just adds to the film's chilling effect.In many ways, Elizabeth Olsen performs here like Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling where at some points you kinda know that Olsen's character may be out of her elements, but at the same time that factor actually gives her a good vantage point. Jeremy Renner plays his character like an old timer western hero who knows the ins and outs of everything, a man of few words but gets tough when needed. Their dynamic is not some kind of odd couple cop duo, this is more like each of them trying to prove themselves while bringing justice to the family of the unfortunate girl. And the way Sheridan crafts the mystery from a small radius to a much larger scheme is one that will have you hooked. ""Wind River"" is highly suspenseful, it's a perfect thriller.-- Rama's Screen --",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Grim, slow-burn crime thriller marks Sheridan's directorial debut","Taylor Sheridan's achievement in this film lies in his success in crafting an old school crime drama that doesn't try to re-invent the wheel but instead relies on good old-fashioned storytelling. Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen are both exceptional as a dissimilar pair who out of sheer happenstance form an alliance to solve the mystery of a young woman's brutal death on an Indian reservation. Renner is a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service tracker. Olsen is an FBI agent sent on an assignment very much alone.The narrative remains low-key but gradually builds toward its gripping conclusion. We come to learn quite a lot about Renner's character through his backstory. He's quite understated and effective in this role. Olsen enters the picture as an outsider to the bleak region of despair that the American wilderness is portrayed as here. She must learn quickly in order to do her job or leave a possible crime completely unsolved.Because this film deals with life on an Indian reservation, much of the social and economic woes might seem unfamiliar at first, but the film does a good job of providing a snapshot of the hardship that pervades in this part of the country and the difficulty that law enforcement has in conducting even a workmanlike investigation. Sheridan depicts a world that is sympathetic and troubled at the same time, masking its tears with courage and doggedness. Recommended to everyone.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"""You are looking for clues, but you are missing all the signs""","""Wind River"" (2017 release; 107 min.) brings the story of Wildlife Officer Cory Lambert. As the movie opens, reminding us ""Inspired By Actual Events"", we briefly see a woman running for her life in the snow. We then are introduced to Lambert, who is hunting down wolves. Lambert visits his ex, where he picks up his young son for the day. Lambert then visits the parents of his ex, as their life stock has been attacked, possibly by a lion. In the course of starting his investigation, Lambert finds the frozen body of the woman we saw running for her life. Because it looks like a possible homicide, an FBI agent is called. At this point we're 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie marks the second directing stint of highly praised writer (and erstwhile actor) Taylor Sheridan, whose previous two movies, 2015's ""Sicario"" and last year's ""Hell or High Water"", were among the top movie of the year for me. ""Wind River"" is for me one of the most anticipated movies of the year, period. With ""Wind River"", Sheridan goes in a very different direction again as compared to ""Sicario"" and ""Hell or High Water"", digging into a murder mystery, set in an Indian reservation in snow-covered Wyoming. Jeremy Renner brings perhaps his finest performance of his career as the Wildlife hunter/tracer Cory Lambert, who himself carries a heavy secret. Elizabeth Olsen is Jane Banner, the wide-eyed inexperienced FBI agent who is in way over her head but is determined to do what is right. ""You are looking for clues but you are missing all the signs"", remarks Lambert early on, and she begs him to help her. And there are plenty of potential suspects--it's not a coincidence that this is set in a community that has more than its share of crime and misery. Sheridan leads with confidence as the tension in the movie rarely lets up. Bottom line: this is another nice movie from Tayalor Sheridan, who in just a matter of a few years has become one of Hollywood most accomplished writer-directors. Can't wait for his next movie, ""Soldado"", a sequel to ""Sicario"", to be released next year.""Wind River"" opened this weekend at my local art house theater here in Cincinnati on not one, but two screens, a rarity. The Saturday matinée screening where I saw this at was attended very nicely for a matinée. I imagine that ""Wind River"" will benefit from the strong word-of-mouth that this will surely generate. If you are in the mood for a top-notch mystery drama with some stellar performances, you cannot go wrong with ""Wind River"" be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. ""Wind River"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Heat to the Cold Sheridan's fantastic crime thrillers work beyond change in weather,"After the southern heat of Hell or High Water, Taylor Sheridan gives us the cold wintery thriller Wind River.In the frosty Wind River Indian Reservation of Wyoming, the body an 18 year old Native American girl is discovered by Wildlife service agent Cory Lambett (Jeremy Renner). Lambett with his knowledge of the mountain assists foreign FBI agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olson) to track down the killer, but also his own personal reasons wants to find the killer in an attempt to wrestle his own demons.Inspired by true cases of missing native American girls, Wind River has cold hearted passion in its story-telling. A very melancholy murder mystery drama exploring grief and vengeance but also the neglect of the Native Americans in the mountain regions in the USA.During a time this week while I was pondering the significance of different crime thrillers, with also the approach of the The Snowman in November, Wind River is real important stand out. The film itself although is about a murder is more centred on the atmosphere and location. Repetitive vibes of a hellish land resonate throughout the film. This mostly breathed life by the chilly aerial shots of the cold mountain land, identifying misery through the snow breeze and wind (an atmospheric format that was similar expressed in Hell or High Water). The most haunting aspect is the character brought to Wind River by Nick Cave and Warren Elis eerie soundtrack, echoing the dark past of the freezing land.What leads us into the desolate mystery of Wind River is Jeremey Renner superb performance as the experienced hunter possessed by the past but also enriched with perception of his home land and its welcome. Renner very much appears as himself, however is a perfect casting choice with his neutral expression hiding his deeper emotions. Opposite is Elizabeth Olson, the most convincing FBI agent I've seen on screen for a while. But her city slicker style does not prepare her for the divergent law enforcement experience in the isolated Wyoming. These two leads are the perfect casting, with a enigmatic presence that makes you completely believe in them.While Wind River has deeper meaning at its centre, Sheridan knows how to thrill his audience in quiet sensational but violent sequences. Loud sound effects of the gun shots bring light to the silent landscape that the characters dwell, and present a sense of realism to the experience.Sheridan's third feature in his trilogy of modern American law enforcement, following, Sicario, Hell or High Water, has shown his strength in creating masterful crime thrillers with much to reflect about the real world. This capacity has also lead stronger confidence his potential prospects in directing a Bond film. 9.2/10",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Absorbing & Atmospheric!,"Written & Directed by Taylor Sheridan, 'Wind River' is an absorbing & atmospheric Neo-Western Murder-Mystery Thriller Film, that works due to its strong making & solid performances. It may not be perfect, but it weighs higher on pluses way more than on minuses.'Wind River' Synopsis: A veteran tracker with the Fish and Wildlife Service helps to investigate the murder of a young Native American woman, and uses the case as a means of seeking redemption for an earlier act of irresponsibility which ended in tragedy.'Wind River' grippingly unfolds a brutal murder & how the people in charge get to the culprits. Cory Lambert, the protagonist (Jeremy Renner) is a man who's dealing with his own demons & gets a shot at redemption when this brutal murder occurs. The lady in command, Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen) is a complete contrast to Cory, a rookie FBI special agent, who teams up with a man who's confronting way too many battles to get into another. And its the diversity & the connection of these 2 characters that make 'Wind River' all the more interesting. And Taylor Sheridan's Screenplay intelligently intertwines the extreme gap of its leading characters in a world of brutality & crime. The Writing builds up slowly, but never loses the momentum. What works more so for the Writing is the consistently serious tone, that never changes gear for the sake of cheap thrills.Sheridan's Direction, too, is competent. Ben Richardson's Cinematography stunningly captures the wilderness as well as the brutality. Gary D. Roach's Editing is sharp. Art & Costume Design are authentic. Action-Sequences are nicely choreographed, but are too violent.Performance-Wise: Renner & Olsen do some of their best work here. Renner, a splendid actor, portrays the guilt-sickened protagonist with genuine heartache & also flexes machismo when required. Olsen is beautifully restrained & proves her mettle as a performer. Others lend remarkable support.On the whole, 'Wind River' is moody, chilling & engrossing. Don't miss this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Well Directed, Beautifully Shot, And Quality Acting!","When actors decide they want to make the transition to the other side of the camera and direct films, it can be a dicey proposition. It makes me even more nervous when said actor to director decides they don't have the acting out of their system and want to keep acting, but with ""Wind River,"" Taylor Sheridan (best known for ""Sons of Anarchy,"" but also the writer of both ""Sicario"" and ""Hell or High Water"" with this completing his American Frontier Trilogy) separates himself in order to focus on directing a wonderful based-on-a-true-story tale.Jeremy Renner plays Cory Lambert, a tracker who works for the Fish and Game Commission in Wyoming who gets caught up in the investigation of the murder of a young Native American woman on a local reservation during a series of brutal snowstorms. He partners with FBI agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen) as they try to navigate the elements and even the law as it pertains to the reservation itself and a very thin law enforcement department headed up by Gen (Graham Greene).I know there is not much to the above summary, but that is all you really need to know about this film, besides the fact that I REALLY enjoyed it as one can do with the material involved. Make no mistake: this is a dark film that deals with very haunting subject matter, so there is quite a bit of weight to it, but Sheridan treats this story with the highest level of respect by allowing his very well written script to drive it while still shooting it beautifully. To see such beautiful landscaping (actually shot in Utah) take my breath away while still understanding the danger of what the elements bring from the wildlife to the weather and even the inhabitants add a great layer to the story, but what takes it to the next level is the score from Nick Cave and Warren Ellis (not THAT Warren Ellis) that frames each and every scene perfectly without giving what is coming up ahead.From a performance standpoint, I really dug the way that both Renner and Olsen dialed it WAY back within their characters with Renner keeping Lambert simple and focused on the task at hand and Olsen showing how Banner is just trying to do the right thing while attempting to understand the situation she in AND asserting the authority she has representing the Bureau. Greene gives great balance and levity to their dynamic while keeping his character involved as a reminder of the heightened sensitivity of their situation.The Weinsteins' eye for film strikes again here, and I am also looking forward to where Sheridan's career behind the camera goes as well. For this being the second time he has helmed a film, this is incredibly impressive and should at least be on your ""need to check out"" list if not all the way to ""must see"".",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
What a Start For Taylor Sheridan,"Crime dramas have always been one of my favorite genres of filmmaking, especially the ones that take themselves seriously and pose interesting questions about life. Wind River takes the genre up in the cold, snowy tundra of the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming. Gritty, brutal, and well-timed action, Wind River builds a simply structured crime film into an important conversation about missing persons with a great storyteller and one great cast.Coming from writing the likes of Sicario and Hell or High Water, Taylor Sheridan is really making a career for himself. It's hard to imagine it's the same guy who made those short acting cameos in Veronica Mars back in the day, but Sheridan is separating himself from the pack in terms of his writing skills. I won't say that Wind River reaches the heights that either of his other two writing efforts did, but the sheer power of the subject matter of this film may take this film into Oscar season.Jeremy Renner stars as Corey Lambert, a man with a tragic past, teams with Jane Banner (an FBI agent played by Elizabeth Olsen) to solve a murder. It's easy to label Banner as the ""out of place woman who needs the help of a hardened man"", because it can appear that way at first glance. But I'll view it as two people who cross paths with each other and end up working together to better their current situations. It also doesn't hurt that both Renner and Olsen have pre- established chemistry from the Marvel films, and dynamite together on screen.However, I do believe that Sheridan could have done a slightly better job of directing the tone of Wind River. There were times where it seemed the actors were giving endearing performances and monologues, only to be sometimes interrupted by a subtle joke or a lighthearted comment. I think that just a minor change in direction of his actors would have changed those moments for the better. With that said, Sheridan's brutal touch of action when the film calls for it is impressive to say the least. It's those moments that helps put a realistic layer to Wind River.Overall, Wind River is a grounded but moving take on murder, rape, and missing persons cases. Solid performances, sharp script, and nuanced storytelling, Wind River is a fascinating crime drama.8.0/10",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Dances with the Wind,"Jeremy Renner is cool as f***, but that's nothing new. Wind River got good acting and fantastic pictures of raw nature but what it lacks is imo a suspenseful and captivating story, so I wouldn't call Wind River a thriller or a crime/detective story but more kind of drama about loss and being lost spiced up with some hunting and shooting.Not bad, not exceptional, but okay, thanks to the good acting and the great supporting act called nature.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Cements Sheridan as a director to watch,"If you weren't already aware going into Wind River of just who is the brains behind this tough, tense and distinctly masculine drama, then it won't take very long for you to guess that it is Taylor Sheridan, the so-hot-right-now scribe behind the likes of Sicario and Hell or High Water. Rounding off his trilogy based around the American frontier, Sheridan directs for the first time here, and proves to be as equally adept with bringing his work to life as he is with penning it. To dub him the new Cormac McCarthy may be slightly condescending to the talented writer, but the comparisons are certainly there to be made. This is the world of tough, lean men doing what they have to do in order to survive or get by in their increasingly dire economic surroundings, and it's certainly a setting Sheridan feels comfortable in, or at least wishes he was part of.While Sicario placed us in the terrifying, claustrophobic choke-hold of the Mexican drug cartels and Hell or High Water delivered outlaw hi-jinks with serious social and economic undertones, Wind River is a movie of quiet, simmering tension played out against the backdrop of the freezing, desolate mountains of Wyoming. Hard times have come to the titular Indian Reservation and the surrounding areas, but so little apparently occurs here that a police force of over 6 officers is trusted with covering an area the size of a large city. When a young Native American girl (Kelsey Asbille) is found barefoot and dead in the snow 5 miles from the nearest residence, the minuscule department find themselves clearly ill-equipped for the investigation. The girl died from suffocating on the blood in her lungs, brought on by the sub- zero temperature, but she has also been raped. The man who found her, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agent Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner), uses his knowledge and experience as a hunter to start making connections.Renner has spent so many years in superhero costumes or starring in forgettable, little-seen box-office under-performers that it's easy to forget just how he made the jump from supporting character actor to leading man material. In movies like The Hurt Locker and The Town, he demonstrated an uncanny skill at playing introverted characters emotionally scarred by past experiences. Yes, he was an outright psychopath in Ben Affleck's thrilling The Town, but it always felt like he was masking something deeper. Lambert is living with his own trauma. He pays visits to his Native American ex-wife to see his son, but their separation was clearly brought on by tragedy. In a moving monologue to the father of the murdered girl (a marvellous Gil Birmingham), he reveals through choked-back tears that his daughter had passed years earlier. It's quite possibly the best work he's ever done; utterly convincing as the strong, silent hunter who can spot a snowmobile track from a mile away, and as a potential romantic interest for FBI agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen).She is sent from her office in Las Vegas, and arrives completely ill-prepared for the brutal conditions of Wind River. When she quickly realises she's out of her depth, Banner leans on Lambert to help her navigate the perilous conditions and vast landscape. It's a character seen many times before - even in Sicario - and although Olsen is perfectly fine, her role seems somewhat diminutive and over-reliant on her male counterpart. It's an issue Sheridan should perhaps address in his next venture, but Wind River proves that he is more than capable of visualising his own work. He shoots the wilderness as a cold, unforgiving place, where only the toughest - humans or animals - can survive, turning them wilder and more primitive in the process. The score by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis also give the land a mystic ambiance, similar in many ways to their work on The Proposition. Although it does digress into Quentin Tarantino territory and the final pay-off seems over-eager to highlight good from bad, Wind River deserves some recognition come awards season, as does Sheridan as a director to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

More than well worth tracking down,"Having been responsible for writing 'Sicario', directed by Denis Villeneuve, and 'Hell or High Water', directed by David McKenzie, Taylor Sheridan's directorial debut 'Wind River' was seen with great interest and high expectations. Mainly to see how Sheridan would fare as a director, showing himself as a great writer for those two mentioned films.And what a directorial debut 'Wind River' is. Sheridan proves himself to be the completely right director for the job and be as good a director as he is a writer, handling the tension, disturbing creepiness and pathos with a near-perfect balance and despite being a slow-burner 'Wind River' is mostly compelling and rarely dull. There have been a number of directorial debuts this year, Sheridan's to me is one of the best in one of the stronger films released so far this year.'Wind River' does have a couple of drawbacks. It does drag at times in the middle act as a result of being bogged down by having a little too much talk, and the philosophical elements are a little patronisingly heavy-handed. On the most part however, 'Wind River' is impeccably made, directed and acted, highly atmospheric and well balanced in tone. Of the films seen so far of all the films released last week in my country, 'Wind River' is in the top four along with 'God's Own Country', 'The Farthest' and 'IT'.Visually, 'Wind River' is impeccable. The scenery is stunning yet atmospherically desolate, accompanied by some of the most beautiful cinematography of the year so far. The music score is suitably haunting but not in an overt way.Despite being imperfect, occasionally being a little too talky and not faring so well in the philosophising, the script is intelligent, thought-provoking and understated. The story has suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and at times chillingly disturbing while also being an effective slow-burner and rich in atmosphere. It does get off to a great start, still engages but meanders slightly in the pacing in the middle and then goes with all guns blazing in an electrifying climax.Characters are well realised and interesting, while the acting is superb. Jeremy Renner gives one of his greatest performances in a role that stretches him but he shows no signs of being challenged. Elizabeth Olsen has also never been better, being responsible for one of the most convincing portrayals of an FBI agent since Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling in 'The Silence of the Lambs'. The supporting cast are more than up to their level, especially a heart-breaking Gil Birmingham.In conclusion, 'Wind River' is more than well worth tracking down, for those who loves this sort of film it's a must albeit it won't work for anybody. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Taylor Sheridan has done it again,"I was lucky enough to see this at the Nantucket Film Festival back in June and I thought it was excellent.

The movie ended up coming in second at the festival, right behind behind The Big Sick.I enjoyed it as much as, if not more than, Hell or High Water. Definitely more than Sicario.The scenery, the score, the dialogue and the acting were all on point. Some of Jeremy Renner's best work.

You really have to listen close and be prepared to rewind often. My wife and I were constantly asking each other, what did he say? One demerit for that. One other item that makes for more exciting scenes is they way a rifle shot will throw the bad guy across the room like a mule kick. It doesn't work that way, I would prefer accuracy.

But don't expect anything flashy or great happening ... well not the whole time.The pacing is key, so when something happens it appears bigger. Be it a chase or a possible stunt/action scene. This is about unraveling a story and finding the truth - but more about a certain seed that is planted that will get exploited later on in the movie.

Taylor Sheridan depicts another dilapidated region of America,"If you've seen any of Taylor Sheridan's previous work, you probably noted that he has a certain style. He tells stories about ways of life in dilapidated regions of the country. He blurs the lines between ""good guys"" and ""bad guys,"" instead framing the status of the selected region as the truest villain. What's right and wrong, considering all the unique variables of each story, is not always clear. At least, that was case in Sicario and Hell or High Water.In Wind River, the region is still presented with all the strain that is causes on the lives of its residents, but a much more obvious villain is revealed before the movie is over.Hell of High Water frames the crumbling economy of a certain Texas region as the real source of evil, rather than any characters. Whereas in Wind River the source of evil is definitely the rapist. I mean, the rapist attempts to blame the cold and silence, but his actions were clearly much worse than bad weather.Sheridan's previous films also left doubt about who were the heroes, who the audience should be rooting for. This time it was much less ambiguous—they were the people searching for the rapist.An emerging theme in Sheridan's movies appears to be Tarantinoesque eruptions of violence, sometimes near the conclusion. They don't always reach the levels of the Django Unchained shootout, but Sheridan clearly isn't shy about showcasing the unforgiving damage that can be inflicted by firearms.Complaints, I have a few. On more than one occasion, I legitimately could not understand what a character had said, so I was left wondering if I missed something important. I'm not sure if this manner of speaking was a choice made by the actors or if this was a decision made by Sheridan to establish a certain tone. Either way, I could have used less mumbling.The other complaint that I have, and this is more serious, the middle third of the movie felt like it contained a lot of empty moments. This may or may not have been related to the times that I couldn't understand what a character said. Still, the movie could have used a bit of its fat trimmed. It wasn't as crisp and clean as Hell or High Water and Sicario. And I know I keep comparing this movie to Sheridan's others, but that's bound to happen when a writer sets the bar so high with two gems.On the whole, I consider this a success for Sheridan in his directorial debut. I'd happily watch another story of his about justice and an overlooked culture.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Its good - but VERY clichéd under its veil of self-importance,"Wind River almost suffocates under the weight of its self-importance - characters mumbling, most lines being a little over-cooked in their meaning, characters seeming a bit too contrived and self- conscious, a context that keeps throwing its metaphor at you.But once you cut through all that, you'll find a very clichéd, often sexist genre film complete with a moody, understated male hero, a rookie female FBI agent who basically looks pretty and needs rescuing, a couple of action scenes that feel a bit like random missions from GTAV (with plenty of characters that you have only just met getting arbitrarily killed).The main flaw of the film for me is the presence of a flash-back which ultimately shouldn't be necessary, but seems completely relied upon for audience satisfaction when it comes to a villain's denouement. The villains here have no depth or causality, they exist simply as villains to further the story, but perhaps that's where the unfair treatment of native Americans comes in again.Its good - worth seeing even - but if you've seen The Grey (Neeson's character specifically), Insomnia and The Valley of Elah, your recognition neurons will be fairly active.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The reveal towards the end is satisfyingly on the money, and it tugs at the emotional strings to see very believable and well acted grief on the part of the family that suffered the loss.

A Gripping Yet Sometimes Slow-Burning Thriller,"Wind River is a tense, atmospheric thriller set against the stark, frozen landscapes of Wyoming, where a U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service tracker, Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner), teams up with an FBI agent, Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen), to investigate the murder of a young Native American woman. Written and directed by Taylor Sheridan, the film touches on themes of loss, justice, and the harsh realities of life in isolated, often forgotten communities.The film's strength lies in its atmosphere and setting. The desolate, snow-covered terrain of the Wind River Reservation creates a chilling, almost oppressive backdrop for the story, and Sheridan's direction captures the bleakness of both the environment and the characters' lives. The coldness of the setting mirrors the emotional isolation and quiet desperation of those living on the reservation, and it's in these moments of stillness that the film shines.Jeremy Renner gives a solid performance as Cory, a man haunted by the loss of his own daughter, and his grief is palpable throughout the film. Renner's subtle, restrained portrayal of a man who has been hardened by trauma is one of the film's highlights. Elizabeth Olsen, as the inexperienced FBI agent Jane, offers a more conventional performance, but she does well to serve as a counterpoint to Renner's more stoic character. Their dynamic works, with Renner's quiet authority and Olsen's determined but vulnerable agent complementing each other effectively.Where Wind River falters, however, is in its pacing. While the film is undeniably engaging in parts, especially during the investigation's most intense moments, there are stretches where the story feels a bit slow or even predictable. Some viewers may find the deliberately sparse dialogue and moments of reflection to be powerful, while others might view them as dragging the narrative. The film builds toward a violent and emotionally charged climax, but the journey to get there can feel somewhat meandering at times.Thematically, Wind River tackles serious issues such as the systemic neglect of Indigenous communities, violence against Native women, and the burden of grief, but it often feels like it's trying to address too many heavy topics without fully diving into any one of them. It's a film that deals with the weight of personal loss and societal injustice, but at times, its exploration of these themes lacks the depth it needs to make a truly lasting impact.Ultimately, Wind River is a gripping film with a strong sense of place and well-executed suspense. While it doesn't always live up to its potential, it remains an effective thriller with memorable performances, particularly from Renner. It's a slow burn that rewards patient viewers, but the pacing and occasional predictability prevent it from being a fully realized masterpiece. It's worth watching for fans of atmospheric crime dramas, but it doesn't quite achieve the emotional or narrative resonance that some may hope for.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Emotional, brutal, real and important Wind River is one of the best of the year","After writing phenomenal scripts of Sicario and Hell or High Water Taylor Sheridan's new directorial venture is as powerful if not better. Sheridan's films follow people and lives of people that are forgotten by the whole world. Even though we are not used to this kind of life the compelling characters feels so real that the negligence of the world over these lives hit you real hard.

brutal crime drama,"Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner) is a hunter working for Fish and Wildlife Service. He is brought in to Wind River Reservation to hunt down an animal in the mountains of Wyoming and discovers the frozen body of a dead local girl. Ben (Graham Greene) is the tribal police chief. New FBI agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen) arrives to investigate the case. She faces jurisdictional conflicts and cultural intransigence.This is very much in the tradition of In Cold Blood. The characters are well-drawn. There is a sense of place. The violence is brutal. The shootouts are shocking, abrupt, visceral, and intense. There isn't much of a mystery. It's more about a straight forward investigation. The scene with Cory confessing his lost to Jane is something different. Although I appreciated it, Jane getting the information from his wife would be more compelling in the traditional sense. Jane would know something about Cory without him knowing about it. When the perp is on the run and sees the porcupine, I fully expected the mountain lion to jump him from behind. There is a poetry to what Cory does to him. This is a brutal and effective crime drama.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Grim and sad, but WELL worth watching.","I was excited to see this film, because writer/director Sheridan did one of my favorites from last year, HELL OR HIGH WATER. That film featured a great script, tight direction, a well-cast team doing some of their best work, great cinematograpy and a tone that kept things serious, but somehow still full of lightness and energy.WIND RIVER does many of the same things, but the sense of lightness to cut through the darkness is missing almost completely. It's a grim and sad story, with only a few moments of humor. It's still a very good movie and I recommend it...but lightning didn't strike twice either. It's a bit more SICARIO (which was also Sheridan...a tight, well-crafted film that didn't move my heart) than HELL OR...Set in some of the bleakest, coldest reservation land in Wyoming, WIND RIVER tells of the story of the seeming murder of a young woman from the reservation, who froze to death in the middle of nowhere while clearly on the run from something. Jeremy Renner, who works for the Wildlife Department as a hunter, finds the body. He knows the young lady, who was best friends with his daughter, who has been dead 3 years herself. Thus Renner, who is our main protagonist, is a man full of sadness...and thus the film is infused with sadness. The FBI sends in its nearest agent to just take a look around and see if there's anything there for them to work on, and of course, it's ""rookie"" Elizabeth Olsen, who is eager to work the case but doesn't have a great sense of the society and the land she's ended up in. Most of the chuckles in the film come from her ""fish out of water"" character...the jokes are often a bit obvious, although well played.Secrets and more secrets are uncovered....but when we get to the truth of the matter, it's a far more ugly, unattractive and sad truth than we might have imagined. The final scenes of the movie are crazy, with horrible explosions of violence and a startling flashback that lays the truth bare.The plot of the film isn't actually too complex. What gives the film heft and seriousness is more the characters, the society and the land. The snowcovered landscape is very well captured and the sense of cold really permeates the film. Most of the characters are good, solid but flawed people...just trying to do the right thing and to live up to what they think their responsibilities to the world and each other are. But there are enough bad folks around who either by design or by character do everything they can to make the lives of ""decent"" people depressing and dangerous.It's a pretty gripping film, and while grim, it's not as bluntly cynical as SICARIO was. There are glimmers of hope for the characters...even when it's clear that the place they live will never allow them to truly blossom. Renner gives a good, solid performance...perhaps not quite Oscar caliber, but convincingly done. The always welcome Graham Greene is on hand as a local law enforcement official, and I have always loved his line delivery. Just the right mixture of dryness and humanity. Gil Birmingham, who was SO good as Jeff Bridges's partner in HELL OR..., excels in a smaller role. And Elizabeth Olsen does all she can with a somewhat cliched and predictable role. We've seen this character (the inexperienced, FEMALE law officer) many times before...but she gives it her all and manages to find some nuances we haven't quite seen before. She's always been an engaging actor.So WIND RIVER, while not an ""enjoyable"" entertainment, is more than worth your time. Taylor Sheridan is CLEARLY a major talent to be reckoned with...a great, AMERICAN voice, with the kind of attention to detail and the land and to characters as Jeff Nichols (MUD).",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Excellent,"While Wind River is on its surface a murder mystery/police procedural, it transcends these things due to an excellent tight script, first-rate performances, starkly beautiful visuals, and an approach that does not given in to worn out Hollywood tropes.

Elizabeth Olsen never once plays the vulnerable female card, and manages the tough cop role without falling into silly heroics or unrealistic butchdom. Of course, Graham Greene is the consummate pro. The story remains adult, and never falls prey to the super-imposed romance one might expect. All in all, an excellent motion picture by director Taylor Sheridan.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Mostly good.  It has some big flaws.,This movie should have been great.. It had potential to really be a great film. The Jeremy Renner character was great.. He really pulled it off nicely.. The Elizabeth Olsen character wasn't nearly as believable.. but OK. I don't see how it got the high marks it did. But I only have one opinion.There were some really stupid executions in the story telling.. I rolled my eyes a few times at some of the scenes.. Ridiculous stuff.And then there was the lazy film-making style of going hand-held with the camera. There are scenes in this film that are almost unwatchable because of the hand-held camera jitter. I understand at times it adds to excitement - ala the street scenes of The French Connection.. But this film wasn't using hand-held to add to action. Clearly most of the hand-held was done to make the film easier to make. There were even jittery hand-held scenes of two people having a conversation in a living room..Un-necessary and really takes away from the film. I am glad I only paid a couple of bucks to see the movie.. if I had paid full price I probably would not have felt like it was worth it..,6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"good, bad and snow","Greetings again from the darkness. With his two most recent screenplays, Sicario (2015) and the Oscar nominated Hell or High Water (2016), Taylor Sheridan seemed acutely attuned to the fine line between right and wrong, and the twisted complexity of new age American values when contrasted with ""old school"". This time out, he both writes and directs. The themes remain familiar while the landscape shifts to the frozen tundra of Wyoming.We first meet Fish & Wildlife Service tracker/hunter Cory (Jeremy Renner) as he picks off (with a long range rifle) a pack of wolves that is methodically encircling goats on a ranch. A very similar type situation plays out later in the film  only with humans in place of wolves and sheep. Not long after dispensing with the wolves, Cory stumbles upon the barefoot corpse of a young girl he recognizes as the former best friend of his daughter. Her frost-bitten bare feet visible, face buried in the snow, bleeding from an apparent assault, and miles from the nearest house or dwelling, the girl's corpse is telling a story that Cory knows requires the immediate attention of law enforcement.Ben, the Native American Reservation Police Chief (Graham Greene) has jurisdiction unless the Medical Examiner rules it a homicide. In the meantime, FBI Agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen) shows up dressed more for winter in her native Florida than the brutally cold Wyoming plains. Jane quickly proves she is no ordinary ""fish out of water"" (even if she lacks experience for such a case), and commissions Cory to help her out with the local people and land.The film has many ties to the fine TV series ""Longmire"", and though Mr. Renner and Ms. Olsen are well known in the Marvel Universe as Hawkeye and Scarlet Witch, there are no superheroes present here – just a convoluted society within a seemingly forgotten (or at least) ignored part of the country. It's a police procedural blanketed in the always-falling snow, an underground drug culture, and the quiet animosity between the outside world and the Reservation (where many have given up hope).These aren't people that talk much, although they say plenty. Sometimes the dialogue is a bit too obvious in Mr. Sheridan's goal of leaving no viewer behind, especially when combined with overly detailed flashback that will have the amateur sleuths in the audience feeling a bit letdown in receiving a full explanation. However, when cinematographer Ben Richardson (Beasts of the Southern Wild, The Fault in Our Stars) loses the shaky-cam from indoors, and beautifully lays out the vastness of the snow vistas, forest and mountains, the remoteness and stunning landscape becomes a character as important as any other.The supporting cast is stellar and features Julia Jones, Gil Birmingham (Jeff Bridges' partner in Hell or High Water), Jon Bernthal, Kelsey Asbille, and a crazed James Jordan. Mr. Greene adds a touch of deadpan humor and resignation to his plight, while Ms. Olsen is effective as the 'green' agent dealing with an unfamiliar white-out. Mr. Renner truly excels as the throwback cowboy carrying out his duties while bearing a burden exacerbated by this case. The crunching snow, predatory lions, and high-speed snowmobiling never cause us (or Cory) to lose sight of how important it is to know the land and the people  and walk that line between right and wrong.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Overrated,"I liked Wind River but, I think people are overrating it. The acting is really good, the writing is good. The weakness of this movie is the plot/story/pacing. Not much happens through out the whole movie. After I had finished this movie my first thought was ""that's it?."" I was left unsatisfied and I think this had to do with the pacing. This movie was 1 hour and 40 minutes and they could have condensed what happened in that 1 hour and 40 minutes probably down to 45 minutes. It's a good movie, it's just not a great movie. 7/10 stars.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Grim, generic thriller","Atmospheric, capable thriller but feels shopworn and its production marred by TV-style shot selection and editing. Story of Indian reservation killing is chock-a-block with grim and squalid images we've seen in other stories with same old Hollywood virtue-signaling about awful white man's depredations. Two leads are adequate but nothing remarkable in the writing to lift or distinguish their characters. We've seen it before. Hunter/tracker Renner offers awkward exposition speech about his family tragedy (we know its coming, and it does not come seamlessly for the story). Scenes of brutality are fairly predictable, and so are the antagonists. For great take on murder on Indian reservation story check out Thunderheart.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"the best movie of its kind since Insomnia: a snow-bound tale of murder, dread and existential horrors","With Wind River, I'll get a nitpick out of the way first, There's in Wind River a mournful score (by none other than Nick Cave with Warren Ellis), and it gives scenes that would otherwise have a stock tone to them a sense of tragedy that isn't laying it on thick but is there and one you can feel in your bones, like being out there in the sort of cold that would give Marquis Warren in Hateful Eight some pause. The nitpick is with the voice in the score, this whispery male voice that is saying things as Jeremy Renner trudges through the snow or a character goes through a mysterious part of the woods. What is that? Why is he doing that? I feel like a grump for even bringing it up, but it took me out of the movie.OK, what is this movie? Wind River is another Taylor Sheridan script, a man who has cut a' real figure in recent cinema making violent, brutal films with the sort of brutality that is about how people can be just awful creatures, and we all know it but somehow get subsumed in it. Wind River probably shares more of a kinship with Sicario, Sheridan's first produced script (here he directs for the first time), as it's almost as much about the setting and how it contributes to the discomfort.Actually both movies also have a woman who *is* already a tough cookie and can do her job well (to the point where one should feel foolish even trying to equate her to a man, as if she's not good enough, and both Blunt and Olsen make these women such), while around men who have been shaped by the world around them... Come to think of it, there's also a male protagonist who has lost his family and has transformed him over time into something much harder. I could probably go on and on with the comparisons, including the unforgiving nature of the whole culture.But while del Toro in Sicario was lost forever to his darkness, Renner's Cory is someone who still does have family - we see him with his son, still doing his best, though separated from his wife now (why this is is... one of those movie things, I can buy it, more due to the mother's pain as they both lost a daughter to some tragic circumstances) - and he has another job as a tracker. But that pain is always there, and internalized in a different way. He can be scary, but it's not in his immediate nature; he is a good person, but has been shaped by so much around him and has had to adapt. The girl in the middle of the plot of this story who is found dead, frozen, miles from the nearest place she could have been from (it's the sort of mystery that really isn't, and we know that, and it makes it sadder), has a father and of course he is devastated. When Cory offers up his consolation, it's genuine, and how Sheridan writes in and Renner plays it has all of the pain but grudging knowledge of what comes with... time.Like Pine in 'High Water' last year, it's easy to take certain actors for granted - it's been a long time (maybe since The Hurt Locker? probably not Bourne Legacy I'd bet) that Renner has had any character to play that's challenged him, much less as a lead, and he sinks his actory teeth into this completely. He has Olsen to play off of too, and she does well, but the framing is really from his point of view; some may find more identification with her, as the one who is not from such a place as Wyoming. I found myself totally in Renner's point of view, and it made it a richer experience because of how every moment has a simplicity and truth to it. One of the pleasures of seeing movies for, well, grown ups that Hollywood does(ish) in a genre is to see actors not just getting to but allowed to show all the complexity they're capable of. I'll remember those scenes where Renner gets to really shine as the awesome actor he is (i.e. when he tells about his daughter to Olsen), but it's the quieter scenes that are tougher and that he does so well.This isn't a pleasant experience inasmuch that you'll leave feeling elated or something. What makes Wind River stick out as being a very good film is that Sheridan isn't ostentatious about it. He has confidence in showing us all of this out-in-the-middle-of-nowhere-ness and we get it, and he even finds quality in those scenes with characters that are only there so briefly (Jon Bernthal does pop up, but I won't tell you when or what his role is, for example). My favorite is the dead girl's brother, who is about the same age as her and a waste of life drug addict. But Sheridan does the work, even in several minutes of screen time, to get us to understand who he is, why he's come to this place, and that he's not very sympathetic (Renner's Cory helps make this clear). I don't even remember the actor's name, and he'll stay with me for a long time with that scene in the car at night. Sheridan's setting may seem or just be obvious as was the Mexican one - heat is oppressive and so is the cold, and, as we see, it can kill if one is not careful - but he stays true to what he's after, and when he goes into the dark parts of the human experience, it feels earned. If he's not quite to where Villeneuve is yet, he will be soon.Just, you know, tell Nick Cave to cut out that voice s***.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
a lot will happen in a bleak setting,"Taylor Sheridan's ""Wind River"" is essentially two stories in one. The main plot is the murder investigated by Jeremy Renner's US Fish & Wildlife Service agent and Elizabeth Olsen's FBI agent. Since the murder has taken place on an Indian reservation - the Wind River Reservation referenced in the movie's title - the issue arises of whose responsibility it is to investigate. Renner and Olsen press forward with the investigation, and there's a lot to discover. The other plot is a focus on the status of people living on the reservation. The Indians are a minority in their own land, and are now relegated to dismal, isolated pieces of land with living conditions often comparable to the third world (not to mention high levels of alcoholism). Indeed, one of the movies addressed by the movie is the murders and disappearances of women on the reservations.I guess that my one complaint about the movie is Olsen's character. We get to learn about Renner's character's background, but not about hers. I would've liked to hear more about why she chose the field that she did. Other than that, I found it to be a fine movie. I recommend it, and I'm eager to see Sheridan's next movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Murder mystery thriller set in the winter wilderness of Wyoming,"This is a pretty standard crime thriller, with Jeremy Renner playing the role of a Native American hunter/tracker helping out a newbie FBI agent in the remote winter wilderness of Wyoming. What makes it unique is perhaps the emotional grieving experienced by the families involved as well as having a main character who is a tracker. The acting here is very strong, perhaps less so by Elizabeth Olsen, but she is stuck in the unlikely role of a new FBI agent who seems to have been given the job without any credentials or knowledge of how to solve a crime.

Cuddle up with a warm blanket and listen to the cold wind,"We are getting to that time of the year when the leaves fall of the trees and the days slowly get darker. This means that we're in the perfect mood for some thrillers to accompany you during these rainy days. ""Wind River"" is about a murder investigation and it finds a way to naturally blend the crime aspect with a slightly more dramatic and character centered story. What instantly helped immerse me into this movie was the showcase of the environment. We get to see snow- clad landscapes with mountains in the distance. Seeing the setting alone makes you wanna cuddle up in a blanket while you listen to the sound of the wind and look at Jeremy Renner wandering the woods with a rifle. The entire thing takes place in a small town during this cold winter. There aren't many people working for the police, so Elizabeth Olsen's FBI agent is sent to help figure out the case.I thought it unfolded in a perfectly decent way. Once you kind of hit the midpoint it gets even more interesting. And that's mostly because of the dialogue and occasional monologues which all felt so realistic that it was hard to believe it was scripted. I enjoyed the nice natural flow to them. Some might think it drags or gets away from the thriller aspect. But I began to care a lot more for this dramatic character side-plot. The fear is for things to go over-dramatic and I saw signs of things that could have gone way out of hand. But the movie stayed with its feet on the ground and that was good. Although there's one character who was on the borderline of being too overacted because it contrasted the naturalistic/realistic tone that was established earlier. It bothered me a little bit because he kind of felt like a one-dimensional villain figure. The final act gets some suspense and tension across, so it culminates in a way where you will be invested. Graham Greene always delivers with a nice subtle performance. Olsen and Renner both may have done their best acting in this movie. The word I'm gonna repeat again is realistic. Because that's exactly how it feels. My favorite parts were whenever it took place in the woods. The silence and the look of the white snow on the trees added so much intrigue. A simple mysterious mood piece like that can sometimes be just exactly what you need to prepare yourself for a thriller. It's a good one!

Why does every line of dialogue need to be a social commentary?,"Sure, this movie has some stuff going for it. The scenery is beautiful, cinematography is fine, Jeremy Renner is a likable guy, Elizabeth Olsen is pretty, and the local cop/sheriff (played by Graham Greene) is a believable character who acts like an actual human being. Too bad he's the only one. Wind River - even more so than Hell or High Water (written by the same guy) - is filled with dialogue where people talk in metaphors, where there's always a deeper meaning to what they say, in other words, it doesn't sound like normal, everyday people talking to each other. If they only did that in certain key moments, it would be fine, it could work if that's what the story demands. But when that's all you hear throughout the whole film, it becomes pretentious and irritating.Also, I'm tired of the notion that certain movies feel the need to hit you over the head with their social commentary. When the young female FBI agent arrives, everybody is surprised, obviously because they don't think a woman is fit for the job (aka sexism). When they arrive at the home of the native American family, the father asks the FBI agent: ""Why is it that whenever you people want to help us, you always insult us first?"" (Because that's what white people always do, I guess.) When the Indian boy, who sells drugs, gets caught and confronted by Jeremy Renner, the conversation is about him fighting against the whole world, and how Jeremy Renner shouldn't say ""we"", because the only native American thing about him is his wife. And if that's not enough lecturing for you, then wait for Elizabeth Olsen thanking Jeremy Renner for saving her life, and Renner replying by saying, ""you're a tough woman, you saved your own life"". Obviously the problem is not the idea of ""strong women"", but the fact that instead of making it a natural part of the story and the characters, the director decides to shove it down our throats through such clumsy, heavy- handed dialogue.There's a shoot-out scene towards the end of the movie, that I thought, was written and executed pretty poorly. First of all, at one point I couldn't even tell who's on whose side, and who gets shot by who. It felt like they tried to recreate the amazing border shoot-out scene from Sicario (also written by the same guy), only this time in the snow. The problem is that we don't know anything about most of the people who are in this scene, as they were just introduced two minutes earlier, but all of a sudden we're supposed care whether they live or die.Anyway, if you're a huge Jeremy Renner or Elizabeth Olsen fan, you might as well go and check it out, but be prepared, it's not a very good one.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Another good story by Taylor Sheridan.,"Taylor Sheridan wrote 3 really good stories in last three years(Sicario, Hell or High water), but this time he was also a director. His direction gave us something special in terms of making actors to do their best and show them where to give importance to specific scene or parts of dialogue.Jeremy Renner gave us a great performance, he really showed us his pain and ways to confront it. Chemistry between him and Elizabeth Olsen was pretty good. I was a little bit suspicious when i saw Gil Birmingham and Graham Greene duo from Twilight *hahah* but they were good in this movie especially Gils character Martin who had similar destiny as Jeremy character Cory and they have created a special bond and that parable was through the whole movie.Taylor realistically present us harsh life of people living in the north and all negative things that could happen to that people out there. Comparasion and rivalry between Native Americans and the settlers is one of the main object in this movie and showed that they must live and fight together if they want to survive.I liked this movie and i advice Taylor to direct his own stories because he knows best what is important in the movie and he can show actors how he imagine all the characters.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Excellent acting,So much better than Sicario. Renner plays a grieving father with much subtlety and the overall cast are outstanding. Particularly Gil Birmingham. A whodunit that unfolds in an understated way but is eventually gripping and moving. And has a sobering message re the absence of stats for missing Native American women. I highly recommend.,8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Jeremy Renner Excels as a Craftsman in the Lead Role --- including allowing the other actors to stand out on their own....,"It is hard to criticize this movie, with one caveat. We are still in that place where movies about First Nation people have to have white people in them as a principle focus. That said, the film is ""inspired"" by actual events, so this may very likely be the way it went down. The film explores the theme of missing and murdered indigenous women, and makes a direct comment about that still-neglected subject at the end. Jeremy Renner plays a fascinating character with huge emotional depth, awareness, respect and sensitivity. Renner's character's skillset is fully developed, and is critical to the film. The fact that he is alert and knowledgeable makes everything else work. I thought Elizabeth Olsen did fine, and the First Nation actors were outstanding --- and could very easily have been more developed than they were. While this film didn't really have to work so hard at building a white character in a First Nation setting, my esteem for Jeremy Renner has nonetheless bumped up a couple more notches. He is really deep and versatile, and in this case, he did not intrude on the space, despite being the film's leading actor. In fact, he had a knack for backing off, and allowing the other actors to shine in their respective roles --- a mark of a very fine craftsman. I'm not sure who else could have played the role if Renner had not been there. One more aspect --- there was no point at which suspension of belief was difficult. I was roped in from the very first minute, and the emphasis on Renner's role as a wildlife tracker was allegorically so much on the mark. That is, the film was about tracking both figuratively and literally, and the themes were intertwined almost perfectly, in my opinion. Kudos to all involved.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Effective and Devastating,"By being a purposefully paced and uncompromisingly bleak crime story, Wind River ends the summer movie season with a sudden, astonishing thud. Knowing that the film is written by Taylor Sheridan, who also wrote Sicario (2015) and Hell or High Water (2016), may prepare you insofar as themes and setting. But nothing will prepare you for Wind River's effective use of tension building and its devastating sense of justice.Wind River refers to the Wind River Indian Reservation, the final resting place of 18-year-old Natalie Hanson whose body is found frozen beyond a remote mountain ridge. The FBI sends rookie agent Jane Banner (Olsen) to investigate. She quickly finds herself beyond her depth and immediately deputizes FWS agent Cory Lambert (Renner) who not only has a good relationship with the Tribal Police, but also knows the wilderness like the back of his hand.The movie isn't so much a mystery whereby we're supposed to follow the clues and narrow down a pretty scant list of suspects. The film instead leads you by the nose from place to remote place; letting the landscape shape your sense of dread. In the words of Agent Lambert ""You're looking for clues, but you're missing all the signs."" And those signs come in the shape of pounding blizzards, dangerous wildlife and a destructive sense of isolation which threatens to cover the tracks of a grizzly crime.Wind River marks the last of Sheridan's Frontier Trilogy and the first in which he directs. By juxtaposing the foreboding splendor of the Rockies with painterly scenes of human misery at the ""Res"", Sheridan showcases his eye for innately human storytelling. Unlike Sicario, this tale of retribution approaches its subject matter with a sense of poetic justice and clarity of mind. And unlike Hell or High Water, Wind River equalizes the power dynamics of hero and villain via its environment. This isn't a movie where the hero succeeds based on luck or righteousness but by prepared they are.Elizabeth Olsen and Jeremy Renner prove themselves intensely capable actors, aptly taking advantage of a script that requires characterization through action. Olsen especially provides a sympathetic and active lead. She along with Graham Greene provide the few moments of mirth in a movie that would otherwise come across as starkly depressing. Renner's role can and should have probably gone to a more grizzled actor. Lambert as written follows the ebbs and flows of the story with quiet sadness and hard won horse sense. He pulls it all off, but not to the level that the role requires. Perhaps it was the joint image of seeing both Hawkeye and Scarlet Witch in the same movie that made me think ""youthful"". The man is 46 so he can hardly be blamed for being too young.Much of Wind River's other faults are small and can be attributed to inexperience more than anything. There are a few moments of awkward blocking and inappropriate moments of hand-held that neuter some of the film's calmer moments. Taylor Sheridan also defuses many moments of quiet with a soundtrack that should sound haunting but comes across more like its droning. Then there's the framing of the story within a socio-economic context. Rather than letting the story speak for itself, Sheridan adds unnecessary overtures at the beginning and end, cheapening the film's resolve.All is forgiven. The morally complex beats of the story and the force with which it hits you is evidence of something very much beyond. Wind River can comfortably be called a western but its potency sets itself apart. It's moody, gritty, understated and unassailably bleak. In a moment of practical wisdom Agent Lambert says, ""There's no sense going where a wolf could be, I rather hunt by going where he's been."" Wind River follows that wisdom to its logical end.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Well-written and directed with strong characterization in haunting outdoors,"Taylor Sheridan is really good at fleshing out sympathetic characters with a lot of depth in the personality, strong backstories and moral fortitude. This and his skills at shooting the wilderness, beautiful and desolate, where the characters are just everyday Greek heroes, acknowledging their temporary place to cope with their destinies.This has a lot to do with the natives' way of life, especially in the confines of a reservation and clearly most of the strength, density of Wind River stems from this setting (which is also the most subtle and sensitive story arc in the Yellowstone series) so it does not matter that much if the storyline happens to be weak if you are looking for a basic thriller.Clearly Wind River could have been excellent were it not for a couple of weak plot points. It just seems the inner stories of the various characters are more important than the lukewarm investigation itself.The only (really) bad thing here is the flashback sequence that was not necessary in my opinion. It feels like an over-explanatory bit in a very subtle and sensitive storytelling achievement. And worst of all it mostly serves as a justification for the perps. Violence only emphasizes the victims' point of view in finely carved-out ellipses.That being set aside I cannot wait for a Shoot to Kill kind of movie writtten and directed by Mr Taylor Sheridan.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

It earns the capacity to create lasting impressions through small bits of dialogue or short scenes that don't stick out at the time of experiencing them for the first time. A bit more memorable score could have pushed this movie a bit further to become a true gem.A strange and wonderful thing that this movie got made in 2017 from 11 million dollars with 2 high-profile actors from the MCU.

Magnificent Indeed,"Renner at the top of his craft, and Elizabeth Olson, about who I was concerned, was well cast as the green FBI agent, whose character comes through when the situation required it. Bernthal has a very small part. Graham Green and Gil Birmingham are perfect mixes of stoicism and Indian humor. The Utah (made to look like Wyoming) weather has a major role as well, although I never knew if it was following direction or doing it improv. The story is an intense drama with action to match, based on actual events on the Wind River Indian Reservation which has a per-capita crime rate that makes Chicago look like Mayberry. The climax was set up so suddenly it actually added an element of lethal humor to it. It definitely has a similar flavor to ""Hell or High Water"" in which Sheridan acted, only better. I noted the absence of any disclaimer about any animals being harmed. I don't know if that's still routinely being put in the credits or not, but I don't think it would apply here, though it was about an animal being hunted, Renner's character's job.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The Brilliant Taylor Sheridan Can Do No Wrong,"Taylor Sheridan has been responsible for immensely GRIPPING, modern day American Westerns from recent years, such as personal favorites Sicario & Hell or High Water. 2017's Wind River continues his winning streak, offering audiences a harrowing frontier-drama, that exposes the modern day atrocities committed against the Indigenous. Here, Sheridan's knack for bone-chilling, visceral narratives floored me, as he delivers tangible insights that emphasizes the exploitations PLUS the emotional & psychological footprints of these, from the victims. Apart from its captivating premise, Wind River as well boasts of the trademark Sheridan-confrontations, that brims with SKILLFUL INTENSITY.The discomforting yet engrossing themes of Wind River is owed to Sheridan's showcase of the present day, miserable realities faced by the Native Americans. These are shared through emotionally-stirring expositions and poetic dialogues that reveal the Indigenous' sorry state of being shunned by society & pushed to unlivable conditions, ushering Wind River's shocking murder-mystery that speaks volumes. These are staged exceptionally under Sheridan's ice-cold backdrops that are given villainous intent, infecting everything & everyone with its unforgiving savagery, accounting for the seemingly inescapable, survivalist way of living. Sheridan's direction also deserves praise, highlighted by one of the most pristinely executed, satisfyingly violent ending in cinema that deserves Youtube re-watches. As for the performances, Jeremy Renner & Gilbert Birmingham were powerhouses, disappearing into their characters' under-dramatized brokenness and silent anger. It is through their crushing portrayals that sees their proud veneers crumble in the face of unfathomable grief, that audiences are left shattered. Elizabeth Olsen was as well superb, conveying a relatable, out of place FBI agent, drawing affection from her courage & toughness.Overall, Wind River is MUST SEE CINEMA, with powerful, resounding subtexts. Sheridan's filmmaking brilliance places his audience right at the center of this visually-rich yet punishing terrain, characterized by unjust treatment, tragedy & this prevailing sense of anguish. In amazing fashion, this eye-opening piece boasts of filmmaking artistry too, through absorbing dialogue and mind blowing standoffs. Yes, this is the reason we adore movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Makes you feel ashamed for not feeling much,"Do you know these cases when you get to learn something which you know is important somehow, but you can't still quite touch the topic on the emotional level? It doesn't even mean that there are no emotions to touch, maybe it's just you being a heartless piece of wood. But you just can't help but stare, unable to make a link from what your mind perceives to your heart.Wind River is exactly this type of story. It's not that the story is not touching, nor is it not important. But you can't shake off the thought that you've seen it all a thousand times already: a depressed place, a bunch of sad and tired people who have nothing good coming at them in this life, some people still have goodness within, some have chosen not to care too much because it's easier that way. And somewhere along the way, one unlucky event follows the other, and something evil ensues.I can't decide whether it's my fault for not being able to take such matters to heart simply because they are not sensational, or it has something to do with the writing being kinda thin and the directing being kinda slow and sloppy at times. Not something major, just the little details which only rub it into your eyes yet another time that it's one of those ""sad, but sadly nothing new"" kind of stories, something you wish you could've done something about to fix it once and for good, but you know at the same time that you simply don't have the power to.We humans suck in general.

"Dark, Finely Crafted Crime Drama","The screenwriter behind ""Hell or High Water"" and ""Sicario"" brings us this unique, independent crime drama about an investigation of a homicide of a young woman on a Native American reservation. Set in the bare, remote landscapes of snowy Wyoming, ""Wind River"" is nicely shot and staged. The film contains expertly filmed cinematography of the desolate landscape, matched with strong performances across the board. Jeremy Renner's performance as a Fish and Wildlife Service Agent who found the victim's body is strong and leads the way, but just as noteworthy is Elizabeth Olsen's role as an FBI agent called in to investigate the murder.The film's style of narrative pacing is slow-burn, which works well given the plot and the context of the film's narrative exposition. The tone is dark and highly tense throughout, which also is quite effective given the grim nature of the story (and its violence.) What doesn't quite work, however, is some abrupt tonal shifts and plot devices that arise regarding some action-style scenes (shootouts, primarily) that detract from the film's otherwise slow and lurking tone. Because of that, ""Wind River"" isn't quite a masterpiece--but it is most certainly a good film that is worth seeing. 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Good Direction, But the Script Needs Some Work","Director Sheridan wrote Sicario and Hell or High Water, two of the most thoughtfully intense films of the last couple years, but this is (essentially) his directing debut. However, somehow he seems to have focused so much on the beauty of the visuals (which truly are stunning) that the script took a backseat. With a lack of character or distinction, and an unexpected plethora of clichéd storytelling and on-the-nose dialogue, Wind River is little more than a beautiful but ham-fisted allegory of how Native Americans have been poorly treated. Renner and Olsen take a break from their Avengers duties to join up with a local sheriff (scene-stealer Greene) to solve a crime in the frozen tundra of a Wyoming Indian reservation. The mystery itself, a young woman found brutalized and frozen in the woods, is an absorbing one, thanks to the skill in the filmmaking details. A uniquely foreboding score, intensely authentic action, gorgeously gruesome dead bodies atop scenic snow, and a lead hero who displays an aptitude for cool vengeance that should make Liam Neeson proud, all help boost the engagement. Unfortunately, once the mystery is resolved and explained, it's less, ""Woah!"", and more ""Oh"". The appeal of the mystery begins to dissipate when the conclusion is unsatisfying, leaving us with more unintended questions than answers: Why is the camera so shaky during simple dialogue scenes? What's with the hackneyed one-liners? Are these performances nicely subtle, or just dry as a bone? Is this the best we can do to portray the suffering of Indian-Americans? Wind River might have some helpful thoughts on wrestling grief, but it's mostly just unnecessarily brooding and too uncomplicated in its anger.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Off-Beat Detective Movie,"Bet you've never seen a detective movie about a murder on an Indian reservation. Well, ""Wind River"" is one, even though neither of the two principals, Jermy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen, are detectives.

Together they try to solve the murder of an Indian girl who died of exposure on a remote part of the reservation.Although they are the principals, the real star of the picture is the reservation, vast, snow-covered and far from civilization. The overriding sentiment there is spiritual and financial hopelessness accompanied by bleak prospects for the future. The older ones are trapped and the younger ones yearn for something better which never seems to come. The story itself is interesting and absorbing but moves slowly until the eye-popping finale.

Like wading through heavy snow,"I know I probably shouldn't have just watched 'Wind River' on the basis that it's - sort of - 'Hawkeye' and 'Scarlett Witch' from the Marvel universe starring together and expect something along the lines of a full-scale alien invasion of New York. However, there was a gun on the front cover, so I did expect a bit more in the way of 'action.' I was wrong.A young Native American woman in murdered on a reservation and a local hunter (Jeremy Renner) teams up with an FBI agent (Elizabeth Olsen) to solve it. If - like me - you're expecting gun-play, car chases and a non-stop thrill-ride, then you're going to be sorely disappointed.What follows is effectively the cast trudging their way around the scenic, snow-covered locations, occasionally talking to people. I know the direction is good. The scenery definitely deserves a mention and you really do get the sense of isolation in the wilderness.However, you may be thinking that if it's not a fast-paced, action-packed movie, then it's going to be a 'cat and mouse' tale of a murderer trying to stay out of the clutches of the law. But it's not - really - that either. It - kind of - gets explained about three quarters of the way through where we get a jarring lump of backstory/flashback to tell us what we're now supposed to know.Personally, I was finding it quite a hard watch - until the final act. There was a majorly-tense scene near the end which was definitely well done and I just wish the rest of the film was like that.However, it's probably worth noting that I'm clearly in the minority here.

Powerful story that avoids the trap of cliché,"I know a lot of people who would not like this remarkable movie, written and directed by Taylor Sheridan. If you don't like violence, you might as well stop reading now. If you oppose hunting, you can stop. If thoughts of a child being lost are too troubling, stop. But if you want to see a powerful tale about achieving retribution despite the forces aligned against that possibility, you may appreciate Wind River. So many easy mistakes this movie could have made, but didn't. There was no unconvincing romance, despite the respect and understated chemistry between the main characters. There were no long quasi-editorials about the plight of reservation Indians. The filmmakers show you that. There was no pretending that people simply get over soul-wounds by the next scene. These characters carry their pain with them and it helps shape who they are and what they will do. What the filmmakers do give you is beautiful, treacherous mountain scenery (the Wind River Indian Reservation is in Wyoming, though the film was shot in Utah), where blizzards are blinding and it's so cold that breathing can burst a person's lungs. They give you snowmobiles racing across the fields, forests whose sounds could be branches breaking or a family of stalking cougars. Best of all, they give you several profound cinematic moments, achieved not when the characters say a lot, but when they say almost nothing. ""At times, Sheridan has his characters spell out a little too clearly what they're thinking and feeling . . . but the words are so beautiful and come from such a place of deep truth, it's hard not to be moved,"" says Christy Lemire in her review for RogerEbert.com. I don't want to say too much about the actual story, so as not to take away from your experiencing it fresh. Suffice it to say it's about the investigation of a murder; it's about gun culture and drug culture and their inevitable consequences; and it's about survival. And it's about loving and safeguarding your children. Once you have them, a father says, ""You can't blink. Not once. Not ever."" Put everything else aside and concentrate on the fine acting. Jeremy Renner plays the protagonist, fish & wildlife employee Cory Lambert (""I hunt predators"") who has many reasons for trying to solve this killing; Elizabeth Olsen is the FBI agent who learns more in a week in the snow than in her FBI Academy training, that's for sure; Graham Greene is the laconic, seen-it-all tribal police chief; and Gil Birmingham is the father of the murdered girl.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It's True Detective season 2 all over again...,"Hearing the raving reviews about Wind River caught my attention but only after finding out that it was written and directed by Taylor Sheridan, the writer of last years Hell or High Water, which I absolutely love, did I decide that I'd definitely check it out in the theatres. I have to admit I left kinda disappointed.During Wind River all I could think about was the resemblance to True Detective, season 2 that is:Both were written by someone who previously created something amazing and kind of special (True Detective season 1 and Hell or High Water), but ultimately failing to recreate that same magic, that lightning in a bottle with their following work - Pizzolato's TD season 2 and now Sheridan's Wind River.Other than the circumstances of making them, they share the same problems in writing, directing and production and weirdly enough I found this to be true in their positive attributes as well.Wind River has impressive cinematography and an incredible sense of chilling atmosphere, which actually made me feel cold and shaky at times, creating a gloomy and depressed mood, which was complimented by the incredible and fittingly melancholic soundtrack, again just like TD season 2. This being said I did think that the story was quite basic, bit too simple and slightly unengaging, lacking layered well-written or at least unique characters. That being said the actors did a solid job with what they had, in TD- S2 it was Collin Farrel, Vince Vaughn and Rachel McAddams and here Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen (along with Graham Greene who was probably my favourite) who elevated their underdeveloped characters with their performances. Some of the dialogue while having some well-thought out interesting ideas and touching moments felt a bit forced, unrealistic. Finally, the director! True Detective had Cary Fukunaga and Hell or High Water had David Mackenzie, the directors and writers complimented each other perfectly, but TD without Fukunaga and Sheridan directing feels like its missing something.All in all, both Wind River and season 2 of True Detective, while having some pacing issues, are well above the average crime thrillers we get nowadays (e.g.: Sleepless), that have personality and are worth seeing for sure (if only for their climax which is extremely satisfying and touching in both cases).",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Wind River is a gripping crime drama that captivates its audience with its stunning cinematography and powerful performances,"Set in the harsh and unforgiving landscape of Wyoming, the film tells the story of a young woman's brutal murder and the unlikely team of a tracker and an FBI agent who come together to solve the case.However, the film is not without its flaws. The plot is at times far-fetched, with some details feeling contrived and hard to believe. The climax, which features an overdramatized shoot out, felt out of place and took away from the film's realistic tone.Additionally, there is a strange and unsettling scene in which the victim's mother self-harms herself in a way that feels unnecessary and out of place. While the scene may be meant to emphasize the mother's grief and trauma, it comes across as gratuitous and uncomfortable to watch.Despite these flaws, the film's incredible cast, led by Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen, deliver powerful and nuanced performances. Their chemistry on screen is palpable, and their interactions are often filled with tension and heart.Furthermore, the direction by Taylor Sheridan is masterful, with his unique vision of the American West driving the plot and setting the tone. Wind River is a thought-provoking and emotionally charged film that, while flawed in places, is still highly recommended for fans of crime dramas and powerful storytelling.Score: 87%

Predictable and just okay,"I'll say here at the start that I'm really not a Taylor Sheridan fan. I thought ""Hell or High Water"" was terribly cliched (and overrated) and feel that ""Yellowstone"" has lost its way amid the nonstop ""isn't cowboy life the coolest"" messaging. But ""Wind River"" had good reviews, so I gave it a go.Meh. Again, I found it formulaic and stereotypical. And if you DO watch Yellowstone, you've seen much of this already, as he has reused the themes (and the same actors) there. The sad reservation life and plight of Native Americans is used as a backdrop for a story of drugs, violence, and rape. A heroic local assists the (typically pretty) female FBI Agent in rooting out the bad guys, and that's it. Decent film, but we've seen it all before. The scenery is lovely, though...",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Really well-made murder mystery,"'Wind River' is from the writer of 'Sicario' & 'Hell or High Water', but is only Sheridan's second directorial effort, which makes it all the more impressive. It's a really simple plot - a Native American teenager is found dead, by Lambert (Renner) in the Wind River reservation and Banner (Olsen) is the FBI agent assigned to solve the case. Lambert is a tracker and hunter ad knows the terrain, so helps local cop Ben (Greene) and Banner in the snowy mountains.Nick Cave & Warren Ellis bring their sparse, 'Skeleton Tree'-like sounds to the score and soundtrack, and it definitely helps set the mood and highlight the sparseness of the northern Winter (or Spring, technically). The film moves along quite rapidly, with the investigation never boring, but still time to build plenty of backstory for Lambert and the reservation.The final 20min or so is handled really well, with a few surprises thrown in. Similar to the Australian-set 'Goldstone' in some ways. It all looks beautiful (odd that it was filmed in Utah, not in the real-life reservation in Wyoming), with plenty of nice scenic and animal shots, but also plenty of sadness. Renner and Olsen carry the film with nuanced performances, and there's thankfully no romantic distractions. It's just a great, straightforward crime-solving scenario, done right.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Gets better as it goes on,"Most of the movie was very slow, well made but dull and pretty much what I was expecting. The end though, significantly raises the level of excitement, is done very well, is very satisfying and pretty much makes up for the long slog that went before.I do have to point out that I thought it was pretty odd (odd as in out of place not as in unexpected) that the 'local' hero main character was literally the only white guy on the reservation.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Luck Don't Live Out Here,"This is an outstanding film by writer/director Taylor Sheridan. He also wrote 'Sicario', which I did not like, primarily due to Emily Blunt and her character, and 'Hell Or High Water' which I thought was much better than the Oscar Winner for Best Picture, 'Moonlight,' and which garnered Sheridan a Best Original Screenplay nomination. This film is Sheridan's directorial debut, but it most definitely will not be his last. The film beautifully captures remote, hostile, beautiful, mountainous terrain and unforgiving weather extremes. It also captures the cultural differences between people who are drawn to this type of environment and those who are repelled by it. Most importantly, it's a character study of inner strength and grace in the face of tremendous adversity, and coming to grips with loss, loneliness and despair, as well as, learning to celebrate life in spite of same.Jeremy Renner gives perhaps his finest performance, in a very nuanced role, demonstrating great personal strength gained from loss, and displaying tremendous presence and natural command without ever once raising his voice. Elizabeth Olsen is quality as an FBI Agent who is out her her depth and knowledge, but without that usual FBI arrogant BS of trying to impress and intimidate everyone and insisting on following that horsepucky 'book.' She knows instantly that she needs help and she adapts and overcomes accordingly. She's got spunk! Graham Greene is the local Chief of the Indian Reservation Police and plays it with low-key wit, cynicism and wisdom. Gil Birmingham, who was also in 'Hell Or High Water' and is one of the characters in 'Yellowstone' is also excellent in a small, but memorable, role.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Ridiculous,"The FBI would never send an Agent to a reservation to work a case alone...let alone a rookie Agent. Agents do not work homocides...it is not part of the curriculum at the Academy. The blast she took through the door would have probably burst her aorta, body armor or not...oh yeah, the body armor does not protect against high-powered weapons. I know that it's ""entertainment"", but...really?",,Anonymous,Mystery
Atmospheric,"I guess shooting an entire film in the snow and cold helps render it very consistent in terms of atmosphere, and atmosphere is indeed WIND RIVER's strong suit. The acting is competent, even from Renner, who has a difficult part because in the midst of his silences he keeps distributing pearls of wisdom about losing one's children, how to live, and other existential predicaments. Still, he comes very effectively across as a terrific shot and the man you need around in times of trouble.Graham Greene is outstanding as the experienced and attentive head of the police force in the reservation. He does not appear much, but promptly commands attention. Kelsey Asbille I did not find convincing. The motley crew that rape the Indian girl all sound convincingly depraved, and certainly there is an eerie sensation that there is no law and it is sheer survival out there.Direction is sound and assured, but far from exceptional.The screenplay opens in media res, is credible and with many punchlines, but at times dips into some annoying moralism. Also, suddenly it veers into a flashback which explains what happened at the beginning, that caused the Indian girl's murder. I found it a cliché- ish form of storytelling that detracted from the film's modern look and even technology.Those minor reservations aside, WIND RIVER is an above average film well worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Jeremy Renner shines in this murder mystery that shines a light on the life of modern Native Americans.,"Wind River is the debut film from the writer of Hell or High Water and Sicario, and stars Jeremy Renner as a hunter in snowy Wyoming who comes across the body of a girl miles from the nearest civilization. He is joined by an inexperienced FBI agent, played by Elizabeth Olsen, and the film explores the personal relationships of Renner's character and the injustices of being on an American Indian reservation.This film is an emotional masterpiece that has a surprising amount of depth, and never goes quite in the direction you expect it to go. Renner shines in the best performance that he has given since The Hurt Locker, and should even be considered for an Oscar nomination (even though we all know he won't be.) He controls the movie, and shows a lot of emotion with just small gestures and actions.Wind River is also a beautifully shot film. It captures the landscape of the Wind River Indian Reservation with ease, and makes you feel as if you are there.The cold comes through the screen and transports you to a different location.Without giving anything away, I will also say that the ending is also very satisfying. It manages to wrap up the main storyline while giving some closure to some side characters. The solution to the murder mystery feels real, and doesn't play as though it is in a Hollywood movie.Wind River is dramatic movie-making at its finest, and showcases Jeremy Renner's range that is not seen in his roles in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It also delivers a truly suspenseful adventure that, near the end, gives you a twisted feeling deep down in your stomach, but in a good way.I give Wind River an A.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Absolute gem of a movie,"Shocking even myself I have nothing negative to say about this movie (never happened before). As for style I would say its taken its stylish rendering from Nordic Noir, bringing in the snow as a major player in the movie.

Perfectly executed, poignant, very adult, amazing production, excellent acting (big line up of well known names... and... everyone in this carried off their role to award winning levels - sort of thing the Coen brothers were known for).

They brutally murder their friend and rape his girlfriend for no reason at all, they just do it because they are meanie heads.

Wind River (2017),"Taylor Sheridan really broke out with his script for Sicario. I'm not the biggest fan of the film although I admit its quite good. Then he wrote the script for Hell or High Water which felt like a country styled thriller that we'd see from the Coen Brothers. Here, he comes not only writing but this time directing Wind River. I didn't know much about the film before going into it. I have to say this is Sheridan's best work. Its so sharp, strong, thrilling, and horrific at the same time. I'm still in thought of what I've just seen. People really need to check this out.The film takes place in the Wind River reservation in Wyoming. In the freezing cold terrain a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Agent stumbles across the frozen dead body of an 18 year old Native American girl. Upon further investigation it is revealed that she had been sexually assaulted and died in the cold. With the help of an FBI special agent, the pair try to figure out what exactly occurred while trying to bring justice to all parties involved. The film is pretty much a modern but loose noir that becomes an intense barn burning thriller as it goes along.Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen work together (not for the first time), and both are quite excellent and very convincing in their roles. I LOVE Elizabeth Olsen and love that she took on a role where she gets to show off a bit of range. Wonderful in a role as a brace and committed agent who still can get distracted by her surroundings and let the harrowing details of the case get to her. Renner is just a badass, a great sharpshooter. One of the other highlights of the film is the locale setting of this. Absolutely heightens the experience.The film has disturbing moments (revelation of the case). Sheridan once again explores mystery by diving into the pure evil and the justice that comes with it. Tense shootouts, bloody moments, and a thrilling third act; Sheridan masters it all. Its really sharply written. I thought the film meandered a bit at the end but that's really the only thing I can pick out from an otherwise fun ride. This film didn't get a lot of buzz this year which is slightly outrageous.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not as good as it's rating - still good,"NO SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW! Honest opinionThis is the first time I've ever reviewed on IMDb, but this movies rating is very in just.When the movie started, the first vibe went straight to Fargo, another great movie. As it progresses, slowly steady you get as sense of what's going on. The storytelling is solid, and the acting is only as good as the script and the plot allows it to be, and if you have those in mind the acting was on point. The reason for the title and this review is that the plot is, and I have to emphasize it, VERY MEDIOCRE.I get the intentions of the movie, but I think for it to bear as little plot, and as slow moving plot as it does, the characters need to be written stronger, which they were not. I especially felt that Jeremy Renners character and backstory could have been more impact full if the script had given Jeremy a chance to explore the character some more. I never say this ever, but maybe if they had added 15minutes of run time for character exploration, it might had been a 9/10 from me. I didn't come for action driven movie, I actually like character heavy movies, but the script was just very mediocre.Anyways, if you're into a slow moving, well directed, acted and perfectly scored movie you should go watch this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"a standard vengeance thriller with solid storytelling, exciting visuals, and well-crafted acting","The vengeance thriller genre has always been popular because its core emotion is universal and forgiveness has human limits. There are many ways to translate this theme to film and most involve 'eye for an eye' violence which is the narrative heart of Wind River (2017). The stand out feature of this film lies in the way it deploys stunning cinematography to tell a reality-based story with rising tension and emotional depth.While protecting livestock from wolves in the snow-covered Wyoming mountains, wildlife hunter Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner) discovers the frozen body of a barefoot 18-year old girl. The crime scene is on Indian Reservation land and beyond local jurisdiction so rookie FBI agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen) is sent to investigate. Her inexperience is quickly obvious and she calls on Lambert's hunting skills and knowledge of the Mountain ranges. The investigation unfolds amidst deep distrust that locals have for outsiders and Lambert's grief over the recent loss of his own daughter. His connection with the Indian parents of the missing girl adds a culturally sensitive and emotional layer to what would otherwise be just an action-based thriller.There is little in this story that would earn praise for originality. Its pace is unhurried and the central characters are stereotypes that we have seen before. But it is outstanding in the way the majestic mountain-scapes are integrated into the storytelling through breathtaking panoramic aerial photography. Treacherous weather and the effects of sub-zero temperatures on the human body add to the hidden dangers and the impoverishment of life on native American Reservations. Lambert and Olsen are well-cast as two conflicted loners, giving character performances that drive the film without grandstanding. Dialogue is minimalist as you might expect in an isolated mountain community and a female FBI agent is not going to change that. While shootouts are obligatory in this genre, the violence is swift and essential to the narrative. The film's suspense curve maintains audience engagement until justice and vengeance are served.While this film comes with little fanfare, it has solid storytelling, exciting visuals, and well-crafted acting. It also has a subdued political theme not fully evident until the sobering on-screen message that, even today, no data is collected on the number of American Indian women reported missing. This disturbing insight into the status of today's native American population is balanced by the positive feminist message that is portrayed in a young female heroine using her wits without the hyper-violence seen in so many recent releases.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Another Winning Material From The Writer Of 'Sicario' & 'Hell or High Water',"From the writer of Sicario & Hell or High Water comes another sharp, intense & thoroughly gripping crime thriller that also presents him helming the director's chair this time. As neatly structured as it is expertly directed, Wind River takes hold of the viewers' attention from its opening moments, and doesn't let go until the very end.The story revolves around the murder of a young Native American woman and follows a local game tracker who discovered her body and later assists a rookie FBI agent with the investigation. As the two gather additional clues, interrogate more people & close in on the suspects, the tracker's involvement in the case becomes more clear.Written & directed by Taylor Sheridan, Wind River makes excellent use of its cold surrounding and unfolds in a controlled & steady fashion, allowing the audience to gather all the information before moving on to the next segment. Sheridan's direction is just as accomplished as his screenplay, for all the events coalesce eventually to culminate on a bloody but wholly satisfying note.The wintry ambiance, cold surroundings & sparsely populated setting add to its grim, chilling aura. Cinematography makes sure that every moment is captured in a clear, concise fashion, and makes effective use of colour palette & lighting to enhance the image's intensity. Editing retains the mystery till the final revelation and paces the story splendidly, while the muted score is in sync with its bitter tone.Coming to the acting department, its character-driven story is powered by sincere performances from both Jeremy Renner & Elizabeth Olsen, with former delivering a very measured, calculated & emotionally acute rendition while the latter articulates her rookie character's inexperience & emotions with accuracy. The rest of the supporting cast play their part responsibly and don't leave anything to complain about.On an overall scale, Wind River is another winning material from Taylor Sheridan that brilliantly showcases his directorial talents, especially his firm grip on pacing & environment, and is one of the best cinematic surprises of the year. Translated from paper to film canvas with razor-sharp clarity, presenting Sheridan in total control of his craft, and steered by solid performances from its faithful cast, Wind River is absolutely worth your time & money. Thoroughly recommended.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Good movie. Good ending. Good performances. Bad taste?,"The story is good. The scenes are often cliché, but with interesting ideas about suffering and dealing with tragedies. The acting is solid, sometimes great, and the crime that puts the investigation in motion (with all the difficulties from geographic, political and the social dynamics) is in a way a mystery and makes the movie always interesting.What's the bad taste? After the movie ends, we see that a point of the movie is to tell the story of the injustices that native American women suffer constantly and yet... the protagonists of the story are the two white leads. And I guess it totally makes sense with the FBI agent (Olsen) but there is little to no reason for the Renner character to be that relevant at all, and with those two we kind of... don't see the apathy coming from racism the movie apparently wants to denounce.In the end, I still left the movie interested in the problem and subject matter, so I guess it's a success, but it is kind of questionable regardless.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The best thing Renner has has done,"Wind River is a film that seemed to pass everyone by when it got it's theatrical release back in September . I'm not sure if that's because it is a Weinstein film and Harvey had a little bit more on his plate than promoting it ?!
It's also won awards for the most overlooked film of 2017 so I fully expect it to be talked about more now it has been released for home viewing. 
It's the story of a ranger who discovers the frozen body of a young Native American woman in an Indian Reservation. She turns out to be the best friend of his teenage daughter, who died a few years earlier under mysterious circumstances. Although the tribal authorities get involved in the investigation, the FBI also sends in rookie agent to investigate.This is the second film in a row I have watched that involves Native Americans dealing with death and the grief that comes with it ( the other was Hostiles ). This is the better film of the two in my opinion.
It's very atmospheric and you really do feel the harshness of the environment these people have to deal with.
This is probably Jeremy Renner's best performance to date as the dad who is still dealing with the death of his daughter but I was not totally convinced that Elizabeth Olsen was the best choice for an FBI agent.

Absolutely chilling,"I've seen Sicario a few times now, and admire the writing more each time. After having only seen that, and the success of the Yellowstoneverse, I decided to check out Sheridan's other projects.I have to say, Wind River was excellent.One could argue that there could be more Native American representation, I personally don't know enough about the situation to argue either way. But the film does a great job at raising awareness towards their plights, and for that I have to commend it. It helps that it's a damn good film, the way tension is handled in the final third is something I hope to replicate in any creative endeavours I go on. There's one moment where a line of dialogue expertly delivered completely changes the tone of the scene. I went back and rewatched it a few times.

"Hopelessness, isolation and the thin ice of morality.","The very edges of justice and jurisdiction. Hopelessness, isolation and the thin ice of morality. All these elements converge in Wind River to make a bitter tale of abuse, depravity and survival. The familiar faces of Renner and Olsen (Ala Marvel) may have tripped up the seriousness of this drama but I think they did it justice (no pun intended). The challenge to solving this murder puzzle, as ever, is evidence. And that's one of the moral messages of the story - out here on this remote Indian Reservation - what possible chance is there of finding that? And so despite all the signs crimes go unheard and unpunished. And this is where it gets interesting because out here you don't need a detective as much as a hunter-tracker. So, was it good? Yeah - I think so - saved, I think, from being too contrived by Renner and Olsen giving compelling and convincing performances as the hunter in his element and the FBI agent out of her depth. There were some lump in the throat moments too - there's some heavy grief and emotion to heighten the drama. The snow swept wilderness is beautifully shot. The soundtrack is (Nick Cave no less) a little predictable (think The Revenant) but it works - droning strings and wandering fiddle - American Indian mournful crooning. The First half is all set up - but the second half goes all to bloody hell - so buckle up.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Great film. Simple yet effective.,"Very solid writing with a couple Silence of the Lambs influences/references.My one issue was in the casting of the lead role. Lizzie Olsen makes sense because her character is a fish out of water but Jeremy Renner's role should have gone to a Native actor. This otherwise great movie about a Native American community is now centered around white characters. He was most likely cast for his star power for financing. I think it's one of those BS situations when you need experience to get a job, but the job requires experience-- Indigenous actors can't make a splash in Hollywood because they're not being cast in lead roles but financiers don't want to put their investment in unknown actors...even though there are PLENTY of examples where newbie actors star in successful films. Wind River could have been one of them.Not to take away from anything Jeremy Renner did (he was fantastic) or to fault Taylor Sheridan.

"Terrific locale, fascinating crime.","""Luck don't live out here."" Cory (Jeremy Renner)""Out here"" is somewhere outside of Jackson Hole, Wyoming, and outside of the normal advantages of a murder investigation in a big city and inside the Wind River Indian reservation. The Fargo-like white snow of writer/director Taylor Sheridan's smart and enjoyable Wind River is as always menacing as it joins pure white innocence with dark crime.Unlike Fargo, no laughs enter this dialogue, just the single-minded will to survive in a hostile land for everyone and a hard life for the Native Americans. A young girl has been raped and murdered, and Cory is the wildlife service's tracker, who joins with FBI agent Jane (Elizabeth Olsen) to solve the crime.Although the intricacies of the crime are simple when contrasted with some much bigger-budgeted thrillers, it has going for it atmosphere and acting, especially Renner's laconic and intuitive local, whose daughter was killed in a similar manner.The sense of place is just as strong (credit DP Ben Richardson with breathtaking views of mountains and trails). Unfortunately, the later Mexican standoff among police officers doesn't fit with the serious nature of the film as a whole (it becomes comedy-like when it reminds you of Tarantino with its shouting and abandon).Then there's the villain—another almost comic touch, and clichéd when contrasted with the rest of the original material. Too bad because Sheridan had done so much original work already as he did throughout Hell or High Water.Along with unsophisticated forensics comes commentary on reservation life such as boredom that breeds crime, lack of support from government, and few opportunities to break free of the poverty. An epilogue states there are no stats for lost reservation women. In other words, this thriller is after bigger game than lions who devour sheep and men who murder.Wind River shows people's grit in the face of hardship and their will to survive. Throw in a murder or two, and that life is stripped to its bone in a world that can't be fictionalized. This is reality, Wyoming-style.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Average thriller,"I remarked the many positive reviews on IMDb and put Wind River on my dvd watchlist. I have spent an interesting Saturday evening with my wife. I thought that at the end of the movie i would be very electrified but it was not so hot. I mean the film offers the cat and mouse play with revenge but the story didn't offer enough suspense. Jeremy Renner played solid and believable his role.

Superb... all round,"One of my favourite movies; I've watched it muliple times and it never bores me .... even though i know the plot and the outcome. This speaks to how enthralling and excellent both the story and characters are. This is one not to be missed.The script is superb and so is the acting. Dont think Jeremy Renner has done anything much better! Not that he's let down by the suppoting cast. Quite the contrary; they acquit themselves most ably.With such quality in those fields its easy to miss the quality of the cinematography, though that 'burden' is eased by the scenery. Sometimes you get drawn in to how cold it must have been.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The last third makes the first third completely worth it.,"Wind River (2017)The setting here will suck you in immediately-remote Wyoming, high mountains and rough uncouth men and a handful of principled good people to keep it steady. The leading man, Jeremy Renner, is superb. He plays Cory, who is strong, thoughtful, but not over the top into cliche, a fish and wildlife mountain man, of sorts. His job is to kill predators like wolves and mountain lions that are intruding on civilization. (This alone sets a one that is filled with contradictions.)
But then a murder happens (of a human being) and things get intertwined with Indians on the Rez and with an FBI agent sent to deal with the conflicint authorities (fed land, local cops, Indian land, etc.). This will seem like a huge weak point because the FBI agent comes off as a terrible stereotype we should all scream against-the incompetent blonde woman over her head. Elizabeth Olsen, unfortunately, is not even quite good at projecting that stereotype.
It somehow survives this stumble, however, and if you get past that half hour of the agent and the hero coming to work together (without any sense of impending romance, by the way), the movie grows and gets more subtle. And as Renner gets more convincing and intense, so does Olsen, as she gets roughed up emotionally and isn't as green or arrogant as she first appears when rolling up her window in the car (you'll see).
Then, to my surprise, the movie turns into a great movie. The last half hour adds lots of nuance even as it gets violent and ugly. It becomes a moving tale of resolution, dreams, mourning, the passing of tradition, the debauchery of lonely men, and the strength within some of us. Yes, maybe I overstate, but it's all there, in pieces.
A warning, perhaps. There are two violent scenes near the end. One is with guns and is quite exciting, for that kind of good guy/bad guy stuff. The other is an assault (which is implied at the very beginning) that is painful and for me not quite necessary. I see why they included it, but it could have been implied instead, or deflected a little. But for people who might find this disturbing-it is.
Expect a well made movie that builds and justifies itself by the end.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Truly Great Film,"One of the most honest films about human nature you will ever see. Tells it like it is. Pulls no punches.

Wind River,"I reckon that this is my favourite performance from a really well cast Jeremy Renner. He is an animal hunter who is shocked when he discovers the corpse of the daughter of one of his oldest friends. She has been brutally raped and murdered in their pristine snowy wilderness. The crime - on a Wyoming native American reservation pits local and state law officers against one another, but fortunately FBI agent ""Jane"" (Elisabeth Olsen) is soon on hand and so they team up with each other for what turns out to be quite a perilous investigation with not only the criminal to track down, but with a local community rife with mistrust and brutality not necessarily on their side either. As the mystery gradually unfolds before us, we are treated to some beautiful snowscape cinematography and to some well delivered efforts from Renner, Olsen, the legendary Graham Greene and some solid contributions from a supporting cast of largely indigenous acting talent. The story is a bit on the bleak side, there is little here for us by way of a let up in the relentless nastiness of the plot, but it is rarely dull and certainly worth a watch if you want something that will keep your brain engaged as well as your eyes.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Wind River Misses the Mark but Tries real Hard,"Wind River: Misses the Mark but Tries real HardWhen Wind River doesn't try to be more than a nice mystery featuring clashing white and Native cultures, grief and meditations while staring at wide open spaces, it works. When it turns into a hyper tense drama of shock and violence, it plays as false.There is a rape scene that was unnecessary and drawn out in the film. It did nothing to add to the mystery or the plot of the film. In fact, it ruined was little mystery the story had. It was a reveal that was unnecessary.Then there is the unrealistic shoot out. It is highly unlikely it would have happen at all, except perhaps for one hot headed character. If they had limited the action to him, the plot would have made more sense. However unrealistic this gunfight was, it was well filmed.Was Jeremy Renner's character, Cory Lambert, a white savior in Wind River? Partially. He wasn't a white knight in the classic sense. He didn't save the day, he didn't rescue all the people, but he did save some. The character, a white hunter from Fish and Wildlife, is not out of place in Wyoming. However, it could have easily been a Native American actor and all the hemming and hawing about belonging on the reservation as a white guy would have been avoided.Renner does a good job with the material, regardless. And Elizabeth Olsen does a fine job as Agent Banner from Las Vegas. There is one scene where she is reminiscent of Agent Starling from ""Silence of the Lambs"", but the characters are different. Starling presented a preppy image, Agent Banner is more earthly and less cerebral. And the cases are different.Some critics call ""Wind River"" slow paced. That's only true if you expected the pacing of Fast and Furious or Super hero film. The pacing matched the setting and plot and some people will find it slow.Others call the sound track dismal. It was quiet and minimalist. I guess they wanted an overwrought John Williams or Hans Zimmer sound track. The music works well for the film, except the times I heard the chanted words. The vocals distracted from the viewing.There are many out of character actions by characters in the film. The actions by Lambert at the end of the film didn't make sense. Why did he go to save some people and make sure they were okay and not check on some of his closest friends? Why would private security draw on the police and Marshalls when they could have just asked for a warrant?The film looks good and has some decent acting, but the plot doesn't hold enough mystery and that was spoiled in the end of the second act by an unnecessary, some might call exploitative, flashback.Rating: Matinée It wasn't the worst rural, Native lands cop drama I've seen, but it had many problems.Peace, Tex",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Slowly builds to an extremely satisfying climax,"This movie is basically a western, but with rolling pastures replaced with frozen expanses. The idea of using remote areas in the dead of winter in modern day to provide an old-timely feeling of the Wild West's isolation is genius. Following Elizabeth Olsen's character's investigative logic was easy, and everything played out quite nicely. The best murder mysteries are ones that are straightforward and clear by the end of the movie, and this movie is beautifully straightforward. Trying to think of a similar movie, I just happened to watch Hell or High Water recently and it turns out they have the same director, Taylor Sheridan. I definitely noticed some similarities in the somber tone the two movies had and how well they developed the characters. This movie is my favourite of the two, even if Hell or High Water feels a bit more fun to watch. Another movie this made me think of is Winter's Bone.

Slow paced thriller that kept me glued to the screen. Wonderful photography and editing.,"It is nice to see Jeremy Renner and Elisabeth Olsen outside the Marvel context, acting together in this slow paced thriller written and directed by Taylor Sheridan. ""Wind River"" is set in Wyoming, Jane and Cory need to solve a murder of a young girl. The movie never gives away the plot, it slowly plants clues here and there, but I never see who was the culprit of this crime, and I would never guess the chain of events that led to this dramatic act. It has all the right ingredients to be a solid detective story and despite the slow paced narration, I never felt bored once, because the film takes its time to build characters, give them a context and this really made me care about them. It lasted just a little under two hours and managed to open and close all the narrative arcs perfectly. Dialogues are compelling and the script does not lose time in trivial or cheesy lines.I genuinely believe that this is a well written movie, with wonderful photography and editing. Who curated the whole technical aspect of the production did an amazing job. It is really rare to find decent investigation films nowadays, but ""Wind River"" is for sure a small gem.

"Wind River - a gripping tale of shallowness, metamorphosis and eventual redemption","Directed by Taylor Sheridan, this Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen starrer offers us a journey which is unbelievably sulking in nature.There are few instances where one might feel connected to a movie on a meta-level, understanding its metaphorical references, and diving towards its inner soul where it hits you right in the heart. Wind River is one such rarity that engulfs you within its sea of shallowness and provides you with a chance to cleanse yourself, only if you let it.The narration starts with a girl running off on a full moon night, along the snowy hills of the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming, barefooted.! With a poetic recital in the background, the title appears as the girl runs through the wide (yet, still) frame (pardon my Cinematographic glossary!), with just the moon showing any glimpse of light that is left in her path of life.This sequence sets the tone for the rest of the movie to follow; this feature is not the one where you wish to pass the time, it is not for those who don't wish to endure strength amidst a cold storm. This is for those who wish to undergo the journey of redemption, much like the lead characters in the movie - one becomes a relatively matured human while the other cleanses off the guilt (of the past). A lot of questions pop up in one's mind - Why is she running? What is she running from? Will she survive? Why does a beautiful yet trembling voice recite an unpopular poem? But as the movie progresses, one might discover answers to these queries...one at a time.As a renowned hunter of wild animals and an expert tracker, Cory Lambert, played exceedingly well by Jeremy Renner, holds the key to the complete investigation process. Driven by the ""hunter"" instincts and tracing abilities, he dissects the ""how"" part of any incident quite clearly...the ""why"" part, however, is not up to his hands. But what if something comes up, something special that he eventually falls into the ""why"" as well? Coupled with his feelings towards the deceased, the guilt from the past plays a major role in taking up the investigation, irrespective of the help he gets. The people in that reservation, including the police chief Ben Shoyo (Graham Greene) are so used to having no help at all that they do not depend on the government to do the job for them. It is quite evident through the various references placed in the feature. They do receive something, which can be barely called as help - a naive FBI officer who is completely dark of the topology she is going to deal with.During one of her investigative processes, the father of the deceased girl considers her barely an adult, let alone an FBI agent. He did not mention it sarcastically; there is some intensity in his voice that might be taken in the wrong sense but he is damn serious about it. Well, in my opinion, he is not completely wrong. The officer might be physically aged but she has not aware of her surroundings and the experience she lacks by mountains that surrounds her! But she never shies away from admitting her naiveness and explicitly asks for help, which she is in dire need of. Although she is sort of ""pushed"" into this situation, she never backs out; she holds her ground and undergoes this journey, which I can only say as a metamorphosis. ""We"" (audience) are she, I would rather say!The friendship that Cory shares with Martin Hanson (Gil Birmingham), caught me right in the eye. Their bond transcends boundaries, sharing emotions on much higher ground. You don't need courtesy, you don't need parties but just a man to sit with you, to comfort you as if he doesn't have anything else to do! This feature, to me, is something like that...It just sits beside me, grows inside me, comforts me without uttering a word.With a strong motive behind making this feature, Taylor Sheridan conveys the message loud and clear. The amount of breathing space that he gave in writing the screenplay is just the right amount that the script demanded. Thus, it allows us to embark on this journey, rather than witnessing the events as they unfold. The frames from Ben Richardson along with the score from Nick Caven and Warren Ellis, creates an environment where you can feel lonely yet comforting, shallow yet contempt, scared yet strong, naive yet courage! They comforted the viewing experience like a heavy quilt on a cold night. I highly rate this movie purely for the way it was told. Just brilliant!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
great locations and acting,"The mystery itself proves not to be much of a mystery, and its abrupt solution, offered in flashback, is a bit disappointing. But from the beginning it is apparent that writer-director Sheridan is more interested in the mood of his film than in the details of the plot. Sheridan's dialogue is overy sharp and understated, and he shows an aptitude with his cast. All deliver strong performances, in particular Olsen and Birmingham, the latter of whom also had a major role in Hell or High Water. (Sheridan is an actor himself, best known for his role on Sons of Anarchy.)
For all its strengths, Wind River stumbles in its final act, as it struggles to balance its themes of solemn grief, macho retribution, and gender and cultural enlightenment. But it is still a film worth seeing-as, one hopes, will be whatever films lie in the director's promising future.",,Anonymous,Mystery

A terrifically cool Jeremy Renner performance makes this a riveting humane crime drama,Jeremy Renner in this movie plays a role similar of Morgan Freeman in Se7en; both have a apathetic sense of understanding of what and where they inhabit that is unpleasant and undesirable.There are a few human interaction scenes throughout the movie with his character that illustrate this with some excellent dialogue alongside a isolated snowy backdrop. The latter makes this feeling more apparent thanks to its striking cinematography and the movie rewards viewers to look at the movie through this lense.

Now I, too was feeling chilly to the marrow of my bones but less to do with the snowy visuals and more to do with the relentlessly sombre atmosphere of the film. I would go as far as to say I left with frost bite of the soul. I have heard it said from critics that the desolate portrayal of this story was perhaps daring and effective but as an audience member I felt stretched to my limits without moments of relief. The beautiful wide shots of snowy Wyoming where reminding me that I'd rather be watching an arctic episode of Planet Earth, at least our David Attenborough actually enunciates. One big issue I found with this film was that I couldn't understand what the characters where saying! The audio quality just wasn't sharp enough but even when I was understanding I found the conversations about grief too over-laboured. I think in order to establish real poignancy in these more emotional scenes there needs to be some light and shade in the films presentation. I think if the film had established some contrasting scenes with moments of comedy or warmth then I would have felt more emotionally invested in the film during the tragic moments.

"good acting, suspence and scenery","There are some problems with the movie and some controversy whether the main first dramatic point in the movie is even possible - it appears it is, in certain conditions which clearly occurred - you can indeed injure your lungs with a long intensive exercise in cold and dry conditions to the point they start to bleed.
So this is one thing. The other there are some problems with reasoning the visiting agent presented. This is not how it works. I also have problems with the fight scenes but I guess the long winter and substance abuse makes people do silly things.
Other than that a very well acted movie especially from main male character. For a woke times this is certainly not common. Of course overshadowed by villains but still very well done. As for woke - it does not hit you in the head till the very last moments when the stats appear. The main female character is overdoing things - I would not expect such flood of emotions from an agent but maybe I am too atistic a male to know better. It was not too much in my view, I could live with it.
I enjoy the movie even if I do not like thrillers. Maybe it is so because it was well made one or maybe because of the scenery I did not consider it to be one. I did not regret the time spent.

Wind River,"This is a crime thriller with its fundamentals rooted in the old Western style of narration. It has the typical Western style narration where the main character is portrayed as a kind of a loner who is doing his job and not bothering anybody. Then a crisis develops and the main character is directly pulled into the events and tries his best to be of assistance. The existential struggles of individuals are very well portrayed, which contributes directly to a very strong psychological component of the movie. The social issues that are typical of a deserted place like Alaska are also very well portrayed - drug abuse, murder and rape.Overall it is a cold and brutal movie that might upset people, but not in the sense that it tries to be sensational.

Background noise being brought to the foreground seems to be a trend in the last few years, but nearly all of the 2018 movies that my wife and I have seen suffer this malady.
Wind River takes place in snowy mountain wilderness where the silence is broken only by things like the far away cry of an eagle, but in this movie we are constantly bombarded with what sounds like busy traffic on a gravel road. And for the record, you never hear thunder in a snowstorm! Added to that is a constant attempt at eerie music consisting of high and low tones generated by a synthesizer, with the occasional banging on a piano. Trying to hear an actor speaking behind all this is all but impossible, especially since so many of today's actors are required to speak in whispering tones with voices that don't carry well. Wind River's bedroom scene was the first and only one where the background noise ceased, and what a relief it was.

Methodical crime thriller,"I'm just finding out that I love everything Tyler Sheridan writes. This is a perfect example of how to craft a compelling story, using a procedural as your weapon to tell a good story with wonderful characters. Kind of like the first season of True Detective. Here you have deeply flawed but extremely relatable characters fighting a horrendous crime in a very atypical location. Loved almost everything in the movie, with very good performances by everyone (how come Graham Greene didn't have more award buzz is beyond me), excellent cinematography, and I really loved the music by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis which seems to put off some people. My only small gripe with the movie is that the ending is a little bit too well explained, for a lack of better word. And I absolutely hate the Inspired by Actual Events that opens the movie, there was absolutely no need for it and it is basically a lie.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Flawed yet chilling tale,"There is an important message in this film...made explicit at the end for those of us who don't reside in that 'supposed' land of the free, the USA. To get to this message we first have to wade through yet more unpleasant realities of the USA. Nevertheless, suddenly, we find ourselves on a murder mystery detection trail. Trouble is, this is in the middle of nowhere-land. There is no close FBI agent so a diminutive, fresh faced city type from Las Vegas is sent....the authorities clearly have no intention of 'solving' anything. Step in local wildlife ranger, Renner, and the hard bitten local sheriff ...now the story really gets going and it turns out to be a rocky ride. The story and Renner are compelling which is fortunate as this film has some major failings. Cinematography is particularly badly directed with some hand held shakiness introduced at the wrong moments. Dialogue and diction is often incoherent or muffled. Script is not matched by actor action...or is not adequately captured in filming. Knocks the shine off what should have been a top class production. Instead it is so so.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A grief stricken thriller,"I don't think it would be much of an exaggeration to say that ""Wind River"" director/writer Taylor Sheridan likes creating neo-westerns. His screenplays for ""Sicario"" and ""Hell or High Water"" both encompass lots of the themes and settings of westerns and sets it to modern times, and this film is not so different. It is centered around a white tracker/hunter, played by Jeremy Renner, who is living on the titular Indian Reserve in Wyoming. Early on we learn that he is still recovering from the unexpected death of his daughter from three years prior, so when he finds a body of a dead girl he immediately is interested. Luckily for him, the new wet-behind-the-ears FBI agent, played by Elizabeth Olsen. who shows up to take the case is in need of someone to help her navigate the unforgiving physical and social terrain of the reservation. This film does not play out like a buddy cop movie though, The characters and inhabitants of Wind River are all in pain in some way or another.I think this film is compelling due to its characters, setting, and story (I'm a sucker for a good police procedural thriller), but is let down in the way of direction and some acting. This film is bleak and character driven. It isn't until around 20 minutes into the movie that Jeremy Renner's character, Cory, finds the body and sets the events of the film into motion. The time up until then is spent developing his character and the pain he is going through of losing his daughter. Here some of the dialogue is kind of weak and too on the nose, like ""is that how sissy died"", but overall it's still a welcome change of pace to movies that immediately drop you in on the action. Unfortunately what holds this film back the most is the directing. It's so f**king bland it's incredible. There's so much unnecessary hand-held, and so many weak cuts where scenes jump from one to another prematurely it is honestly quite frustrating. Yet by the time the tension filled third act of this film starts really heating up all my complaints for the film go right out the window. It's exciting, tense, and well shot. There's a style to be found in the action sequences that is just missing throughout the rest of this movie, which is a real shame as this could have been a 9/10 for me if the direction was just up to par. But that and some of Jeremy Renner's acting are the only things that really hold this film back at me. Yes there are some nit picks I have with it as well: like how nobody ever breathes out cold air even though it's supposed to be below freezing, and how sometimes the score ruins some of the tension (although for the most part I would have to say the score for this movie is pretty great) but these are minor issues and slight inconveniences at most. Overall this is an excellent film that explores a part of Modern America that is too often forgotten about or brushed aside.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Alright, but wrong POV","Wind River is a good movie. It has a thriller vibe that pleases, especially because of its dark tone.However, the main problem is the protagonist. He is too perfect. Cory Lambert would be a great B-character, but we see stuff through his lens, which, to me, kinda numbs the movie.The main reason for this numbing is because we don't see Cory change. We see Jane change, a lot, but that happens mostly offscreen; Cory, the protagonist, is already coping with his transformation. See this: he is mourning, but he doesn't even drink. He already accepts things as it is; in the end, he is still the same, sort of a guide to everyone.Storytelling-wise, the movie misses: Cory wants to help from the start, so the transition to the ""new"" world of events is seamless. Like I said, I think Jane should have been the protagonist, but I guess Olsen couldn't get the rights over Renner. Oh, well...Other than that, the movie is fine. Not much of an investigation going on, they just go from A to B, then to C, where Hell breaks loose and we are immediately aware of the facts. What drives this movie is the dark mist surrounding the place.I vote ""recommendable if you happen to step by it.""",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The Western is still alive,"Western never dies, it only transforms itself. Hunters no longer go on horseback but on snowmobiles and the sheriff now drives a SUV vehicle, nevertheless the Indians in reservations, fights, shootings and also the stories of this genre of movies remain the same or similar than to the past century, only changes the landscape and the characters, Perhaps Fargo was the movie that started this new modern trend, but basically everything stays the same over time. Aggressions, rapes, revenge, violence and an ending that is always happy and puts things in their rightful place. In the case of this film, the novelty is in the serious reflections on the dramatic loss of loved people and how to continue living in a balanced state of mind, the perseverance that overcomes the inexperience of woman official sent by the FBI and the bravery and determination of the protagonist.

Enjoyable but Flawed,"Four of us watched this together after which we had a fairly balanced dissection of the film including the role of women in the film. Although it (just) passed the Bechdel test there was a needless shot of bare flesh as titillation yet the background story is supposedly focused on the injustice towards native american women. Indeed it states this misleadingly in the ending credits whereas the film is actually told from the point of view of the hunter played by Jeremy Renner. 
Also it seemed that the FBI agent, played by Elizabeth Olsen, was inserted as the female interest in much the same way that the director used Emily Blunt in Sicario. 
So even though we felt the film misrepresented itself, the central story was still very interesting and compelling to watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Winter's Wrath,"The film ""Wind River"" (2017) encapsulates the essence of a cinematic experience that beckons with its frigid splendor, particularly suited for a morning viewing. The chilling atmosphere of Wyoming's icy winter is depicted with an artistry that is second to none. Jeremy Renner leads the narrative with a compelling portrayal of a relentless crime-mystery investigation, transcending the ordinary with a depth that is both captivating and unsettling.The film masterfully explores the stark socio-cultural disparities between the law enforcement and the indigenous populace. The tension between these groups is portrayed with unflinching realism, highlighting the historical grievances and profound disconnect that permeate their interactions. The authorities, depicted as inexperienced and often in conflict with the locals, struggle to impose their methods, which are met with resistance from the native community's enduring wisdom and resilience.The heartrending tragedy of a lost daughter reverberates throughout the narrative, casting a profound pall of sorrow. This emotional gravity, rather than intricate plot twists, anchors the film, creating a compelling and poignant viewing experience. The conclusion, imbued with a symphony of poignant beauty, leaves a lasting impression, urging viewers to reflect long after the credits roll.""Wind River"" stands as a testament to the power of storytelling, offering a bleak yet profoundly beautiful narrative that is both evocative and enduring.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"A solid film indeed, even if it could have gone further.","I have to say, I was kind of disappointed. A solid film indeed, but it's not as well written as Sicario or Hell or High Water. It does show Taylor Sheridan to have some genuine talent and skill as a director, however, which is great. But it's surprising that this is his screenplay when he's proved himself to be such a crisp, natural writer. The overall plot and narrative is fine, but some of the dialogue comes across as a bit clunky and awkward, and there seem to be more than a few crime procedural clichés used. Still, it's an enjoyable film with some strong work from Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen, even if the latter seems to get the short end of the stick. I feel like the film could have taken the opportunity to not be exactly what you expect when you hear a man and woman are going to team up, but sadly it stays on the wrong side of the line when it comes to giving the female character some truly juicy development.",,Anonymous,Mystery

I haven't really followed Elizabeth Olsen, but she was plausible in this role, despite her performance being a little one dimensional (big-eyed but emotionally lacking), I felt this too suited the role.Really worth watching and explores the grief of loss and how that affects people.

Interesting Mystery with Weird Misogyny and Cluelessness About How the FBI Works,"I love the snowy Wyoming setting and sense of atmosphere that pervades Wind River, and I agree that the mystery itself is well-written. However it's difficult to get past the first hour of ""country men"" telling a young woman what to do, as if an FBI agent is just some city slicking dummy who can't do her job. It's a piquant blend of misogyny and rural ignorant suspicion that leaves a sour under taste to this film - and trust me when I say it's nonchalant and ham fisted in its delivery not meant to add complexity to the film but, rather unfortunately, simplification to a mainstream audience. I do appreciate subtler commentary on how white bureaucracy mistreats Native American people in the US, and Wind River does have a very authentic sense of being a legitimately American cultural film that is devoid of cheap commercialism or corporate capitalism.

Reply to negative comments,"Some reviewers see the story as typical Hollywood left wing propaganda where white men are bad and the native americans are noble. Well, since reviewers chose to go down that road I must say that I had no trouble with the story. The whole point of this movie is to comment on how native american women go missing more than others and how jurisdiction on and off reservations make life unsafe for them. The whole point is that someone can commit a crime on indian territory and get away with it. I totally accept how the hunter here let's justice prevail, and you would think that a right wing person would appreciate the eye for an eye morals here. It's not as if the indian drug addicts are presented as good people, either. One of them is killed by the FBI woman and it's clear that the indian sheriff has little regard for him. Some comments also focus on how the FBI woman is totally mal placed. I think she is tough and she has a steep learning curve and in the end I think she is both tough and good hearted.
By the way, I also buy the premise of the native american woman having a stronger will to live than the rapist trash. This would even fit a christian way of looking at things where the Lord gives strength to those who need it.

Original thriller,"Wind River - Hawkeye and the Scarlet Witch try to solve a murder in Wyoming. That's really all I thought it was going in, but it's so much more than your average whodunit.As it turns out Mary Kate & Ashley's lil' sister can act. I've only seen her in supporting roles, and while she hasn't been bad, I didn't really see 'leading lady' potential there. Here she takes full advantage of the opportunities she's given with this role, putting to bed any notion that she isn't ready for top billing.Jeremy Renner is strong as well, actually delivering what I consider to be his best performance since The Town in 2010. He comes off like he's already lived two lifetimes, neither of which were easy. Stoic and stolid, but still vulnerable and empathetic, he pulled me in right away.The movie goes along at a calm and steady pace, but all at once it shifts to an uncomfortable and intense climax. Having that stark contrast in the final scenes, and forgoing the gradual increase in urgency, was an impressive choice by this first-time director.There is a scene where a character is giving an emotional backstory, but I couldn't concentrate on what they were saying due to the way it was shot. The character is indoors, standing still, but you'd think they were on the deck of a ship with how the camera was moving. It felt like the guy behind the lens was doing the sign of the cross with the camera the entire time, trying to exercise some unseen demons. Unfortunately it took away from an otherwise powerful moment.My only other complaint, and don't quote me on this, but I think they used digital snow in one of the early scenes. It just looks overly affected, and doesn't seem to accumulate on anyone or anything. Again, I could be wrong, but it felt markedly different than the snowfall in other scenes.It's a smaller film, but I'm hoping those Sundance leaves on the poster can push it into the awards conversation. It feels like a movie that will either get completely passed over, or rake in the nominations. And while you can guess I won't be calling for Best Cinematography or Best Visual Effects, I'd be hard pressed to bet against it in any other category. 8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Strong Start and Finish, But Weak Middle","This is the directorial debut of Sicario and Hell or High Water writer Taylor Sheridan, and you can certainly tell it was done by the same guy who did those movies. It has the same visceral, gritty feel as the aforementioned films. It's a gorgeous looking movie, with beautiful cinematography that fully realizes its luscious wilderness backdrop. One of the movie's strongest aspects is its atmosphere. For a first time director, Sheridan does a great job at building the world around the film, and it probably comes from his well written screenplay. I wouldn't say it's as well written as Sicario or Hell or High Water, but it is really a solid screenplay. Stemming from that screenplay, and realized through the direction, is the tension. Wind River does an excellent job with escalating tension, and making it feel palpable. I won't go into details, as not to spoil the film, but there are certain scenes where the tension continuously builds and builds, and you're on the edge of your seat the entire time! But, where this movie loses me is with the second act. It felt like Sheridan knew where he wanted the story to begin and where he wanted it to end, but he didn't know what to do in the meantime. Had this movie been only an hour long, I think it would have been a lot more effective.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Taylor Sheridan is Here To Stay,"As much as I like Sicario, I like it more for the direction and performances rather than the script, Hell or High Water on the other hand was so good mainly because of the screenplay so I was understandably very excited for Wind River and I was blown away by my second favourite movie of the year so far (falling only close behind Dunkirk) and I could not be more curious to see what Taylor Sheridan does next.Sheridan wrote and directed this movie wonderfully, at first it seems like an ordinary murder mystery but it quickly turns into a character based drama with something real tragedy behind it with some very good social commentary in regards to the way the law works in the poorer areas of America and the treatment of Native Americans which makes this film more intelligent and fascinating than it could have been. Sheridan also took to the directing of this film really well, it made you feel the atmosphere of the film as well as giving some true realism, an Oscar nomination for the writing or the directing would be well deserved.Sheridans script also happen to be very performances centric and this film is no different. Jeremy Renner gives the best performance of his career in this film, he's so subtle yet brilliant in his delivery, you get the sense that the character has been through some real turmoil and is in a lot of pain, it let you sympathise with his character more and he stole this movie for me. Elizabeth Olsen is also fantastic in this movie, real strong willed, professional yet quite inexperienced, she was really convincing as this character. I'm glad to see her get out of the marvel universe and give a more grounded performance like this.The location played a big part in this movie, it was almost a central character, like Sicario and Hell or High Water before it Wind River really makes you feel like it's main location is a grimy place, not one you would want to visit. It gave this film a real grit to it, nothing felt like a movie but about as close to real life as this film could be. Sheridan did a good job of making you feel cold while watching this movie, you hear the wind in the air and see the thick snow on screen, it makes you feel like you are there and that's one of the best praises I can give a movie.Despite all the social commentary this film is still a murder mystery at its heart and that mystery is very intriguing, it's a good guessing game like any solid mystery should be but the pay-off was fairly unsatisfactory. The film just kind of tells you the answer and was done in a fairly lazy way.Wind River is amazing, it's got a brilliant script with a good directing style to match, fantastic, career best performances from Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen, a very good atmospheric location as well as a solid central mystery. Even if the answer to that mystery is given in a fairly lazy way I was far too impressed with everything that came before for that to bother me to much. I'm very excited to see what Taylor Sheridan does next and I truly think he's becoming a real talent to watch out for.9.5/10: A (Phenomenal)",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Love and the Agony of Losing a Child,"Synopsis: Man works as a hunter for a federal wildlife agency, but discovers a young girl's body frozen in the cold Wyoming snow. What ensues is largely about his relationships with the people: most he already knows, some are new. Central to this touching film are the joys and sufferings that parents go through, raising, and sometimes losing children. Having people who understand, or just listen is sometimes all there is to ease the pain.Story: The story is actually quite simple: murder, American Indians, love, the snow and cold, lust, and boredom. Yes, the plot and development are simple and straightforward, but ... the unwinding of people, their struggles, and relationships were complex (enough) to keep the story nicely evocative and heart rending.Tension: There are diverse tensions ... FBI and American Indians, city folk and dead winter in Wyoming, parents struggling with anger and pain, nature vs man. It's well managed overall, but there were some scenes toward the latter part that added little value. In fact, I thought these scenes were gratuitous and took away from the film's quality.Movement: Excellent tempo, especially considering it's fact-based and emotionally moving.Like Movies: Gone Baby Gone (superb)Better Movies: NoneActors: Casting was excellent overall, believable characters. I loved the film ""Arrival,"" which Jeremy Renner starred in (along side Amy Adams). He has an honest quality about him I value.Director / Writer: Only after watching did I discover he wrote both Sicario films, each of which is superb.Climax: The ""climax"" with regards to the crime was inconsistent with the whole tenor of the film, so I was disappointed with that. However, the film ends very, very well.PS: It is difficult to decide, do we review just after watching (while the emotions and thoughts are fresh) or do we wait awhile (let the stew simmer)?I don't know. Normally my sense is to wait, let things settle out. For this review, however, it's fresh off the burner : )2nd View Update (one year): It's a very good film (as contemporary film goes), but I have a complaint. Renner's character is just always ""right,"" which is such an arrogant and male thing to do.The film should bring anyone with children to tears, but this quality of being the hunter and alpha male spoiled some of the film's sensitivity.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A Look In The Mirror,"This well done film has all the emotions and why they are there. A closer look at where our.government' prioritises are. Foreign lands, not here. Exactly how many years are we set to break Native Indian's down? We are continuing down a path set in the 1800 's with not even a word about fairness to our own. No money in it to spread out for industries. What a pathetic, sad asses position to let stand. We all should be ashamed for many reasons, of the path taken to exist as we do. But with that there comes no way except down. We are well on our way already in that direction. The spoils go to the most corrupt, as it has for over 100 years.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

An American Indian murder mystery,"Wind River is a movie about a Fish and Game hunter who helps an FBI agent try to solve a mysterious murder on the Wind River Indian Reservation. This film explores the other side of living on an American Indian reservation. This journey in the film, while important for discussing the culture of American Indian society, often makes the film feel slow at times. A lot of dialogue about pain, hope, despair, and lost opportunity are intertwined within this murder mystery.The film is very similar in style to the 1992 movie, Thunderheart. As a movie, I thought Thunderheart was a much better overall story/murder mystery mainly because while it showed American Indian life/culture, the story remained focused on the mystery. In this movie, Wind River, the murder mystery tends to get lost at times within the long dialogue scenes about Wind River society and culture. Then it gets back to the murder mystery.As a film, I recommend seeing it. It has a good story and great ending. However, because of the film's pace, I think many viewers will probably only watch it one time.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Engaging film, good story and acting, misses the bull's eye on a few points","Here you have a not terribly uncommon theme, really. A young woman runs from some clearly very bad dudes, and we come into things as the investigators are trying to figure things out in the aftermath. For much of the film I was intrigued, and I like the fact that they did a pretty good job of setting the story in environments most of us know little about. Here and there the dialogue is a little pat, and is obviously written to evoke a desired emotion from us, the viewers. There are other problems; for example, did I miss something, or was there really a reason for her to try to run through miles of bone-chilling cold? I mean, all those drunken dudes came crashing in on her and her boyfriend. Um, did they walk there? Took the bus? In other words, surely they would've left a couple of trucks or ATVs or something outside, and considering their hazy condition and the remote location, I'd bet big bucks the keys were in at least one vehicle... while they were involved inside couldn't she... well, you get it. There are other points I could make but overall it's a good film that, while entertaining us, manages to also communicate an important message about the condition and fate of many native folks, especially the women.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great Direction and Amazing Performances by the Lead Cast,"This movie, invariably, reminded me of The Prisoners. Even though it is a different plot but the overall experience of the movie is very much the same. It is a little depressing, so if you are in a mood to have some fun, this movie shouldn't be the choice. Having said that, in terms of cinema, it is a very good watch.Story (8/10): A body of a very young girl, just adult, is found in the icy mountainous region of Wind River Reservation area of Wyoming. The FBI agent, Jane, teams up with a local hunter, Cory, to solve the mystery behind the killing that is not exactly a standard killing since the girl is found to have died because of pulmonary hemorrhage while running barefoot on the ice. While Jane has been summoned from a far away from Nevada for the case, she still has to adjust to the cultural aspect of the area and the demons in the unforgiving terrain. Luckily, she has Cory by her side to help her see the subtle clues. As they solve the case, Jane also discovers a chapter from Cory's personal life that makes him want to help her in the case. The story is very well written and the relevance of each character, besides Cory and Jane, has also been explained quite nicely which makes the entire story complete. The conceptualization of the opening scene, some of the connection of the main story with Cory's past and the climax scene is amazing and couldn't be more fitting to the entire story.Acting (8/10): The lead cast, Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen, are amazing to watch. Jeremy Renner was a near perfect choice for the role and he did justice to the character by avoiding being dramatic or aggressive. Elizabeth was amazing to watch as a dedicated, empathetic, honest but a slightly under-confident officer who knows her limitations in the unfamiliar land. Her chemistry with Jeremy Renner is quite subtle. A large part of the movie has only these two characters in the scenes. The rest of the cast, however, has done just good enough to maintain the standard of the movie.Direction (9/10): Taylor Sheridan did a stellar job in directing this movie to near perfection. The opening scene was very well picturized and laid down the set up quite well. Some of the scenes and locations used to convey the brutality of the terrain added a lot more implicit drama to the movie. The climax scene couldn't have been more fitting to close the movie. The references and conversations explaining how differently things work in that region compared to the rest of the US brought a lot more authenticity to the story as well as the importance of the central character's involvement in solving the murder mystery. The pacing and the length of the movie are just right enough to keep you glued to the screen.Overall (8/10): Overall, it's a great movie to watch, especially for some amazing performances by Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen, and great direction.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Sheridan's scenes boil over with suspense,"In the third film of Taylor Sheridan's so-called American Frontier trilogy, incidentally the first of them he also directed as well as wrote, it's not the writing which stands out, but rather the direction. As with the brilliant Hell or High Water from last year, Wind River is a film about forgotten communities in remote parts of the United States. The story deals with a suspicious disappearance and death in Wind River Indian Reservation, a region where the film tells us that disappearances of girls in particular are frequent and don't necessarily get investigated. These are harsh lands and conditions to live in, and the desolate apathy of these characters are thrown at us from the outset, as Sheridan wants us to feel the constant cold and hardships of the place. The story is interesting as a classically structured whodunnit. What really stands out with Wind River, however, is Sheridan's skill in setting up scenes and making every one of them almost boil over with suspense. In this respect the film is reminiscent of Jeff Nichols' work (Shotgun Stories, Take Shelter), another young filmmaker with his heart and soul in rural USA.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Taylor Sheridan makes a cracking directorial debut! [+70%],"The man who penned the screenplays for 'Hell or High Water' and 'Sicario' - Taylor Sheridan, follows it up with a little gem titled 'Wind River', where he is also making his directorial debut in sensational fashion.The film is essentially about a rape and murder of a young native- American woman in the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming, USA and how it brings together U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agent Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner) and FBI agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen) along with the town Sheriff, for the investigation.What's appreciable about 'Wind River' is how the writer/director allows the film to run its course in building the lead characters while maintaining a certain level of suspense. The weather is harshly cold, with blizzards coming in at the oddest of times, and environmental clues showing signs of obscurity unless decisions are taken quickly. Cory has a tragic past of his own that connects well with the proceedings in the present, making him half bad-ass hunter and half brooding dad. Olsen plays her part of the rookie agent well too, her expressions bang on target when she sees the victim's mom hurting herself and when she hears the sorrowful cries of the victim's dad.I liked how Sheridan made Cory speak out loud about his tragedy, allowing Jeremy Renner to showcase his solid acting skills, rather than spoonfeed the audience through lazily done flashback sequences. A late cameo from Jon Bernthal is a welcome change from his recent eccentric outings. The writing is as solid as it can get, and the narrative flow seamless. The 'cowboy' vibe is quite apparent, especially in the early scenes featuring Cory and his son. Plus, Cory deals with the baddies just like he's handling his quarry.Sheridan tries to raise a valid point with respect to the uncertainty in the 'missing-case statistics' of native Americans through extremely introspective story-telling. He voices his judgement against offenders in the most cinematically-satiating approach. Gil Birmingham, who plays the victim's father, gets to act out a few well-written scenes (especially the one at the very end).A few loose ends could have been sealed off better: there's a mention of a friend who dropped off the victim at the location where the crime took place - never to be seen or mentioned anywhere else. Also, the state of relationship between Cory and his wife was largely painted in shades of ambiguity. Nonetheless, these minuscule drawbacks should not deter you from giving 'Wind River' a watch as Sheridan is arguably one of the best yarn-spinners of our times.Verdict: Superb character-driven thriller!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A somber and stoic animal tracker still grieving is offered a chance for vengeance,"Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner) is a big game animal tracker in Wyoming who hunts down lions to eek out a living. After losing his young daughter through an unsolved murder a second young lady named Natalie (Kelsey Asbille) is found dead on the frozen Wyoming Native American reservation without any snow shoes on her feet and she was raped and murdered. Cory speaks to Natalie's grieving father and personal friend Martin (Gil Birmingham) with great empathy after losing his own daughter to an unsolved murder. Martin tells Cory if he chooses to assist the FBI in hunting down his daughter's killer(s) to spare no mercy to these savage killer(s).When a rookie FBI agent named Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen) is assigned to investigate this latest murder on the Native American reservation land she quickly realizes that she needs the assistance of the experienced tracker Cory Lambert to just survive on the harsh and frozen surrounding white hills.I always enjoy these type of crime/drama revenge films if they are done well without embellishment of how awesome the hero/heroine is by miraculously defeating more than two dozen faceless lackies 'a la Steven Seagal. No, this mystery/thriller is void of any long winded overblown fights of one man versus an army. Rather, it focuses on how our experienced tracker Cory Lambert not only wants to track the person/people responsible for raping and killing his friend Martin's daughter but utilizing this opportunity to free himself from continuing internalizing his own grief for the unsolved murder of his own daughter. So Cory gladly joins the inexperienced female FBI agent who has never prepared herself for the harshness of the frozen Wyoming wilderness and they set out to solve the crime.Jeremy Renner always dives deep into his roles and unlike many of the made-to-model pretty boys who usually get these starring roles Renner's performance is both somber and stoic and you can't help but root for him and you know he is going to get these S.O.B.'s. It's a classic good versus evil cat and mouse chase but with a twist, this man is also on a personal mission to help ease his own personal grief for failing to save his own daughter and not finding her killer(s). He won't fail this time. Mrs. Shullivan and I greatly enjoyed this particular hunt and are even bigger fans of Jeremy Renner after his stellar performance.An 8 out 10 rating well worth watching!!!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The chemistry between the two cops is a little paternalistic,"Taylor Sheridan likes to combine the Western genre with actual social engagement. In ""Hell or high water"" (2016, David Mackenzie), for which he wrote the scenario, the film is situated in Texas and its theme is the banking crises of 2008. ""Wind river"" (for which he wrote the scenario AND was the director) is situated in Wyoming and its theme is the difficult position of native Americans.Through the films of John Ford we identify Westerns with locations such as Monument valley. Personally I do like Westerns situated in the North of the United States very much. Think of films such as ""McCabe & Mrs Miller"" (1971, Robert Altman) and ""The revenant"" (2015, Alejandro Inarritu). ""Wind river"" is one of those films, and the landscape is really beautiful. Good work of cinematographer Ben Richardson, who also shot ""Beasts of the Southern wild"" (2012, Benh Zeitlin).The theme of the difficult possition of native Americans is illustrated by the case of the rape and murder of a young girl. The sheriff of the indian territory can only act as both the victim and the offender are native Americans. Against offenders from outside the territory he is powerless and needs the assistence of the FBI. Because of this a lot of crimes against native Americans remain unresolved.In ""Wind river"" the assistence of the FBI comes in the form of an inexperienced female agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen). Her cooperation with the experienced local guy Cory Lambert (jeremy Renner) is the weak point of the movie. In many detective movies the tension between the experienced (local) cop and the inexperienced (but often better educated) cop from outside is one of the driving forces. During the movie not only the crime is solved but there also grows a mutual understanding and appreciation (for example ""In the heat of the night"" (1967, Norman Jewison) and ""Mississippi burning"" (1988, Alan Parker)). In ""Wind river"" Jane Banner proves that she is brave, but she never really contributes to the solution of the crime. Combined with the fact that Jane is a woman, the film tends to a kind of paternalism.I already mentioned ""McCabe & Mrs Miller"" (1971, Robert Altman). Only after seeing ""Wind river"" one can value the utility of a brothel in such a lonely town in the North.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I got pretty teary eyed multiple times throughout the film.,"'WIND RIVER': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The new crime-thriller from acclaimed screenwriter Taylor Sheridan; who also wrote 2015's 'SICARIO' and 2016's 'HELL OR HIGH WATER'. Sheridan also directed the film, in his sophomore directorial effort (following the 2011 horror flick 'VILE'). The movie stars Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olson (Hawkeye and Scarlet Witch together again) as a US Fish and Wildlife Service agent, and an FBI rookie, trying to solve a murder on the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming. The movie has received nearly unanimous positive reviews from critics (like Sheridan's other two screen writing efforts), and it's also been a success in it's limited theatrical run at the Box Office so far (also like Sheridan's other recent movies). I found it to be pretty dang good.Cory Lambert (Renner) is a US Fish and Wildlife Service agent who's currently investigating the killing of livestock at the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming. While trying to find the den of the suspected lions involved, Lambert comes across the body of an 18- year-old female resident. The FBI sends a rookie agent, named Jane Banner (Olson), to lead the Tribal Police there in their investigation. Due to Lambert's skills at tracking in the area, Banner asks him to assist them as well. Their efforts soon lead them to some very dark, and brutal places. Places that Lambert is very familiar with, having also lost a daughter there (the same age) in a similar way.The movie starts out a little slow, in my opinion, and then it keeps picking up pace, until a very intense and dramatic conclusion. The climax is definitely my favorite part of the film, but it's also very dark and violent (and you have to have some patience to get to it). The character development, and performances, are both excellent though (Renner is always good outside of Marvel movies, I think). I got pretty teary eyed multiple times throughout the film as well. It's another near masterpiece from Sheridan, in my opinion, and he proves himself as a very talented director here too.Watch an episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/j_XDrmlMJNY",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Very emotional,"WIND RIVER (2017) MOVIE REVIEWWind River is a movie about hard life in the mountains. Actually it is a detective. You don't feel a lot of tension in the movie, but you will feel a lot of feelings. From compassion to hate.Because this film deals with life on an Indian reservation, much of the social and economic woes might seem unfamiliar at first, but the film does a good job of providing a snapshot of the hardship. Sheridan depicts a world that is sympathetic and troubled at the same time, masking its tears with courage and doggedness.

Wind River is practically flawless and Taylor Sheridan is a name all film enthusiasts should keep in mind for the future.The story is perfectly told from the first to the very last scene and should not leave anyone cold. The theme of the film is tackled nicely and contains elements of drama, crime, thriller, mystery and some brief moments of bittersweet comedy one-liners which are all balanced really well. The performances from the entire cast are worthy of every praise as well.One of the best features of Wind River is how realistic it all feels, from the story, locations to the characters and carries quite an emotional impact. Films like these are very rare these days, especially films that deal with the lives of Native Americans and are not in any way morally biased.Taylor Sheridan previously wrote the screenplay for Sicario and Hell or High Water and if you liked those, then seeing this one is a must.

LUNGS DO NOT BLEED FROM COLD AIR,"Anyone who thinks your lungs bleed from breathing cold air rapidly is a damned idiot. Period. Pure fancy by people who have obviously zero experience living actively in a subzero environment. People who obviously just want to dupe audiences as an excuse to show medically imaginary, melodramatic, violent death scenes. As someone who lives in it, and regularly runs, sprints and engages in all manners of breathing subzero air that I can imagine I can confirm that your lungs don't bleed for an reason related to inhaling cold air via natural aspiration unless you have some other serious underlying medical condition causing them to do so. If this was at all remotely possible are you truly daft enough to believe hundreds of thousands of people would risk living daily in a subzero environment? How stupid and uneducated are filmgoing audiences and filmmakers getting, and how is it even possible with the wealth of knowledge available a few clicks away? Utter failure, especially following ""inspired by actual events"".Suspension of disbelief aside, the rest of the film was ok. Entertaining (if even for its medical fantasy). Well-acted. Great cinematography. Mediocre plot and dialogue. Abysmal sound editing and mixing. Glamourized by one of the hottest native american women you will ever see in Julia Jones, however, I don't even have to be native american to be insulted by American filmmakers' penchants for employing beautiful half-asian women to depict native american women, per the actress playing the rapee, Kelsey CHOW. Really?...You REALLY couldn't find 1 more actual native american girl who could use a job acting?...Or do you simply assume your audience is that daft?Extra points for going far enough with the rape scene, all too rare amidst prevalent disproportionate hypersensitivities of the day.

"Evil doesn't exist, people just created them !","I'm really satisfied after watching this movie, this thriller crime movie is really impressed me. The movie scene starts with the woman running barefoot on icy ground and she seems terrified & chased by someone. Then she fell and the scene change to Jeremy Renner who is hunting the wolf. Jeremy Renner plays as a hunter who has some dark past tragedy, and Elizabeth Olsen as newbie FBI agent. They come across because the murder investigation on that woman in the first scene. The storytelling is so mysterious, and we cant predict of the murderer. Taylor Sheridan just really great with his work and he just did it again. Many people are connected or involved each other and it seems anybody can be a suspect.At some point, this movie tells you people have some good and bad side. They have both sides and sometimes people can change one to another side because of the tragedy or just a circumstances. It seems like evil itself doesn't exist, evil exist because of people created them.And another good point is this movie gives you many great scenery and amazing panorama. It reminds me of The Revenant movies with extra thriller experience. However, i just feel a little bored with the first 15 minutes because it has so many daily conversation that is pointless and not really important.

"Places you don't want to be, people you don't want to know...","Nothing fascinates me (and surely many people with me) more than a grim and harrowing murder-mystery/thriller. And, if there's one thing David Lynch's ""Twin Peaks"" taught me in the early nineties already, it's this: the more remote, secluded, and geographically isolated the setting, the more absorbing the mystery. ""Wind River"" refers to an Indian reservation in the ice-cold and mountainy state of Wyoming, so it doesn't get more remote & secluded than this in terms of setting.It's a bleak and daunting film, but indescribably atmospheric and I even daresay brilliant. Even without the vicious murder where the plot centers around, writer/director Taylor Sheridan makes unmistakably clear that Wind River isn't the type of place where you ever want to be. In case the ice, the snow and the insufferably cold temperatures don't scare you off already, the lack of rights in the reservation and the total absence of hope for a half-decent future will. Every resident carries a trauma with him/her, and the discovery of a young local girl's dead body in the snow makes the community even more embittered and tense.With his powerful statement of a drama/thriller, Taylor Sheridan exposes how unjust and miserable the living conditions of Native Americans still are, and how very little legal rights and governmental protection they have. It's depressing and downright infuriating. The reservation, which on itself is as big as a little state like Rhode Island, is illustrated like another member of the cast, and moreover one that is menacing and unreliable. The scenery and locations are beautiful, but you do not want to exist here.I also find it deeply astounding how one single film can completely alter my perception of a performer. Before ""Wind River"", I thought of Elisabeth Olson as a mediocre actress who simply appeared in a handful of Marvel superhero movies, but here she proves what a good actress she really is. Jeremy Renner is also stupendous. And Graham Greene, well, he's great as always in a role that - I reckon - is deeply significant for him since he grew up in a reservation. Beautiful, must-see film.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Overall, pretty good","""We have to drive 50 miles to go 5. Welcome to Wyoming.""Not only is this a cool line of dialogue, but I believe it perfectly captures how much the land and the environment affect the story, pacing, and tone of Wind River. The movie starts with a girl running panicked through the wintery woods before collapsing in the night. She is then discovered frozen by Jeremy Renner, a trained tracker who knows his ways around these parts and with these people-even if he is a white outsider. It's obvious he has some sort of troubled past that hunches on his back despite his efforts to push forward. This mysterious past motivates him to help the young FBI agent Elizabeth Olsen with the case; and coming straight from Las Vegas, it's obvious that she needs the help of a local.The movie has ominous undertones of the dark side of humanity sprinkled within the glistening snow of the beautiful landscape. The serious, almost straight-forward approach to the simplistic story kept reminding me of Sicario, and I didn't realize until afterward that it's the same writer. This writer Taylor Sheridan, who previously was lauded for both Sicario and Hell or High Water, both writes and directs for this film. He's definitely imitating aspects from Denis Villeneuve, and if there's a director to imitate, he's one of the best choices. With that said, I think the production, editing, score, and cinematography are all ultimately better than the decent directing.On the surface the film is about a murder investigation on an Indian reservation with an FBI agent receiving help from a skilled tracker/hunter. And except a nice turn from Jon Bernthal, there's nothing really surprising here. Some shocking moments, but nothing surprising. But that's rightfully not the focus of the film. And neither are the decently developed characters. Wyoming takes the starring role here. There's enough snow in sight to freeze a polar bear, and despite how little that analogy may make sense, it's true. And it's used to full effect with blistering wide shots mixed with shivering closeups of the characters. The setting is an obstacle, a visual splendor, a kickstarter for the right moments in the plot, and an underlying motivation. Without Wyoming, this movie is nowhere near the same.As much as I praise the setting for this film, you do still have to knock the film a bit for the story. The unflinching storytelling-almost reminiscent of Prisoners-will work for some, and may be a slight turnoff for others looking for a more upbeat movie. That's not really the issue. Olsen and Renner run into new characters, potential suspects even, and it's pretty easy to tell from the get-go how all these encounters are going to go. To keep with the Prisoners comparison, there's no Jake Gyllenhaal to do detective work here. And to Taylor Sheridan's credit, he plays up the mood, setting, and characters to focus on them because he can't rely on a plot twist filled story to keep the audience engaged.This film really does try to replicate a lot of the successful tension built in Sicario. It works to some degree, and the filmmakers do an admirable job trying to coverup any other shortcomings this film has. It's not the best film, and it certainly isn't a joyous film, but if you're trying to think of something to watch, this is a better choice than plenty of other movies. Heck, it definitely won't put you in a merry spirit, but it's got plenty of snow to be a movie to watch over the break.

Renner makes you think about life during all the duration of the film, in some of the best lines I've seen in a long time.I don't remember the last time I liked a thriller so much. I was hesitating to give this rating, but this is so emotional, tense, surprising and well done that it's difficult to point many failures (maybe the only one is the one dimensional characterization of the killers).",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"As chilling as you'd expect, as well as powerful and significant. Sheridan does it again.","Taylor Sheridan makes his case for being one of the best working screenwriters today with ""Wind River,"" his third script to make it to the screen in three years and the first of the three that he's directed.Like ""Sicario"" and ""Hell or High Water"" before it, ""Wind River"" is a crime thriller that draws heavily upon setting and environmental factors – and the political, economic and social consequences of these factors – to tell a story. In particular, Sheridan is fascinated by situations where lawlessness thrives and what happens when the systems believed to protect us make us vulnerable to desperate, dangerously motivated and often morally corrupted people.In ""Wind River,"" that context is the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming. With complicated jurisdiction issues on top of its remote location, the effectiveness of law enforcement on Native American land has a limit, opening these regions up to violent crime that goes unpunished. Sheridan takes these circumstances and crafts such an effective genre story that its basis in truth is all the more appalling and soul-stirring.A straight-forward murder mystery, ""Wind River"" depicts the unfolding of events when a wild animal tracker (Jeremy Renner) discovers a young woman dead in the snow. When the FBI sends a young agent (Elizabeth Olsen) in from Las Vegas to investigate who obviously has no knowledge of the region, he offers to help, even though the case tugs at an unsolved crime in his personal past.Because no murder mystery could be straightforward in such a desolate and dangerous place, Sheridan equips this classic crime thriller story with numerous wrinkles and abrupt twists that directly result from the unusual circumstances of solving a crime on a Native American reservation filled with mountain lions in snowy Wyoming. But most of all, he fills out the script with character moments that speak to the emotional consequences of these unusual circumstances as well.Renner's character, Cory, for example, could have just been the cold and calculated tracker who propels the intrigue of the plot, but Cory was once married to a woman from the reservation and has deep personal ties to the people there. Olsen also could've been the classic naïve in-over-her-head officer, but much like the similar role Emily Blunt played in ""Sicario,"" she's constantly reckoning her own understanding of the world with the headaches and horrors of this case. Both actors do some of their absolute best work in this film, and it's definitely Renner's finest performance.Sheridan's script deserves a lot of that credit. The way he sees the world and articulates the ideas he pulls from his stories through dialogue borders on poetry. A scene in which Cory gives the father of the murdered woman (Gil Birmingham) advice on how to grieve is deeply moving and will feel frighteningly truthful to anyone who has ever lost someone. He gives his characters such powerful words to process the themes of the film that every key emotional scene feels like a discovery of some new rich meaning and perspective on life. At any moment his writing could become too much, and some might argue it does, but the rest of the film holds fast behind it.Although his greenness hardly impacts the film, Sheridan has room to grow as a director. The story had the potential to feel even moodier and more atmospheric and connect the viewer even deeper into the narrative through visuals, and Sheridan just never takes that extra step visually. Someone like ""Sicario"" director Denis Villeneuve would've absolutely nailed it; Sheridan is just a little too straightforward – he buries us up to our waists in snow and with a little more experience or the right director, we might have gone up to our necks. Still, the difference is negligible; maybe just between being a great film and being a Best Picture frontrunner.Above all else, ""Wind River"" has the trappings of an important film given its subject matter and the issues it raises. It's a movie that should be seen and talked about, especially because so many of the people it depicts are not.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Very quickly, this became one of my top 10 favorite films of all time","Intense drama, mystery, and action packed into a relatively short 100 minute masterpiece, Wind River is about the riddle of a dead young woman, and the volatile conditions of an often exploited tribal community bashing heads with local government, in what may be one of the last ""wild west"" tracts in the U. S. nation.Its writing is superb. The acting is amazing, everything about this film is above average. It's gripping, harsh, profound, and everybody I've ever known personally who has ever seen this film, absolutely loves it.I especially love the little camera tricks they use. Like during a certain scene amid the film's climax (to those who have seen the film, you know what part I'm talking about), the subtle camera tilt downward to draw the audiences' attention right before the moment of ""HOLY S@#!

Well Crafted and Understated Thriller,"""Wind River"" is easily one of the best mystery/thrillers to be released in years. The body of a young woman is found frozen in the wilderness of an Indian reservation and a female FBI agent teams up with a local hunter to uncover the secrets of the suspects and determine who is guilty of murder. The film is beautifully shot and well-acted by the entire cast. The director successfully conveys the somber tone from the beginning, due not just to the loss of the young woman's life but to the poverty and desperation of the locals. What stands out in this film is that it is all very real, from the dialogue to the scenery to the dim, cold surroundings. For much of the movie, the killer's identity remains a mystery, so the audience is taken along for the ride. The way the mystery unfolds is powerful and the film stays with you long after it is over.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Much more emotional than expected; it's impressive, captivating and affecting work.","'Wind River (2017)' is a much more emotional experience than pictures of the kind usually are, with time taken to ensure we empathise both with the family of the victim and with the investigators themselves rather than get caught up with the nuts-and-bolts calculation of detective work. The feature takes great care to handle its central theme of loss with an honest maturity that feels at times genuinely poignant and almost objectively true. Though the mystery aspects of the piece often seem to come second, they come second only to the excellent atmospheric and tonal work and the brilliantly well-realised characters. These really compound a tangible sense of place, allowing the icy chill of the snowy mountains to almost creep into your bones, and develop fully formed individuals that never take a step outside of themselves. Even if the mystery itself doesn't quite reach these heights, it is still supplemented by phenomenal peripheral elements which elevate every aspect of the piece right up until its near perfect end. It's seriously impressive, captivating and affecting work that solidifies this up-and-coming writer-director as a true talent to watch out for. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Highly recommended,"There will be time when you just need to some good movie that will keep you engaged till the end. Wind River is one such film. I felt good after watching this film which had everything going in its favor.Wind River tells the story of a FBI investigator (played by Elizabeth Olsen of The Avengers fame) who seeks help from a local huntsman to solve a cold-blooded murder of a 18 year girl in Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming, US.Directed by Taylor Sheridan, Wind River is a perfect crime thriller that has some wow moments. The film begins on a slow note which will eventually wrap you in its stunning visuals and interesting plot. The screenplay is crispy and will keep you hooked on to screen. The movie does have some shallow moments but it is compensated by electrifying climax and strong performance.The cinematography is eye-catching while background score gels with the mood of the film. Jeremy Renner is superb as agent Cory Lamber. The brilliant actor is ruthless when it comes to seek justice. Elizabeth Olsen proves that she is more than a eye-candy. She shows the sign of maturity and proves her credibility as an actor.Overall, I thoroughly watching Wind River and would highly recommend it. Excellent 4/5",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Solid and engrossing but a bit sluggish in parts,"'Wind River' is a well-made film with some excellent acting performances and an engaging plot. It is also visually stunning with the rural setting providing some beautiful scenic shots and contributing to what is a very atmospheric film. The characters are well-developed and the plot is convincing enough to keep the audience invested in what happens, despite the fact the film goes through a few too many dull patches.The occasional slow patch is the only real weakness of the film, but it does affect the overall flow and ability of the film to sustain tension. These parts of the film don't really contribute to the development of the story and could have been trimmed or even cut from the film entirely. However, providing you have some patience to sit through some of the duller moments, there is plenty to admire about 'Wind River'.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Wind River - Why you go to the Movies - An Excellent Film,"No spoilers. Really, really good film. A thriller. The Plot: the body of a bare foot young woman found in the snow out miles from anything or anyone on a native American reservation. The screenplay. Tight, no wasted dialog, unnecessary characters or gratuitous overly long scenes. Characters are developed, frame by frame, fun to watch. Very well cast with wonderful performances by all. The cinematography is amazing, capturing a landscape that's beautiful, stark and frightening all at once. The writer/director Taylor Sheridan wove a story that grabs you in the first 2 minutes and hold you breathless till the final credits roll. Sheridan keeps you in the film, less like you're watching the action remote and safe more like you're right there just out of frame but close enough to feel the tension, feel the dread.

A fine updating of the western genre with some social conscience,"This film is a deconstruction of the American dream, the civilizing mission and the taming of 'the west'. There's a lone lawman ( woman actually), a shoot out at the Corral (close enough), the horses take a rest while snow-mobiles ( due to snow it's basically a black and white movie) do the cross-country stuff; there's old hands (improbably old in view of the ambient mortality) and greenhorns, and, to the Europe-side viewer, too many guns in the hands of people who haven't received enough vetting. There's also hurting people ( hurting animals too), personal motivations, tragedies to live with, hesitant conversations, some psychological closeness, and on occasions, just being there. I was moved. There may have been some romance ( I blinked for a moment). I loved that Indian Martin says some obscure things while the busy highway traffic races past his isolated homestead. Even if your official position is to support the rule of law, the denouement is satisfying. An actual grown-up western. Bravo",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

This 'River' will chill you to the bone,"While a good script is usually needed for a film to be considered ""good,"" a great script can make a film memorable. Taylor Sheridan's 'Wind River' benefits from this, just as his previous screenplays have ('Hell or High Water,' 'Sicario'). The film is set in the windswept, springtime snow peaks of Wyoming, as a Native American reservation deals with a horrific crime involving the murder of a teenage girl.On its surface, 'River' is a suspenseful, somewhat procedural murder mystery thriller. At its core, 'River' is dark drama that looks at the struggles faced by Native Americans - particularly women - as they fight for survival in the desolate wilderness of the American west. Specifically, we follow the story of U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agent Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner) as he is pulled into a case that is all too familiar to him. Then, enter Vegas-based FBI agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen), who is tasked with the case, given the fact that the crime was committed on federal land, and it quickly becomes clear that she is out of her comfort zone - figuratively and literally - and must rely on Lambert to make progress.'River' is filmed beautifully, as the harsh environment inserts itself at every moment possible. The landscape and weather sets apart what could otherwise be a semi-straightforward thriller, and Renner's and Olsen's characters are visibly the mercy of the elements, which heightens the sense of excitement and danger. While the first half of 'River' is a bit slow, this build is necessary so that the climactic act has that much more of an impact, even though some of the plot that unfolds can be seen from a ways away.Aside from the obvious parts of the film that make it what it is, there are core themes that are present throughout 'River.' From dealing with loss to seeking retribution, understanding cultural differences and allowing karma to take hold, these themes are central to the film. There's also a fair amount of symbolism, with the mountain lion being somewhat of a barometer for how Renner's character evolves throughout the film. Renner and Olsen do an amazing job conveying pain and passion through their performances, and while they are the most prominent actors here, strong supporting roles including Apesanahkwat as tribal patriarch Dan Crowheart and what amounts to basically a cameo from Jon Bernthal are also important to the storyline.'Wind River' is a quiet, understated powerhouse thriller that is slowly but surely finding an audience, and it certainly deserves a number of nods come awards season, including ""Best Picture.""",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good movie. Good ending. Good performances. Bad taste?,"The story is ok, good. The scenes are often cliché, but some have interesting monologues about suffering and moving on from tragedies, etc. We get a crime and the difficulties to persecute it (geographic, weather, politics, resources, social dynamics) and a more or less slow but really well done process to unravel the truth. The acting is solid at least, with some great moments.What's the bad taste? After the movie ends, we see that a point of the movie is tell the story of the injustice that native American women suffer (and the fact that nobody is paying attention to it).
Why then the story is told by two white leads?
I get the FBI agent, totally, but why Renner then? The story is about Native Americans (and particularly women) suffering, but we experience it by Renner and Olsen, two whites, totally empathic towards these crimes. So, we kind of don't see much of that apathy towards the problem the movie is supposedly denouncing (there are a couple of lines about how the FBI won't care, but it's never clear that is more than typical bureaucracy and not something against the Native American). Also, we get the birth of a friendship/romance between them that gets in the way (more than anything because it is portrayed in the most cliché ways), and makes it lose the focus.
In the end, I still left the movie interested in the problem and subject, so the movie succeeds, even if I question some of the moves and decisions taken.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Wind River is Taylor Sheridan's directional debut and he crafted a brilliant film, a character driven neo-western with strong acting and beautiful cinematography","Taylor Sheridan, a real maestro. This is his director debut, a film he also wrote. Honestly, you can see how personal this film is to him. Sheridan has said that he wrote the film to raise awareness of the issue of the high number of Indigenous women who are raped and murdered, both on and off reservations. The screenplay is superb and a story worth telling, also his direction needs to be praised. It's a great film, a terrific neo-western thriller. Like most of his creations, if not all, the landscape and town feels like a character itself. Sheridan have made the film so rich and it helps so much in how it's filmed on location in Coalville, Fremont County, Hidden Peak, Lander, Utah Film Studios and Wind River Reservation. Making us immersed right in the first minutes of the film. What's worth noting is how Taylor Sheridan won at Cannes, Un Certain Regard for Best Director.A veteran hunter helps an FBI agent investigate the murder of a young woman on a Wyoming Native American reservation.The two lead roles are Jeremy Renner as Cory Lambert; a U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service agent, and Elizabeth Olsen as Jane Banner; a rookie FBI special agent. The supporting cast has names like Graham Greene, Gil Birmingham, Kelsey Asbille and Jon Bernthal. Bernthal has a small but important role, giving his A game like always. Elizabeth Olsen is great in this, even getting snow blindness Jeremy Renner has the best performance of the cast. But I think everyone did a phenomenal job.Nick Cave and Warren Ellis does the phenomenal musical score for this beautiful looking film. They created the musical score for Hell or High Water, a film Taylor Sheridan wrote. From the more calmer scenes to the more suspenseful scenes, these two musical geniuses created a memorable score. Something else I would call memorable and mesmerizing is Ben Richardson's cinematography, seriously top notch. The editing is too quite remarkable, whole production is. To end my review let me quote Owen Gleiberman of Variety, who described Wind River as a ""humanistic crime drama, though this one has more skill than excitement"". Yes it offers more skill as it isn't rough on the edges, but the slow pacing doesn't hurt the film, far from it. So don't go into this film thinking it will be suspenseful from start to finish, it's the well written and human conversations you should stay for, Taylor Sheridan created something of great brilliance, but action this is not. But when the more suspenseful and action scenes play out, it's brilliantly shot and over quickly, how it should be. Realism. The suspense and tension in those scenes makes it so worth your while. You see, slow pacing pays out. You'll love those moments, gripping and full of grit. I also want to add how r

"Good film, but flawed","Overall, I enjoyed this film. I liked the story, the interesting wilderness settings, the Native American angle, and the themes. They did a great job of portraying a bleak and hostile land. And Jeremy Renner puts in a solid performance in a kind of role he's accustomed to, but also quite effective in. He pretty much carries this film.The moment things first started to slip for me was with the appearance of Elizabeth Olsen. My first thought was ""oh no, not that silly Avengers girl."" I think I get why Olsen was put into this role - she's supposed to be a ""fish out of water."" But completely miscasting someone is not quite the same thing as having a good actor portray being out of their element. It's kind of like a short cut to the end and it doesn't work. I didn't find her performance believable (or good). I see this is a Weinstein produced film and will just leave it at that...The other main thing that bothered me about the film was the inconsistency with the winter shots. While film production in winter is extremely difficult, I felt that some of the issues were preventable. It doesn't actually go from complete overcast and a blizzard to blue sky, calm and sunny in 10 minutes anywhere that I know of on earth. And when it's actually cold out, you can see people's breath. See ""Fargo"" as an example of a film that pulls off winter production well.Despite these things, this remains one of the better films I've seen this year.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Wind River: The Old-World  Cowboy and the New-World FBI Agent,"I've often wondered, in the bleak and a-moral world that we live in, what would the morally 'good' John Wayne or James Arness-type of cowboy do in the face of rapists, child killers and bad men and women who escape justice through pleas of insanity of mental disorder? In Jeremy Renner's Cory Lambert we get the hint of an answer. A tough cowboy and 'hunter of predators', Renner encapsulates both the straight-down-the-middle 'good guy' western hero and the complex pathos-driven study in masculinity that emerged in post-John Wayne cinema. Not that Renner's could be described as soft, indeed the pathos and tragedy that motivates him is potent and the means through which he channels this pain creates a 'new' cowboy who is the perfect combination of traditional and contemporary sensibilities.Elizabeth Olsen's Jane Banner provides the chink of light shining from the modern outside world into this Western microcosm which straddles both the 'Wild West' frontier and a Trump-ruled America in its savagery and desperation. Her hero is our doorway into the frozen landscapes of Wyoming and it is through her eyes and her compassion that the viewer can begin to process the tragedy and sadness that permeates Wind River. The FBI agent perfectly balances against the old world cowboy, both characters are reflections of each other in their strength, compassion and tenacity.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Unexpected.,"Renner might not have been the best fit for this character.Olsen is underused.The third act unravels a bit to fast for my liking. The limited runtime tries to keep it compact but if you know everything that's going to happen with still 25 minutes to go, it's not ideal.I was very surprised by Jon Bernthal. Had no billing and did his usual act. Solid tho. As always.But THAT scene is what elevates this movie above average.Sure, it's clichéed. Sure, it doesn't brake any new ground. But it's well choreographed, well lit, well acted and adds immense emotional depth. The plotholes on the other hand diminish the viewing experience a bit.You don't have to live in super rural, mountainous terrain to know some things don't add up.If we had a better Renner, a more intricate plot with some more content/context and a less stereotypical ending/message, this could have been great.Without that, still a good watch.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Different authorities and their jurisdictions are another problem; when there is nothing left but to go to the FBI, a young and inexperienced agent arrives to find realities that she does not even imagine .. she will be helped by a local hunter who carries with his own pains; together they will go on an adventure that will involve more than solving a crime .

All the mistery around the death of this young woman is fantastic, it delivers to you in such a flow way.

I don't if was a attempt to pass some message using the camera or something (because in some other parts in the movie, we see some different use of camera too, but there, makes sense).

Given that Sicario was foreboding, with a tension that didn't let up, and unforgettable, I thought Wind River might also satisfy. I was right. Wind River grips your heart from start to finish. The magnitude of the tension generated is bewildering it is so masterfully created that it emerges as if it is merely a by- product. The acting is astonishing, extremely well cast, with a script that is plain speaking, intensely intimate, efficient and integral - ""you didn't see it, did you?"".

Never really got started,"What can I say? Expected big things but was pretty disappointed. The only redeeming part was performance of Jeremy Renner, but rest of acting was poor. Lead actress (Olsen) was supposed to be a fully trained and competent FBI agent, but behaved more like a prom princess with a nervous disposition. Storyline was confusing and a lot of pointless scenes. Ending was good but had to wait 1 hr 40 m for that. I have rated 4/10.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Excellent thriller,Beautifully captured to film and a great slow burn story with good acting and great directing.It was some of the best acting I've seen Jeremy and Elizabeth do so far...all the actors nailed their roles. And I'm glad it was not another unrealistic Hollywood film where the leads just have to fall in love just because it thinks it has to. They avoided that cliché by giving them realistic dialog.I look forward to seeing more from the director.,9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Rating: A-,"I will start with Jeremy Renner because he undoubtedly steals the show. He is able to transform himself into an entirely different person, consequently delivering his career-best performance. Renner proves that he is more than just a mere superhero, he is a highly capable actor who brings out an astonishingly emotional display.Cory Lambert's script helps a lot Renner's performance since Taylor Sheridan's writing is, as usual, brilliant. Cory has an extremely disturbing and tragic past which the audience only understands near the beginning of the third act, hence elevating the character's backstory into something much more intriguing.The screenplay is wonderfully written. Sheridan is effective in avoiding forced exposition scenes with sharp dialogues, every conversation feels genuine. Additionally, some fantastic character development scenes support a truly captivating story that never has a dull moment due to its pretty well-controlled pacing and tone.If the writing is not enough for you to appreciate Sheridan's talent, then his work as the director will surely convince you. The action-heavy third act is amazingly filmed, it is packed with some unbelievable shootout and chasing scenes, including some flawless editing that helps the film's overall flow.The cinematography (Ben Richardson) feels as real as it could be, the setting is just beautiful and its colors brighten up the movie. Finally, the soundtrack really captures the environment of the snow mountains with some memorable tracks accompanying the narrative.This is one of the best films of this year, but I still have some issues with it. My main problem with the screenplay is based on the mystery itself, ""who killed the girl""? Even though this is a character-driven movie, its build-up surrounding the murder loses some of its impact when the moment of truth is finally revealed. The characters related to the killing feel a bit cliché and too superficial, so I do feel somewhat disappointed.You are probably wondering why I didn't write about Elizabeth Olsen yet. Well, that is because I have a nit-picky thing with her character. Olsen is great, she truly is! She gives a very compelling and passionate performance that will definitely offer her more opportunities for bigger projects in the near future.However, I think her character could have been given a more solid backstory to help the audience connect better with her. Jane Banner is far from the ""damsel in distress"" cliché, in fact, she is able to stand her own against her attackers, but I find her essence very shallow.All in all, Wind River is one of my favorite movies of 2017! Jeremy Renner has his best performance yet and Elizabeth Olsen amazingly supports him, despite her character's simple background. Taylor Sheridan elevates everyone and everything with his marvelous writing and skillful direction. Stunning cinematography, an extraordinary score, a great protagonist and an extremely captivating story that never fails to entertain its viewers.MSB Reviews - If you enjoy this review, please follow my blog :)",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Fantastic Movie,"This is almost a ten, the only reason its a 9 is because IMDb don't allow half marks. I don't want to say too much about this movie other than its absolutely fantastic and easily worthy you time - what a refreshing surprise after being so disappointed with the drivel I have watched churned out of the Hollywood machine for most of the year.Taylor Sheridan has now written Sicario, Hell or High Water and now this movie, putting him among the best writers in Hollywood and as great films go 3 for 3. Wind River is beautifully shot, great writing and the two leads played by Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olson are really top notch.When March 2018 comes around and its ""Oscar time"", don't be surprised at all to see this movie nominated in at least one category.

The second amendment where it's needed,"Out in the wilderness of Wyoming you need a gun to keep you safe from predators, in the city you need a gun to help you rob banks,shoot cops, shoot co-workers and shoot innocent schoolkids. In both environments lots of people end up dead because of the hair trigger mentality of American Culture. The major scene in this movie validates that mentality.Jeremy Renner is a perfect fit for his role as the Fish and Wildlife officer, he has to carry a gun to deal with those predators I mentioned.All of the others carry weapons to deal with the human predators that tend to inhabit remote, cold,snowy places. And so the story of murder and mayhem unfolds in front of a glorious backdrop of white snow and black mountains , a metaphor for the good and the bad in the world. It's not a particularly gripping story but it's fleshed out with depictions of the harsh life of Indian Reserves and the total hopelessness of the reserve system. Violence booze, drugs, the three main food groups for trouble are present in everyone's lives in sparsely populated communities it seems, moreso than the big city.Gil Birmingham is the Indian given the task of trying to absorb, explain and deal with these hardships but in the end it is the fish and wildlife guy who helps him manage the journey.It's a movie that's got me thinking and that's a good way to assess it. The scenery is, of course, glorious and the cast is up to the job but they don't have a knockout punch. Like somebody else mentioned, I had trouble with the sound quality, I first thought it was because of my declining faculties but having someone else mention it has cancelled my appointment with the hearing specialist. You'll watch it, enjoy it and then forget it , it's that kind of movie Cheers BillC",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Wind River: An Excellent Movie.,"Taylor Sheridan has the gift of creating catching stories, which is writers' most valuable quality: an ability you could simply have or have not.So even if the cast was exceptionally good and everybody did great, you can't help but notice his script, his direction and the atmosphere he created.The present title is a thriller (just like 'Hell or High Water'), full of lovely and endearing characters.

When the action does come it is hard-hitting and shockingly real.There is not much of a mystery here, don't expect too much of a breadcrumb chase through the woods.The film does take its time and isn't particularly complicated, and may leave some feeling a little underwhelmed.This is well acted and produced, great camera work.

"An atmospheric, snow-covered murder mystery that uncoils into a classic","'Wind River' dispatches the audience into a chilly location and into the heart of a missing person's investigation. From the outset it is clear the real star is the setting, a place equally bleak, atmospheric and stunning. As the setting gradually ensnares you into its murder mystery, Taylor Sheridan's skill as a writer and director begins to take hold, and 'Wind River's deliberate pace makes the unfolding events, well-written drama, and atmospheric violence all the more rewarding and powerful. Best described as a snow-covered western, 'Wind River' escalates towards a satisfying conclusion, and the quality on display from the acting and writing suggest big things to come for Taylor Sheridan, in what is arguably an instant classic of woven genres. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Worthwhile and thought provoking, both in what it gets right and what could have been","I loved Sicario and Hell or High Water and I overall am glad I finally watched this film as well. It has a compelling story and also relays an important message about the very real national problem of the disappearances of Native American women. The film uses its central mystery to draw us into a broader reflection of the beauty of the reservation, both in the culture and natural beauty within, which are inseparable from each other. But it is also a tragedy, both in the crime against the life of a woman and the historic crime that my country committed against her people, taking their land and so much of their culture. So I appreciate this film and its sensitivity. I would like to see more media exploring these themes.Jeremy Renner does a great job playing the wise hunter, grieving his own daughter's death under unresolved circumstances. Some of his monologues are a bit forced feeling, but there is a real poetry to his words which is a hallmark of Taylor Sheridan's style.However, throughout the film I couldn't help thinking of how whites are always in the foreground. In a film about Native Americans, I felt myself continuously wanting to see how the Natives themselves were reacting themselves to the events. If there were an equivalent of the Bechdel test for Native American characters, this film would fail in the sense that there are no scenes not portrayed outside of the view of white actors. Again, as I said, I appreciated the sensitivity of Renner's performance, and the film shows brief flashes of consciousness of the inherent irony of a white man being the protagonist of a film about crimes against Native women.Still, I feel this film squandered a chance to use a Native lead. It tries to sidestep it by having him as the father of Native children, but I just couldn't help cringing as he explained to the bereaved father about how to grieve his daughter, and to the drug-addled brother about how to clean himself up and pick himself up by his bootstraps.As a white man, I am accustomed to films where someone who looks like me is the savior, from Dances with Wolves and Last of the Mohicans to The Last Samurai and even Avatar. These themes have already been explored at length. This film does a good job at highlighting the historic crimes that my people committed (and continue to commit) against Native Americans, but I would like to see more celebrating the survival of Natives and seeking answers from their culture, rather than merely offering advice.This film is powerful and worthwhile as a reflection on the beauty and sadness of the West, but it would have been a true classic for me if it had taken more risk in its storytelling, getting viewers like me out of our comfortable bubble of white lead actors. Because it seeks to profile a current problem, the disappearance of Native American women, as a continuation of the historic crime against their people, they should be able to be more active participants in the narrative rather than supporting actors.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I agent who turns up at the deep set wintery Wyoming Indian reservation camp after the local wild life officer (Jeremy Renner) finds a teenage girl dead in the snow in the middle of nowhere & the autopsy reveals she was raped. Wind River is a very dark & serious Murder Mystery Thriller & one that is very deeply emotional & full of despair & sadness surrounding this poor teen girls horrible death & rape & Elizabeth Olsen (Avengers: Infinity War, Avengers: End Game) gives an incredibly passionate performance as the Agent out of her depth in a place full of rugged, tough & secretive hard men & she stands her ground & delivers a strong minded, smart & kick-ass character performance with a big heart. Olsen is excellent.Jeremy Renner gives the performance of his Career here, truly an Oscar worthy performance as the rugged local Animal wildlife officer & expert hunter but with such an emotional & tragic back story & Renner is outstanding & shows what an incredible actor he truly is & gives it his all in his sensitive, smart, deeply hurt performance with eyes that have seen too much horror & a simmering rage that burns beneath his calm exterior & it's a performance that will stay with you long after the fantastic gripping ending!!! For me, Renner gives one of the best performances in Cinema history.Jeremy Renner is truly one of the greatest actors working today & yet i still think he's way underrated in my opinion but he is a true ""Movie Star"" he has that quality to him, it's hard to explain but i see him & think MOVIE STAR, a real MOVIE STAR!!!The story here is drenched in very scary realism & was based on an actual real life event so that grim darkness hangs over the movie & fills everything with a sense of dread & sadness.What happened to the teenage girl is horrific & what happened to her boyfriend is horrific & that's all i can say as this is a Mystery movie with outstandingly raw & powerful performances.The freezing cold & blizzard filled bleak Wilderness of the Wyoming landscape is so dangerous & creates suspense just from our two heroes going out to investigate, it's expertly Directed & beautifully photographed.The music is raw & full of sadness.Not a film i could watch alot though because of it's dark subject matter & some scenes (Rape) are horrible to watch but i love the Vigilante action that comes later on & i totally agree with it because sometimes the law isn't enough for the Evil that Men do!!!Shocking, Suspenseful, Gripping, Scary & Powerful.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Simple but Enjoyable,"When a murder takes place, people try to solve it.There is something very formulaic about this film, with its plot and characters, that may confuse viewers wanting something ""fresh"" or ""different."" Trust me, if you've seen a crime show you'll only be surprised by the lack of twists and turns. This is not a thriller or a mystery or suspenseful at all, aside from certain well-crafted moments. Wind River uses beautiful backdrops and scenery to tell the most basic story I've seen recently, but it does it well. The acting seems better than the direction as the actors do not seem at fault for some weird or mixed up reactions, as they are acted well. It just seems the director chose to have some characters act in strange or random ways and it takes away from drama that's trying to be established. The dialogue is clunky at parts but otherwise crisp.I will briefly mention that this movie tries to raise awareness for native American missing persons' cases but I think it misses the mark on any actual exploration of native Americans troubles or culture or anything really, it more so just states their presence in the film. I'm not sure if it wanted to do more than that anyway but, if so, any message is muddled in the end product. They probably didn't want to say anything substantial considering the two leads aren't native American. The film uses native Americans sort of as a backdrop for a conventional crime story. I guess the statistic is a nice thing to add but there were more interesting facts about native American struggles in the IMDB trivia.This movie gets a 6 mainly because I think it didn't have ambition for its plot or characters. It's well done in the effects and setting while the characters are two-dimensional but well-realized. Most scenes accomplish their goals in terms of story-telling but the emotions evoked were little to none and, maybe it was just the snow, but by the end my mind was blank on what to take away from this.

Cons:
Plot holes you could drive a semi into
character development non-existent
anti women 
ridiculous dialogue that stops any story telling rather than furthers it
demeaning female characters that cry for help and do stupid things that get them hurt, raped or killed and it's hard to feel pity when you are acting like an absolute idiot without the common sense of a squirrel
Lead male role tries to force nuggets of wisdom, that sound like he's quoting from the inside of a snapple cap
FBI does not know the first thing about law enforcement or the law itself.
Lead female role spent all her money training to be an FBI agent, graduating from Quantico and could be out performed by a strip mall rent a cop.

"Thoughtful, moody - AND GOOD - murder Mystery","The back 1/2 of August has traditionally been a dumping ground for bad motion pictures.  One exception to this was last year when the deserved Oscar nominated film HELL OR HIGH WATER was released (if you still haven't caught up with this, I highly recommend you do).  So when I saw that the writer of HHW, Taylor Sheridan, was coming out with another modern sheriff murder mystery, I was intrigued to say the least.And, I am happy to report, that this film did not disappoint.  While it is not at the level of HHW, it certainly is a thoughtful, provocative murder mystery that is a refreshing change from the normal SuperHero, GGI-fests that festoon the cineplex throughout the course of the summer months.Written and Directed by Sheridan (the screenwriter of HHW and SICARIO), WIND RIVER tells the tale of a murder on the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming.  Coming in to investigate is young, city girl, Florida native, Elizabeth Olsen who teams up with aTribal Police Captain (Graham Greene) and a veteran tracker (Jeremy Renner) to find out what happened.This could have been a by-the-book murder mystery with the naive, ""fish-out-of-water"" Olsen learning to love and understand the world she is thrust into, but in the hands (and pen) of Sheridan, it is much, much more.  Sheridan creates a mood throughout this film, one of slow, lingering dread and hopelessness - and how he accomplishes this was intriguing to me.  He uses the setting of the Indian Reservation to show the ""smallness"" of the people living there, juxtaposing scenes of vast, wild, cold wilderness with scenes of squalor in the settlement of Native American people living there.The acting is solid - Olsen is turning into a very good actress and her performance sets the right tone.  Greene is, as always, a steady hand on the screen with a pragmatic approach to the inhabitants of the Reservation, but it is Jeremy Renner as the quiet, taciturn tracker who has a loss of his own that parallels the murder investigation, that shines.  I've always liked Renner and was high on his potential after his breakout performance in THE HURT LOCKER in 2008.  While his performances in the blockbusters that followed have been solid, but not spectacular - you saw glimpses of it in films like THE TOWN - but I've felt that he never quite lived up to that potential - until now.  This is a very strong performance (falling just short of Oscar material) but one that anchors this film and mirrors the mood that Sheridan sets up through the location of WIND RIVER.Not the fastest moving of films, but a thoughtful, intelligent mystery that left me grateful for a film with some meat on the bone after a summer of ""Cotton Candy"" action flicksLetter Grade:  B+8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Interesting but incomplete,"""Wind River"" has a strong sense of authenticity. The performances are uniformly strong. Set primarily on the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming during winter, the background and characters are interesting. Dialogue is strong. And yet, the movie seems incomplete and somewhat dissatisfying, particularly compared with the writer's previous ""Sicario.""Part of the problem stems from a muddled dramatic perspective. The film begins with a shot of the victim fleeing some unidentified threat with a voice-over reading a poem, which we assume she wrote. But later, we learn the poem was actually written by somebody else entirely, who may have been a victim of a similar fate. Later, we abandon the story's linear timeline for a flashback of the crime from an omniscient observer's perspective, which undermines the whole detective story angle by giving the audience superior information in the middle of the movie. To further complicate matters, most of the potential witnesses are abruptly killed in a shootout that doesn't make a whole lot of sense in terms of character motivations. Fortunately, our intrepid amateur sleuth can figure out what happened from tracks in the snow, despite the fact that it's been snowing intermittently for days since the crime.Further detracting from the story is the over-reliance on jiggly-cam shots. Somehow, I imagine a skinny eleven-year-old kid struggling to hold a twenty-kilo camera steady. The shots aren't quite as unsteady as the cellphone videos posted on Facebook, but it looks as if the camera operator used a self-balancing skateboard instead of a Steadicam rig.The movie leaves several loose ends untied. Solving the crime should give the protagonist some sort of closure regarding the death of his daughter which should have some positive impact on his relationship with his son, but it's left open. The romance angle is left dangling. Perhaps I missed something, but it's not clear if there was some relationship between the victim and the protagonist's daughter or the poem. We're not quite certain what happened to the lions.

"Polished, but raw and gritty","I only review movies that leave either a good or bad impression; I don't bother with ""meh"". I watched this twice, as I'm sure others have as well... it's so well done in all aspects (particularly the acting), that I give this a two thumbs up.Reiner as a mountain man/guide/bush expert really pulls this one off with ease. He a natch in this role so much that it elevated my respect for his acting, and that's after a hats-off to him in Hurt Locker. He's underrated.There was more genuine, believable acting on everyone's part than there was anything that you could criticize as cliche or formulaic. Elizabeth Olsen's role as a naive, almost bumbling FBI agent was a nice touch to the serious tone of the movie. Some important archetypal plot nuances kept me very captivated as the story unfolded. In the end, I was cheering for the sector of indigenous women that are abused... but no spoilers here.I have this flic on archival media, cuz, well - it's a huge winner for me.

Sadly undelivering thriller which fails to make the most of its potential,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningA young woman is found dead in a snowy enclave in a Native American reservation. Completely isolated and cut off from the outside world, it falls to embittered local game tracker Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner) and FBI agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen) to get to the bottom of the case. However, as professional tensions between the locals and the national agents, as well as the wall of silence that seems to build around the residents, intensifies, it proves to be more difficult than a standard hunt.A good several years after his feature length 2011 debut, Taylor Sheridan returns to the helm with this moody, atmospheric thriller, based around true events. Diving into the heart of the reclusive, insular Native American reservations, we enter a snow-covered, out of bounds netherworld, that in itself sets the scene for an effective backdrop on which to set a brooding, suspenseful thriller. What we end up with is a film that plays doggedly to conventions, although unfortunately in a fairly generic, standard way, that squanders its chance to make the most of its potential.Truth quite often tends to make for more compelling filmmaking than fiction, and so WR had even more chance to make the most of what it promised. Sadly, it just plays out like a connect the dots affair, obeying all the genre conventions despite having more opportunity than most to delve beyond these. It has the look and feel of your average TV movie, despite its A list Hollywood stars, and to about that level of quality. Somehow, no genuine air of suspense or tension is created in regards finding out what caused the dead girl's fate, and so the core of the film is unfortunately rotted.Performances wise, lead stars Renner and Olsen suit their roles, and fit into their skin better than any other performers who spring to mind. It's just a shame they didn't have more satisfying material to work with. **",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Life in a Indian Reservation,"This movie is not about a investigation of a murder, it's about life in Indian Reservation in Wyoming.

What is tougher then growing in Wyoming is growing up in Indian Reservation. Yes, they have their own laws and own land, but what kinda land is that? What if they don't have people to carry out the law? They're left on their own, no one thinks about them, no one cares about them and no one wants to help them.

Snow job.,"Jeremy Renner delivers a fine performance and the state of Wyoming looks magnificent in this hackneyed disappointment of a murder mystery that sulks from beginning to end. Sloppy and improbable it stumbles more than once as it injects statement, upending a rhythm that is near moribund to begin with a cast of characters snowbound in blues.Corey Lambert (Renner) is Wyoming game warden trying to balance the predator population in Wyoming when he comes across the body of 18 year Natalie Hanson, dead from hypothermia but while running from something in the process. With the death occurring on tribal land FBI agent Jane Banner (Liz Olsen) is assigned to sought things out but makes a less than impressive debut that she more than makes up for with some deadly shooting, take charge tough talk as well as withstand half a can of mace sprayed in her face without mussing hair or make-up. Eventually they get around to dropping by the prime suspects place. At this point the already sputtering story stalls momentarily to play with time and tenderness and in doing so obliterate the meager tension remaining before resuming the earlier aborted climax killing carnage that auteur Taylor Sheridan interrupts to jam a strong woman statement in. It rings hollow (much of the blame belonging to the limited and miscast Olsen) and drains the outcome of impact to go along with a busy Lambert in the film's final minutes sun setting with three different characters.As the credits role Sheridan makes another pitch for the plight of women on reservations but it does not assuage the fact Wind River is a clumsy, gratuitously violent piece of sadism made even more distasteful by a concern that is meant to purchase license for his slipshod mayhem and murky funk.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Jeremy, Elizabeth and directing carried the movie, in that order .","Wind River.A wildlife officer, who is haunted by a tragedy that happened because of him, teams up with an FBI agent in solving a murder of a young woman on a Wyoming Native American reservation and hopes to get redemption from his past regrets.Well, watching this movie right after watching Zodiac felt kind of risky, but this one holds up in a really good way, it is a crime mystery / thriller and inspired by true events either so here where the comparison came from.However, as I said before this is very good movie comparing it or not, it is very fun to watch, the mystery and the action is there and most importantly it just doesn't try to give much details, it just hits you in the face with the truth .Revealing the truth was the best part of the film, it was well-placed and well-made yet it is enough to have Jon Bernthal in it to be great .Directing was very good, I really liked the locations ...

"Wonderful, sad, hopeful","I don't like snowy scenes. I don't like noble Native American movies. I don't like token hard-bitten female FBI agent movies. I loved this movie. I did not feel warm the entire time this movie was on the air. I loved that every person from the reservation had both virtues and flaws, just like the white FBI agent. I loved that the FBI agent was not one cape short of a superhero and did her best to play the hand she was dealt. I know, I know, there are a couple of plot holes in terms of procedure, but I tend to suspend disbelief a bit because without these issues in procedure, there's no movie.The cinematography was outstanding. The script, while not perfect, was spare and dramatic that sounded ""real"" when spoken. The emotions were close to pitch-perfect. My biggest complaint, I think, was that events toward the end fell into place a little too neatly, making for a slightly weak ending. I would definitely watch this movie again, which is a big deal for me with most movies made after 1985 or so. Most modern movies don't make my ""rewatch"" list at all.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

No. It's pretty dark and has many confronting themes, even for a movie of its kind. But it was satisfying. The final act was jaw on the floor type stuff - I definitely let out an audible ""wow"" during the last 20 minutes.And then to top it all off, it's inspired by actual events and highlighted the plight of the many missing Native American women whom no statistics are recorded for.Powerful.

The bleak story is one of form, function and setting meld together.Sheridan is quite a gifted writer and he hits it out of the park again. This script, and especially the ending, functions as a murder mystery, a northern western and as an expose on a current issue. There is a bitter irony that this film was largely overlooked when it came out given its subject matter. The ending and climax is absolutely perfect.

Slow and cold with amazing performances.,"This movie took me quite by surprise. On paper the story seems thin, but it will surprise you how things turn out in this film.
We have seen Jeremy Renner does great performances before, but here he is absolutely fantastic playing a wise but broken and still standing hunter who teams up with a young fresh-out-of-training FBI Agent (Olsen), to nest up and solve a murder of a young girl. Olsen also gives a highly convincing portrayal of a city-girl lost in the cold woods of the Wyoming mountains, and both Renner and Olson shows a sparkling chemistry together. Olsen being curious, Renner with a torn past. It works so well.
Writing is brilliant and directing by Sheridan is also rock solid. This movie was quite a hidden gem with little publicity around it and should be one of those you should see someday.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

It is grim, violent, brutally depressing at times but if I can sum it up in one word it would be honest. It just felt like a stand up honest movie. A frighteningly realistic plot with some amazing performances. Renner in particular, this really is his best performance to date. What I also kept seeing throughout the movie was the image of Renner's cowboy interacting with the native americans and having true love and friendship. Showing that people from all different backgrounds can be friends, share emotions and grief and help each other. It's one of those movies that will stick with you for a while, it has done for me.

I expected quality and pretty much received it,"Being a fan of Taylor Sheridan's Sicario and Hell or High Water, I expected the same level of suspense, drama, believable characters and cinematography. By and large I received this. He is setting a high bar for himself.A big positive is a great cast, from the smaller roles to the two main leads. Jeremy Renner at his most comfortable, almost downplaying his character to accommodate Elizabeth Olsen who, yet again, absolutely compounds my belief she has a great career ahead of her. She needs more leading roles with a decent script and complex characters, without a doubt. She is wasted in the blockbuster movies such as the Avengers and Godzilla (but I guess they pay the bills!). I will be seeking her out in Kodachrome with haste.People may say she was given a meek, 'rabbit caught in the headlights' role here. I feel this isn't really the point, just simply the opportunity to tell a story of a character becoming stronger, not a super hero, just stronger.Wind River sets the tone for a bleak, dare I say, boring, setting of a reservation with a 'wild west like' lawless nature. It then plays out a well paced whodunnit thriller. I rarely say this but I actually feel it could have benefited from 10-15 mins added to the runn time to flesh out the plot line further. Or maybe I feel that way simply because I was enjoying it so much?The script was concise and I can't think of a scene I thought was superfluous to the plot. No mean feat in a modern film. A sign of a good editor.Sadly, it is by no means perfect. I feel more could have been made of the injustices taken place on the reservation and the poor treatment of Native Americans. Also, there were a couple of scenes with a shaky cam which I cannot believe was purposeful, if so, it was unnecessary and distracting.The film left me damning myself for not making the time to see this in the cinema, I know for a fact I would have enjoyed it more.This is everything the recent 'The Snowman' should have been.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Wind River is gritty, depressing and utterly thrilling.","Taylor Sheridan...I think I love you. Though this is not his directorial debut, it's the first film where he both directed and wrote the screenplay. A murder mystery set on the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming where the incident might be more of a personal journey than first anticipated for our lead characters. And what a journey this is! It's dark, broody and full of tension around every corner. What Sheridan has done is intricately create not just a thrilling investigation but one that evokes pain and suffering. Through experiencing loss of life, a wildlife tracker who assists the FBI agent undertakes an opportunity to redeem himself. An absurdly visceral and poignant tale that is so emotionally raw that it filled my soul with melancholia. These characters are so hard hitting and complex that I found myself absorbed by these compelling individuals. The screenplay is infused with convincing dialogue that allows the characters to be natural, nothing ever felt forced. No line or word was out of place, not a single one. It was like poetry. Shakespeare even. I succumbed to the words as much as I did to the performances. Jeremy Renner, yet again, gives an understated performance and proves his is still an underrated actor. He was enigmatic. A multiple layered performance where I could see the internal suffering just from his eyes alone. Elizabeth Olsen holds her own in a more physically demanding role. The inclusion of Native American actors enhances the authenticity of the environment, and all performances felt real. Sheridan's directing style felt intuitional, admired how he filmed at a distance within the foliage to allow the landscape to fuel the tension. An extremely harsh environment, but captured beautifully. I only wished that the film was longer, the investigation itself was solved too quickly which did detract on the excitement factor. However, Wind River is a paradoxical thriller. A small convincing murder mystery but vast in scale. One of the best of the year.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen give terrific performances here and show a lot of chemistry on screen. Do yourself a favor and don't miss this one. Put it on your must watch list!

"A deeply disturbing, solid thriller","Having written brilliant scripts for Sicario and Hell or High Water, Taylor Sheridan tries his hand at directing with Wind River, of which he also wrote. It is clear now that Sheridan has a unique talent for creating harsh and isolating landscapes (both somatically and mentally), and for writing engaging narratives based on such settings.Wind River is the setting for the film's story. An American Indian Reservation in Wyoing, this is where wildlife hunter officer Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner) discovers the body of a young Native American woman Natalie Hanson (Kelsey Asbille). She is found barefoot and hardly with any warm winter clothes on. Upon much examination, Cory deduces that she died as a result of a condition called pulmonary haemorrhage. In less scientific terms, that is bleeding from the lungs, caused here by breathing in too much cold air too soon.Cory is joined by young FBI agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen), who is sent to Wind River to investigate Natalie's death. She is ill- equipped and clueless about surviving the harsh conditions of Wind River but she is determined to solve the crime. Cory and Jane make an effective team together, as both can relate to Natalie's death in their own way. Cory lost his daughter a few years ago and her body was also discovered in the snow. Jane is perceived as young and vulnerable, much like Natalie. They found a clue that Natalie's boyfriend Matt (Jon Bernthal), who works as a security guard at an oil drilling site may have some information.The film is effective at slowly building up curiosity and Sheridan finds the impeccable balance between character development and storytelling. For most of the film, it carries a pervasive sinister tranquility, which is later interrupted by sudden outbursts of violence. Despite the uncensored brutality of the violence, for us, the chilling factor lies in the profound psychological impact. As we found out what happened to Natalie through a cleverly placed flashback, it is absolutely terrifying. Having been introduced and acquainted to the unforgiving nature of the winter landscape, we wonder what could push Natalie so far that she would flee outside, barefoot. Although it is anticipated something dreadful is going to happen, I still couldn't help but feeling sick to the stomach.Wind River is portrayed as a land with vast open spaces. Normally, this would usually signify freedom and free will, but we feel trapped and very claustrophobic. Sheridan also adds another emotional layer where he deals with themes of loss and despair. It doesn't feel entirely hopeless, as he injects some degree of warmth and sensitivity into the story. Natalie's father Martin (Gil Birmingham) is a friend of Cory's, and together they navigate through the tremendous grief of losing their daughters. Both men have been hardened by the external environment they reside in, but within, they are gentle and deeply lost. They are men who are not afraid to express their grief, and are desperately trying to scavenge enough hope to live through the next day.What I realised in this film is that everything that happens is consequential. The unrelentingly cruel environment imposes disturbing effects on the human psyche, which in turn transforms man into unleashing terror. Tragedy strikes, and the overwhelming grief then leads man into unpredictable acts. Who here is the true evil? Is it the scathing coldness of the landscape around us or does it merely reflect our true nature?

Jeremy Renner character is a standout in this,"(2017) Wind River
MYSTERY THRILLERWritten and directed by Taylor Sheridan as it opens with an Indian woman with just her bare feet, running across a snow field, before the movie then switches to 'fish and wildlife' preserver Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner) who shoots and kills a wolf in order to save a herd of sheep. He then visits his ex, Julia (Julia Jones) to pick up and spend time with his 7 or 8 year old son, Casey (Teo Briones). He then drives young Casey to an Indian reservation called ""Wind River"" -hence the title, to see his grandfather, Dan (Apesanahkwat). And upon Cory chatting with Dan, he tells him they're lions around killing his some of his herd of sheep. And because Cory works in fish and wildlife, he goes and checks it out by following where the lion tracks may lead, and stumbles onto a dead body. And it was the same young Indian woman we saw at the opening, and we find out her name is Natalie Hanson. The only lone FBI, Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen) is sent to lead the investigation, with the help of Cory because he is an experienced tracker and the assistance of Tribal police chief, Ben Shoyo (Graham Greene) . And we find out that Cory used to know the victim quite well, as Natalie used to be friends with his already deceased daughter, Emily that may have resulted to the break up of his marriage. Natalie also has a pot headed brother, Chip (Martin Sensmeier) who lives with the Littlefeather boys of Sam and Bart, as well as a white boyfriend, named Matt, who works as one of the security guards at an oil drilling site as the investigation becomes much more complicated as soon as his body been discovered at a snow bank, also dead.The movie is somewhat reminiscent of ""Thunderheart"" from 1992 with the only difference is that I liked and identified the Jeremy Remmer character in this than I did when Val Kilmer was as FBI agent, and that at the same token, I question how ill equipped Native authorities are. I also think this is a better movie than ""Thunderheart"" even though both are about the same subject of mistreatment of Native Americans in general served as a backdrop.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Murder mystery on a wintery Reservation in Wyoming,"RELEASED IN 2017 and written & directed by Taylor Sheridan, ""Wind River"" chronicles events at the remote Wind River Indian Reservation where a curiously barefooted young Native woman is found dead in the wilderness; a Fish & Wildlife tracker (Jeremy Renner) and an FBI agent (Elizabeth Olsen) team-up to solve the mystery. Graham Greene plays the Reservation police chief, Gil Birmingham appears as the victim's grieving father and Jon Bernthal & James Jordan are on hand as security guards at a drill site. There are several others.The film is based on hundreds of actual stories similar to it. The issue of assault against Native women on Reservations, many mysteriously disappearing, has existed since the inception of the Reservation system, but in the past 15-20 years it has exploded and yet gets no attention, which was the motivation for the film. In ages past the tribes (e.g. Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho) would migrate out of the area during the unrelenting winters, but the Reservation system basically forces the tribespeople to permanently stay where people weren't meant to live year round (or so it is argued).This is a straight-forward crime drama/murder mystery/thriller taking place completely in wintery conditions in the remote modern American West. The story starts kind of dull, but interest slowly builds until everything eventually explodes in the second half. If you like stories where the clues slowly lead to the culprit/culprits you'll probably like this movie. Renner is a quality taciturn Westerner and likable Olsen with her cutie face & figure is strong on the female front. The action scenes are effective because they're sudden & realistic and not over-the-top cartoonish.THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 47 minutes and was shot in Utah (Coalville and Park City Studios) and Wyoming (Wind River Reservation, Fremont County and Lander).GRADE: A-",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Under the radar low key real and overwhelmingly beautiful,"I lost my daughter at birth, a still born gift. So I know existential pain, what it feels like when your soul bottoms out and sorrow that never leaves your side. This movie is so incredibly real in its raw emotions, the need to look away from the black hole in front of you because otherwise you will lose the will to live, the devastating effect such a loss has on your relationship, most of which don't make it after such a loss. And the need to look your grief in the eyes in order to survive and to be able to be with the one you lost, to be able to remember her. The author must have experienced loss himself to be able to build a narrative so up close with the hard and cold loneliness of grief, the inability to share when you are grieving, and only being able to reach out once that black thick wave has subsided. And the acting is sublime, the score is so fitting, scenery is amazing. All wrapped up in a pace of storytelling that seemingly gives you time to catch your breath yet often times so overwhelmingly intense you forget to breathe.So well worth it, what a gift...",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
great movie but,Why do they have to shake the camera while shooting? Absolutely hate it. I was feeling dizzy 10 minutes into the film.

May make you sick'.The fact that it uses lots of zoom-in close-ups is making it worse.,5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
In Deep Water,"The opening titles declare ""Wind River"" to be ""inspired by actual events."" The opening scene is a protracted one of an Indian girl—barely an adult—running then crawling across an open expanse of snow, trying to make the tree line as she recites in her mind a poem of hers: ""A Meadow in My Perfect World."" The poem has the view­point of up in a tree. It's almost as if she is longing for higher ground. It could conceivably be an arche­type of a widespread flood.Next is a scene of a wolf worrying some Wyoming sheep. Wild­life official Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner) takes care of it. Now we start thinking in terms of Noah who shepherded a passel of animals into an ark. Noah according to the book of Enoch was an albino, and Cory is dressed in camouflage white.Next stop is the town of Lander where Cory picks up his eight-year-old boy. Of course, after the ark landed, Noah himself would be a *lander*, the name of the town. Here's where it gets positively weird. There's a globe on the shelf next to Cory as he warns his ex-wife Roma about the oncoming blizzard. Of course, Noah had preached about a coming world­wide flood.It's more of the same from here on. Noah's wife was evidently too old to bear children after the flood—she didn't have any more—and likely not able to shortly before it either. Their youngest Ham was conceivably the off­spring of a maid­servant, per the custom of the time. The servant girl did not make the cut for the ark ride, but Noah had custody of Ham when they took it. Like­wise, Cory has custody of his kid this day, and his ex- has a job inter­view, her location being defined by her work.Next we get to a scene where Cory teaches his kid how to dominate their riding horse. After the ark landed, God renewed man's dominance of the animals (Gen 9: 2), ""And the fear of you shall be upon every beast of the earth."" Then comes Cory's wildlife patrol where he discovers some cat tracks next to a slaughtered steer (""It's a lion, all right."") Multiple tracks (""Mama's teaching her kids to hunt."") Once that happens she has doomed her whole family. Here in Oregon we'll put down a rogue wolf that kills live­stock. Here it seems to be a matter of their family business, not individual character but the pattern of their paw prints. Oh, well.Now comes the gist of the story proper. Seems the body of the introductory scene Natalie is discovered frozen having succumbed to weather as a proximate cause, from evident foul play earlier. Cory is drafted by local law enforcement to simply drive around a green FBI agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen), and then his tracking expertise kicks in. His own daughter had been brutalized three years ago, so he is self-motivated to seek justice for this new death. It's similar to the way the antediluvian world was full of violence causing God to flood it out. There­fore Noah didn't want to see violence introduced into the cleaned-up world. Gen. 9:19-27 relates an incident that cast's Noah's youngest son Ham in a bad light for having looked upon his father's nakedness. According to *The Interpreter's Bible*, Vol. I, p. 556, ""In the primary, popular form of the story there probably occurred here—as shown by the reference in vs. 24 to 'what his younger son had done to him'—an account of an indecent attack by ((Ham)) on his father."" In the film some stir-crazy drunken boys living in this isolated region wanted to practice voyeurism on Natalie (""All I want is a little peep""), which escalated into some­thing far worse. We are spared much of the details, just as the Bible story spares us.There's an accounting to be had by the tracker who will search out all the miscreants. Noah pronounced a life of servitude on Ham's offspring. The Tracker like­wise will give his targets a chance rather than kill them out­right if he can avoid it.For the record, Noah's other two sons (righteous Shem and Japheth) can have their off­spring represented by the whites (""crackers"") and the native Americans in this film, traveling the rocky road to some kind of integration, (Gen. 9:27) ""God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem."" Integration of blacks is not dealt with in this movie, and does not follow the same formula in the archetype. Ham's oldest son Cush—Hebrew for black—settled in Africa where real lions dwell. How­ever, it can be projected that Cory is a negrophile on account of the women's magazine article he reads about the ten ways to tell he's into you, which includes him looking in your eyes during conversation. Cory does look into the mountain lion's eyes in its den where it is pitch black.This is, like, one strange whodunit, ""not in the land of backup, but the land of you're on your own."" There is minimal police procedure—just some jurisdictional wrangling—but justice proceeds more on atavistic grounds, as, say in the days of Noah where they were not surrounded by the safe­guards of civilization, although God seemed to trust Noah in his judgment. Noah's travails seem to be the best paradigm to relate this movie to, although there is lots of human and wilderness appeal without considering any of that. It just impressed itself on my mind that way, and it's not an unheard-of story, so I put it in my review.I quite enjoyed the show going along at a slow pace, punctuated at the right time with flared-up violence. Unless you're set in some more traditional formula, I find it worthy of my recommendation.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A captivating masterpiece,"I'll start this review by admitting I wasn't the biggest fan of 'Sicario' or 'Hell or High Water'. I appreciated them for what they were and admired the quality with which they were made, but I certainly didn't fall in love with them like the general public seemed to. So my anticipation for 'Wind River' wasn't exactly sky high, but I saw that it had a very high rating on IMDb which left me mildly excited. Then for the first 10-15 minutes of the film I wasn't quite sure what to make of it. It seemed very similar to 'Hell or High Water' in the sense that the production of the film was terrific, yet the actual substance of the story seemed lacking. However I was very wrong. After about the 15 minute mark the film kicks into gear and from that point on it one of the most captivating film experiences I can remember.The dialogue in the film is exquisite. There are countless lines spoken that you actually have to stop for a second and appreciate how profound they are. Also the structuring of the story is quite brilliant. The transitions of the stages of the story are effortlessly simple in their explanation (whilst being effortlessly complex in nature) and make it so very easy for the audience to follow along and appreciate the things that truly matter.Of all the impeccable elements this film possesses though I have to say it may just be the performance of the cast that are the highlight. The whole cast are superb, however Jeremy Renner is next level (and Elizabeth Olsen isn't far behind him). I've always been a fan of Renner, but I would have to say this is his finest performance to date. He is enthralling to watch and creates a character for the ages. Olsen also thoroughly impressed me. She had a very different type of role, yet she still managed to absolutely nail it. She is a very underrated actress.'Wind River' is nothing short of a masterpiece and if you have even the slightest hesitation towards seeing it for whatever reason, please ignore that feeling and go see it. You won't be sorry you did.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Gathers Steam-till the lid blows off!,"Just like a steam engine going up hill, it gathers a full head of steam, and then takes you for a thrill ride going down the other side. What a masterpiece, and btw who says there aren't any good movies this summer?? I liked how the movie spoon fed you little tidbits, and let the suspense build. Jeremy Renner knocks it out of the park as Fish and Wildlife agent Cody Lambert. He plays the agent with heartfelt emotions as you feel like he is on a mission to make amends for his own daughters untimely death. Not only lots of action, suspense, and mystery, but it is packed with a lot of emotions. Gives you the dark side of how our Native American's feel despair. Also the FBI agent played by Elizabeth Olsen packs a lot of punch, as you get this impression like she is in over her head. I have to say I went to this movie with expectations and it ended up being all met, as I had a feeling I could have been in for a let down with all the hype, as that has happened in the past.

Really nice simple thriller,"Wind River is one of those low budget movies like Hell or High Water that are a pleasure to watch. I am amazed it was the same writer and first time director Sheridan. I am also amazed with the cast including Renner's excellent depiction of the father out to get his revenge for his daughter. The movie never got boring for me, there were some excellent scenes in it, including the crime itself which was harrowing. The movie ended with a nice sense of closure and I'm sure everyone would be pleased with the main evil character's death. If Sheridan can continue to write with such superb words all his movies will be highly praised. I sort of hope he doesn't sell his soul to Hollywood and end up becoming an A list writer or director. By the end up the movie the sheer feat of this young girl running 5 miles barefoot through minus 20 degree weather really comes through to you, and you really feel for the parents and hope their lost son, comes back to them.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
They call it Wind River because it blows and it left me cold,"Taylor Sheridan, like so many who start out on the page, makes a better screenwriter than a director; even then, this is his weakest script, on top of the standard direction. There's a reason why nobody talked about about this, there's nothing to talk about. Hawkeye takes a break from all his Avenging and lands a rugged job at an Indian reservation, where he goes all Dances-with-Wolves with the natives. When he finds a body in the snow, a female F.B.I. agent is brought in, at which point I was heavily reminded of 'Insomnia'. And then they crack the case (and in typical movie fashion, the events of the crime are revealed in one long awkwardly placed flashback). Hooray.

A Wintry Mix of Silence and Sorrow,"(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5 )GRADE: BTHIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Taylor Sheridan's riveting murder mystery is a well written thriller that boasts a terrific performance by Mr. Renner.SYNOPSIS: On a remote Indian reservation, a FBI recruit and a local townsman team up to solve the murder.JIM'S REVIEW: The riveting opening scene in Taylor Sheridan's Wind River, immediately draws us into this thriller: At a Native American reservation, a bloodied young woman trudges through the sub-zero elements in central Wyoming, finally collapses, and dies. Barefoot and frightened, her wintry death sets up a murder mystery. Her frozen body is found by the town's wildlife officer / hunter, Corey Lambert (Jeremy Renner). Leading the investigation is FBI agent Jane Benner (Elizabeth Olsen). A newbie with the bureau, she wisely knows that in order to solve this case, she needs local help. So she enlists the aid of Corey, who knows the town and its people, although he is a bit of a loner with very little social skills and a tragic past. The duo set out to find their suspects and bring closure for their victim and her family.￼Screenwriter Mr. Sheridan (Hell or High Water, Sicario) once again tells his story with skill and style. He focuses on the murder investigation while subtly showing the socioeconomic hardships of the community and its toll on the citizenry. The town is filled with desperation and loss and its inhabitants are all prime suspects in search of redemption. This talented screenwriter, making his fine directorial debut, delivers an engrossing narrative and imbues his characters with insightful dialog that keeps his film riveting from start to finish. His film is atmospheric and moody and his characters have an authenticity that is usually lacking in this genre.￼The one issue that I had with the film, which keeps it from being highly recommended, is the mystery itself. The story-line remains involving but it is just too simplistic, needing more intricate plot structure to completely satisfy. When we finally meet the perpetrators, everything appears far too obvious. That said, the screenplay still resonates with its complex characters and their impassioned monologues and eloquent conversations that create lovely moments about the human condition.The acting is uniformly strong. Graham Greene as Ben, a Native police officer, provides his customary able support and Gil Birmingham as the victim's father is quite moving. (The scenes between the two grieving fathers are very poignant and emphasize the personal drama most effectively.) Kelsey Asbille and Jon Bernthal make a lasting impression as the film's doomed lovers. Ms. Olsen is fine as the FBI agent, although her character's naivety and lack of training seems bewildering at times, which cuts into the logistic of the story.￼However, Mr. Renner is a revelation. He underplays his character's angst and subtly shows his sense of mourning. He internalizes the man's melancholy and regret. His is a powerful performance and one wishes this gifted actor would be offered more complex roles than his typical shoot-em-up action fare and playing one-dimensional comic book superheroes.Wind River has its scenes of action and sudden violence in its storytelling that will please the action aficionados in the audience. Yet the film's greatest asset and driving force is not so much the mystery or its action sequences. It is the film's deeply personal human story that slowly unfolds. That, and Mr. Renner's memorable character and Mr. Sheridan's poetic words of wisdom make this movie-going experience quite special.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Beautiful, heartbreaking, exciting, and heartbreaking.","Beautiful, heartbreaking, exciting, and heartbreaking. No doubt Sheridan has writing chops(Sicario, Hell or High Water) and has directed once before(vile), but in Wind River we see for the first time a complete vision from the up-and-comer. Wind River strait up works from the beautiful cinematography and technical accomplishments to the tight, suspenseful story and convincing performances. Renner in particular gives a masterful performance as Cory Lambert, a professional hunter enlisted by FBI agent Jane Banner, portrayed by Elisabeth Olsen, to help her solve a homicide in Wyoming. The pallet perfectly matches the tone of the film that takes on themes of grief, bureaucracy, and of course the plight of the American Native. Wind River lacks a certain subtlety but overcomes it with great use of tension and character building.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Hauntingly sad story of an even sadder reality,"After seeing 'Wind River' I felt compelled to write a review since it was a beautiful movie that tells a hauntingly sad story of an even sadder reality that befalls many Native women in the U.S.With great attention to detail and atmosphere this gripping story line is told which is based on factual events and which reveals the untold truth of the disturbing disappearance of Native American women from their reservation lands.Especially because so few people outside of the Native community know about this horrid reality I find this film to be of utmost importance.Nevertheless the acting, the dialogue and the directing are all of superb quality which created a dramatic film of intense sincerity and that is emotionally touching.Definitely highly recommended viewing even if you just want to see a suspenseful crime thriller, fortunately this film essentially offers a compelling insight into one of America's hidden tragedies.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Superb Directorial Debut from Sheridan,"I had high expectations for Wind River, and when it finally hit a theater near me, it exceeded those expectations. To be upfront, Wind River is not an easy watch, as it's dealing with heavy dark subject matter, and it's delivered in a brutal realistic way. There's a strong chance that you will leave the theater more depressed than you entered it. However, the film is absolutely worth the potential emotional drain, as it is a superbly crafted film. The movie opens with a young Native American woman running away from something in her bare feet in the snowy Wyoming wilderness. Then after introducing the main character Jeremy Renner, a hunter/wildlife official, he finds the dead woman in the snow while searching for mountain lions that killed some livestock. At this point the investigation begins, and Elizabeth Olsen as a fish out of water FBI agent comes to solve the murder with Renner's help.For most of Wind River, it is a slow burn dramatic mystery thriller, but as the the investigation moves forward, there are moments of incredible tension that eventually burst into realistic violence. These moments are filmed very differently from action films, but they are very satisfying and brutal. The director uses a lot of interesting tactics to build the tension leading up to these moments, and it really gets your heart beating as the viewer. One of the most surprising and effective is in the middle of an already tense scene, where the film flashes back to show exactly what happened the night of the girl's death.The acting from everyone in Wind River is excellent, and the film is filled with small powerful moments between two characters. Jeremy Renner is the standout performance, where he's playing a character with a deeply ingrained tragic past. His moments with Elizabeth Olsen and especially with his good friend and father of the raped/murdered girl, Gil Birmingham, are packed with emotion. The dialogue in these scenes is outstanding and heart breaking. I really think that this film deserves multiple nominations when the award season comes along, particularly for Best Actor (Renner), Best Supporting Actor (Birmingham) and Best Director/Original Screenplay (Sheridan).I'd highly recommend this film, it's one of my favorite movies of 2017, and definitely the most powerful film I've seen since Arrival.

Jeremy Renner's best performance,"Why does nobody speak about Jeremy Renner's tremendous performance in this? That should have gotten enormous early buzz as he hardly has been any better during his career. Its a great crime mystery with an original setting. Its shocking that this is actually based on a true story. Taylor Sheridan chose the right screenplay for his directional debut and it turns out he is just as skilled as a director as he is as a writer. He chose his cast wisely. Jeremy Renner is absolutely outstanding as the troubled hunter. Elisabeth Olsen delivers a good performance however her character was a bit underwritten and she was not constantly believable. Still its a charismatic enough performance. Graham Greene gave another beautiful and humble performance as the police chief. The atmosphere works perfectly. I liked Nick Cave's score a lot which added a lot to the film. The screenplay is excellently written and its great how Sheridan builds up tense and fits in the right twists at the right moment.

Wyoming Story,"Taylor Sheridan is an actor turned writer-director who last year put out the vastly overlooked Hell or High Water. It was my favorite film of 2016. The script deserved best picture and best screenplay at the Oscars. Wind River is not quite as good, but it is still an excellent movie. Jeremy Renner plays a wildlife agent whose main job is to keep coyotes from decimating herds of sheep. While on the prowl in search of a marauding mountain lion, he comes upon a dead eighteen year-old girl from the town. She is face down in the snow with blood coming out of her mouth. The FBI is summoned to the Wind River Indian Reservation to help the understaffed local police solve the crime. Elizabeth Olsen is the agent and she joins Renner in the search for the killer. Along the way, they encounter drug addicts and other colorful but depressing people. Renner's ex-wife is Indian and they have a boy together. It turns out that their high school aged daughter had a bad experience with a criminal element and this pretty much rounds out the story. The scenery of Wyoming and Utah are spectacular and the script is precise with some good, witty moments. So far for 2017, Get Out and Wind River are two best films.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A well crafted modern crime/noir story,"Given Taylor Sheridan's previous works as the writer of ""Sicario"" and ""Hell or High Water"", I was rather excited to see what he would do when also taking the helm. This feature ""Wind River"", as Sheridan has said himself, completes his unofficial trilogy of stories exploring the American frontier and it does so on a high note.The film is captivating from beginning to end due to well paced writing, directing and editing and raw performances particularly from Jeremy Renner, Elizabeth Olsen and Gil Birmingham.Renner plays a Fish and Wildlife officer/tracker named Cory Lambert who patrols the Wind River Indian reservation in Wyoming which gives the film it's name. Olsen plays an FBI agent named Jane Banner who is called in to investigate the death of a Native American woman found at the reservation. She represents an outsider looking in perspective of this culture as Renner represents the opposite of someone who lives within in it and understands the landscapes due to his occupation.When the autopsy of the body reveals it was a homicide, Jane asks Cory to help with the case due to his expertise and he agrees so they set out to investigate. It is revealed later on that Cory's daughter was murdered too and he feels responsible for it so he is using this case as a chance for redemption and closure.The film's slow but deliberate pace and crisp cinematography makes you almost feel the biting cold of the environment and the harshness that this culture deals with on a day to day basis. The film highlights some unfortunate truths like the fact that even though the medical examiner believes the case is a homicide he can't report it as one due to a technicality. Also, it is revealed just before the credits in the form of text on the screen that there is no record keeping of missing Native Americans therefore nobody knows how many are truly missing.It is clear that Sheridan likes to explore uncomfortable subject matter such as the Mexican drug cartel in ""Sicario"", disenfranchised Middle America in ""Hell or High Water"" and now the mistreatment of Native Americans in ""Wind River"". It is also clear that he is very good at it as each of these films are filled with palpable passion and care.The only thing I had a problem with in ""Wind River"" was editing in the third act. I felt the way the flashback is utilized is disorienting and a little clumsy which makes the whole final act somewhat disjointed.However, other than that, ""Wind River"" is a well crafted crime drama/noir thriller which sheds light on issues seldom talked about.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

No tension, no thrills and not much of a story. The only saving grace is the wonderful snow covered landscape, but I can watch a travel blog on youtube for that. Yawn.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I love the story and the acting is so authentic and real,"Taylor Sheridan's films take place in a mythical version of the American West that doesn't exist anymore, if it ever really did. It's a place where there are no rules beyond the ones people invent for themselves to survive-stretches of Texas and New Mexico that are equal parts brutal and beautiful. Sheridan previously explored this terrain as the writer of Denis Villeneuve's ""Sicario"" and David Mackenzie's ""Hell or High Water,"" the latter of which earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay. Now, he's directing for only the second time as well as writing with ""Wind River,"" which feels very much of a piece with those two previous films, even as it distinguishes itself with a vivid sense of place. ""Wind River"" is full of vast, scrubby expanses that give way to pristine blankets of white, interrupted only by a snowmobile slashing a solitary path. You can hear the crunch of snow and feel the bitter chill, which runs so deep that it can be deadly. Sheridan drops us in and we know this place immediately; his storytelling is meaty but efficient, and his pacing moves along at a steadily engrossing clip before ultimately exploding in a startling blast of violence. A moody procedural, ""Wind River"" is heavy with symbolism from the start-perhaps, too much so. When we first see Jeremy Renner's Cory Lambert, a tracker well-versed in the Wyoming wilds, he's lying on his belly in the snow, camouflaged with his rifle, picking off wolves that have been preying on sheep. He's a protector because it's his job, but as we learn throughout the course of the film, that calling has become deeply personal.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"brilliant direction and story, excellent acting by Jeremy Renner","Taylor Sheridan direction and story is excellent Jeremy Renner is a brilliant actor but his skills are yet to be noticed by directors, I wish Christopher Nolan ropes him in for his next flick.The scenarios and set up of the movie are a pleasure for eyes.the story is so thrilling that it is haunting me again and again. Overall a movie which can be watched again and again.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Allegorical mystery thriller makes for a haunting experience,"Screenwriter Taylor Sheridan's directorial debut is a rather bleak affair that mixes murder mystery with the modern day western, set in a frozen landscape where cowboys and indians still roam, only now as long-forgotten ghosts. And the war between them still rages on.Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen enjoy a naturalistic and believable dynamic together, perhaps thanks to their previous working collaborations, and the usual mismatched partners at odds clichés are immediately done away with by establishing both characters as professional, capable and cooperative. While this is a refreshing spin on a familiar trope, their relationship does lack a degree of conflict and drama. Renner's tracker has a sad backstory so he's all good for character depth, but Olsen's FBI agent is pretty much a mystery. We never learn much about her as a person or her past, which is a shame because she is utterly compelling in the role, projecting equal parts vulnerability and intensity. The whole cast feels authentic and natural and helps to really sell this world of an Indian reservation buried in ice and blood. Perhaps more time could have been spent exploring these people in greater depth. I would have gladly watched an extra 10-15 minutes of this story, just to get to know everyone better and feel more invested in them.What is most commendable about Sheridan's muscular plotting is that it feels like a genuine investigation unfolding. There is nothing staged or contrived about it, even when we get a sharp stab of action. He also engineers a very slick third act reveal and transition to help us better understand events in context without the need for someone to monologue out some exposition of the hows, whys and whos. Once we finally get a clearer (and highly disturbing) picture of what happened, the metaphor that Sheridan's narrative is trying to embody becomes apparent and that the young woman's death at the start is analogous to the rape and murder of an entire culture, left to drown in its own blood in the middle of nowhere. With films about the Native American experience (and modern America's historical guilt complex), the solution to the case was perhaps an obvious and inevitable revelation, but still effective as allegory. For me, it is a message that would have been rendered far more powerful had Renner's character been written to be an actual Native American, something I suspect that Sheridan may have originally intended.'Wind River' matches the unforgiving weather it portrays, much in the same way the atmospherics in Denis Villeneuve's tonally similar 'Prisoners' reflected the mindset of its characters and themes of its story. The beautiful snowy landscapes and crisp cinematography really help to sell this desolate frontier feeling, while the haunting score evokes an air of foreboding as well as a sense of loss. There are some minor gripes here but this is strong and solid storytelling that marks a promising debut for Sheridan in the director's chair.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great film; disturbing after-thoughts,"I loved the acting; nothing in the movie was obvious. Only after it is over do you go back in your mind and recall conversations and details that only make sense after you have seen the ending. I love any film that examines a part of society or culture we don't see represented very often.THAT SAID, I was very upset about the speciesism in this film. The main character is a hunter of predators. This is a very sick and dangerous concept. We don't have enough predators in the environment; destruction of coyotes and mountain lions and wolves throws a wrench into the lynchpin of how ecosystems work. This ""hunter"" is trying to protect livestock - sheep and cows - that again, humans are only planning to kill, and that, again, are terrible for the environment. Raising livestock is the number one destroyer of forests and native species. No human - not even native americans on reservations - need to breed, confine and slaughter animals for survival. It's the least healthy diet and most destructive to our climate.So on one hand we see this tragedy -- two young human women being killed -- and we are supposed to be outraged and overcome with grief at the senseless loss of their lives. But we are not supposed to bat an eye at wolves, coyotes and mountain lions being killed (notably, the film points out that these animals are MOTHERS, with cubs, so very parallel to the human family units in the film) or the fact that these wild animals are being killed to protect cows and sheep..... who will also be killed!! This sickened and disgusted me.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A fantastic tragic murder mystery,"""You can't steer from the pain. If you do, you'll rob yourself."" - see below for full quote.Wind River is a fantastic, gripping and tragic murder mystery set on a frigid Wyoming Native American reservation.The writer/director Taylor Sheridan hits his stride with this one. He channels the pain of those that have lost children and the harsh realities of life on the reservation.He also choreographed several scenes that are some of the most intense action scenes in any movie, period.Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen literally disappear into their roles as the game warden and FBI agent respectively. That is no small task given the notoriety they've gained with their roles in The AvengersThis is one of those movies you can watch multiple times and still enjoy every moment. I can't wait to see his next endeavor.Full dialogue of above quote:
""I'd like to tell you it gets easier. it doesn't. If there's any... comfort, it's... getting used to the pain, I suppose. Went to a grief seminar in Casper. Did you know that? I don't know why. Just wanted the bad to go away. Wanted answers... to questions that couldn't be answered. The counselor come up to me after the seminar and sat down next to me. And he said something that stuck with me. I don't know if it's what he said, or how he said it. He says, ""I got some good news, and I got some bad news. Bad news is you're never gonna be the same. You're never gonna be whole, not ever again. You lost your daughter. Nothing's ever going to replace that. Now the good news is, as soon as you accept that, and you let yourself suffer... you allow yourself to visit her in your mind, and you'll remember all the love she gave you, all the joy she knew."" Point is, Martin, you can't steer from the pain. If you do, you'll rob yourself... You'll rob yourself of every memory of her. Every last one. From her first step to her last smile. Kill 'em all. Just take the pain, Martin. You hear me? You take it. It's the only way you'll keep her with you.""",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

This summer blockbuster will make your blood freeze,"Wind River is the blockbuster you didn't know you had to watch this summer or autumn. The movie is a gloomy mixture of a sinister drama with a set of authentic, flawed and haunted characters and a quite gruesome, mysterious and tense thriller. The fact that the movie was inspired by true events makes it even more haunting.Even if you're watching this movie in the summertime, it will definitely send cold shivers down your spine. The film takes place during a heavy snow storm in the isolated Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming. The story follows a quiet outcast and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agent who is divorced and has lost his daughter under mysterious circumstances and a female rookie F.B.I. special agent who must be resilient in unfamiliar territory to earn some respect from hostile Native Americans and closed-minded white drill workers alike. This unlikely duo, supported by local Native American police officers, must find out the truth about the mysterious death of a young woman.The movie's only weak spot might be the slightly predictable plot but the authentic, brutal and emotional ending still suits the movie perfectly. Among the most convincing elements, the superb acting performance by Jeremy Renner must be pointed out. I have always appreciated him as entertaining sidekick in several action thrillers but in this dramatic thriller, he shows his entire potential and really convinces as haunted outsider. Another strong element of the film is the fact that it authentically shows the problematic relationships between disillusioned Native Americans and arrogant White Americans and points out the difficult coexistence between traditional reservations and greedy companies. Finally, the bare but beautiful snow landscapes fit perfectly to a story between bitterness and hope. They aren't only stunning to watch but play an important role in the opening sequence as well as in the final scenes.If you like authentic dramas and thrillers with credible stories and outstanding acting performances, there is no way you can get around Wind River. I would suggest watching this film in the wintertime as you will find it even more immersive. Still, Wind River is easily the best movie I have watched last summer and I would recommend it to any family member or friend and surely buy a copy on DVD or BluRay to support the makers of this film.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Movie with great suspense and great purpose,"Tough to watch and swallow, but movie had a great purpose. I don't like wasting time and energy on movies these days but I luckily ran into this one after some research. Very painful to endure through in the movie theater since I tend to be very sensitive and emotional - I also have three girls. It was worth watching and it has deepened my gratefulness for my children. Humanity ca be pain and beautiful at the same time.

"First time since March 15,2010","I haven't given out a perfect score to any film since the date in the subject line, and that film was Airplane! from 1980. Wind River broke that streak today. I thought the acting, writing, and directing were perfect. Renner was outstanding (deserved an Oscar nom for this role), Olsen brought with her a strong, steely resolve that I didn't see coming, and I loved Graham Greene as the tribal police chief. How Sheridan didn't get a Best Director nom is a shame, too. Started watching this at 3AM and just couldn't turn it off. A+ all the way around.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Beautifully & hauntingly shot!,"This might be one of my favourite films to come out in 2017. It's so beautifully filmed, Taylor Sheridan did an amazing job. The cast is perfect all around & all the scenery shots are so stark & haunting, it really fits in well with the plot. This whole movie made my heart ache since I've known few kids that have lived on reservations & the families & children that grow up there do not have water or electricity in most cases. It breaks my heart because of the way they live, a lot of the youth resort to drugs & drinking to get away from their reality. This movie accurately depicts what every day life is like for Natives. This movie just proves that white man is always out there destroying someone else's life. We are to blame for a lot of the injustices & horrors that have happened in the world & are still happening. This film broke me in more ways than I can count & it was done so well. The soundtrack was perfect, everything about it. Also I've read a few reviews on here where people were complaining that a lot of the actors mumble in this & they were wondering if that's something the director planned on purpose. As someone who's met a few Natives, I can tell you it was not done purposefully. That's just the way Natives talk when they do talk. They have low voices and very seldom are super chatty so they're usually quiet and tend to sound low & quiet. It's as simple as that. If you can't hear or can't understand, get subtitles or turn up your TV. Simple.Overall I loved this film and would recommend to everyone to watch, but I do warn you it will break your heart to see what these people have to live like & what goes on in their world. I also want to say I'm relieved with how respectful this film is towards the Native community, and overall what a great job Taylor Sheridan did to tell this story with grace. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
