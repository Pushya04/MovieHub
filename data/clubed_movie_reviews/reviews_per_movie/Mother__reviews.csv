"One of the toughest films I've ever tried to review. I liked it a lot, but can't recommend it.","This is a very difficult movie to review without major spoilers. I can either just say ""spoiler alert"" and then promptly ruin the whole thing. Or I can be circumspect, and perhaps not tell as much as would be satisfying. I'm going to take approach #2, because in the end, I would hate to go into this movie having had someone ""explain"" it to me first.Having said that, I DO think it's very important to state that this is NOT a horror movie (at least, not in the traditional sense). The trailers make this film look like some kind of artsy, weird, off-the-hook horror film. A modern day, graphic ROSEMARY'S BABY, perhaps. MOTHER! is NOT that. It has many horrifying events and images...but it is a virtually unique product. If you only like going to movies with some idea of what to expect...this film is likely not for you.On the other hand, if you're comfortable sitting down to watch a film with virtually no preconceived expectations, and have a strong stomach and lots of patience...you should be rewarded.The film, other than a brief, odd opening sequence, starts of ""normally."" Jennifer Lawrence wakes up to discover her husband is already missing from bed. We see that she lives in a lovely country home that is undergoing significant renovation. We discover that Lawrence is re-doing the house herself, and her hubby (Javier Bardem) is a famous poet who is undergoing a bit of writer's block, and has been for awhile. There are some tensions in their marriage, but they seem pretty mundane. In the evening, there is a knock on the door, and Bardem invites in a stranger (Ed Harris) and seems to immediately develop an oddly close relationship with this man. A relationship that excludes Lawrence. The film's tone immediately shifts to something mysterious and, for lack of a better word, ""off.""That's all I'll tell you, expect to say that this movie just builds its oddities one after another, growing on and on in strangeness and it becomes downright unsettling and disturbing. You'll likely spend a lot of time with the movie having no idea what's going on. We see it all through Lawrence's eyes (in fact, she is seen almost exclusively in closeup), and as her confusion and alarm grow, so does ours. As the movie arrives at its last third, it truly goes completely nuts. It descends into seeming chaos, and grows from alarming to downright uncomfortable. There are a few very difficult scenes.Director/writer Darren Aronofsky, who has made films both excellent (REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, BLACK SWAN) to mediocre (NOAH) to downright unwatchable (THE FOUNTAIN), often seems to grapple with deep issues, and certainly takes a lot of care with his films. He demands careful editing and challenging cinematography. His actors are often pushed to extremes. In the case of MOTHER!, I found Jennifer Lawrence to be quite effective, especially by the end of the film when pieces have started clicking together. It's her movie, frankly, to carry or blow, and she mostly carries it. Her chemistry with Bardem is spotty, but it almost makes sense by the end. It's a frustrating viewing experience for much of the movie because you can't help but try to impose meaning on it all...and you really can't unless you're amazingly perceptive...at least, not until the last third of the film. THEN what happens is you have to spend an hour afterwards reflecting on the early part of the film and putting it into context.MOTHER! is a difficult film, and I cannot recommend it (even though I give it 4 stars) because I also understand that a) the film is infuriating and b) once the ""answer"" is revealed, viewers might be enormously offended when they discover what the film is about. It is just, frankly, a deeply challenging film. I really enjoyed myself, and will watch the film again (this time, knowing from the start what it is about)...but it's also just a bit smug too.And the single biggest mistake was having Kristen Wiig appear in the film. I like her a lot, and she's proven over and over that she has dramatic chops, not just comedic. But she appears suddenly during some critically important events and it seems like a crazy cameo and not a real performance. The audience sniggered, as though anticipating a nice bit of comedy from her. I feel bad for feeling this way, but there are certain performers who would always briefly pull an audience out of a film if they showed up unexpectedly...folks like Will Ferrell, let's say...who are known for their antics on film first and foremost. Arnofsky should have avoided this casting.I hope I've helped give you some vague idea of what you might expect. Whether you decide to go is another thing. Oh, and by the way, PLEASE do not bring children. There are some VERY disturbing things (if they are even still awake when they happen) that were pretty tough for adults to see. I saw a few folks storm out during these scenes...and I can't imagine having to explain them to young kids afterwards.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Anxiety: The Movie.,"The way it's shot, how the dialog is written, the characters and their choices, all odd and nonsensical at first, but all there for a reason. All there to help write a poem that wants to tell you something. Some things. Everything.Mother! is an astonishing yet nerve-racking allegorical picture that won't leave your mind.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Religious allegories abound but really it's just pretentious nonsense,"Now I'm not one to disparage the director, I liked Requiem for a Dream and loved Black Swan, but this is a stinker and just simply boring. It's all just packed full of cod biblical allegories spread thickly throughout which tries to twist between different types of horror genres, but leaved me unintrigued.Granted the settings, claustrophobic direction and acting are top notch but it shouldn't mask for what otherwise is a poor uninteresting movie. It unsettles and bores, way too much to care, and as the ending dragged on I was left increasingly frustrated as it refused to just shut up shop.It's totally split opinion from what I've seen so far, and you'll struggle to find anyone in the middle on this one. In fairness, some credit to the film studios for risking this effort in launching it into mainstream cinemas but without the director it would have rightfully languished on cable late night showings.There's no point going anymore into this. I simply hated it, and that despite being a major admirer of offbeat horror and psychological movies, but this isn't in the same league as for example Raw or Get Out, which is a shame. I'd recommend you pass on this there are far better films out there to go watch.",3.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Aronofsky's mother! will be hated by many, but loved by a precious few","100Horrifying. Just.. horrifying. Aronofsky really got me with this one. Not only did he manage to grab me on an intellectual level, but also on an emotional one. This movie is going to be hated by many, I know that now. But for me, this is, hands down, the movie of the year. Every shot, cut, and scream is perfectly constructed to make an immersive atmosphere that never relents in it's uncomfortable feeling, and the acting is seriously award worthy. Javier Bardem is absolutely wonderful, and Jennifer Lawrence... oh man... her performance is absolutely top notch. At first I couldn't quite relate to her character, but as the film progressed, her mindset became my mindset, and we essentially merged into one force of fear and terror that was absolutely unstoppable until the ending. I cannot praise her performance enough in this review. Her emotions leaked from every frame she was in, and it broke my heart and scared me witless the whole way through the film. Aronofsky's pacing is immaculate as well, the whole movie feeling not a second too slow or quick, the events rolling on naturally and in a way that felt very satisfying. The whole way through, I was riveted and invested by the acting and cinematography, which is definitely Aronofsky's best I've seen so far. The entire film is gripping, horrifying, heartbreaking, and absolutely wonderful. Nothing about this movie pulled me out of it. Watching this in a theater was like being in a bomb shelter while the world ended, every sound apocalyptic and every camera shake filling my view. If you can, watch this on the biggest screen you can with the best surround sound you can afford. If you only watch one movie this year, make it this one. This movie is incredible. This is why I study the movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Pretentious and annoying,"A married couple live in an isolated country house. He is a celebrated poet, suffering from writer's block, and she is working on renovating the house. Then a guest, a stranger, suddenly drops in and nothing will ever be the same again.Written and directed by Darren Aronofsky who gave us masterpieces like 'The Wrestler' and 'Requiem for a Dream', as well as the excellent 'Black Swan'. The fact that he wrote and directed this was the only reason I watched it, hoping that he was back to the form of those movies as his previous movie was the craptacular-beyond-belief 'Noah'.Unfortunately, no, he isn't, though initially there was a glimmer of hope. The movie started interestingly enough, with some decent character development and some interesting themes. However, from the outset it was slow, plus there were signs this wasn't going to be a character-based drama but something symbolic, and pretentious.Plus it was annoying. The only likeable character was Jennifer Lawrence's. Javier Bardem's was selfish and egotistical and every single other character was incredibly irritating.Still, I was hoping this would all develop into something interesting and profound. Wrong again. It develops into anarchy and some sort of badly-thought-out horror movie, and the annoyance factor gets pushed to the max. Of course, it's all meant to be symbolic, but figuring out everything would require you to think about the movie, and do so you would have had to have concentrated all through the tidal wave of excrement that was the movie.Pretentious and annoying, and evidence that, sadly, Darren Aronofsky has run out of ideas.",2.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Art's Not Safe,"Went to the first matinée available locally and I am still thinking the picture over. Will definitely see this one again, if it hasn't left the theatre abruptly. I was certainly horrified by the film, which is a good thing, as I had assumed it was a horror picture. It is, of course, much more than that. Nonetheless, it is NOT The Conjuring or Get Out (both good films, for sure), so just be warned.By now you are aware that the film has been controversial, also a good thing. Jennifer Lawrence does a fine job and her career is certainly not going to suffer for her performance. I am not exactly a JLaw ""fan"" (could live without the Hunger Games), although I will pay closer attention to her future performances, especially if she pulls off more roles like this one (really liked Winter's Bone, by the way). As I understand the Hollywood scene, it is a respectable personal decision to take on a challenging role in an avant garde picture, especially if you have already banked serious money from popular roles in blockbusters. Javier Bardem, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Ed Harris also do their respective parts justice--a well-acted film by A-listers, overall. Camera work and special effects are also impressive.The story is genuinely disturbing in a Requiem for a Dream way, so don't go if you can't handle that sort of thing. Some of the violence is, indeed, OVER THE TOP. Seriously, not for the faint of heart. Aside from the biblical allegory stuff, I found the character portrayals creepy as hell in a (sur?)realistic David Lynch-esque way. Hell is other people!I applaud Mr. Aronofsky for keeping his vision intact all the way to the big screen. For reference, I just don't need any more movies based on superheros, comic books (except The Tenth or Gen 13), children's cartoons, vampires fighting werewolves, or horror stick about unfriending weirdos on facebook.You will have to make up your own mind on this one, so please do just that. Even if you end up despising the film, try to remember that, to quote Rob Zombie, ""Art's Not Safe.""",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

I Loved It But Who Could I Recommend It To?,"Mother! (2017)**** (out of 4)Usually this is where I put my plot description but it's best that you go into Darren Aronofsky's latest knowing as little as possible. Lets just say that Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem are living in a large house all alone when a surprise visit sets them off into madness.It really shocks me that Paramount would try to push MOTHER! onto the masses. For starters, the majority of moviegoers today do not want to think and they certainly don't want to see a movie where everything isn't explained. In fact, most people need everything explained in the trailer before they'll even go see a movie. A movie like MOTHER! is something that never explains itself and it constantly keeps you guessing from one scene to the next. What's it about? It's really hard to say as every viewer is going to come away with something different. With all of that said, it's easy to see why the film bombed at the box office and why those who did see it gave it a F rating.what I loved most about this movie is that the setting is just so perfect. You've got a large beautiful house out in the middle of nowhere and it's surrounded by beautiful grass and trees. From the very first scene we can just tell that something isn't quite right and Aronofsky puts us in this beautiful place with confusing surroundings. What makes the film so special is the fact that nothing is ever explained and with each new plot twist your brain just becomes more confused as to what's going on. We know something is happening and we know something bad is going to happen but you're constantly trying to guess what.Of course, a movie like this wouldn't work without a terrific cast to pull it off. Lawrence turns in another terrific performance and I thought she as fabulous at showing how fractured this character was. We're often questioning her mental state and I thought Lawrence managed to make you feel for the character and go along with her confusion to everything that is happening. Bardem actually steals the show with his fiery performance and I really loved the rage and anger he brought to the film as well as another side that I won't spoil to prevent giving away aspects of the plot. Both Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer were also terrific but, again, I'll hold off commenting more to prevent plot points.The cinematography is terrific and on a technical level the film is quite flawless. The story is a very interesting one and one that keeps you guessing throughout. The performances just seal the deal. With that said, the film certainly goes downright insane at times and the ending is just one that will have you staggering out of the theater. I must say that I thought the finale went on a bit too long and that it would have worked better had it been edited down a bit. Still, MOTHER! is a film that I really loved and one that I really respected but at the same time I'm not sure who I'd recommend it to.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Easily the most intense move I've ever seen,"Holy. Crap. I am shaken - mentally, and even physically. This is my first IMDb review, in part because I can't believe the negative reviews. Anxious (good word to describe my current state) to check back once it's widely released. The first half of the movie, I believe, is intended to get you riled. By the second half, if you're like me, you're trying to figure it out - WHAT DOES IT MEAN?! - and when you get it, you won't stop thinking about it. What a masterpiece. Here, take all my money - I'll definitely go back... once I've calmed down!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Trigger Warning,"""You never loved me. You only loved how I loved you."" ---mother (Jennifer Lawrence) to Him (Javier Bardem)Directed by Darren Aronofsky (""Black Swan"" and ""Requiem for a Dream"") ""mother!"" is possibly the darkest, most disturbing movie I have ever seen.It is absolutely one of the most affecting.Reviews have been mixed, to put it nicely. But I think the theme of ""mother!"" terrifies some people so much that they choose to be perplexed by it rather than allow themselves to even think about what Aronofsky is suggesting.My take on the film is that it is about God, humans, and our respective relationships with creation and the creative process.Humans are trying to create Heaven on Earth, and God is....well....God created our ability to create. ""mother!"" is about the futility of OUR attempts.It is about nihilism.It is the abyss, looking back at us.Congratulations to Darren Aronofsky: He got it on film. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Liked the idea and message,"... But it was just over the top.
For my tastes the first half of the movie was great, a solid 9 stars. I felt the helplessness of Mother and it carried the message well enough.
The second half was just overwhelming and too much. I would have loved the movie if they kept it more subtle.

"If there is a movie theater in hell, this is playing there","I have been going to the movies for 45 years. This is, hands down, the worst movie I have ever seen. I mean, I hated this movie. Plan 9 From Outer Space and The Room were at least entertaining. This is like being locked in a cell with a stoned college student who can't shut up and thinks that every opinion they have, is the final word on a subject for 2 hours. Jennifer Lawrence should stick to roles that require her to paint herself blue or shoot arrows. Darren Aronofsky wants to be Luis Buñuel but he's closer to Uwe Boll. He cites The Exterminating Angel as the inspiration for Mother! I agree, in the sense that I did feel like one of the dinner guests who can't leave in Buñuel's classic during the course of watching Mother after paying 13 bucks to see this pretentious, heavy handed waste of time. Do yourself a favor, don't go see this movie, you won't get the 2 hours of your life back if you do. When it shows up on The Movie Channel playing at 3 in the morning in a couple of months, don't even set your DVR to record it. There are infomercials about gardening tools on at the same time, that are much more entertaining to watch that this.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Beyond Brilliant,"This movie took my breath away. When the end credits began to roll, all  I could think of was just how brilliant this film is! I was  absolutely astonished by the level of craftsmanship on Darren  Aronofsky's part, and just the sheer complexity of the writing.  Aronofsky says he wrote the screenplay in six days, which just blows my  mind. It is so intricate and delicately designed, that I don't know how  he was able to write it in less than a week. I think it just goes to  show how much of a pure genius Aronofsky is. This is a movie that is  driven 100% by its story and its screenplay. Everything else, from the  camera angles, to the score, to the performances, are in service to  that script. So it's hard to sit here and say ""Oh, well the  cinematography is gorgeous"" or ""Jennifer Lawrence is fantastic in the  film"", because their purpose was not to stand out on their own.  Everything they did was to enrich and drive forward this story, and  that doesn't necessarily work for every film, but it absolutely works  here. This film is made by the deep complexity of its metaphors and  allegories, and by its social and theological analysis of our past,  present, and future. Without the strength of its script, mother! would  fall apart. Luckily, Aronofsky has crafted a masterful screenplay that  works and plays on so many different levels...",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
magnificent,"It is a parable. And one of the most impressive films of the last decade. A film about poetry, poetry itself, and about people. About art. And about intincts and sheep spirit and religion , illusion and blind freedom. A film who you must see. Because it is about each from us, its public. Symbols and violence and fear and profound vulnerability. A manifesto more than a masterpiece. Great performances and a so, so clear message. As warning . And as verdict. But, more important, as precise definition of the near reality. Sure, a Darren Aronofovsky film. So, far to be comfortable. But it has the virtue to be exactly what you looking for. Great cinematography, admirable performances and the right lesson about present.Short, a magnificent work.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Jennifer Lawrence Hubris,"I thought this was worth its salt even though it did tend towards  cliché as it wore on.  The disappointing aspect of this film is that Jennifer Lawrence somehow  portrays an ego that is beyond the character. It's a kind of ""you know  that I know I'm only acting this and the real movie is me"" that seems  to have perpetuated in every film she had made since Silver linings  Playbook, bar X-Men (when she was covered in paint and having to ""live  in"" the previous ""humble"" shoes of Rebecca Romijn) and American Hustle  (where she was greedy White Trash).  She needs a director who can ""humble her down"", in the same way  Eastwood did for Jolie in Changeling, so that her ego is less of a  distraction for her acting.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Not what people expect from a horror movie.,"Normally, horror movies traffic in fear of being startled.The feeling is similar to talking with someone who says ""I'm going to jump at you"" and then keeps up the threats: ""you'll be startled, just watch... I'm going to make a loud noise... you'll not know when...""That's annoying, but not very genuinely frightening, not any more than a champagne bottle in a dark room.This movie instead confuses, frustrates, and deeply unsettles you. The logic in it is absurd and dreamlike. I've never come as close to having a nightmare while I was awake.That's not what the average person wants. It's hard to enjoy a movie like that if you think you're smart so you spend time poking holes in absurd logic that is up-front about its absurdity. It's also hard to enjoy if you are in some other way dense or unempathetic. An average person looking for an engaging series of loud noises would be very upset with this movie.I've not seen anything in theaters as bizarre and upsetting as this. It's very stressful. I hope it makes money. I want more directors to take risks.Aside from the buzz, I'll say I've never been as moved by a movie. It captures powerlessness perfectly. It is the best movie I have seen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Spies in the house of love?,"""Mother!"" follows a couple (Lawrence and Bardem) who live in solitude in an expansive farmhouse that the wife has painstakingly restored from a fire. One evening, they are visited by a doctor (Ed Harris), whose wife (Michelle Pfeiffer) follows. The dynamics of the home are turned upside down, and chaos ensues.I won't attempt to give a full plot summary here, as it's truly a waste of time. If the cryptic promotional materials and slim premise are enough to intrigue (as they did myself), then give the film a go. The first half of ""Mother!"" is just shy of brilliance, with bizarre character interactions, wry humor, and phenomenal performances from all involved. At times, the dynamics between Lawrence, Bardem, Harris, and Pfeiffer give one the sense that they're watching a zany stage play, and the actors (especially Pfeiffer and Harris) clearly have a ball with this. As the film progresses into its second half, it shifts and expands in ways that are unabashedly over-the-top, and Aronofsky quite literally pulls the rug out from under his audience.The film is stuffed with metaphors that are clearly Biblical, but there are numerous bents and other influences spilling in, most notably ""Rosemary's Baby,"" which seems to be a prominent influence Aronofsky wears on his sleeve here; that said, ""Mother!"" is a very different film from it. The second act is chaotic and grotesque, and it's effective up to a point, but it brazenly crosses the line that the first act so cleverly toed; and perhaps that's the aim here, but it's not as enthralling as what comes before it.Overall, I found ""Mother!"" at times riveting and consistently well-acted. It moves from being delightfully off-kilter and sinister to fiery pandemonium, the latter of which doesn't have the same consistent pull as the former. It is no less a thoroughly weird and engrossing epic that demands attention, but I personally found the second act to run itself thin. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

hold on to your butts,"Greetings again from the darkness. Him. Mother. Man. Woman. When those are the identifiers of the four main characters (none have a real name), one might assume that the filmmaker is lazy. However, after watching the latest from the psycho-creative force known as Darren Aronofsky, we understand that names weren't necessary, and even if they had been, he was probably too mentally exhausted from finding ways to torture those characters and confound the viewers.The first half of the film is discomforting and creepy while the second half is downright crazed and deranged. You won't find many story details in this review, as the fun is in the shock. Most of the film is through the eyes of Jennifer Lawrence, and we share her confusion and disoriented state. She is married to a famous poet played by Javier Bardem (yes, the age difference is acknowledged). While she spends her days refurbishing their stunning country home, he battles severe writer's block. Needless to say, their domestic bliss goes wrong  but it's not the kind of wrong we've ever seen before.Aronofsky and cinematographer Matthew Libatique (both Oscar nominees) confine us in excruciatingly tight shots resulting in further disorientation and claustrophobia through most of the film. By the time we get a single wide shot of the home's exterior, we've just about given up hope. And once Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer show up, we kick into full ROSEMARY'S BABY mode  only more frenetic and hyper.It should be noted that it's not a traditional horror film – heck, it's hardly a traditional film at all. It's built on confusion, and metaphors abound. Aronofsky seems intent on causing endless post- viewing discussions and debate over what it ""means"". A case can be made for commentary on ego, fame, Mother Nature, deity/religion, and a sign of the times – the entitled ""takers"" of the world. The most obvious explanation is that the price paid for creativity is quite dear, and often causes a release from reality. There is a vicious cycle occurring here and our realization happens after the crescendo of insanity that is the film's peak.WTF moments are too many to count, and Ms. Lawrence pulls off what has to be the roughest on screen pregnancy we've seen. It's a real treat to see Michelle Pfeiffer back in form after being out of the spotlight for four years. The score from Johan Johannsson is remarkable and there are ground-breaking visual effects (easy to miss during the audacious, frenzied second half action). Aronofsky is clearly provoking us, though it's abundantly unclear to what end. His previous twisted, mind- benders include REQUIEM FOR A DREAM and BLACK SWAN  both of which seem like mainstream family fare in comparison. This is a love it or hate it project, and most will likely fall into the latter. But for those who embrace the deranged and audacious, the love will be everlasting.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A shocking off the rails metaphorical art house film,"Wow mother! was a real wild ride. I stumbled out of the theater in awe. I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like it. It is really nice to see directors like Darren Aronofsky take chances like this. What you get in mother! is one part drama one part horror six parts insanity.The story does not take any time at all to get going, it becomes completely crazy about an hour in and the final 20 minutes will leave you shocked. While I was not totally floored by either main stars performance the acting was surely great.The problem with mother! is, taken at face value it's totally ridiculous. The things that end up transpiring are absurd and over the top to say the least. Therefore mother! will surely be a polarizing movie. As a small example I went with 3 other people to see it, including myself it was a 50/50 love hate outcome.As far as the shocking moments in the film, they are a real doozy. There's one scene in particular that will certainly repel some people. In my theater of about 20 or so people a woman basically ran out during this part. When we left she was waiting outside visibly shaken and yelling at her boyfriend. For me as a person who loves it when films push the envelope and cross boundaries, I was delighted by it all.While mother! is the most audacious original movie of 2017 taken at face value it could be a real bust for some people.

The house is the world. Humans are intruders that can't behave.2. The mother is god. God is giving us and just trying to give love to the simple things.3. The father is the human prophet. The father is using god for his own purposes even if he's not really understunding how he is betraying god.4. The ""people"" are the humans. (YOU WILL HATE THEM!)5.

Many ways ... many views ... many feelings,"You can tell by how people react to reviews on this, that they have made up their mind. The director himself likes the fact the movie does not leave people without emotions. Be it joy for liking it or hate for disliking it. Even strong annoyance if you feel that hate is too strong a word is well received. And we also know that the director does have a tendency to go religious on us.That is not a bad thing but it may be helpful for the viewer who want to know what is going on. Or want answers! They are sort of written down ... in a book. But this is not just the making of ... this can also be seen as an allegory on many other things. And Darren is not someone who'd squash anyones view on the matter. He said he made one movie, but he welcomes any other interpretation. And there is a lot to discover.If you are open and receiving for the way the movie tells its story, for the way the characters behave (because they can be pretty annoying, especially out of context, but even if you get certain things, it'll be pretty stressing to see certain things happen) ... with certain life experiences, different feelings may arise while watching. That's why everyone watches a different movie (subjectively speaking). Yet there are so many universal themes (or even otherworldly?) in it, that there should be something for everybody.Again slow pacing and agonizing horror are front and center. Though almost nothing can prepare you for that last part of the movie. Then again I wouldn't want it any other way myself. I was at the edge of my seat - even when I was frustrated by things happening. A movie that dares you to think all the time and is made for multiple viewings. And for a movie that is aiming for head/brain rather than the heart, it is able to get quite a lot of emotion from anyone watching ...",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Wretched,"The so-called religious symbolism is so heavy-handed it's as though it were written by someone with no imagination or appreciation for the language of the source material. From the opening scenes with the grotesque Bardem coarsely abusing the divine Warren to the flat phony sycophantic behavior of Ed Harris (first time I have ever disliked his performance) and on & on the film plays like a bad high school film class product.

Succeeds at breaking your nerves,"One of the most frustrating films I have watched so far. People are talking about how Aronofsky went way too far this time, but I thought he succeeded in his intent on disturbing and horrifying his audience. That's what I would expect a horror film to do anyway, instead of foisting the usual gimmicks of the genre. It starts off as some kind of black comedy, then things escalate so badly that it even becomes painful to watch. The voyeuristic camera angles constantly stalking Jennifer Lawrence, together with the dark, yellowish photography and immersive sound design also contribute to a truly unsettling experience.The film is clearly an allegoric retelling of the Bible used to reflect on the relationship between Mother Earth, God, and mankind. I thought it works as an ecologic parable, but the biblical references are so explicit that they make the film feel a little cheap at times (by the way, the terrible CGI is not helping either). Sure there could be other interpretations, but again the religious allegory is so in your face that it's hard to reflect upon anything else.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Shades of gray, folks.","Why does everyone feel compelled to review something as the best or worst thing ever. Really? How is that even remotely useful to the reader? It's not a review -that's a rant. 
For those of you who don't get it, there's a little something called experimental filmmaking. It's been around for about a century, and not designed with mainstream Hollywood consumers in mind. They're art house films, and if you walk blindly into an art house theater, please don't whine because you didn't get a watered down derivative literal narrative. Artists like Darren Aronofsky and David Lynch have been at this craft for quite some time, and they know literal narrative is not hard to pull off. Symbolism, surrealism, multiple layers of perspective, that's a considerable challenge. If it's not for you, it's not for you, but it's tiring to see a convenient dismissal when someone doesn't connect with a piece. Having said that, I don't think this was Aronofsky's best effort. I thought the main concepts and core storyline were fantastic, but felt would have been best realized as a short film and condensed to 40-50 minutes. The themes were repeated to the point of being redundant, and though the point was made, it could have been made more efficiently. I don't see Aronofsky ever eclipsing ""Requiem,"" but this was a solid effort.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

I liked the movie,"Disclaimer: I totally missed the Biblical references and I learnt them from a review here. So obviously that part of the movie was totally lost to me.
But. I enjoyed it. It was beautiful, mysterious and in the end totally crazy. It made me think. It made me relate to the woman on the most mundane level - the supportive wife, the self-obsessed artist, the house - the temple of the their love, being desecrated by his ego. I saw it as a grotesque critique of the relationship model - giver/user. So even just that layer was fine with me and made me feel my time was well spent. Also the evolution of the society, with the false idols it creates and then starts killing in ""their name"". It was interesting story told in a way that worked for me. 
Now, about the Biblical references, in retrospection I can see the idea and it explains a lot. But honestly, if I knew them in advance, that would have ruined my appreciation for the film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Completely bonkers in a way one is likely to love or hate but unlikely to feel indifferent to,"This strange horror film is centred on a young woman; she is married to an older man. He is a poet and she works to repair their home, which was previously damaged by a fire. The house is remote but one day a man turns up claiming to have mistaken it for a guest house. The poet invites him to stay the night against his wife's wishes. The next day the man's wife arrives, she almost immediately starts asking our protagonist awkward questions and makes her feel uncomfortable; still the poet won't make them leave. Things only get worse when the guests' two sons arrive; they fight and one is accidentally fatally injured... the nightmare is just beginning.I suspect this is one of those films that viewers are likely to really love or really hate but are very unlikely to consider 'merely okay'. The sense of unease is gradually introduced but quickly escalates to an early act of violence. Then things relax and appears to bet better before turning to a nightmare. There are plenty of scenes that are likely to disturb the viewer; especially towards the end. The young wife, played brilliantly by Jennifer Lawrence, is rarely off screen is clearly uncomfortably and that feeling is likely to be shared by the viewer. The story may be a biblical allegory; something that isn't immediately obvious but grows increasingly apparent but you don't need to be religious to get it. As mentioned before Lawrence is great; she is supported by Javier Bardem who is equally fine in the more ambiguous role of her husband; a character who enjoys the adulation of his fans to the point that he neglects his wife. The rest of the cast are sold too. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody who likes their horror more than a little bit weird.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
the mother movie 2017,"The mother movie - 2017In this analytical essay, I will focus on one specific reading of this movie, that could possibly help to appreciate and understand some of the parts that put this psychological mystery together. In order to do that, I will use the proposotion that mother! can be read as an allegory. This means the ideas and the characters of the movie represent something else. They refer to meaningful concepts and stories that exceed the storyworld itself. The possibility of an allegory brings me to the following statement: Darren Aronofsky's mother! Is an intriguing religious allegory, in which specific sequences and characters mainly refer to biblical stories, persons and ideas.
The characters :
When the movie approached its shocking finale, it became clear to me that the male lead actually represents God. In the very beginning of the film, we see how the concept of creation goes hand in hand with the deeds of Javier Bardems character. After he touches a mysterious glowing stone, the house actually starts to 'live'. Green vegetation replaces the dust, the darkness and the silence. The house thus awakens, and so does the character called mother (Jennifer Lawrence). The temporality here (creation and awakening go together) is the first clue mother is actually mother earth or mother nature. I will come back to that observation later.
When you read the biblical book of Genesis, you can notice that the beginning of mother! resembles the process of biblical creation. Both stories elaborate on the possibility of making something out of nothing, using the performative power of a mighty entity. One interesting difference is at stake here: in Genesis, the voice of God is enough to start the process of creation (Genesis 1); in mother!, Javier Bardem needs a mystical stone to bring life into the house. This can be seen as a limitation; the God of mother! needs something else to create, he can't do it all by himself. This suggestion becomes more solid if you keep in mind that Bardems character turns out to be a poet with a serious writers block. The principle of first creation is followed by hesitation and doubt. What to do, for example, when the people wandering on earth try to kill eachother?
In my opinion, the case for the story of Cain and Abel (Genesis 4) is really strong here. The two sons entering the house are the sons of the first people on earth, Adam and Eve (Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer). We hear a testament prejudiced the younger brother (Brian Gleeson), causing the other son (Domhnal Gleeson) to kill him out of hate and jealousy. It's also possible to see some reflections of the Jacob & Esau-story (>Genesis 25) here, as that story contains the specific element of heritage and prejudice, granted by the father (Isaak in Genesis, Adam in this story). My interpretation is that Darren Aronofsky is combining the stories of Cain & Abel and Jacob & Ezau. The narrative purpose of these references is purely suggestive: in mother!, conflicts are not caused by an evil entity (there is no snake, no devil), but by the very people God created. Evil resides in their nature, in their urge to revolt when (subjective forms of) injustice occur.
There is one character that represents real justice in this movie. The paradox of mother! is that this character isn't God. It's mother. When the movie is about halfway and all people (all but 'God' and mother) have left the house, mother confronts God with the fact that he doesn't want to make love to her. There is much more ambiguity in this question than what meets the eye; if Bardems character actually IS God, it would make sense he isn't interested in love-making. We have to take into account though that God 'became' a man of flesh and blood too; at least, if we continue thinking in christian characters, ideas and metaphors. In that case, a 'higher', metaphysical entity can actually have sexual desires. Another uncomfortable paradox... and you can definetely feel that discomfort in the painful scenes Bardem and Lawrence share.
God and mother do make love together, and this deed is followed by the strangest cinematic pregnancy I have witnessed in years. When mother wakes up the next morning, she just 'knows' she is pregnant. Her belly starts to grow, and everyone who watches this movie will confirm it doesn't take nine months to give birth this time...
The only explanation for this strange kind of affair is a religious reference once again. If mother symbolizes Maria in this sequence, the narrative contains the new-testamentical birth of baby Jesus (Matthew 1). Written and visual proof for this hypothesis follow, as there are people bringing gifts (referring to Matthew 2:11) and Bardems character starts mumbling about the 'beginning of something very special'. The climax is as intense as it should be: after a magnificent competition in staring and awkward eye-contact, Bardem takes away his son and give him to the people who are destined to do the most horrible thing. This is Gods offer to humanity, followed by Bardems completely inhuman urge to 'forgive' the people who just... well... if you saw mother!, and I hope you did at this point, you know what happened.
I will close this part of the discussion with one specific remark on the end credits. My statement is that Darren Aronofsky knew exactly what he was doing when he wrote his allegorical characters. Javier Bardems character doesn't have an actual name until the end credits state he's called 'Him' (note the capital H). About ten minutes earlier, the very same character proclaims the following line of dialogue: 'I am who/that I am'. This line of dialogue corresponds with a biblical phrase in Exodus 3:14. When Mozes asks God on Mt. Sinaï what his name is, Gods answer equals the only direct clue Javier Bardem gives concerning his true identity. Furthermore, Brian Gleeson and Domhnal Gleeson (they are brothers in real life too) are listed as 'the younger brother' and the 'Oldest Son' (imdb). All the guests visiting the house get characterizing titles to; there's a Zealot (!), a cupbearer, a fool, a wanderer, even a Good Samaritan (Luke 10)... none of these characters has an actual name, but all the characters have a methaphorical one.
The house :
As you can see in soome of the more surrealistic shots of this movie, the house seems to have a heart. In my opinion, the house represents planet earth. God is the owner of the house, while mother! (Lawrence) is the protector of the house, the protector of life. Note how mother tries to restore everything in the house that's broken or destroyed.
We ourselves are the unwanted guests that populate planet earth. We think we can afford to do anything, because the owner of the planet told us we could(ór we decide by ourselves we can). When Lawrences character asks the people in the house why they destroy everything and why they act as if the house is theirs, the guests all give the same answer: because the owner lets them, because he wants them to share everything. You can detect some serious criticism of religion here: I read these dialogues as a protest to the claim (of many believers) that anything is possible, just because God's on their side.
This is not a movie about truth or falsehood. It's not about the question of Gods existence. Maybe it's about the Death of God (yes, Bardem dies), but only on short notice; when the house is destroyed, the process of creation can begin again.
The ending of mother! thus brings Aronofsky's last movie Noah back in the picture. After the flood (the end of the house/world an all the people on it), God has the surreal possibility to start all over again.
Conclusion :
It's important to emphasize that mother! Is open to many readings. My interpretation isn't final at all, but I sincerely hope I have convinced you it is possible to interpret mother! The way I did. For me, the possibility of a (nearly perfect) religious allegory absolutely enriched this movie. It made me think about the screenplay in a completely different manner, and it enabled me to make sense of sequences that I probably wouldn't understand if I hadn't seen the clues I described in this essay.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"An art-house tour-de-force indeed, but not without its shortcomings.","Darren Aronofsky's ""Mother!"" is a surrealist, hard-hitting, and horrifying allegory that packs a visceral and intense punch. The film is an intricate tapestry of Biblical imagery and themes that leave viewers grappling with complex philosophical questions. Jennifer Lawrence stars as Mother, a woman who lives with her poet husband, Him (Javier Bardem), in a secluded house.As the film progresses, their tranquil existence is disrupted by a series of increasingly disturbing visitors, culminating in an apocalyptic ending that will leave you feeling broken, almost as if you just want to wail about the horror you've witnessed, and it is indeed a truly horrifying film, playing on your senses and emotions the entire run through, making you question space and time by the end of it.The film is a tour-de-force in terms of visual storytelling. The cinematography, by Matthew Libatique, is strikingly beautiful and hauntingly dark. The camera work is intimate, giving viewers a sense of being trapped alongside Mother as she is overwhelmed by the chaos around her. Aronofsky's direction is masterful, as he weaves together a complex and layered narrative that leaves viewers on edge throughout the suspenseful and for the most part well-written script.The Biblical imagery and allusions in ""Mother!"" are both explicit and subtle. Aronofsky uses these elements to explore themes of creation, destruction, and rebirth. The film is also an examination of religion and faith, as well as a critique of the patriarchal society that has dominated Western culture for centuries. The portrayal of Mother as a figure of strength and resilience is a feminist statement that challenges traditional gender roles.The performances by Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem are exemplary. Lawrence delivers a raw and emotionally charged performance, portraying Mother's descent into madness with nuance and subtlety. Bardem, meanwhile, is both charming and chilling as Him, the charismatic poet who is oblivious to the chaos around him.The script of ""Mother!"" is a work of art in and of itself. Aronofsky's use of metaphor and symbolism is both intricate and powerful. The allegory, while heavy-handed at times, is nonetheless incredibly effective in converting the film's central themes in a stylistic way. The dialogue between the incredibly well-written characters is sharp and provocative, providing a solid foundation for the film's exploration of religion, gender, and societal norms.The character writing and characterization in ""Mother!"" is the best part of this allegorical tale, with each character embodying a specific idea or theme. Lawrence's portrayal of mother is a standout, with her character serving as a symbol of creation and rebirth. Braden's Him, on the other hand, represents the destructive power of the male ego. The supporting cast, including Michelle Pfeiffer and Ed Harris, also add layers to the complexity of the film, making ""Mother !"" a rich and rewarding cinematic experience.While ""Mother!"" is a great work of art, it is not without its shortcomings. The film's pacing can be uneven at times, with some scenes feeling rushed and others drawn out. The allegorical narrative can also feel heavy-handed, with some viewers finding it difficult to engage with the story on a personal level.Despite its flaws, ""Mother!"" is an ambitious and thought-provoking film. Aronofsky's signature style and the powerful performances by Lawrence and Bardem make it a must-see for fans of surrealist cinema. The film's use of Biblical imagery and themes is a bold statement that challenges traditional beliefs and societal norms. While it may not be for everyone, ""Mother!"" is a film that is sure to leave a lasting impression.Overall, ""Mother!"" receives a score of 8/10. While the film is visually stunning and emotionally powerful, its heavy-handed allegory and uneven pacing detract from its impact. Nonetheless, Aronofsky's latest work is a bold and daring cinematic statement that is sure to provoke discussion and debate for years to come, and without a doubt one of the greatest art house films of the century so far.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

This film hit a nerve and not because of all the symbolism or what the ""true meaning"" of it was. I have never so closely related to a character in a film than I did with Jennifer Lawrence's performance. 
I was riveted by her character and the panic, anxiety and pain of her situation. It was as if it were scripted from my own dreams and nightmares (though it went much further than my subconscious mind ever has!).
The emotional turmoil and anxiety of being powerless to control 'others' from transgressions of your personal space and property was expertly portrayed. The connection for me was so intense it was disturbing to say the least.

A decidedly inferior homage to Rosemary's Baby that amounts to little more than a series of pretentious metaphors and allegories,"I can absolutely understand why someone would dislike or even hate this film, but let's start with the positives. Firstly, the sound editing is excellent; you hear every footstep and creaky floorboard in the imposing, shape shifting house that is a character in itself. These unnervingly sensual acoustics aid the DoP's extreme closeups, which create an awkward, uncomfortable atmosphere. The performances are good, too.The problem is quite simply this - what on earth is it all about? Well, Aronofsky says his story is drenched in biblical references, but these complexities are only fully apparent to those who have either read Aronofsky's artist statement or are well versed in the good book. It's also been said that 'Her' represents mother earth while the rest of the characters represent the threats to our planet. This is the kind of over reliance of pseudo-profound metaphors rather than complex, believable characters and narrative that really turn me off. It's better to ignore Aronofsky's self- indulgence and see it for what is - a massively inferior homage to Rosemary's Baby with a semi-interesting metaphor about selfish masculinity at its core.Now the theme of self-absorbed, self-pitying masculinity could make for a very interesting film, but any possible resonance is lost when a filmmaker communicates this subject through a litany of chaotic metaphorical surrealism.The reverse is true of Rosemary's Baby, which is rooted in chilling reality with an endearing central performance by Mia Farrow, whose relationship with John Cassavettes's character is human and romantic. The relationship between 'Mother' (Jennifer Lawrence) and 'Him' (Javier Bardem), on the other hand, is bereft of development; we barely even see them communicate. You could argue that this is because 'Him' represents male self-absorption, but it's difficult to empathise with a couple that have such an odd lack of chemistry.This dubious central relationship quickly receives even less attention as 'Him' entertains a gradually increasingly large group of hateful strangers who further harass and use 'Mother'. Her treatment caused me to feel some degree of indignation, but I didn't genuinely care because mother! amounts to little more than a sequence of pretentious allegories and metaphors. It's just like watching a bad dream, and dreams don't have the tangibility and resonance of reality.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Art is not shoving everything into a blender...,"As I say in the title of my review, it is neither artful nor profound to jam every possible reference and metaphor into your movie. It's lazy.

"Exciting chaos, slightly stale","Mother! is a purely allegorical film. In its foundation it mixes biblical allegories into a story about mother nature. The intent of director Darren Aronofsky is completely lucid. He wants the audience to reflect on the history of humanity and its impact on our planet, as well as of how our relation to God is ultimately what makes us destroy each other and our home. There are many layers in this film however I can't say that I experience the layers to be particularly deep. Mother! is so concerned about its metaphors that it neglects in creating fully fleshed characters and doesn't contribute any poignant ideas to the conversation about climate change. Yes, we have destroyed our planet. Yes, we have an unheatlhy relation to religion. Then what? This wouldn't be an issue had it been that it didn't take itself so incredibly seriously. It comes dangerously close to being goofy at its climax.What saves Mother! is actually the ways in which Aronofsky choses to portray and visualise the metaphors. Watching the house deteriorate symbiotically with The Mother and all the visitors that arrogantly and violently storm their home was thrilling. The allegories were excellently portrayed by the actors, I think especially Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem were fantastic. Mother! is anything but boring and manages to entertain all the way through in quite a ride. It marvels technically and I celebrate any filmmaker that tries to do something new. But Mother! doesn't fail by technical marvel, it just leaves me seeking a refreshing statement in a battle it clearly wants to participate in.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Highly symbolic, highly disturbing, highly rewarding","I attended the premiere screening of 'mother!' and the entire audience left the cinema speechless. Potentially Aronofsky's magnum opus, 'mother!' benefits from rich religious and environmental symbolism with so much more bubbling under the surface than the majority of mainstream cinema today.With a genius marketing plan - the film itself is shrouded in secrecy, with intriguing trailers which actually give away nothing - 'mother!' exceeds expectations and takes turn after turn, each more shocking and tantalising than the next.Aronofksy prefaced the screening with an apology for what we were about to witness, but that we will ""feel better tomorrow"", while Jennifer Lawrence noted its biblical and environmental themes. That doesn't give away anything, though. It's almost impossible to describe it - go and see for yourself -- but give yourself some time after to decompress.Lots of discussion will emerge after this film's release, and that's a good thing. It's esoteric but not alienating, and covers such a wide scope of themes that everyone will pick up something different. I found the film to be feminist in nature, and a brilliant comment on a woman's societal role in the modern era.Though the acting is top-notch, the film's overall message makes 'mother!' a winner. The sheer pathos of the film overrides it's slightly clunky dialogue, and Aronofsky's assured direction will set this film to be the most-discussed movie of 2017.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A film in a hurry,"Darren Aronoksy's ""Mother!"" reminded me of a varied bunch of other movies, including ""Pacific Heights"", ""The Shining"" and ""Rosemary's Baby"". A stranger comes into a pregnant woman's home: superficially polite and plausible, soemthing about him rubs her up the wrong way: he doesn't respect the boundaries she expects him to, while her partner seems strangely oblivious to the oddness of their guest's conduct. Is she paranoid, or is there really something wrong here? I like the premise, but the film seems in a hurry throughout, escalating rapidly where there might have been more mileage in letting things simmer; and ultimately plunging into a graphic supernatural horror that feels a long way from the film's opening moments. In the end, the protagonist is effectively revealed as doomed from the start, and the nighmarish quality present throughout loses its interest as the story transforms into literal nightmare. A little more restraint in the writing would not have gone amiss.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The weirdness of 'Mother!' has to be seen to be believed,"'Mother!' is a perfect example of a film that raises such high hopes with one of the best and most disturbing trailers (every bit as much as the trailer for 'IT') of the year, yet turns out to be the complete anti-thesis in quality making it one of the most disappointing, and to me the strangest, films of the year.It is really sad for me to say this about 'Mother!' Appreciate Darren Aronofsky very highly, though totally get why his films don't click with all viewers, and really liked to loved all his pre-'Noah' films, especially 'The Wrestler' and 'Requiem for a Dream' ('Black Swan' was also great, and while it is one of his more polarising films likewise with 'The Fountain'). 'Noah' for me was a real disappointment, though it was nowhere near as bad as the initial audience response on IMDb (which was of vitriolic hate with severe objections to how the 'Noah's Ark' story was treated).To me, 'Mother!' is Aronofsky's worst. Was expecting to be terrified and riveted but ended up being perplexed and left completely cold. Although the trailer was one of the year's best, it turned out to be one of the most misleading. Is 'Mother!' irredeemable? No, absolutely not, Aronofsky's films are at least extremely well-made and crafted and he often gets great performances out of well-chosen casts, even if there are other aspects that don't connect. Could it have been much better? Considering it had Aronofsky's name on it, that most of his previous films are examples of great film-making and that it had talent like Jennifer Lawrence, Javier Bardem, Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer, yes it should have been much better.Where 'Mother!' fares strongly are in the visuals and the acting, pretty much the film's only near-uniformly good assets. It's a wonderful-looking film, especially in the agile and truly unsettling cinematography that gives a real disconcerting sense that there are things constantly lurking around. The production design is audacious and creepy, the house like an increasingly opening up character of its own, the lighting is rich in atmosphere and the aesthetics are more than accomplished.Jennifer Lawrence sheds her usual quirkiness and feistiness, and gives a more vulnerable edge here which is not just wholly convincing but also very moving. Michelle Pfeiffer stands out in support in a truly startling turn, likewise with Ed Harris and their chemistry is far more interesting than that between Lawrence and Bardem. Domhall and Brian Gleeson (sons of Brendan) do very capably with little to do.Aronofsky does bring some dynamic to his directing, if more in the style and atmosphere than in the storytelling and content.However, 'Mother!' really is let down by that it feels incredibly muddled. Throughout there are a mishmash of tones, whether it was horror, thriller of a psychological kind, allegory and perhaps torture porn, and it all felt thrown in with not much thought in what to do with them. There are moments of an unsettled vibe, but only in spurts. A vast majority of the film has scares that are very much empty and too reliant on done to death old dark/haunted house tropes and at times unintentionally funny, the intense close ups and sudden reveals feel overused and neither provoke chills or sympathy for the protagonist (for all Lawrence's efforts).The pacing is far too sedate to be thrilling and there is nothing sensual about the film due to the chemistry between Lawrence and Bardem being so lukewarm. 'Mother's' content is obvious a lot of the time, and the symbolism and allegorical elements came over as excessive, heavy-handed and overblown. It was not the matter of not getting them, it is the way they were used that has put people off and that it is hard telling what Aronofsky is trying to say. It was also not the matter of hating things that do things differently, have seen my fair share of unconventional films and have been impressed.While Aronofsky succeeds in the stylistic elements and some atmosphere, the storytelling doesn't work here. The momentum is creaky constantly and the whole telling of it is strangely muddled at best and incomprehensible at worst. Particularly bad is the last half an hour, which descends into ridiculous and incoherent chaos and outlandishness. The dialogue is stilted and rambling and the characters are very thinly sketched, especially Bardem's, though Lawrence's is also too passive and is not easy to root for. There are exceptions to the acting, Bardem looks bored in his role and Kristen Wiig is completely out of place.Overall, a disappointing film (didn't hate it, just didn't care for it) that should have delivered on creepiness but instead delivered on excessive weirdness that it has to be seen to be believed. It is not hard to see why it has polarised critics and audiences alike. 4/10 Bethany Cox",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

However, as I reflected and let my mind go over the movie itself, I started to see all its quality, its symbolism. One day after having seen it, i can clearly say that i love this movie, and i suspect that it will be in my all time favourites as time goes by. This is the power of Mother!, one true experience.

You can see the art behind the scenes.,"Actually this movie isnt my favorite movie but i wanted to talk about it because I couldn't choose my fav. Anyway,Mother is a American psychological horror? film. jennifer lawrence and Javier Bardem are starring.The plot follows a young woman whose tranquil life with her husband at their country home is disrupted by the arrival of a mysterious couple. The main place is lead characters's house.Mother was directed by Darren Aranofsky. most of the people who watched the film did not understand the message. The movie is satire to religion to god, every scene, every detail is a hidden symbolic passage. example: In one scene a man is in the bathroom and his back appears bruised, it means that he is Adam and his back is injured because God took his rib to make Eve. What I understood from the film is that it shows that God would be a selfish being that while man destroys the world and nature he only cares about being worshiped. You need to watch the movie and at the same time associate that part of the bible it is referring to, and which bible character each actor represents so you can see the art behind the scenes.😋",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

If you want to go for this picture, I can recommend to read the short review from IMDb-user wasabiteabag from Australia. In his review is a fine summary of all the symbols in the movie and it helps a lot to be aware of symbolism as main carrier of the script. With that in mind it is a must see.

Pretentious nonsense masquerading as art,"This movie tries to justify itself through the use of artful imagery and Biblical symbolism, but can't seem to mask its overall misogyny. While misogyny has been a theme in many a horror film, I've never seen it used so blatantly than in this film and all while trying to mask it with a thick layer of pretentious allegorical Creationism. This isn't something I would typically speak out on, but this movie hit a nerve. How Him patronizes and demeans Her throughout; how the guests devalue Her within her own home; how Her debases herself in enough to be treated in this manner by all those around her. It all speaks of male chauvinism.Even beyond that point, I've seen so many people defend this movie and it's because of the allegorical nature of it. Just because a film is overwrought with Biblical symbolism doesn't make it 'meaningful' or even a 'good' movie. 
Underneath all the symbolism and all the misogyny this, simply put, was a bad movie. It was slow, boring. There was never any tension created to amount to anything suspenseful or exciting. And the plot didn't stick. Yes, the allegory. The whole point was the allegory as the director so diligently drilled into our heads throughout. But an allegory without good storytelling is just nonsense. 
And this movie is purely pretentious nonsense.",2.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

It seems like a terrible confession to make but the truth is I couldn't care less about that mother because I didn't believe in her plight and couldn't understand her behavior. Jennifer Lawrence is a terrific actress we all know that but here, she screams and screams while I glanced at my watch with mounting impatience. Borrowing from other, better films, doesn't help, on the contrary, it irritates. Rosemary's Baby came to mind as well as The Tenant, Apartment Zero, Common Wealth.

Amazing surreal nightmare,"This movie is one hell of a trip and perhaps completely unlike anything you've seen before. It starts out feeling like a horror drama, or the makings of one, but then goes off in a very strange, unexpected and highly original direction. There is a palpable tension throughout, and an unnerving, strange dream-like quality, with a real sense of dread. Later on, towards the end, the movie completely flies off into something like an insane surreal nightmare, an assault on the senses,and is very shocking. The ending is incredible. The movie says a lot about the human experience and especially relationships, love and selfishness; this is the emotional core seen through the eyes of the lead actress. The acting is great, especially the lead actress who is absolutely superb, as is the set. The filming style, and sound work, are at times intentionally disorientating, adding to the surreal sense. It's an absolutely gripping experience and very psychedelic. Despite much intense darkness and carnage, there is also goodness, beauty and truth, so in a strange way, in parts it's a wholesome experience. Bear in mind this movie is working more on a subconscious level and a lot of it does not make logical sense. You may well hate it. Incredible.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"A weird and really strange film that blends mystery , family drama and horror","A terrifying and rare yarn with several characters with strong obsessions that drive them towards self-destruction. The roles in this film are unnamed and are referred to by descriptors. In the burnt-out remains of a large house , Him (Javier Bardem) , a known poet struggling with writer's block, places a crystal object on a pedestal in his study. The ruined house morphs into a lovely home in a landscape. In bed, Mother (Jennifer Lawrence) , the writer's spouse and muse, awakens and wonders aloud where Him is. While renovating the house, she starts seeing things that unsettle her, including visualizing a beating heart within its walls. Along the way, couple's relationship is tested when uninvited guests arrive at their home. One day, Man (Ed Harris) shows up at the house, asking for a room. Him readily agrees, and Mother reluctantly follows suit. During his stay, Man suffers coughing fits and Mother observes an open wound in his side. Soon Man's wife, Woman (Michelle Pfeiffer) , also arrives to stay. Then things go wrong when a large number of guests disrupting their tranquil existence. Seeing is believing !Great actors lead the cast of this bizarre psychological thriller written and directed by the quirky filmmaker Darren Aronofsky , providing an unflinching portrayal of violence and damage to the body , adding a colorful cinematography by Matthew Libatique . So in ¨Mother!¨ the protagonist couple's relationship and her peaceful life is put to the test when , one after the other, the house fills with more and more strangers, forcing the wife to reexamine her image of love, devotion and sacrifice. Allegorical in many ways, revolving around obsession and its damaging effects on people's lives . The film mixes suspense, drama and horror, as Aronofsky explains as follows : ¨The flick begins as a simple on-camera story about a marriage. The center of the story is occupied by a woman who is asked to give, give and give. Until she can't give anymore. The on-camera story can't contain the pressure that builds up inside and turns into something else...¨. Main and support cast are pretty good ,such as Javier Bardem as an acclaimed but deranged poet and Jennifer Lawrence as his suffering wife . Accompanied by veterans as Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer and other secondary appearances from Brian Gleeson and Domhnall Gleeson.This luxuriously mounted production was professionally directed by Darren Aronofsky , including lengthy over-the-shoulder shots , though it has some flaws , gaps and failures . Darren frequently uses a technique known as the hip-hop montage, which is a sequence of images or actions shown in fast-motion with accompanying sound effects, usually shown to simulate a certain action, such as taking drugs . He won several film awards after completing his senior thesis film , ""Supermarket Sweep"", starring Sean Gullette, which went on to becoming a National Student Academy Award finalist. Aronofsky didn't make a feature film until five years later, in February 1996, where he began creating the concept for ¨Pi¨ (1998) . After Darren's script for Pi, received great reactions from friends, he began production. The film re-teamed Aronofsky with Gullette , who played the lead. This went on to further hits, such as the successful ¨Requiem for a dream¨ (2000) with Jared Leto , ¨The Wrestler¨ (2008) with Mickey Rourke and the Oscarized ¨Black Swan¨ (2010) with Natalie Portman. Most recently, he has made the films ¨Noah ¨(2014) with Russell Crowe and this ¨Mother!¨ (2017). Rating 6/10 .Acceptable and passable , but very bizarre .",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A curiosity,"I have to temper any critique with the recognition that I was entertained and engaged throughout. That's worth 6 stars on its own. A killer cast does work here, too, and the direction and set design are vivid.At the end of the day I don't think the metaphor was worth exploring, however. Unless you think the world needs more (and more provocative) Christian allegories. As a viewer I was interested in trying to figure it out, but by the third act the mystery is mostly gone. The archetypes are pretty on-the-nose; it's not a film that lingers with you as you search for meaning. The meaning is not precisely what a typical Christian might appreciate (perhaps quite the contrary), but it draws exclusively from those well-worn themes.I'm not sorry I watched it, it certainly was something...

An allegory of Biblical proportions,"Long-awaited ""Mother!"" is a challenging film. It's far more complicated and rich than the house-invasion horror-thriller it starts out as.Despite having directed only seven feature films, Darren Aronofsky has become one of the most interesting and important directors of our time. Now returning after a shot at Biblical adventure-drama ""Noah"" (2014), Aronofsky delivers a film full of allegoric storytelling. The performances of Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem are impressive. Aronofsky's screen writing and direction never allows the viewer to get away from the hellish nightmare that unrolls. Longtime Aronofsky collaborator Matthew Libatique (who's worked with Aronofsky on six out of his seven full-features) delivers some exquisite cinematography that adds power and discomfort to the story.

a film full of allegories and that will still have much to talk about.,"Mother! is a controversial film, a film that received very positive reviews, but also received many negatives, Darren Aronofsky is undoubtedly one of the great directors of the century, especially for the incredible Requiem for a Dream and the great Black Swan, he made a movie full of allegories the bible and also the film tries to give a message, but not all managed to capture (I for example, I saw some videos about people explaining better and understood more and more), the film has a great cast, Jennifer Lawrence is very well, Javier Bardem is fine too, the rest of the cast, Ed Harris, Michelle Pfeiffer, and etc are all very well, I have not seen any Oscar performance in the film, but the best is without a doubt to Jennifer Lawrence, Darren's direction is great , it's amazing how he manages to make the whole movie have Jennifer's character on the screen, at no time she's not on the scene, it's just like we were her, and that was very clever, the soundtrack does not exist, and this makes a greater tension, type in the masterpiece In Country for old Men, but the film is slow and gets very tiring with passing of the time, even if it is not being long, there are problematic parts that take a little of the movie, Mother! is undoubtedly a controversial film, but it is far from bad as many people have said.

Complete waste time and money,"My husband and I checked some critic review before going to see this movie. The movie critics seemed to give it a good run. Unfortunately, to our dismay, this movie is completely not what the movie review was about and it's the worst movie I have ever seen.What makes it such a disappointment is not its utter violence and feverish cinematography, but its completely nonsensical plot. Sure the director has a very clear cinematic and directorial ambition to accomplish and there are meanings in all the plots, sub plots, etc.and he explains it's an allegory, but please do not forget, no matter how ambitious your artistic aspiration is, your story has to MAKE SENSE! And this is the biggest problem of this movie. The whole plot is an accumulation of crazy mumble jumble and pushes the audience into a lost land. The director forgets the audience goes into a theater to entertain. They do not spend their money to kill their brain cells to understand your over the top cinematic nightmare.This is not because ""this movie is saved only for those sophisticated audience"" - we have been watching lots of artistic indie movies and this one is simply not that. The glorious, hefty directorial self indulgence simply falls under its own weight.If you haven't seen this movie, you can save your ten bucks to watch something else. I was disappointed to waste more than two precious hours of my time on this flop. And DO NOT always trust a movie critics opinion.

A refreshing oasis in an otherwise parched desert of Hollywood remakes (NO SPOILERS),"10/10I loved this film so much, was so shaken and moved by it, that I actually created an IMDb account to post this review. This film is a breath of cold, crisp fresh air for anyone sick of brain dead Hollywood sequels and remakes.My review is for people who haven't watched the film, so it contains no spoilers. I believe that like a magician's trick, if you know what's going on, the illusion will vanish. You'll miss the magic. You'll won't feel the confusion. Your brain won't be pulling itself apart trying to work out what is amiss.This is why all the trailers leave the story as a mystery. It pains me to see the director and cast answering questions on the red carpet and in interviews explaining the film away. Sadly, if you are reading this review, you probably already know what the film is about, and you are now cursed never to experience the magic this film has to offer. It's a risky game, to make a film like this. It's a bubble waiting to be popped by the media and criticism whereupon the marketers suddenly backtrack their high ground and feel the need to explain what it's about. By doing this, they poison the well they put such great care into making.I believe that the true magic of this film can only be experienced if you share the confusion of the protagonist, as I did. I genuinely felt like I was watching events unfold through my own eyes. A state of surreal confusion, anxiety and panic. To be able to transport the watcher into such an incredible and other worldly state, to be able to take someone to such a place, is an amazing feat. And Aronofsky, Lawrence and Bardem accomplished that feat for me.This was obviously an incredibly hard film to market. Give away too much and the magic is gone. Give away too little and magic has no foundation in which to root itself. Thank you for the director, cast and studio for investing in this. I read that they did 3 months solid of rehearsals before shooting, and I think you can see this passion in the execution, the flow, the near flawless way in which the jigsaw puzzle assembles itself. This is not improv.What else to say about the film without giving anything away? It's hard. All I can say is if you like to THINK, stop reading or learning ANYTHING about this movie right now. Go on a total information blackout until you are in the cinema. And then strap yourself in.Might I first address my own assessment of the 15% of people on IMDb who gave this film 1/10:* Half say the film is too obvious* The other half say the film doesn't make senseThey can't seem to make their minds up. How can people be giving it 1/10 for being both too obvious and lowbrow and others giving it 1/10 for being incomprehensibly highbrow?All I can imagine is that the people who thought it was too obvious knew what it was about before they started. For them, the film was perhaps already doomed.And the others in that group that ""worked it out"" too quickly, then thought it was too low brow for them, I guess their brain switched off and they didn't care to keep looking for the myriad other interpretations of what is happening on the screen.There are at least 2 very obvious interpretations, and many non-obvious ones. I've read lots of reviews in the days since seeing it (I saw it a week ago) and people really have come up with very interesting ways in which to interpret the story and symbols. For 80% of the film I thought it was about something completely different than my final interpretation.Then there are those who thought it was incomprehensible. One lady near me got up in the end and said ""Is everyone else as confused as I am?"". I guess she thought she was going to see the next Hunger Games or Transformers. I don't blame her for that at all. I just genuinely feel sad for her because she hadn't switched her brain on until it was too late. She lost her $20 and she felt robbed and I honestly feel sorry for her.If ""interpretation"" is a dirty word for you, you might hate this film. But let me be clear - this is not an ineffable high-brow David-Lynch circle-jerk that leaves people for decades wondering what the meaning (if any) was. This film has very clear, solid, definable meaning. As well as myriad alternate interpretations.Lastly, some say it offended their belief system. I can't argue with that one. This film is offensive. It assaults you. It takes no prisoners and doesn't care for your belief system. Because it is bigger than your belief system. It is infinitely (literally) bigger than that.If you have ever felt that Hollywood was caught in meaningless loop, pay to go see this movie and show your support. The more people that see it the more innovative, adventurous, risky, thought provoking movies we be financed in the future. A major movie house took a risk on this - I can only suggest that anyone who cares about film, get yourself to a cinema and reward them for having the balls to produce this.If my review gets one more person to watch this film, the time taken to write it has been worth it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Too many unnecessary bad reviews!,"I went to watch Mother with little knowledge of what it was about, I read a few reviews which differed from 1 star to 10 stars so I was keen to watch this to give my own opinion. From some of the '1 star' reviews I read I personally feel this is a harsh review, i have seen some bad films but it would take a lot to give it 1 star. I will be completely honest while watching the film and even at the end my thoughts were 'I have no idea what just happened' I did then once I got home spend some time googling the plot, some would say 'if you need to google a film to understand it then it can't be good' others may say 'if you kept thinking about it that much you had to find out more, it must be good' so I will leave you to your own opinion. I however after watching a film love reading about it after and I will not say what I found but it did clear everything up and then made me enjoys the film more. Although the film itself is confusing without understanding it I was constantly engaged through the whole film and was left in suspense completely throughout. A lot of reviews I read were saying it is put in the wrong genre, it's not a horror.. I personally feel that we are now moving towards a new genre of horror, how many more poltergeist movies can you watch? I have now seen a couple movies which are not the usual 'horror' genre and I am glad the horror setting is changing, every person will view things in a different way which I like. I gave mother a '7' for the reason I was constantly captivated throughout and thought it was an interesting move for the horror genre and since watching the movie it has constantly been on my mind which I believe a movie should.

I want to be alone,"I can't help feeling that the story of ""Mother!"" was written by someone who never got over being rudely intruded upon when they were in the bathroom.""Mother!"" is chock full of phobias including some most of us can relate to with invasion of personal space the most prominent. For me it is an effective horror story until about the three-quarter mark. Then it ends up in the same kind of mess as Ben Wheatley's ""High Rise"".Writer/director Darren Aronofsky started out with a fascinating scenario. A successful author simply called 'Him' (Javier Bardem) moves to a large secluded house in the country with his pregnant wife, 'Mother' (Jennifer Lawrence). It seems they both welcome the solitude. However when he invites a stranger into their home it leads to more and more unexpected guests arriving and also the arrival of hordes of the author's fans. He seems to welcome the attention while she feels besieged.Before the script and film heads way over-the-top, there are some nicely observed touches, especially the uninvited guests who turn nasty when they are rejected, and Bardem's author who seems prepared to sacrifice just about anything for adulation and flattery. On the other hand, Mother slowly cracks up as gatecrashers pop out of every crevice.There is confronting nastiness in ""Mother!"" But that's fine; it's a horror movie. What isn't fine is that it all becomes rather tedious, eventually giving way to Peter Greenaway inspired excess - ""Baby of Macon"" comes to mind. At the end there is even a touch of that mother of all round-trip horror movies, ""Dead of Night"".According to an interview with Jennifer Lawrence, there is subtext in ""Mother!"" including allegory for the rape of Mother Earth plus references to God as well as Adam and Eve. Signals I found difficult to receive out of the unrelenting chaos. I'm surprised we didn't end up with a Blake Edwards-style pie fight - that's what he seemed to do when he didn't know what to do next.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Welcome to the Crystal Maze,"Darren Aronosfsky's mother! is like no other film you'll see this year: guaranteed. As a film lover, an Aronosfsky film is a bit like root canal at the dentist: you know you really need to go ahead and do it, but you know you're not going to be very comfortable in the process.Jennifer Lawrence (""Passengers"", ""Joy"") plays ""mother!"" doing up a dilapidated old house in the middle of nowhere with her much older husband ""Him"" (Javier Bardem, ""Skyfall""). he (sorry. He) is a world- famous poet struggling to overcome a massive writing block. The situation is making things tense between the couple, and things get worse when He inexplicably invites a homeless couple ""man"" (Ed Harris, ""Westworld"", ""The Truman Show"") and ""woman"" (Michelle Pfeiffer, ""Stardust"") to stay at the house. As things go progressively downhill, is mother losing her mind or is all the crazy stuff going on actually happening?Jennifer Lawrence can do no wrong at the moment, and her complexion in the film is flawless: it needs to be, since she has the camera constantly about 3 inches from her face for large chunks of the movie: I sat in the very back row, and I still wasn't far enough away! Her portrayal of a house-proud woman getting progressively more and more irritated by her guests' inconsiderate acts – a glass? without a table mat??! – is a joy to watch. As her DIY 'paradise' is progressively sullied my 'man' and 'woman', so her distress grows exponentially.Some of the supporting acting is also superb, with Ed Harris and particularly Michelle Pfeiffer enjoying themselves immensely. Also worthy of note are the brothers played by real-life brothers Brian Gleeson and Domhnall Gleeson: the latter must never sleep since he must be *constantly* on set at the moment. One of these guys in particular is very abel! (sic).Whereas the trailer depicts this as a kind of normal haunted house spookfest, it is actually nothing of the sort: much of the action (although far-fetched) has a reasonably rational explanation (a continuation of my theme of the ""physics of horror"" from my last two reviews). The film is largely seen through mother!'s eyes, and the skillful cinematographer Matthew Libatique – an Aronosfsky-regular – oppressively and relentlessly delivers a uniquely tense cinematic experience. For me, for the first two thirds of the film at least, it succeeds brilliantly.Aronosfsky is no shirker of film controversy: having Natalie Portman perform oral sex on Natalie Portman in ""Black Swan"" was enough to teach you that. But in the final reels of this film, Aronosfsky doesn't just wind the dial past 10 to the Spinal Tap 11. he keeps going right on up to 20. There are a few scenes in movies over the years that I wish I could go back and ""unsee"", and this film has one of those: a truly upsetting slice of horror, playing to your worst nightmares of loss and despair. While the religious allegory in these scenes is splatted on as heavily as the splodges of mother!'s decorative plaster, they are nonetheless extremely disturbing and bound to massively divide the cinema audience. I think it's fair to say that this DVD is not going to have ""The Perfect Gift for Mother's Day"" as its marketing strapline.Which all leaves me where exactly? For the first time in a long time I actually have no idea! This is a film that I was willing to give 4*'s or less to while I was watching it, but as time has passed and I have thought more on the environmental and religious allegories, and the portrayal of the cult worship prevalent in popular X-factor celebrity, I am warming to it despite my best instincts not to. I'm not religious, but I would love to compare notes on this one with someone with strongly Christian views.So, I've provided a rating above, but I reserve the right to revisit that again at Christmas to see if I can resolve it in my mind as either a movie masterpiece or over-indulgent codswallop.(Please visit bob-the-movie-man for the graphical version of this review.

The perfect S.O.F.A. flick!,"Surreal, Ominous, Foreboding, Ambiguous.If you like movies that tickle the portion of your mind that's been questioning whether or not your reality is just an elaborate distraction, then this movie is for you.I watched this movie 5 times in the first week that I discovered it and it's not because I didn't have other options; it's because when I put on one of those other movies on, I found myself craving to see Mother! again. It's a difficult feeling to describe.It's imagination candy. It's not so much about the things you notice each time you watch it (and there are plenty of them), but rather the new ideas it conjures within your mind each time you watch it. You may even find yourself re-watching it just to have it play in the background while you think about other things. It's that powerful.A lot of people won't understand the power of this movie as obvious from all the 1 star reviews.

Trigger Warning,"""You never loved me. You only loved how I loved you."" ---mother (Jennifer Lawrence) to Him (Javier Bardem)Directed by Darren Aronofsky (""Black Swan"" and ""Requiem for a Dream"") ""mother!"" is possibly the darkest, most disturbing movie I have ever seen.It is absolutely one of the most affecting.Reviews have been mixed, to put it nicely. But I think the theme of ""mother!"" terrifies some people so much that they choose to be perplexed by it rather than allow themselves to even think about what Aronofsky is suggesting.My take on the film is that it is about God, humans, and our respective relationships with creation and the creative process.Humans are trying to create Heaven on Earth, and God is....well....God created our ability to create. ""mother!"" is about the futility of OUR attempts.It is about nihilism.It is the abyss, looking back at us.Congratulations to Darren Aronofsky: He got it on film",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Fierce debate, how wonderful","I have a nagging feeling that the raves come from people in their 20's and/or younger. I maybe wrong but the debate erupting from this movie reeks of youth. Something similar happened with Terrence Malnick's The Tree Of Life. People either loved it or hated it. From my own personal POV the only different between The Tree Of Life and Mother! is that The Tree Of Life was a masterpiece without any visual cope outs and, perhaps, the only commercial concession were in big star names but even then Brad Pitt gives one of the best performances of his career. Mother ! Is not a masterpiece, not to me anyway. I couldn't connect. Was it a comedy of the absurd? When I saw all the people dancing and partying in the house I had a flash back to Blake Edwards's ""The Party""Jennifer Lawrence is a truly gifted actress and beautiful to boot and, quite clearly, she put herself in Darren Aronfski's hands, She, the mother, calls out ""Baby""? Hoping to find her husband - She is a Saint Joan half burned already. That truly puzzled me. Can you please give us time to connect with her? A few minutes. If you remember Mia Farrow's Rosemary - She was, emotionally, so far away from what she's about to confront. Polanski takes the audience through her journey and we're with her, every step of the way. What makes it so terrifying is the veil of normalcy that surrounds the proceedings. In Mother, the surreal takes over the atmosphere and destroys it. We can keep a distance without really participating. The same can be said of Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer - They are a welcome, semi-camp addition at the perfect time and then, they disappear. The glory of Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer in Rosemary's Baby is that their intrusion is taken all the way through to extraordinary results. And Javier Bardem/John Cassavetes? If you're interested watch Rosemary's Baby again like I did last night, 24 hours after seeing Mother!and then you tell me. In my modest opinion one is a flawless masterpiece the other is just okay.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

One of the best drama-horror films of recent times.,"""I know what it's like when you're just starting out, and you think you have all the time in the world, and... you know, you're not going to be so young forever. Have kids! Then you'll be creating something together! This is all just... setting."" Woman (Michelle Pfeiffer)What a phantasmagorical setting it is! Darren Aronofsky is mad about motherhood or rather the process of giving birth either physical or metaphorical. In his mother! he directs and writes a horror potboiler with unsurprising scary tropes but an allegorical heft not seen yet this year. Poe would have approved.Having characters with no names, only generics like woman or poet, allows the writer/director immediately to plunge into the figurative with our approval. The poet (Javier Bardem)) and his wife (Jennifer Lawrence) occupy a mansion that could serve well any such Gothic setting from Frankenstein to Psycho except that it is being rebuilt from a ruinous fire, a phoenix rebirth helped by the construction skills of the wife and the spirit of her youth.Her being pregnant helps the allegory of the artist's creating and complements their apparent devotion to each other in the creation process. The film seems also to be commenting on the dangers of the January-May marriage. He can't write or make love in this sterile time of his career and marriage.Not to worry, for they receive visitors, starting with an ill doctor (Ed Harris) and his stone-cold wife, Woman, who begin to upend the couple's life with fan adoration and frank comments about their marriage. A splendid home-invasion thriller this turns out to be as their loony family and countless fans appear. Aranofsky's Grand- Guignol ending is over the top but effective translating a fearful anxiety the couple has over home invasion.What happens is a mash up of Rosemary's Baby, Black Swan, and Carrie with any other invasion film that becomes more than home busting. Indeed, this tense black comedy is largely a commentary on the challenges of art and partly about troubled marriage. The narcissism of creation and the obsession of the writer to be loved are important motifs of the film as it graphically paints the fall of the house of art.Some audience might grow tired of the Lawrence close ups, which draw us in but also cause us the pain of identifying with her, caring about her more than the artist can. Yet, caring is what art does, close or from afar, writing or filmmaking.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Watch it to make up your own mind—deeply disturbing,"Ugh, ""Mother!"" makes you feel bad... Jennifer Lawrence's character just moved in with her husband, a poet played by Javier Bardem. Their seemingly idyllic life becomes interrupted when a mysterious man and a woman, played by Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer, invite themselves to the couple's new home... and from there on, things spiral downward.Among the many good things that stand out about ""Mother!"" is Jennifer Lawrence's compelling performance. Her face fills almost every shot and the whole story is told in a deeply subjective way from her perspective: As she is trying to make sense of what is happening around her, so are we.When I watched the trailers for ""Mother!"", I thought this was just going to be a rip-off of ROSEMARY'S BABY, but in fact, the movie is nothing like that. You continue to be surprised from beginning to end, and there is a lot of mystery that is deeply haunting. The suspense keeps going as you try to make sense of this movie, which is deeply metaphorical and open to many interpretations. You will leave the theatre wondering what you just saw and discussing the deeper meaning with your friends.

Fantastically weird and rhythmically paced mystery of a film,"Love It If We Made It by the 1975 was a movie directed by someone who really liked No Country for Old Men. Unfortunate that both those works have been lauded by critics with Aronofsky was dealt the short stick reception wise. I do hope Mother! becomes a sort of cult classic because I am of the camp that this is an incredible work of art that kicks the audience in the balls with the ! section towards the end and treats them to an enthralling two hour mystery for the rest. 16mm film makes me want to reach out and touch the fuzz it creates on the characters skin it is so cool, absolutely gorgeous.I am so glad I went into this not knowing a lick about it besides the fact that Jennifer Lawrence, who gives a transformative performance as wistful little Mother in her very motherly cardigan, represented Gaia and that she was in a creaky old house in a clearing, 'Edenic' I found out after the fact, and some people show up. That understanding is all I had and I almost cheated and tried to read more into it like twenty minutes in but I trusted Aronofsky to deliver and deliver he did.The sort of greatest hits of humanities faults exhibited during the most distressing part of the film I actually enjoyed enough to get over some pretty messed up stuff.

The woman wakes up, but her husband is up and about already. We later learn that he is a well-known writer but suffering from writer's block, and that she is restoring the house room by room. Then out of the blue a man comes knocking on the door and the husband invited him in, even though he doesn't know him. Turns out the guy thought their place was a bed-and-breakfast. To the wife's surprise and dismay, her husband invites the man to stay the night. Then the next morning, the stranger's wife comes knocking at the door... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from writer-director Darren Aronofsky, who previously brought us the excellent ""Black Swan"" and ""Requiem For a Dream"", among others. Here he goes in a very different direction and brings us... what exactly? a haunter house scary movie? a psychological terror drama? If you have seen the movie's trailer, you have a pretty good idea what to expect, that is, in the first 45 min. of the movie. After that, the movie goes into a completely different direction. No worries, I won't spoil, but I will say this: I was at times bewildered as to what is going on, at times annoyed, at times fascinated. In other words: the movie is all over the place. It is for me one of the weaker movies that Aronofsky has made to date. Jennifer Lawrence gives her all, and is quite good. Javier Bardem has a difficult role as the inherently unlikable husband. Ed Harris plays a small but vital role as the stranger, as does Michelle Pfeiffer as his wife. An what to make of those final 15 min. of the movie? I couldn't make heads or tails of it, except that I kept thinking about ""Rosemary's Baby"", although that classic is better than ""Mother!"" by a mile or two.The movie opened wide this weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Saturday matinée screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended poorly (less than 20 people in a huge theater), and that is not a good sign for a movie just opening. Bottom line: if you are a fan of either Darren Aronofsky or Jennifer Lawrence, I'd suggest you check out this movie, be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",3.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Just ok as a thriller,Jennifer Lawrence is amazing as usual. The increasing fear as an expectant Mother is beluevable. The rest of the cast were reciting lines. This could have been much more frightening instead of just barely creepy. There's not much explanation as to why sudden strangers invade the peace of this couples homestead. Not sure why Aronofsky directed this heaping confusion. I intelligently these genres but was waiting for it to get better. Then it veers off anything believable the last third of the film. Then the strangers rip the house apart when she's in labor!!! W hat!?????,6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
waste of time,"I went to the movies recently with three other people with tickets we purchased at an attractively discounted price. Which movie? Upon reading reviews we settled on ""Mother"". Just a nudge beyond 2 hours long, and one of the greatest waste of 2 hours for a long time.What on earth is this about? I hated it, as did my fellow movie goers. And then, in that post movie discussion room - the men's' toilet - all were scoffing at what they had just watched. So, the next day, onto google I went and read the reviews again, and found a website that explained it all.So it's an allegory to certain events, set to a modern semi-horror movie. OK, great idea, but in my opinion, surely there are better ways to make allegories. Hopeless if the allegories are so tucked away that I have to research it online to make sense of it. OK, so now it does, and I look back at so many scenes and i find myself thinking, ""oh OK, so that's what that was about"". And I have found myself saying that so many times about so many scenes.But in the end, as a movie, it seemed so incredibly disjointed and devoid of understanding. To watch the movie as a standalone story it failed. Sure, make your allegories, but weave them into a movie so that the movie flows, is enjoyable, and you don't have to research to find out what the point of it is!! In my opinion, it failed miserably as a movie for the movie goer who simply wants to watch a movie to escape life for two or so hours. Forget it if you want watch a movie that has another take on good-beats-bad, love-conquers-all, or an exploration of human relationships in all their forms - failed, successful, homosexual, marriage, parenthood, etc, etc. in whatever movie genre - science fiction, romance, horror, crime etc.Reading the 'explanation', sure, it makes a bit more sense, but if one wasn't versed in the meaning before the movie, it was simply a bundle of scenes put together and you would come out thinking what everyone else did - what was that about? None of the reviews I read before watching it would reveal much about the plot out of respect of spoiling it for some people, so, out of respect, neither shall I. But, I will say, that had I read the plot and the explanation I would have been a lot less scathing of it. So in my opinion, read the plot. The movie will make a lot more sense when you watch it. I can't see how reading the plot and allegories beforehand can possibly spoil this abomination of a movie.The allegories were too camouflaged. If one has to resort to the web to work out what the hell I just watched, then the movie fails in my opinion. And just how many people will bother to go online to gain an understanding of what they just saw? As for the rave reviews, honestly I wonder if people get so blown away by movies just because they are off center and mystical and contorted in what they are trying to say. Production wise , and acting wise, I have no complaints there.For me, the only scenes worth watching were the shots of Jennifer Lawrence's adorable seemingly perpetual teenage good looks and the one frontal shot of her wearing a see-through nightshirt. Very tasteful and teasingly hinting at a lovely female form.Apart from that, I hated ""Mother"". I would never watch it again. Understanding it or not. My three other friends were just as scathing, as were the few people I had the pleasure of briefly discussing the movie with over a few moments of liberation post movie. In summary, the worst movie I've seen in years. And pardon some of the puns in my review. That might make a bit more sense after you've seen the movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

the best horror film in the last decade; a masterpiece!,"Just saw mother! at the Venice Film Festival and what an absolute pleasure it was to watch. What an absolute pleasure! I won't get too much into the plot as to avoid spoilers, and quite honestly the less you know about this film the better the viewing experience will be. This grandeur horror film stars Jennifer Lawrence, Javier Bardem, Kristen Wiig, Ed Harris, Michelle Pfeiffer, Domnhall Gleeson and Brian Gleeson. Star studded enough for you yet? The film (loosely) is about a young pregnant woman who lives with her poet husband in the countryside until unexpected guests start to invade her home. Sounds like your typical home invasion horror movie, right? Wrong. Darren Aronofsky has created something completely different here. Something absolutely amazing that provoked such a haunting reaction in me that I haven't felt since the first time I watched the star gate sequence in Stanley Kubrick's masterful '2001 A Space Odyssey.'And yes, I am comparing mother! to 2001 A Space Odyssey, because mother! is simply that masterful.The film is steeped in allegories and mystical symbolism and satires a variety of themes. The film itself starts off relatively calm until the visitors arrive and invade their home (I must be brief as it is vital not to spoil this film.) However, in its second and third act, the film derails into some of the most terrifying, disturbing and absolutely haunting piece of art ever put on film. It is most definitely the most controversial film since A Clockwork Orange, or perhaps Gaspar Noe's shocking rape revenge film 'Irreversible.' I have watched films all my life and never have I seen something in the last decade this truly scary.It is the type of horror that goes right through your skin, and your bones, and psychologically affects you. Combine that with beautiful art, breathtaking performances from Jennifer Lawrence and Michelle Pfeiffer in particular, and absolutely lunacy, you get this brilliant avante-garde piece of filmmaking, known as 'mother!.' mother! is truly the best horror film of the last decade without a doubt, whilst also being the craziest. mother! is sure to be a divisive movie, some may label it pretentious and some may label it as weird and disturbing for the sake of being weird and disturbing without having any contextual justification towards its haunting scenes of violence and gore. However, they could not be so far from the truth.mother!, simply put, is a masterpiece, and I honestly cannot think of a film in the last decade that has scared me and disturbed me as much as mother!. It is a must see movie.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A beautiful movie with too abstract plot,"First of all, even if you watch this movie you wont understand the true message or story line without listening to the interpretation from author. The movie is very good and has a very good message but the main problem is the director never reveals in the entire movie - what he wants to convey. Specially the publicity stunts with a trailor which makes it look a horror film, the audience are always looking for moments or horror.. while the director is pointing out some thing else.It is an example of how too abstract direction can cause loss of an amazing storyline.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Vidiot Reviews...,"Mother!Houseguests are the reason why God created hotels, motels and hostiles.Unfortunately, you would have to combine all 3 to accommodate the unwanted lodgers in this psychological horror.Mother (Jennifer Lawrence) awakens in a strange house where she searches for her husband, Him (Javier Bardem), a prominent poet paralyzed by writer's block. She eventually finds Him entertaining a man (Ed Harrris) and his family (Michelle Pfeiffer, Domhnall Gleeson), who have asked for accommodations.When Mother becomes pregnant, Him's creative juices begin to flow, but his new work attracts throngs of fervent fans who invade and ransack the couple's home.A curious allegory on Eden, writer/director Darren Aronofsky delivers a divisive take on Mother Earth and her creator that will test viewer's patience.

Intense emotions and a Biblical undertone,"I can understand that this movie is polarizing. Either is your cup of tea, or it is not. However, I do not appreciate some of the one-star reviews that do not make not even a little effort to recognize the achievements of this movie (others are legit).First of all, the emotional tension. The confusion. The contrasting exchange of visions from the characters. This is what I think the director had in mind. We are feeling the confusion that the mother is herself feeling. We are seeing everything from her POV and as she does not understand what is going on, but only guesses, so are we.In terms of interpretation, anyone familiar with the Bible will see the heavy allegorical elements and metaphorical events. I will not dwell into interpretations but I tend to agree with those mentioning the old testament and the house as a metaphor for our world (and mother -> mother nature).Sometimes plot is not all that you need. Sometimes you just need to enjoy the ride (ask David Linch). Some people like modern art museums, some people do not. It is all about filling our subjective gaps and feel the emotions that the artist is generally pointing us towards, sometimes subtly, sometimes aggressively. Our subjectiveness is meant to be part of it.Some people are more sympathetic (or responsive) to modern art (or trained in it) than other, which explains why art is often polarizing and niche. Totally get that and respect it. For me, it was definitely my cup of tea. Time will tell where this movie stands.p.s. whoever complains about the misogyny of a character, you are talking about a fictional character. The director is not misogynist, the movie its not. The character is. Because that is what the character portrays.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A technical accomplishment with Dunkirk-levels of ambition and scale,"I'M NOT HERE TO REVIEW THE STORY. I suspect conversations and debates surrounding the story of Mother! will be going on for a very long time so I won't add anything to these discussions as this is one of those abstract films that can be subjected to numerous interpretations and no two individuals will have the same reading of it. What I will talk about it are the technical achievements of the movie, which is so mind-blowing it alone is worth the price of admission.Purely on a technical level, Mother! was an impressive feat. Having not seen any of the trailers I was under the impression that this was going to be a small indie movie set in a single location (a house). And it certainly begins that way, lulling you with its slow-burn pace and the intimacy of its humble premise. But there is a joy in completely surrendering your expectations and preconceived notions of how good a movie is into the hands of a masterful filmmaker and just going along for the ride, trusting that the director knows exactly what he is doing. Because where the movie goes particularly in the 3rd act is absolutely insane, crazy, ambitious and filled with the kind of imagery that rivals some of the best set pieces of some of the biggest blockbusters we've seen this year. It redefines what we think about single-location movies - that a single location isn't bound by limited space and with great writing and smart tension-building you can craft an excellent big-budget set piece in a small place.The sound design and foley work in particular are top-notch. The cinematography is also excellent, with the camera deliberately closed-in on Jennifer Lawrence's face in every scene as the narrative unfolds from her POV, its movements increasingly more erratic as the suspense escalates. Geography of the house is well-established so you always know exactly where you are when things go crazy. As for Jennifer Lawrence herself, this is one of the most un-Jennifer-Lawrence-roles she has ever played. She's very grounded, understated and restrained throughout the film, making all the scenes where she demonstrates her Oscar-winning acting chops all the more shocking, impactful and affecting. This restraint is prevalent in almost every aspect of the film. It never reveals more than it should or overplays its hand unnecessarily. The storytelling and editing is tightly focused and disciplined, as not a single minute of film is wasted. Every plot thread introduced is paid-off. At every turn, the movie under-promises and over-delivers, every shift in tone (did I mention Mother! is also darkly funny?) and surprising revelation a desired and crescendoed effect.There's a lot of talks and conversations being devoted towards the layers of meaning and symbolism embedded within the story of Mother!. Is the movie an allegory for the bible, environmentalism, the creative process and its pitfalls or Hollywood celebrity/ fame- worship? Or is it an honest but painful artistic depiction of Darren Aronofsky's own personal love-life? Regardless of your interpretation, there will be one universal reaction - WTF did I just watch? Half of us will defend, champion and marvel at the viciously thought-provoking choices of the film (myself included), while the other half will hate the movie and declare it a piece of trash and a waste of time. I won't begrudge the latter for arriving at that conclusion, because it's not for everyone. But for those who want to experience a film that's unlike anything you've ever seen and executes its bold, daring and uncompromising vision with such amazing production values, then you at least owe it to yourself to give this movie a chance and decide if you'll hate it or love it. Because this is going to be the most talked-about movie of the year and it deserves to have you be a part of that conversation.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
poorly scripted,"I see one of the reviewers has commented saying its a brilliant movie, I absolutely differ since its lacks the basic cognitive experience, all the sequences are random and not tied well, for a bit i feel the director just changed the script but tried to copy ""Devil's advocate"" and failed miserably. There was nothing brilliant about it, it was just some random thought which was disturbing enough and made a movie out of it. It was dull slow, and just because it was off beat and a little different does not make a movie brilliant. It was pathetic! Just because you step out of usual movie making does not make a good movie, i would rather say the director/producer who made this movie were dumb. And really disappointed by the Jennifer Lawrence for picking a movie like this. I would say any random person can make a movie like this.

I mean why it has to begin again with a new wife, and why is that jewel restored again from the old wife! in fact I like the surprises in the movie but the end was a big fail, it feels like they didn't had much time to produce a perfect end so they did it like lets ""lets do t again""

It was refreshing to see something actually original in theaters for once. Mother felt like being in a dream, or a nightmare, afterward you wake up and think you understand why you had the dream, but it was a mix of so many thoughts and emotions you've had that inspired it, that it's hard to tell exactly. Mother was an experience and more like actual art instead of a Hollywood sellout movie. It was stimulating, dark, stressful, and you even laugh a couple of times, not to mention fantastic acting.

Surrealist chiller thaws,"An American mystery thriller; A story about a couple's relationship is tested when uninvited guests arrive at their home and events begin to spiral out of control. This is a phantasmagorical horror parable about a self-centred writer and his young homemaker housewife, who live in seclusion in the countryside. The film succeeds for an hour as a filmic explication of anxiety and dismay, building good tension and atmosphere. There is a human centre, which sadly vanishes when further layers are added: abuse, black comedy, and surrealism. In the end, it is either perceived as unwieldy and obtusely indulgent (as I found it) or enjoyable for its sheer violation of usual conventions. There isn't an onscreen chemistry between Jarvier Bardem and Jennifer Lawrence; they are not believable as a couple. Lawrence, as the shrinking violet, does not bring enough agency to motivate. All in all, a thought-provoking and original story about mysogynystic violence, but the screenwriter should have left out the black humour.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One of the worst films ever made.,"I don't know how Darren Aronofsky, a man of such incredible talent, could deliver such an appalling movie. He proved with Requiem for a Dream, The Wrestler, and Black Swan to be one of the finest directors around so I don't know what happened here.Without spoiling too much this movie is essentially just a bunch of irrelevant metaphors sloppily put together with no rhyme and reason. Oh Ed Harris is missing a rip it seems in that one scene? Just like with Adam and Eve! Oh what's that a brother kills his older brother? Its Kane and Abel! Oh what's that? A father sacrifices his son to a rabid group of people who tear him apart? Its like the story of Jesus's sacrifice! And what's interesting to note is that none of these stupid visual metaphors/analogies actually make any coherent sense in regards to the actual ""story"" being told (yes the word story in this film needs to have """" because its just barely qualifies as a story) They are just thrown in their because Darren Aronofsky is pretentious and thinks it makes him look smart. It doesn't. Anyone can do that. Its not impressive.Throughout this mess of a film there are also some sloppy metaphors about mother earth (which Jennifer Lawrence is supposed to represent, but wait I thought she was supposed to be the virgin marry? Oh fuck it) But again in terms of the actual story being told nothing of importance is ever said.The acting is fairly decent all around. Nothing great by any means. But not bad either. Both leads are competent but they really don't have a lot to work with given the shallow screenplay.This movie is also unbearably loud and annoying at times. There are several angry mob scenes that give me a combination of epilepsy and a migraine.

The day director Aronofsky made a short film into a 2 hour artsy feature...,"This film is so out of its own genre. Don't get me wrong - this is not a bad film! It is captivating, interesting and performance of both the Talent and the movie director and the effects team is not bad at all.What I absolutely loathe about it, is how in love the director is with this whole concept that it ends up as self-indulgence and artsy fartsiness. Aronofsky completely loses himself over an idea and forgets to tell a story.It's not that a film needs to have a certain storyline or points or profound happy endings and all that. It's just a matter of a movie being worthwhile. Our time is our most valuable asset in this world. And this movie just isn't worth the time.
This film is a pointless charade. A tour de force of how a good craftsman can completely decide against giving the audience anything than a glimpse of an idea.. YES this film has a message to you and it is BIG but it is in essence also completely pointless as a film. Keep those 121 minutes of your life and spend them on something worthwhile... I would say the message of this film would be worthy of a 6 minutes short film or the Breaking News banner of CNN. Not a bad message, and not unimportant either.

Some reviews said it's G*d, I had the same impression but I found it silly, Didn't know that the poem represent the bible, And the diamond represent the apple of Adam.I understand why people are annoyed with this movie but Humanity needs to be reminded again with what happens to their mother nature.

A timely film tackling one of the most important issues the mankind has ever faced,"I feel obliged to write in defense of Mother, Aronofsky's misunderstood minor masterpiece; three days after watching it, I still feel emotional tremors and deep uneasiness the film had caused in me. What causes movie-going public to so readily disregard a film that gives us something unexpected? Are we so lazy and complacent nowadays, to the point where the constant barrage of blandness from the mainstream media now causes us to recoil from the material that requires a bit of thought and emotional engagement? Mark Kermode's ""diminished expectations"" phrase comes to mind. For those expecting cheap scares of most recent horrors, I sympathize, the trailers were clearly trying to market this as a horror in order to put bums on seats. Of course it could be viewed as a horror, but just as Polanski's horror films are never just that, Mother! too offers so much more. Kathryn Bigelow recently said that it would be a shame not to use this medium to bring important issues to the front. Aronofsky is doing the same.Rightly billed as the proper successor to An Inconvenient Truth, the movie has in it elements of Gaia, the theory invented by James Lovelock, the esteemed British scientist who warned us years ago that Earth, if pushed too far, will restore its natural balance by neutralizing the antagonizing agent, i.e. the human population. In fact, all of our negative traits are exposed in the third act: an insatiable appetite and propensity for violence and destruction, the hunger for the satisfaction of the ego, mindless celebrity and/or deity worship, an assumed right to claim ownership, readiness to bow to collective madness and, when given an opportunity, an utter disregard for others and the world we live in.Jennifer Lawrence was perfectly cast for her role; her impotence to avert the oncoming disaster by rationality alone, was almost unbearable to watch; her innocence, honesty, emotional investment and trust she had placed in her relationship is continuously trampled on; she could almost be seen as a metaphor for powerlessness of the scientific community's consensus on global warming in the face of climate change deniers - no amount of reason or counting on the willingness to do what is right is enough, the loudest ones usually prevail.Mother is a film for our times, it should be seen widely and I hope its magnificent heroine continues to contribute to its ticket sales, even if her fans might expect something a bit more ""mainstream"". It's not meant to be subtle, it wants to grab you by the shoulders, shake you and infuriate you. It perhaps wears its message on its shoulder a bit too strong, but that's not a criticism in my mind, it is a message that needs to be shouted out and this film certainly does just that.Bravo!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

It's badly written and directed...Darren Aronofsky.It's hard to believe this film could be considered art.To quote another review: 'Mother!' is the sad product of an artist's self-indulgence taken to its own grotesque extremes.

Drivel or a masterpiece?,"It's difficult to imagine more conflicting movie. Some consider it deep and brilliant, others find it a complete nonsense. My opinion is somewhere in the middle. I wouldn't say that I liked this movie, but it made me think over, look for the essence and meaning, and I will definitely remember it for a long time. If you just want to enjoy watching a movie, this movie is not for you. The director tried to create something quite unusual and great, mixing religion, politics, family life problems and other social problems into one thing. I'm not sure he coped with this task. Yes, it's apparently unusual but hardly great. The most interesting thing was to read the riddles of the director.

A Future Camp Classic,"""Mother!"" (why the exclamation point???) is an example of what happens when an artist's impulses are left unchecked. Lawrence's involvement is probably what made the studio execs leave him alone because they figured it might still make money. This film is just artistic hogwash. I've enjoyed all of Darren Aronofsky's films except for this thing. The last 30 minutes are so incoherent that it's not even offensive. It's just stupid. The only way to even get a bit of enjoyment from it is to view it as camp. The house's explosion near the end is what made realize that camp is exactly what this film is and will eventually become. It's a major, major misstep for Jennifer Lawrence and Aronofsky.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A work of art,"If you want to enjoy a wonderful religious allegory and a conceptual deconstruction of God and the whole religious apparatus give this movie a try. It is a masterpiece, a work of art to say the least. Its plethora of symbols, vivid imagery and powerful references taclking some of the most fundamental uncertainties of the modern man truly gives one an ambudance of goosebumps.Nevertheless, it is worth noting that this movie is not for everyone. You are either going to love it for its remarkable artistic value or despise it for its confusion, lack of cohesion and traditional movie narrative.I do believe that this movie breakes the boundaries between artistic genres and reshapes the picture of what we have in our head when someone says ""a movie"". Much like with paintings and good books, you won't always have the clear pointers toward what the author meant, and most of the time it is up to you to make your own conclusion. That is what this movie is all about and for that reason I have to congratulate Mr. Aronofsky for pushing the limits and defying tradition in the world of cinematography.To conclude with, even if this type of movie is not your cup of tea, you are surely going to enjoy Jennifer Lawrence's extraordinary acting skills, the only thing both sides of audience are (probably) going to agree on.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Appealing but elusive,"Right from the start this movie seemed to have a great mix of ingredients to make it a favorite. Intriguing plot, excellent acting, well rounded, interesting characters and powerful hooks right from the outset. All that prompted some very high expectations, especially after some poor decisions lead to some outlandish and funny (to me anyway) situations.But as it went on, the movie fell short on fulfilling those big expectations. Bit overall I liked this movie a lot and would see it again. The problem I'd say is it went in a different direction than I'd expected. The story becomes increasingly outrageous as it unfolds and eventually crosses into the surreal. It eventually reaches a point where I questioned if events were actual or the character's dream.All in all it keeps a steady pace and is well worth your time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Mother Of Intentions,"Try to imagine Darren Aronfski with all his talent, preparing Mother in silence working with great actors, re-polishing the script and without the weight of a huge budget. I'm sure Roman Polanski had pressure from the studio to make concessions here and there but look at Rosemary's Baby and tell me. What concessions? I heard Martin Donovan, the director of Apartment Zero, a few months ago, explaining why he hasn't made an American film in 20 years. It was an explanation I'll never forget. He didn't blame anyone or anything, there was no blame of any kind but a deep and I should say, humble reflection and the fruit of his reflection was expressed, beautifully, in his excitement as he prepares his next film. I remembered his words as I watched Mother! Try to imagine Darren Aronfski with all his talent, giving time for the baby to be totally form and ready to be born. Working with great, new, unknown actors, without pyrotechnics but just the truth within the symbols (if any) - I love Jennifer Lawrence and I would have loved to see her play this role at the time of Winter's Bone - regardless of her youth. I believe that small private dreams/nightmares should be told with a feeling of privacy. Think Roman Polanski himself played the meek tittle character in The Tenant and the journey in Mia Farrow's eyes throughout Rosemary's Baby, Colin Firth's invisibility in Apartment Zero. In Mother there is also a Luis Bunuel touch from The Exterminating Angel but in Bunuel we live the surreal mystery with all our five senses. In Mother, we keep questioning, at a distance. No matter how close you come with the camera. Jennifer Lawrence is lovely but she starts with fear in her eyes and she stays there throughout. Javier Bardem is a sloppy variation of John Cassavetes in Rosemary's Baby. Ed Harris, as usual, superb as the Sidney Blackmer of the situation and Michelle Pfeiffer, who provides the biggest and most welcome surprise in a character clearly based on Ruth Gordon's Minnie in the same Polanski masterpiece. For all of the above I felt, sitting through Mother! A long and irritating experience. Now, I'd like to set a complaint about this, who shall I call?",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Amazing,"Mother is the miracle of Aronofsky. This is not just a movie, it is a new version of bible. I am not sure even if Aronofsky knows what is his creation, but I dare to say, for first time in my life as a movie addict and cinema lover, I watched a movie which it was a meaning beyond the each second of it. It was not even single second in this movie, that be not contain a bigger meaning. I watched it five times so far and I will watch it again and again.

A travesty of epic proportions,"This film will undoubtedly go down in history as an exercise in both your patience and tolerance for pretentious, self-indulgent crap. This is exactly what I imagine a vanity project to look like, where a director writes a script as he is surrounded by Yes Men, all exalting his every word. ""You are a Genius"", they screamed, as they held the finished script up to the heavens, ""You are the greatest visionary cinema has ever seen!"". And Aronofsky saw that it was good.This is what I imagine was going through this egomaniacs mind as he wrote this abomination. This movie is the end result of not understanding your own creative output, not having a filter, not having an editor that will call you out on your B.S., and not having a crew that will smell a stinker as they were working on one.Not a single person stopped him and said, ""This isn't good, Darren. This is needlessly obtuse, grotesquely realized, and lacking any real semblance of narrative and true storytelling. Your allegories and metaphors were either blatantly heavy handed, or ambiguous, and your symbolism was obscure but added nothing of value to the overall film. It's not your best work, Darren. I think you should rethink this."" I would have been that crew member, especially if I cared about what I was attaching my name to. But this is Hollywood, where millionaire's tell me about social injustice while they drive their hundred thousand dollar cars to their gated communities, away from the people they swear they care about. I really can't expect much from professional liars, and this movie just proves that Hollywood is running rampant with a degenerate disease that is stiffing creativity, passion and craft, instead politicizing everything, virtue signaling, and attempting to inject social commentary where none is welcomed.Darren, I love your movies. I was there day one for Requiem and for Fountain, and I LOVED Black Swan with a passion usually reserved for Asian films. But this movie, this failure of Biblical proportions is not only the worst thing you have ever done, but it quite possibly the worst film I have seen all year. Humble yourself, man. You are a respected auteur in a field rife with paint-by-numbers movies, created by committee. Your films illicit feelings of great love for the craft, and create fans of cinema as a whole. But you have to reel yourself in, or hire people who will. You cannot surround yourself with people who will offer nothing but praise, much like the character Him in this movie. You are not God, you are not a god, you are just a man. And like any man, it takes a great failure to bring you down from flying too close to the sun. Learn from this, and never repeat this farce of a film. You, nor I, deserve any of this.FYI; I gave the movie 3 stars, because despite all else, the movie was breathtaking to look at.

"Terrible movie. Even after reading reviews/interviews with the director, it STILL MAKES NO SENSE","This movie, advertised as a horror movie...wasn't far off. This movie was horribly terrible! I was uncomfortable most of the movie as it had ZERO plot line, followed no path of a story, gave no reason for anything that was going on with the characters and explained nothing. If it weren't for the popcorn with butter I was snacking on, I would have had nothing good about this experience. So, I went online today to find some reviews or some explanations of what the heckfire this movie was about. Aaaannnnnd, it did not help at all. It was a story told by an ""artistic"" director's mind as if in the midst of a whiskey fueled cloud of incoherence. I felt like sitting thru this movie is like listening to a college friend try to explain our existence on earth after they'd been drinking Jagermeister all night.

Never seen more disappointed cinema goers,"This is a review I hope no one that was involved in the making of this film will see because I have nothing good to say about it, but that I hope many thinking of going to watch the movie will see, because the rating is very deceiving.In fact the only two reasons I can think of at this point for such a high rating are either fake / paid ratings, or a massive online prank.My expectations weren't that high, after seeing latest Jennifer's movies, but I didn't expect Mother to be so dreadfully bad either. I kept hoping that it would get better, that it would have substance or a clever twist. Unfortunately, it got even worse. And if we weren't too tired to leave, after a long day, we would have.I've recently seen The Square, which I didn't like that much either, but comparing it to Mother it was an artwork, it had substance and it had a story you could enjoy following, despite many scenes being quite uncomfortable to watch.Why am I bringing up The Square in this review? Because the worst part in The Square, the big flop in it (those who watched it know what I mean), has many in common with Mother's most shocking scene.

One of a Kind,"Darren Aronofsky's ""Mother!"" is not what one would expect for a typical horror movie. It transcends the genre, if even it could be considered horror. The film follows a couple who seem to have a perfect life with a house too big for the two of them to live in. Their lives were, the audience believes, completely mundane... until there was a knock at the door.
This first knock on the door is really what sets the whole movie in to motion. Jennifer Lawrence's character is disturbed that a complete stranger showed up to their house that is located in the middle of nowhere, while Javier Barderm's ""Him"" (that's literally his name, no names are given in this film) is elated that the stranger wants to talk about his poems that have garnered many fans. To say much more than the titular ""mother"" is quite upset at the uninvited houseguests that follow in the footsteps of the first visitor would take away from some of the best points of the film.
Be prepared to be totally bewildered after your first viewing. That's part of the charm. Keep your eyes peeled for religious allegories as well, which are subtle enough not to be too overt. It was fresh to see a filmmaker who has been in the public consciousness for a while take a risk in something that is made.

the strongest film I've ever seen,"This was the only movie I've ever watched where I had my mouth agape the whole time. Aronofsky did a really great job of making you feel uncomfortable the whole time. I squirmed in my seat during the whole final 25 minute downfall of the house.That being said, I thought it was well done. I loved the cinematography and how the whole thing was from Jennifer Lawrence's perspective. Aronofsky did an excellent job making you sympathize with her - feeling powerless throughout.

maddening and mesmerising in equal measure,"The poet has writers' block and his frustration permeates the house. His much younger wife is renovating their home and trying to accommodate her husband's moods. They live miles from anywhere, and yet an unexpected guest shows up. His boorish attempt to smoke in their home is the first of many provocations.That is about as much rational description of the narrative that you can apply to this film. The Young Wife senses a heartbeat pulsing in the walls of the house. Time jumps and jars. There is new life, and death. Murder even. Thematic elements are front and centre. What happens when selfless devotion encounters insatiable ego? When does the private self end and the public self start? Can the hordes be kept from the door (quite literal hordes, in this case).The performances are superb. The camera keeps the two leads in almost constant close up, allowing us glimpses past and beyond them that show chaos and horror. What does it all mean? I have no idea.

Aranofsky's torture porn movie about climate change (gimme a break),A pretentious piece of garbage masquerading as art. The work of a director who's gotten so full of himself he's become completely blind to his shortcomings. This is nothing more than torture porn.

Aronofsky's allegorical horror is his best film this century,"A poet and his seemingly mentally unstable wife live in isolation - him staringly seeking inspiration, her doing up a house which has seen better days - until they open the door to a stranger, and to a great deal else.Darren Aronofsky made a name for himself with his first feature, Pi, a moderately successful cult film, followed by a powerful if straightforward adaptation of Hubert J. Selby's Requiem for a Dream, before directing and mostly scripting a series of less impressive outings (The Wrestler and Black Swan being particularly overrated) ending in the dreadful Noah. Certain critics are still keen to keep praising him as a director of vision, but the ideas have just not been there.Until Mother! that is, a sporadically nerve-jangling, hardly-dare-watch home invasion drama (though an unusual one, it has to be said) that aims to be an allegory on the Human Condition, touching on themes of mental illness, the role of women, relationships and abuse, the pitfalls of celebrity and fame, mass psychology, the origin of religious cults and goodness knows what else. The basic plot bears some resemblance to the story of Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath had it been directed by Ken Russell, with Javier Bardem as a self-obsessed Hispanic Hughes and Jennifer Lawrence, through whose eyes we see events, as a kind of timid, interior-decorating Plath, as well as a possibly unhinged and unreliable narrator.It's an ambitious project and to an extent it works, making Aronofsky's best film to date, though the climactic violence takes a very unpleasant turn, and the viewer may be left wondering why there is no police involvement earlier on, as well as longing for a reasonable explanation of events.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

the most effective horror film i have ever seen.,"I remember when i first heard that darren aronofsky was coming out with this new project called ""mother!"" and thinking 'huh, this could be interesting'.

To put it in the simplest way i can; this is the only horror film that has made me feel truly helpless. Ive never seen a film that actually instilled a genuine sense of horror and dread before. Im not easy to shock either. I've easily stomached films like ""saló"" and ""antichrist"".Mother!

This is the worst film I've seen this decade,"Allow me to clarify that this is not the worst shot (except for the framing), written, or acted film of this decade; in fact, the production of this film was overall quite strong, and I think the payoff was anything but lackluster or disappointing. The film also isn't at fault for having a misleading trailer, though thankfully I tend to watch films before I see their respective promotions. However, the build-up for it was unnerving to sit through as an audience member, watching characters whose actions and ideals don't relate to me or anyone else. In that way, it was kind of like The Mist. I wanted to throw objects at the screen.The characters had no other purpose than to serve this film. That's it. Unlike any other film in history, they don't seem to be in a universe that mirrors ours or is a fantasy version of ours, or what have you. Even if Star Wars or A Bug's Life isn't real, at least they have established the existence of it within the film's construct. Whereas for mother!, if time did not exist before or after the events of this film, it wouldn't matter. Nothing would be lost or gained. There is no understanding of its construct. It simply 'is' and it doesn't seem like the characters have a clue that they aren't in something that resembles our world. I think this is where the biggest mistake is made. Somebody mentioned this would work well as a play, and I actually agree. Not as a movie, though.I went through my Blu-ray collection and I asked myself: ""What other films represent a universe that a set of characters don't accept, believe, or is not cognizant about its unbounded principles?"" I couldn't come up with any, because eventually they all seem to find their way in, or it just takes the characters time to get the audience to feel out that kind of universe. In that case, the films that I came up with were: The Adjustment Bureau, Stranger Than Fiction, and Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World. STF is really the only one that comes close, but the awareness factor still kicks in. Not to mention it's actually a good film.Let me put it to you this way: pick any musical out there, where characters just spontaneously burst into song and dance in unison and music somehow is playing as well. Let's pretend there was a film where this happens, and the onlookers who are not a part of the number start flipping out, wondering what is going on, try and intervene to stop them, etc. but the singing characters are completely unfazed by their attempts and just keep going... and after the song is over, they go on with their lives like that singing never happened (which is kind of how I imagine they ""really"" go). That's what this film felt like, only it plays out more like a Black Swan-esque psychological horror. This film just felt nightmarish: impressive feat, but in the wrong context of being a completely metaphorical film it became a very unappreciative watch. The characters become helpless in their want to bestow basic fundamentals of humanity upon each other, which as I understand this is a point of the film in itself, it just does not work well when presented as an allegory.Speaking of the context (thematic spoilers ahead), mother! is basically a re-telling of the Book of Genesis, where certain characters and items play parts of the book, and Jennifer Lawrence's character is mother nature itself. Yet again, the problem is the characters for the most part don't know that this is what they are, so when they expect things to pan out like it does in real life and it doesn't happen, they don't have a clue why and don't realize their world had no past, perhaps has no future, and really is just serving one greater purpose: to be a film. This is not what storytelling is about, no matter how clever Aronofsky was in pulling this together (mind you, it all came off as very pretentious). And this wouldn't be such a bad thing if the movie didn't upset you with literally every character, but it did and I could not look past any of it.By no means did this film fail to do anything that it intended (though people seeing the trailer and expecting a house invasion horror film will be very disappointed), but to green light this thing in the first place and give it a budget seems asinine. To quote Jeff Goldblum in Jurassic Park: ""They were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should."" This art house film brings the audience no enjoyment of their theatrical experience, no commentary regarding the fabrication of human nature and societal flaws, no deeper extrapolation of biblical events, and simply it does not make a purpose statement. This has been my least favorite movie-going experience of the decade, even though that is not at fault of the director's execution.",2.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Uncomfortable to watch and you'll wish it's over but that's the point!,"This movie is definitely uncomfortable to watch and you'll be checking the time to see how much longer you have to endure it for. However it is the single view of it's writers so if you view it as such, it is a well made film, well acted and well shot.

The end was perhaps even more horrible than the movie itself because it did not show any escape from that hell. 
So if i should say my opinion - very moving, shaking the spirit but not in a positive sense, and not helpful because from the mothers view point, one would expect much happier ending. Hopefully there would be a continuation of some sort which would allow to create a different, more positive final reality for her somewhere else, and with someone else. Spirit needs hope.

It's masterpiece once you connect all pieces,"First rule of going to see Darren Aronofsky (Pi, Requiem for a Dream, The Fountain, Black Swan) movie is to be open minded and not to freak out when he starts to throw out stuff that in first might not make sense but you need to let the feeling take over you. Loving couple gets their paradise interrupted upon arrival of strange visitor and it just picks up from there to things that you can't imagine that Aronofsky saw. In moment that movie ends and you are leaving theater there are voices of people talking - What did I just see -, -What just happened-, -This is one of the worst movies I saw-, -I don't get it- and just then you find couple people fighting with themselves trying to figure out bigger picture of it and frankly told you need to spend some time putting peaces together because it ain't easy at first. In moment you realize how magnificent and full of lively metaphors movie is you are mind blown with how little director/writer of movie can do. Darren Aronofsky made a huge venture in trying to transform bigger picture to movie screen which seems impossible until you see and realize it. His great and masterful directing skills are all over the movie and there is only place to enjoy it at it's best without losing a sight of his vision. Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem gave a pretty tight and so nice to watch performances filled with constant emotions of all kind. Appearance of Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer was also quite noticeable because of their class and acting skills that will never disappoint you. Only thing that might get you angry is complexity that movie presents and puts on you to figure out but you can't be thrown off because of that.

"""An exhilarating ride of biblical proportions.""","mother! is written & directed by Darren Aronofsky and stars Jennifer Lawrence, Javier Bardem, Ed Harris, Michelle Pfeiffer, Brian Gleeson and Domnhall Gleeson.A couple's relationship is tested when uninvited guests arrive at their home, disrupting their tranquil existence. (18 cert; 121 mins)As I'm writing this, it has been a few days since I experienced Darren Aronofsky's psychological experiment; mother!, yet the thought of this incredible film remains. I'm still working out the various allegories in my mind during day-to-day life, the impact of mother! is still felt.mother! has received a lot of backlash from audiences since its release and I can understand why. It's a tough watch, in fact the first two acts are slow-burn, which means the average movie-goer will lose concentration. Don't let the negative reviews and underwhelming box office numbers put you off, though. this is a thought-provoking film and a very ambitious and brave move by Aronofsky. It isn't an invasion horror like the trailers lead you to believe, and perhaps that's where most of the backlash comes from. This is one of those films that will try to disorientate you, but after some research, it becomes a work of genius. Within its disturbing final act is a clear message.Jennifer Lawrence seems to be getting some heat for her acting style. According to the majority, she never changes the way she acts in all of her projects. Now, I could agree for some of her films, but in mother! she is literally put through hell. I can imagine it was difficult to bring these scenes to life, especially those in the final act, but she performs remarkably well and consistently throughout. I felt like I was experiencing everything right there with her. Javier Bardem plays a rather mysterious character, who disappears every now and then but reappears in the strangest way. It's hard to put into words how this film makes you feel when watching, but I'd stick to what I mentioned earlier about being disorientated. Javier has a hand in this feeling, and I think he brought a lot to the role. Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer are simply brilliant. Again, bringing a sense of suspicion that constantly gets weirder and weirder as the story plays out. The Gleeson brothers have fairly small roles but play quite an important part in the grand scheme of things. This is something to read further into after having seen the film. What I can say, though, is that they were a fine support act.Moving on to the visual side of things; the house set looks stunning. We see it as it's being decorated and furnished by Lawrence's character, so there's a lot of details documenting this process. Part of why the house looks and feels so real is because mother! was shot on Super 16mm film. A format I will always highly praise for its extremely natural capturing of light and the grittiness that kisses the screen in the upscale. Utilising close-up, over-the- shoulder and point-of-view shots, Matthew Libatique puts us right into the story. They even went as far as to build the set so that the camera could move freely in a 360 degree fashion. We see everything as mother does, and that's something I really appreciated. Finally, the visual and special effects, though minuscule, were bitingly real. I can't, and won't, go into the specifics, but there are some scenes that felt too real. but not in the bad way. It wouldn't have impacted me the same way if they were handled differently.This is usually where I'd mention the composers work on a film. But, seeing as there's no score for mother!, I'll talk about the sound. Composer Jóhann Jóhannsson spent about a year writing original music for this film, but after test screenings, both he and Aronofsky decided against using the score. Jóhannson wasn't entirely out of the job, however. With his music being very ambient, he ended up working as a sound consultant alongside Craig Henighan to create the 'sound' of the house. There's the expected knocks and creaks, but it's when mother starts to break down that we hear sounds (such as glass) stretch out further than they realistically could. I found this really quite unnerving; a unique and interesting way to tackle sound design. That said, I would love to hear some of what Jóhannsson wrote originally, maybe a cut of the film with the score? Either way, mother! worked very well with its absence of score, I liked that as a viewer I didn't have something telling me how to feel. It all felt very raw.There's really not much else to say. I've not experienced much else like it, apart from Denis Villenueve's Enemy back in 2013. Many people will say that if a film makes you search up the meaning afterwards, it's a failure. I respectfully disagree. I like to go deeper into the story, and I find it fascinating reading other people's theories and impressions. Think back to Donnie Darko, that still sparks conversation even after 16 years.I think everyone should give mother! a go. Form your own opinions. It will always be divisive. People who love it will love it. People who hate it will hate it. This is the beauty of filmmaking. I'm in no way religious, but I found the concept simply brilliant and the execution, though disturbing, fantastic.Verdict; A dark, disturbing psychological thriller that thrives in a mysterious tension. mother! is an exhilarating ride of biblical proportions.mother! – ★★★★★ (9/10)",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Not for the lemmings,"That has to be one of the most intense cinema experiences I've ever had. People are either giving this one star or ten and that's a testament to it's impact.So many people are hating this film online but let's honest, the concepts and subject matter it deals with are way to confronting for the average person. The average person does not like being confronted, they don't like having to create their own understanding of the world and thus they search for answers in other forms. They search for the answers from people who have already made the answers up for them. This film delves into all the subject matter we see in our news, religion and day to day life in an exaggerated way and it's not for the 95% of humanity who brought their movie ticket for a regular night at the movies.I was constantly engaged during this film and as the film unraveled the concepts and subject matter became more extreme but also more and more clarified. I really liked this movie and while I was shocked, as an artist I was beyond happy to engage. I know a lot of viewers will write it off as over the top nonsense but I felt it spoke volumes about our history and our future.I suggest you don't go see it, it's not for you most likely lol 😜🖤👌🏻",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

What in the Jennifer Lawrence's wig did i just watch?,"This has to be one of the most disgusting, disturbing and vile movies i have ever seen. No wonder the director kept the content of the movie quiet, and made the trailer look like this movie was a psychological thriller. If people knew what the movie contained, no one would see it.Even in the world of cinema there is a line that should't be crossed, and Aronofsky really crossed the line with this sick movie. There are a few scenes in this movie that are done just for shock value, just for the sake of shock. I wish i could unsee the horrific images that i had to endure while watching this movie.Obviously the movie's budget was used on CGI, because they couldn't even afford a decent looking wig for Jennifer. And all the pretentious BS about how mother nature is sooooo down to earth that she walks about the house with no bra on.Aranofsky's sick agenda is very clear when watching this movie.

A new experience - Psychological horror master piece,"I watched the trailer yesterday, after that bought some tickets for me and my girlfriend. We both were with the mindset that it was gonna be a generic horror movie, something better actually, like Babadook.At the beginning there was not really a connection between me and the woman, but as the movie plays you will enter her mindset, it's crazy how you connect with her, and that's why it works so well as a psychological terror.The director grabbed all the human phobias and values and used them as a way to ""torture"" the audience, it's a wild ride, nothing like i have ever experienced, and this is the first movie in years that i actually feel the need to write a review in here.It's a weird movie where you can get your own conclusions (maybe that's the reason why a lot of reviews here are negative) and besides that, it's just living hell, it's like you payed to watch a movie for fun and come out with anxiety and paranoia, very few or no movies can do that to you.Both my girlfriend and other people left the cinema, not because the movie was bad, but because it drains you, The first part is uncomfortable, the second part is ""happy"" but at the same time is scary because you know there's still a lot of time for something bad to happen, the third part... its living hell, it drains the spectator, you just want that confusion to stop but it actually gets worse progressively, just frenetic, when you think you already reached the end of the horror hallway the movie opens way for a new one way worse than the previous, the visuals get pretty disturbing, both in a visual and psychological way, i was like ""Now way that can happen, it would be to bad to put that in a movie.."" and later that actually happens. I got out of the cinema blown away. THIS IS NOT A MOVIE FOR SENSITIVE PEOPLE !!! if you have anxiety or cant control your feelings don't watch this, it's too much.Resuming: it's a weird vibe horror movie (if i can call it horror..)It's amazing, people hated it because they saw politicalstatements from the director there.

An extraordinary movie,"This is a phenomenal film, full of details, full of symbolism and references to the Bible, to man's relationship to the mother Earth, to the state of consciousness in which we find ourselves as humanity. The atmosphere is superb and the actors are exceptional. I think this is my favorite Darren Aronofsky's movie. And I'm a bit sad because people in their reviews give it worst grade just because the movie does not have ""enough action"", just because is slow or not fun enough, just because the super heroes in it doesn't shoot and fly in the air and perform all kinds of spectacular things.
I think, there is internet, there is IMDB and before you go to see a movie (especially if it is a an intellectually demanding like this one) read about it and see, decide if you are interested in such a thing. If it is not for you, there will always be something else to your liking out there

Your Personal Rorschach Test,"This is where all art is today. To make art today, you assemble the most disgusting elements you can dig up, mash them together and proudly display in all pretension for delusional art critics to fawn over.Here we have an odd collaboration of the lead actress and her current boyfriend as the director which gives us wonderful shots such as close-ups of her nose and the back of her head. From time to time she breaks from her default mode of being the new Great Stone Face to come up with contextually improper muggings for the camera.The 'art' here is twofold. First, to see if you can endure the boredom and second if you can stomach the non-boring parts. Maybe the idea was to show the world that if it's not bored, it's revolted. There is no middle ground.

Definitely an experience,"Having not been a huge Aronofsky fan in the past, I went into 'Mother!' with a completely open mind having not heard or read any reviews about it. I loved the creepy scenes with Bardem/Harris/Pfeiffer and I thought Jennifer Lawrence was amazing throughout. In all honesty, some of the scenes were very difficult to watch, but I imagine this is what was intended by the director and all I can say is that I went through many emotions whilst watching this film. Whether it is good or bad? I really, really loved the first half. The second half was very interesting to watch, but maybe not a pleasant viewing experience. But how many films nowadays can we honestly say is an 'experience' to watch? Not many.

A challenging movie that asks but doesn't answer,"As you've probably seen, this movie divided everyone. Much like every piece of art, it asks something of you, it shows you things you may not want to see and then asks you for meaning. Meaning in movies is almost always taken for granted. A movie is a narrative and just tells a story. With mother! this is not the case. There is a narrative but in a very Aronofsky style, allegories and metaphors are plenty. Whether you like them or not, Whether you get them or not depends very much on you, you as a person, your beliefs, your experiences. Like every piece of art it will always mean something different for everyone. Some people like some art, others don't, it's natural. I can only speak of my own experience, and my own meaning. It's definitely a movie that will be talked about for years to come, for some it will bring exasperation and disdain, for others it will bring acclaim, for others it will bring confusion. And that is the purpose of art. To be talked about, to be analyzed, to be remembered, for the right and the wrong reasons, by people who liked it and hated it. It succeeds in being art, but art is not for everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Mother! is not a film, it's a consciousness shift.","Mother! is probably one of the most powerful consciousness expanding films ever made.

Wife as Artistic Catalyst,"I didn't see the religious allegory, though it makes perfect sense and obviously was intended by the writer/director. I saw another, more concrete allegory, related to the fact that the woman was married to a self-involved poet.An acting teacher--I forget who--once passed along a theory that artists draw from a bottomless well of narcissistic poison and, through talent and craft, transform it magically into art. I think this film starts with that position and further suggests that the artist uses the love of his spouse or lovers as creative nourishment, even as he lives for the love of his audience.One thing it brought to mind is that the spouses of artists who stay with them a long time tend to be pretty tough cookies.Anyway, I found it tough sledding, even as an absurdist allegory. You can decide for yourself if it was sufficiently entertaining. I gather that, for many, it was not, but I'm giving it a 10 because the religious whackos have piled in to trash it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Unique, absurd, disturbing, and extremely well made.","The reason why this film has an F grade on Cinema Score is because this film is impossible to market. There is no feasible way to convey what this film actually is in a 30 second trailer. The trailer makes out that the film is some kind of horror film, which is absolutely not the case. There are horror elements, sure, but it is not a horror film. So this leads me to believe that the reason it has received such polarising responses is because a large percentage of the people going to see it are expecting ""Jennifer Lawrence in a horror film"", and those people will have been sorely disappointed. Everyone sitting near me at the cinema was remarking how bad the film was, and how much of a waste of time it was, and to be honest I don't blame them. If you go into it as a casual movie-goer, and you see a mainstream actress like Jennifer Lawrence is in a horror movie, that alone may be enough to convince you to go and see it. Hence the F grade on Cinema Score, and the extremely divisive response to the film.As for the film itself, I had my theories during the film but I found afterwards that there is a single metaphor that the film conveys. There are however multiple ways of interpreting a lot of it, and there is no single ""right answer"", which is something I appreciated. Any of you considering seeing it, I do urge you NOT to research what the film was intended to be about beforehand as it serves to make the film much more interesting on reflection.The performances were top-tier, as expected, the cinematography and the set design, which isn't something I usually pick up on, was incredible. The whole film takes place in this one (large) house, so you get to know the house pretty well by the end.As far as criticism goes, the pacing is weird. On reflection this is necessary for what Aronofsky wanted to do, but while you are watching the film you will likely be WTFing multiple times. Although there is a general sense of unease and threat throughout the entire film, there are some scenes which are very slow and borderline boring, and entire segments of the film are very slow to build. By the time it reaches the last 30 minutes, the film has become literal insanity, with absurd and extreme things happening too fast to keep track of.Another thing to mention is that some of the content in the last 30 minutes is disturbing and arguably excessive. I was fine, but my girlfriend was unable to watch the end of the film.Overall, it gets a solid 7/10 from me. Unique, absurd, disturbing, and extremely well made.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Mother issues,"A couple with a substantial, acknowledged age difference live a quiet life in a nice house in the middle of a field, surrounded by forest. She(Lawrence, giving her usual solid performance. So much of it, here, is anxiety, especially communicated through her eyes, and it's great. A lot of people who hate this, disagree on the quality, and I can see how that would make you despise it, given how much of this is her reacting. She's loving, and accepts a huge amount of micro-aggressions, constantly undermining her will and wishes) has renovated it. He(Bardem, going expertly between sinister and charming. He's a poet, who desires praise from fans) is dealing with writer's block, which fills the air. That tension is greatly increased once people start showing up uninvited, and their rudeness gradually rises to the unbearable. You won't believe what happens next. No, really. That's not exaggeration. Unless someone gives you a detailed rundown of the events of this, it will constantly surprise you. Don't let them. Go into this with as little info as possible.The hand-held camera is in fact not shaky, and yes, there is still great cinematography. The people who claim otherwise haven't watched Polanski. And you know what? Aronofsky hasn't yet mastered that style. I hope he does in the future. The pacing definitely isn't as tight, though he clearly put effort into that. Yes, there are a lot of close shots, uh-huh, a lot of them are of Lawrence, and, yup, her body is treated like a gun is by John Woo. I wonder if that was decided upon before the director and start began dating. If you've watched 2 or 3 of his pictures, you should know if you are or aren't into his stuff. If you don't like artsy, this isn't for you. He woke up one morning, and this poured out of him. You can tell. This is a divisive film. The second half is, indeed, completely insane. Some will hate it. I, like others, loved it. And long before that, dream logic and surrealism run the show: if that bothers you, stay away, rather than complaining that the movie isn't realistic. Don't buy chocolate ice cream and get upset it isn't vanilla. The trailer told you as much. There's a ton of allegory... it's as if Darren woke up manic one day, thumbed through the Bible and underlined every single passage he thought would be compelling to put in this. Then you have a lot of events that are very current. This mix is... interesting. Many call it a failure. It could have been. In lesser hands, it would be.There is a lot of disturbing content, a moderate amount of frequently brutal violence, and a little swearing in this.

Psychological thriller where the audience is the antagonist at times,"I would not recommend this movie as a general movie to watch, as I do with Black Swan. That doesn't mean that it's a bad movie: I mean that, to say that it's not for everyone is an immense understatement. There is symbolism that isn't immediately apparent, but most of it is. There is also a lot of action and dialogue with which to distract you. It does all tie together, but not before inflicting visual and audio trauma. I think that, to get the message across, the extent to which it is disturbing is appropriate. It will appeal to your visceral senses more so than it does rationality, and if your preferred genre is anything other than dark and twisted with elements of insanity, I'd say skip this one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I ended up loving it...,"Took me 1 year to finish this movie. The first time, I lost interest from the first 10 mins and fell asleep.

This time from the 10 minute mark and fell asleep around the 30 min mark. Another 2 months later I caught it on hulu. Watched from the beginning and made it to the 30 min mark again. About a month or two later I put it on to intentionally fall asleep and it worked. 10 mins tops I'm out like a moth on a lamp. Today marks my approximate year since I first started watching it.

I don't believe it was exciting but if it were to have enlightened the purpose at the 10 minute mark, I would have made it through the first time. Excellent movie. I did finally come to love it. I don't like how he says ""it starts as a home invasion because everyone has a home"". Nope, not here, not anymore. Plus, everyone does not have a home, generally speaking.

"One of the strangest, most bizarre, confronting, and surreal experiences I have ever had to sit through","Mother! is a psychological horror film starring Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem. Written and directed by Darren Aronofsky (Requiem for a Dream, Black Swan), it is one of the strangest, most bizarre, confronting, and surreal experiences I have ever had to sit through while watching a movie.In a country home, a well-known poet with writer's block (Javier Bardem) and his wife (Jennifer Lawrence) live their lives in peace and quiet. One day, a mysterious couple (Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer) turn up at their door to take refuge in the home and a series of strange events begin to occur.While undoubtedly thought-provoking, Mother! is equally as sensationalistic and divisive in the way it handles its themes and symbolism. This is definitely not a film for mainstream audiences and seems to be intended for those who enjoy the surreal work of filmmakers David Lynch and Lars von Trier. Jennifer Lawrence does a fine job conveying her confusion as to what is happening around her, almost as though she is channeling the film's audience itself.

If you want something superficial where you don't have to get your mind working, that's not the movie for you. I really got surprised by all the negative reviews. That is a great work that is laden with symbolism and embodiment. It shows how humans have spoiled the planet with their contradicting beliefs, religions, ideas and concepts and competition to satisfy their creator. There is an embodiment of Adam and Eve and their sons and how one of the sons killed his brother and became marked with that shameful crime. The house is the Earth and the Mother is trying to save that house from all the madness. The great thing is that you don't figure out all the symbolism right from the start. There is this catchy series of unexplained events throughout the story-line and the viewer wonders what the hell is going on ! Why does the husband (the artist) care about those uninvited guests who cause all the chaos and madness ?

Can you care for the metaphors? Sort of.. For the most part,"Hmm. This is a difficult one to talk about. I really understand why it's so divisive among people. I saw this in the cinema and at a point a person sitting two rows behind loudly said: ""This is the stupidest movie I've seen"". I have to agree that it's a strange movie but could it make me care for what was going on? Yeah, kind of actually.. For the most part. I enjoyed some things about it, but that's mainly whenever it goes in a more minimalist and subtle direction. The brutality/chaos is affecting to a point, but you can only go so far before the disturbing elements go on your nerves and you get lost. I'm standing in the middle with this movie. I cannot rate this in a proper way. Not yet at least. Everything about the story is a metaphor. That's clear as day and that's also what can make the movie a little difficult to get through. When you have characters who are merely supposed to be representations of a metaphor it's easy for it to turn out very hollow. But, the actors give a huge effort in making their characters seem as alive as possible which is what helps carry your interest. They do appear as real and emotional people. It's just sometimes annoying when the metaphor becomes so clear that it makes them out to be vessels and not actual people to care for.The first half of the movie is atmospheric with tension filled chunks sprinkled throughout. There's a somewhat grounded feel to it, so it's for sure the part of the movie that most audience members will like because it's easy to follow. The second half goes of the rails into an extreme, savage and fierce zone. I enjoyed the quietness at the beginning, but it got carried away quickly. Yet, I could still care for the lives of our metaphorical characters. I can't help but to feel bad for them when you understand the frustration that's going on. At a point you really want to chase these annoying intruders away. That element of intrusion and overstepping boundaries came across in a great way. The extreme brutality in the later half got so beat into my head that I began to check out. It was just metaphor after metaphor. I understood what it wanted to say, but it was to such an extreme that it got distracting and took me out of the immersion. If it hadn't been so overly clear as to what it was representing I would have had a more interesting experience. Because when you know that this character is just supposed to be this, then the impact isn't felt the same way. I'm sorry, but that's what held the movie back for me. It's essentially a re-telling of a certain thing which I'm not gonna give away if you haven't seen it. And if/when you understand what it's re-telling then everything becomes all the more predictable.So, what made it work? Many things that happened still came across as extremely frustrating in the right way. I found it easy to side with Jennifer Lawrence' character yet it didn't judge all the wrong decisions Javier Bardem's character made. You get that all he wants is to do good, but he has trouble knowing when enough is enough. Lawrence wants to live in peace in the house without annoying people overstaying their welcome. The motivation was understandable on both sides, so that was good. It's possible to throw the metaphorical thing out the door and follow the narrative that you see on screen. It can sort of work, but then again it gets so obvious at the end. I felt both annoyed and emotionally devastated when the film ended. I liked it and not liked it at the same time. So, it's a weird reaction. Should you see it? Sure. I know it will make you feel something. Whether it's confusion, happiness, sadness or anger - It's all understandable. There's no wrong opinion.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Not worth it,I don't usually give a review. I love the cast but the movie itself was really bad. It was confusing and painful to watch. We couldn't wait until it was over.

Mother! is a masterpiece and is absolutely terrifying.,"Mother! is directed by Darren Aronofsky and has a huge varying cast.

"Like all of Aronofsky's movies, the film is completely bizarre and unpleasant to sit through!","'MOTHER!': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The new psychological horror flick from writer/director Darren Aronofsky, and starring Jennifer Lawrence (the two are now a couple as well). The story revolves around a woman who's quaint life, living with her poet husband in a quiet country home, is severely disrupted when a mysterious couple shows up wanting to stay at their house. The movie costars Javier Bardem, Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer. It's gotten polarized reviews from critics and moviegoers alike, and it disappointed at the Box Office as well. I found it to be really weird, creepy and hard to watch, but at the same time it's also extremely interesting and quite memorable.The story begins with a woman, called Mother (Lawrence), materializing in a bed and waking up from her sleep. She begins searching her quiet country house, for her husband, Him (Bardem). Him is a poet with writer's block, and his creative struggles have caused distress among their once happy home. Then two strangers unexpectedly show up (Harris and Pfeiffer). Him welcomes them into their house without questions, while Mother fears what damage the mysterious couple could possibly do. Things become even more complicated, and distressful for Mother, from there.Like all of Aronofsky's movies, the film is completely bizarre and unpleasant to sit through. Also like his films 'NOAH' and 'THE FOUNTAIN', this movie is another biblical analogy about creation, life and God. As dark and weird as it all is, the film does have some very insightful things to say about people's belief in Jesus Christ, and the Christian Lord. I think the movie is very effective in this way. I can definitely see why so many viewers have hated the film so far (it's gotten an F rating from theatergoers), but I think the right audience should definitely still enjoy it. Lawrence gives another amazing performance in the movie, and the story will leave you thinking about things in it for days (weeks, months and perhaps years). It's another unique 'near masterpiece' from Darren Aronofsky (in my opinion).Watch an episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/oV2G3RUT234",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

mother!,"'mother!' is the darkest film Aronofsky has ever released. I went to see this film with hardly a clue of what it was about. What I watched unfold in front of me was beyond anything I have ever seen on film.The acting is fantastic, particularly Michelle Pfieffer as the Woman, and Jennifer Lawrence who gives what I believe to be her bravest performance to date as Mother. Keep in mind that the film is an allegory, so expect a hefty amount of symbolism throughout. I don't want to give anything away, but just know that the climax for this film is completely insane.You will either appreciate this film for what it is, or you'll find it pretentious.

Metaphorically beautiful!!,"MOTHER- 87%
Mother could be classified as a movie which has the most uncomfortable watching experience ,as well as, the most breathtaking one. 
The allegory in this movie is a beautiful work of ART. However, It does need a lot of time to grasp the idea and enlighten the metaphors. I personally thought Jennifer Lawrence did a good Job playing the ideal biblical woman, but was hoping for more rage when she became angry. The story could have been the ""best movie of the year"", if Darren Aronofsky(the director) briefly explained to the audience what actually happened because many people would not understand anything about ""Mother"" after finishing the movie. That is why I think only 50% of audience reviewers liked it. 
This movie is definitely one you should think long and hard about.

"""I'll just get started on the apocalypse!""","I've had a keen interest on Aronofsky's work since ""Pi"", and this is one of those movies where his obsessive biblical/occult interests resurface again. The movie left me baffled since it made me admire the metaphors on the one end, yet the overly explicit nature of those metaphors ruins most of the fun. The acting is quite dull (except for Michelle Pfeiffer), and most of the visual effects are simply meager for a movie of this caliber. Still, the movie manages to make you think once it's finished.And do I really buy environmentalist interpretation? I don't think so :)",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A metaphorical gut punch,"Based on Darren Aronofsky's previous work, I was already anticipating that Mother! would take some hair-pin bends around my suspension of disbelief, but I wasn't expecting it to leave the road entirely, flip 30 times into a ravine and explode. This is a roller-coaster track through a director's ideological stream of consciousness and you're either in for the ride, or out.Jennifer Lawrence (unnamed, as are all the characters in the film) plays a dreamy, docile housewife to an acclaimed poetic genius, Javier Bardem, suffering from writer's block. The two inhabit a palatial southern Gothic home in the middle of nowhere, half under re-construction after a previously mentioned fire destroyed it. Interrupting their placid existence arrive two strangers, a man and woman who, despite protestations from the suspicious wife, are invited to stay by the friendly host, who hopes their conversations might inspire him to write. Later, the two stranger's squabbling sons show up and violence ensues. This first act is a microcosm for what happens later on, as more devoted fans intrude on the house to profess their 'faith' for their beloved poet, all the while ignoring the beleaguered wife's protests and gradually tearing her 'paradise' apart.Mother! is a pessimistic commentary on mankind's propensity for destruction and depending on your political leanings, there are many ways the events that transpire can be interpreted. There's no coherent narrative. This is a mayhem of religious, environmental and socio-political metaphors, an irreverent mardis gras parade through history from man's first transgression in the Garden of Eden to the Hiroshima bomb. The house stands in for mother earth, slave to the whims of a rapacious, capitalistic greed. And most of this happens in the last 30 minutes, where the grotesque violence increases to an over-whelming intensity and the claustrophobic camera work, shot mostly from Lawrence's point of view, makes for a dizzying and disturbing experience. There's no uplifting message to be taken, no silver- lining, just unapologetic nihilism and wanton imagery that punches you in the gut and grins sadistically.I left the cinema feeling quite shaken, my brain contorted trying to figure out what all the metaphors meant. I felt as though I had been given access to someone else's nightmare. Others were laughing derisively and complaining that it didn't make any sense, failing to grasp the subtext that was so obviously bashing them over the head.As another reviewer pointed out, it's hard to rate something like this honestly. There are many reasons to dislike it on a content level, but certainly bad film making isn't one of them. This is a tour de force of camera work and cinematography and the acting is top notch. I wouldn't be surprised if Jennifer Lawrence had a mental breakdown after filming this, with all the closeups of her gasping tortured face.Mother! is kind of like heroin. It left an impression on me that's for sure. But I'm not recommending it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Not for everyone obviously,"IMPORTANT!!! Do not watch this for the story, for the characters, or for the horror (nope it is definitely not a horror movie). The only reason to watch this movie is the underlying metaphoric message it tries to send. If you do not wish to think about the watching experience in an abstract open-minded approach there is hardly anything to like.With that being said I actually quite liked it. I see it is getting a lot of hate that it definitely does not deserve. Is it the most intelligent movie ever? Not by a far. But that does not mean it is not a smart critic towards modern humanity (or at least one aspect of it that I am not going to name not to spoil it). One week after watching and I am still thinking about the movie.Both lead actors perform their roles quite well. That doesn't mean you will like their characters, if you are anyway like me it will even annoy you, especially Jenifer Lawrence. Which makes the message just that much stronger.To end I would like to mention I did not get it until a few hours after yet I never felt bored during watching. It was at first a confusing mess and not something I would appreciate a lot, yet just the weirdness of it was entertaining in its own way.To sum up, weird, confusing, but made me think.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
What the...,"""Mother!"" is totally bizarre, and mind bending disturbing. No, clearly these are not props. Writer and Director Darren Aronofsky is angry and surreal in his apparent elegy of the artist's lost muse. After watching this ""What the"" vanity project, I have to wonder whether it extends far beyond mere indulgence. This is not at all a great movie. Really.At times when I viewed the movie as an observer instead of being an audience, the story is laughably ridiculous, taking itself way too seriously. Then again that in itself is somewhat entertaining.Literally, none of Aronofsky's characters have names. I'll use the actor's names when possible. Jennifer Lawrence plays the much younger wife of bestselling author Javier Bardem. Jenn is the melancholy wife, who valiantly restores their country home. Apparently, this was Javier's childhood home that was destroyed in a fire. Jenn wants a baby. However, Javier suffers writer's block, and has lost his muse. The two stopped having sex.""Mother!"" then spirals into the abyss. Ed Harris and his wife, in the movie, Michelle Pfieffer become uninvited house guests. Their prodigal sons return played by Brian Gleeson and Dowhnall Glesson, as Cain and Abel characters in Aronofsky's passion play. ""Mother!"" defies description, being so hard to figure out what is going on. It is strangely amusing in the over the top repulsive imagery and muddled logic.In a weird way, I kind of enjoyed ""Mother!"" given the ending. Seemingly, the angst of the lost artist's muse is more than personal, at least for Aronofsky. ""Mother!"" will not be everyone's 'cup of tea'. It is neither mine, as well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Borrow from House Of Good And Evil much?,"Saw this disjointed mess Friday night. I want to say off the bat, Aronofsky is a better director than writer and as a writer he borrows from many other films. I have to say I saw so many scenes borrowed and repackaged from a little indie film called House Of Good And Evil, which I saw on the SYFY channel a year back. I'm not saying the plots are the same, but I am saying there are at least 10 scenes I found remarkably similar. HGE sticks out as an influence on a few levels, as do several other films, but with that said, this film was a mess and I can see why it only took 5 days to write. I understand the metaphors, but damn, this film went overboard to the point of losing the average audience member. You have to be a huge Aronofsky fan from the beginning to let it slide. I happen to enjoy his other works, which is why I was excited to see this. Art is subjective, so it's fair to look at it in that scope, but this was just an ego piece of art like that of Dali.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Quality trailer but disappointing movie,"Directed by Darren Aronofsky, ""Mother!"" is another one of the Aronofsky's attempts at psychological thrillers, the previous being ""Black Swan"" (2010), which was widely praised as a masterpiece. However, ""Mother!"" is a huge let down.The film tells the story of a nameless couple, played by Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem, who live in the woods in a cliché setting straight out of every scary movie ever. As Lawrence's character gradually begins to hint at being pregnant, strangers start to show up at the couple's door asking for an overnight shelter.When the strangers eventually succeed in entering the home, they seem to have different intentions. With a selfish and somewhat famous poet for a husband, Lawrence's character seems to be the only one that can combat the home invasion.None of the main characters in the movie receive names, which makes it seem like Aronofsky is using symbolism to tell another story underneath the main storyline. This is where the movie gets confusing and loses its main focus.Too many long shots at arbitrary actions by characters and different noises in the background are extremely irritating to the audience. If Aronofsky is trying to build tension, he has succeeded. However, he also misguided the audience into paying attention to countless insignificant details.There are random cuts of the sound of a beating heart throughout the movie, which is later revealed as a crucial element in the development of the plot. Aronofsky's attempts to foreshadow the plot, however, conflict with the main storyline and thus backfires.While the movie seems to have good intentions by seemingly supporting 21st century feminism, it doesn't succeed at it. The film at first portrays the mother figure as a strong, independent woman who is trying to multitask for her family, since her husband seems to be preoccupied with his career and fame.By the end of the movie, the mother becomes powerless, helpless and despaired. The mother eventually turns into a selfish and monster-like character that refuses to do anything for anyone but her child.For those who are familiar with classical psychological thrillers, ""Mother!"" is comparable to ""Rosemary's Baby"" (1968), which has a similar narrative of a mother protecting her child. However, the narrative of ""Mother!"" seems to fall flat of presenting the audience with a thrilling storyline within the first hour. The repetition of shots bored me and I felt like I was checking my watch every couple minutes to see how much longer it was going to last.Until the final act of the movie, nothing extraordinary happens. One could potentially watch only the final 30 minutes of the movie to understand the plot, actually be scared and feel any kind of connection with the mother character.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A disturbing yet brilliant film full of symbolism,"I must admit that I had relatively low expectations for mother! after reading so many negative reviews, but it really is a well-crafted, intelligent, and symbolic film. The cast is strong, the characters are intriguing, and the story is both terrifying and thrilling.At first, mother! seems like a horror film with strange and confusing plot points scattered throughout, but the second half turns in such a way - albeit insane - that the plot points/allegories/metaphors become clear. While the last 30 minutes or so of the film may be extremely disturbing to some, it wraps up the plot perfectly.I think the reason for so many negative reviews is the film is almost overwhelmingly symbolic and uses many different Biblical themes to progress the plot, which some may not prefer. It would benefit viewers to have some knowledge of the book of Genesis prior to seeing mother! but that really isn't necessary to enjoy the film.I'd recommend mother! to anyone not easily disturbed who understands and enjoys symbolism and metaphors in film. I look forward to seeing it again! 9/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

On my growing list of the worst movie I've seen.,"I get a lot of free movie theater tickets so I see a lot of movies. So I thought why not ""go with the flow"" and see the movie ""Mother!"" The theater was half filled so it was an OK turn out. However I saw over 50 people leave around 30 min in, mumbling and grumbling. So at the end of the film when filing out I heard a bunch of criticisms like "" what a piece of cr**p"" and ""can i get a refund for this x-movie"" and ""false advertisement"".I completely agree with these assessments and viewpoints. Here is why: *False advertisement: movie is not as it was advertised.*script: written by a dialectic child, filled with cliche's, fake stuff up the wazoo and is even worse than the worst movie I have ever seen ( for the record that was Himalaya where the nearly 3 hours movie plot is about getting Yaks over the Himalaya's)*Directing: Honestly even lower than an amateur and novice combined. The eunuch that directed this ""piece"" is less competent than the most incompetent Youtuber.*Camera position: UTTERLY FUBAR.. but then that is what you get when you have 6 year old ( or someone with a mental capacity of a 6 year old) directing a ""movie"" where your girlfriend plays the main role.*Acting: From bad to abysmally horrible. The often blank expressions and the hellishly faux script is part of the problem but Jennifer L looked like she was on something when they did this ... erm.. ""movie"". Seriously lady: you need to get that checked out, it is like some bad tick or something.Publicity debacle a la Irma: this is where Jennifer L is saying that ""Gaia""/""mother Earth"" is punishing the US for voting Trump and that ""she was OK with hurricanes destroying people's houses and belongings"".

The exclamation point belongs there.,"Mother! is more like Oh Boy! I knew this new one from Darren Aronofsky was going to be a rough one and give it time, that's exactly what you're going to get.Aronofsky is the man behind such spiritual films as ""Noah"" and ""The Fountain"" and psychological thrillers like ""Black Swan"". You'll find both genres here.Jennifer Lawrence plays the wife of a very well-to-do author played by Javier Bardem. If you're wondering if the age difference is mentioned, it is. I mean she looks like a child bride compared to him, it has to.But anyway, these people are secluded in a house some place, and the silence that exists between them is deafening and its not just because the house creaks or because Bardem's writer has a case of writers block. It's between them.And really what starts off this mystery even more is that an orthopedic surgeon played by Ed Harris and his wife played by Michelle Pfeiffer they just show up out of no where thinking the place is a bed and breakfast.Bardem seems cool with them, but we're following this as the Lawrence character completely taken aback that Bardem is being so hospitable or that they are being so abrasively shitty house guests.Part of where I think the marketing for this really gives you the wrong idea is that this is a bizarre dark comedy more than it is a horror movie. The first hour really is having to deal with worse house guests than Bill Murray in ""What About Bob?""The mystery is fairly engaging though mostly because you do feel what's missing between the Lawrence and Bardem characters and you're wondering if these house guests are filling it or making it worse.At about the hour mark the question really does arise though of whether this movie is trying to say something or if it is something of a vanity project and to that I think the answer is basically both.Aronofsky includes everything from religious and political allegory, the addiction and cost of fame, being in an emotionally abusive relationship, trying to raise children in such a volatile time as this, and there's so much more.It's a lot and the last 45 minutes or so is somewhat effective in the downright brutal and disgusting imagery it shows, while at other times it really is just disgusting and you'll want to leave all together.It's the jumble of things that makes it hard for me to recommend this movie because despite it being called a horror movie, this is more just throw everything at the wall and see what sticks kind of filmmaking.That's not to say I don't admire the commitment, especially from the cast. Lawrence is perfectly confused and horrified while Bardem, Harris, and some of the most haunting work done by Pfeiffer in a while fill everything out really well.But like I said, this is a movie more of ideas than it is horror. Those ideas are portrayed later on in metaphorical form as horror but I doubt it's what most people are going to be expecting and I doubt many others will see much point in wading through Aronofsky's many converging ideas.So I give it 6 out of 10.

Darren Aronofsky's Masterpiece,"One of the most prevalent marketing sins committed by Hollywood is misguiding its audience. We walked into that theater expecting a horror film, and we want what we expect. To be fair, ""mother!"" is definitely related to horror, but it is a psychological art-house flick. No one has figured out how to market that weird genre. Whatever. People should of been warned that ""mother!"" is not grounded in reality.You probably won't ""get it"" because you empathized with Lawrence's character, who felt frustration, anxiety, loss, and anger. She didn't ""get it"" either. Still, it doesn't matter whether you loved or hated it, because we all felt the same emotions; we all searched for and discovered the same answers.

If Bilbo had never left his hobbit hole. . .,"How would the Hobbit have played out if Bilbo and the dwarfs had never left bag end? Mother! gives us a glimpse into the strange occult relationship wound tightly around a group of unexpected guests and the stains they leave on our soul. It's truly though provoking that one can live a life on cruise control that appears to be unwavering until a single drop in time of an others company diverts one to an entirely new plain of existence. Much like a murderers life is out of their hands once they are confronted, the meeting of people that had until now been divergent from our path creates a situation unfathomably out of reach to our own desires.Mother! creates a seamless transition from the mundane to a rich tapestry of feelings and emotions almost completely disassociated from the norm. How does one measure the relevance of time by the day? The hour? The minute? The second? The infinite number of measurements between each of those? Aronofsky takes the audience on such a symbolic journey crying out to be dissected, confronted, and discussed. The very nature of such a film allows for a different experience from each point of view? How would we each comprehend the messages and symbols from these various positions defines a work of art as experienced from so much diversity.Great directors have seldomly had the reins to truly strike out and create an experience so exceptionally unique as to ask their audience to have faith. Mother! delivers this promise that hand holding has no place in art.Gone are the long wide shots of splendor and cinematography so often ripped straight from Kubrick himself.

Suddenly, a couple comes to their house, and is allowed to stay despite Jennifer's resistance to these strangers and then eventually, things spiral far out of control. (Anything past this plot is a spoiler I swear.)Without giving too much away, if you are not into art house or metaphorical horror films, stay far away from this one. Not that it's necessarily bad, but I can tell this is the type of movie that will leave some audience members completely alienated in it's form of storytelling. Jennifer Lawrence and Javier both give compelling performances as you can tell their's a strain within their relationship that isn't said but instead seen within their eyes.The third act is when the film goes completely insane on screen. Like ""Most Insane Moments of Events I've Seen in a Movie In At Least 5 Years"".mother! is a film, that is worth seeing at least for sensory reasons. From a technical standpoint, this film has a lot of highlights from its sound design and atmosphere. The pacing feels fairly off, but makes a bit more sense after looking back at the film.

Such a perfect day to watch this on Jennifer Lawrence's 29th birthday!,"Only my second time seeing this bizarre biblical masterpiece! Very fast paced and can be confusing but worth it regardless!

"Regardless of how you choose to read the piece, 'Mother!' will get you talking and, whether you liked it or not, that can only mean it was at least interesting.","If there's one thing to be said for the controversial and polarising 'Mother! (2017)', it's that it is without a doubt an interesting allegorical experiment that has gotten people talking, whether it be to sing its praises or declare it trash or simply just to discuss it. While I don't think it is anywhere near as disturbing as some people - and indeed some of the marketing materials - are purporting it to be (though that's not to say it's particularly lax when it comes to the distressing scene department), there's no doubt it eventually becomes an incredibly frustrating and uncomfortable watch in the best way possible. A tangible anxiety starts to set in when the previously off-kilter feel transforms into downright claustrophobic chaos. In fact, the more intense sequences are almost enough to induce a real sense of enochlophobia. Towards the end, though, things start to get a little silly as all subtlety is thrown out the window so that the director's point can be hammered home. What's interesting is that after my initial viewing I have several interpretations as to what that point is exactly - the keenest of which seems so obvious that is surprising that it apparently wasn't an intention of the people behind the film. While I'm certain Aronofsky had a specific subtext in mind during his self-described 'five-day fever dream' of a writing process, I think that this ambiguity - along with the general non-conformity of the piece - is ultimately a strength and a reason why it stands out amidst a sea of paint-by-numbers sequels and bargain-bin adaptations. Regardless of how you choose to read the picture, it's clear that the experience, which is one that still works even without its larger metaphorical context, is one you won't soon forget and is a testament to the fact that sometimes even the creator can't predict every valid understanding of their work. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Way too obvious. Starts well and it becomes bad really early.,"This movie starts well and I enjoyed the first third of the movie. I got the message and emotion of the movie by then... great... we all got it. But then the director could not stop himself and goes completely overboard. The movie goes on and on with numerous unnecessary metaphors that do not serve any purpose except being smart. The storytelling becomes patronizing and stops making sense. It killed most of the emotion I could feel in the first third of the movie. I found the second half of the movie sad, not because of the story of which I was detached from by then, but because I could feel the director's obvious thoughts in every scene that served nothing.",3.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

For once I liked a weird movie,"Normally I don't like weird movies. Movies with no real answers, where you lack the satisfaction you need after watching a story unfold. Most of the time, like almost every time, I hate those movies. And I can get why this movie divides people in haters and lovers. But for once I'm going to be on the side of the people that liked it. The story is starting quite normal, but the last half hour is just completely crazy, absolute madness, that's the least you could say. It surprised me completely. I wonder what kind of drugs the director took to come up with such a story. The reason I liked it was because Mother! made me feel very aware of my emotions. I started being angry and talked outloud about the things I would do in real life if I was in the place of Jennifer Lawrence. The acting was really good. Javier Bardem and Jennifer Lawrence just smashed it. Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer, that I barely recognized, were also very good in playing that crazy couple. It's been awhile that I had mixed feelings about a movie. Do I hate it? Do I love it? Love is too strong, but I definitely liked it.

Art and Reaction,"Baffled, riveted, intrigued, horrified: these were the most identifiable feelings I experienced watching 'Mother.' I soon realized that there were allegorical meanings unclear to me, but also that 'thought' was being out-maneuvered. And here's the thing: I believe it's silly and close-minded to expect that I will immediately understand a work coming out of someone's unique creative process: a poem, a painting, a work of fiction, a film: any of those works may require some time to settle into my own psyche and understanding and reveal their meaning. Some works are experiences. Dismissing a work I do not immediately 'get' . . . Well, that's just arrogant. To be clear, I'm not saying that anyone who dislikes this film is being arrogant. One might have very definite aesthetic reasons for finding fault. Maybe I will, once the film settles in. But I will say that this is a thought-provoking film and for me, that is always a plus.

One of my favorites for the year- don't listen to the negative reviews,"I just left from viewing this film, and I have to say it is really one of my new favorites. Please do not listen to the negative reviews; judge for yourself.Let me say, this film is NOT going to be for everyone. First, some are not going to appreciate the ""in your face"" punch that they get by a movie that calls God on the carpet. Second, and what I really think is happening here, is that most current films are so dumbed down that when an intellectual film comes along it is almost always greeted by really harsh criticism. I mean, it is was really disheartening to sit through the previews prior to film because they served as reflection on just how bad and simple most films are today. I believe what is happening with the reviews on here about mother! are that most have become accustomed to being presented with simple, easy to follow plots and easy to follow story lines- which this film is not there to offer.Please, just judge it for yourself. It truly and excellent film.On a side note, I have to say I am COMPLETELY confused by all the references to Rosemary's Baby.

Ignore the marketing and listen to the critics but its still not for everyone.,"The film Mother! currently holds a F rating on cinema score from audiences, however critics see it in a higher regard and after viewing it myself I can see why. Mother! is essentially a heavy handed allegory that works for the most part although I think the final third of the film gets a little too obvious and drastically departs from the slow pacing it had before. It's a very interesting movie about religion and how destructive it can be. It also shows how people of importance are sometimes used to carry one's inspiration yet are given back nothing in the end. I didn't love the film but I did like it. Its a story about inspiration, creation and destruction all under the oppression of patriarchy. We see through the eyes of one who is both cherished and oppressed and never given anything back. It's an uncomfortable watch but an interesting thought provoking film. It's not for everyone. This film was marketed all wrong. It is NOT A HORROR FILM like the trailers suggest, its more of a slow burn drama/thriller. Best to know before watching.

Abstract film making.,"Watching this film, I like so many others felt frustrated and lost. I minored in film in college - I was acquainted with film criticism, but still the film left me bewildered. Like one review here I was also reminded of the advice I had read years earlier from Kurt Vonnegut who reminded us that all art however abstract must exist also to entertain an audience. Perhaps that is part of the problem with Mother - the audience that is entertained here must be both a sophisticated moviegoer and well educated in abstract film making. Like the casual viewer of abstract expressionist art who occasionally pronounces ""My six-year old daughter could have painted that!"" Mother requires a good amount of background in abstract film making to even approach it. I did not give this film a rating solely for that reason. Though I failed to understand it - I also admit that my familiarity with abstract film making is weak at best. 
No doubt this film could have been better advertised to emphasize that it was not meant as realism because it never should have been compared to ""Requiem for a Dream"" which was entirely realistic.
To extend my analogy further even if by comparison you can appreciate early Abstract Expressionism in the form of, for example, Willem De Kooning's ""Woman I"" it becomes increasingly difficult to appreciate his later works which are entirely devoid of realistic elements. Similarly Arenofsky's efforts with Mother when compared to abstract expressionism resound - it becomes clear to understand why a Director as he/she matures might want to become more abstract. Abstraction allows you to display more ideas simultaneously with greater flexibility and exploration of method. I have no doubt that if I watched this film a few more times I would eventually get some of his major points and come to appreciate his methods but this is not a film for a general audience.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"MOTHER! (Darren Aronofsky, 2017) **1/2","Director Aronofsky has said that he came up with the idea for this film after a screening of Luis Bunuel's THE EXTERMINATING ANGEL (1962) & his own thinking on the current human condition! As I lay watching the film - undoubtedly the most controversial release of the year - I was also reminded of many other films: Bunuel's own VIRIDIANA (1961; in the way in which invited guests unceremoniously take over a household) & SIMON OF THE DESERT (1965; throngs of people invading the personal space of & expecting answers from their idol); Roman Polanski's REPULSION (1965; a repressed woman who never ventures outside her home & loses her mind), ROSEMARY'S BABY (1968; a struggling artist invites a sinister couple into his marital home & they take over to the chagrin of the introverted & pregnant wife) & THE TENANT (1976; which had been the director's own male version of REPULSION anyway); Mike Nichols' WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRIGINA WOOLF? (1966; a younger married couple are the disbelieving witness to the constant squabbles of an older couple); & any number of Euro-horrors climaxing in conflagration & reincarnation (including Francesco Barilli's THE PERFUME OF THE LADY IN BLACK [1974])!! The narrative is clearly an allegory but I found the implied biblical connotations heavy-handed & the overt criticism of modern-day fame perfunctory. Most audiences were shocked by the gory climax & some critics deemed this a black comedy; frankly, I was neither horrified nor entertained! All the characters involved (except for the perennially barefooted Lawrence) range from the slightly unsympathetic (Bardem) to the downright annoying (Harris & Pfeiffer)...one can't really fault Aronofsky's technical prowess here but, as Biblical tracts go, I preferred his more irreverent NOAH (2014), while BLACK SWAN (2012; still his best work) was a far more interesting & satisfying 'descent into the maelstrom'.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"AMAZING, AMAZING, AMAZING!!!!! SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!","I actually rented this movie to watch, so did not see in theater, and kinda glad because during the movie I got very riled and upset. Almost as if this was a psychological experience which delved into my every nerve. Didn't know what the movie was about so just sat back and watched. Art imitating life got into argument with partner and turned it off. Next night or perhaps 2 nights later finished watching. Once you get the idea, and I had to google to figure out what the story was, based on the story of Genesis, it started making sense. Jennifer Lawrence is just completely amazing! Same with Javier, Harris, Michelle Pfeifer, Kristin Wiig. Afterward had a complete emotional meltdown.
Had partner also watch, which they did, as I did, not really knowing what movie was about, and they had SAME REACTION! SO EMOTIONALLY MOVED! Completely get where Aronofsky is coming from. We feel the same EVERY SINGLE DAY LIVING WITH TRUMP. And complete sadness on what is becoming of the world.
Everyone should see this, within the scope of age restriction due to disturbing images. THIS IS NOT A HORROR FILM UNLESS YOU CONSIDER TRUMP IN THE WHITE HOUSE A HORROR FILM.

It's definitely unique and it made me feel things I've never felt while watching a movie. I've not heard many good things about it, but I don't think it's terrible. Though I appreciate Aronofsky's noble effort to introduce the avant-garde to mainstream audiences, I just don't think they're quite ready for it. I think the poor reception was mostly the result of poor marketing. If I saw it at an art-house theater, like the Laemmle or Cinefamily, I'd probably feel different about it and would have had a better idea of what to expect. I think that seeing it at a big ol' commercial AMC downtown really threw me off. It was like the movie Brazil, add a little bit of City of Lost Children, mixed with equal parts Jacob's Ladder and Eraserhead. I'm definitely feeling weirded out by it still.

Mother! (2017),"I am pretty mixed on Darren Aronofsky as a filmmaker. I absolutely love both Requiem for a Dream and Black Swan, both are excellent. The rest though, are pretty eh. Noah was probably my least favorite of his, so I was excited to see if Aronofsky could reach back for another great film. The trailer's do not reveal much but I do like Jennifer Lawrence so wanted to catch this on its premiere day regardless. After watching, I have to say its pretty hard to unpack or explain what I just saw but I know I did have an enjoyable time.The film shows two people who don't have names but are referred to as Mother and Him. They live in a remote house and seemingly have a lovely quiet life at first. She takes care of the house while he struggles to write. One day a mysterious man played by Ed Harris stops by and stays over. Later he is joined by his wife. It's hard to share much more without giving away major spoilers but lets just say things quickly become crazy afterwards. Aspects of the film will start not to make sense although I'm sure there is an allegorical meaning to everything Aronofsky does.The footage is grainy giving a rusty feel. Lawrence is really good. Say what you want, she puts in a quality effort. The camera is very personal, always close to her face. She does well to emote the bizarre horror and confusion about the situations she's placed in. Michelle Pfeiffer also puts forth quite a performance as a shady, bitchy, sex crazed wife with seemingly dark tendencies. The film has virtually no score but the film is still able to reverberate.I found this film to have the look and feel of Rosemary's Baby at first with the situation and dark nature of mystery surrounding the strangers. Its still an apt comparison and I think the film is definitely influenced by Polanski's work but Aronofsky puts his own spin on his meaning, especially in the second half. There is an allegorical connection between the film and mother earth and how we reap and rampage and destroy something so pure. There are also biblical connotations that I feel I'll need to have a rewatch for before trying to analyze what's happening. There is also a commentary on idolization and the expansive nature and danger of it.My theater crowd mostly seemed to hate it but I appreciated what I saw. Its not the best from Aronofsky and doesn't rank among the aforementioned quality films of his, but its quite ambitious as you would expect it to be. I don't know if many will understand how to interpret the latter parts of this film but the joy is in trying. While the film isn't anything amazing, its one of those that will have you thinking and will polarize its viewers. Somehow, I know that's what Aronofsky wanted.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

In the moment of watching, I couldn't grasp the full sense of it, and it seemed to undo a lot of the good work that had come before.Good to see Lawrence going for new levels. Bardem as the blocked writer just seems to cruise, a less sinister version of his No Country dude. The previous reviewer here makes a useful comparison to Bunuel's teasing sleights of hand. Just think of the remarkable discipline in the quick-fire third act of Obscure Object, then compare that to the mayhem here.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"If Adam Sandler and the Wayans Brothers teamed up to film ""Art Movie: The Movie""","...this would be the result: a blender full of previously seen art house clichés eliciting an occasional laugh at how ridiculously stupid what just happened in front of your eyes is.If your time is precious on Planet Earth, avoid at all costs. If you have no aim in life other than to be annoyed and irritated by passive spectacle, more power to you, you have found the motherload.Some positive takeaways:Jennifer Lawrence is so beautiful to stare at and ridiculously talented as an actress. Michell Pfieffer acts perfectly as the kind of toxic older woman we all should cut out of our lives. Ed Harris is a stellar man of mystery/genial stranger. Javier Bardem is a solid macho asshole/sociopath/narcissistic artist.

A symbolic piece of art.,"At the time of its release, Mother! was a very polarizing movie. Some people loved it and some people claimed it was the worst film they've seen. Love it or hate it, you can't deny that Darren Aronofsky got people to talk and contemplate about the film's hidden meanings and metaphors.Mother! follows the story of a couple whose peaceful life gets destroyed by some uninvited guests.As mentioned before, some audience members will dislike this movie wholly. In fact, people disliked it to the point where it got an F grade on CinemaScore. I, on the other hand, found this movie to be an uncomfortable but intriguing piece of art. It's not perfect but majority of the time everything is executed well.The performances in this movie are staggering. Jennifer Lawrence does particularly well. A lot of the shots throughout are fixated on her and so the film did rely on her acting skills but thankfully she managed to pull it off. Javier Bardem, Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer also do the film justice with their performances.Aronofsky has done an incredible job. He made a film which will get me thinking for a long time. There are many interpretations that can be made since pretty much everything you see during the movie has a meaning or is metaphorical for something else. Even on a surface level I think this movie's enjoyable. You're constanly interested in figuring out what's actually happening whilst at the same time feeling extremely anxious and awkward at the events that take place.The cinematography is terrific. The whole movie you're wandering around in this house. There are shots of the outside scenery but we never go there. This added a huge feeling of claustrophobia within me especially during the last 30 minutes where it all turns into a nightmare that's not easily forgettable.If there is one problem I have with the movie is that the pacing can suffer. There are scenes where we go from seeing a regular, mundane life to something completely shocking. This may catch some people off guard.All in all, Mother! is a film that I won't be forgetting anytime soon. Its visual imagery and metaphors will keep me engaged until I can decipher the many meanings the movie contains. Aronofsky has crafted a piece of art.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

It is so beyond beautiful how he mixed surreal issues in the world from over history of time, such as the Bible, a cross between mostly Judaism and Christianity. There's dealing with loss, and one of the biggest is how relationships are tested when one isn't serious about them together.

Why people pirate films and ANOTHER review for MOTHER!,"In this world if you buy fruit and it is rotting you take it back for a refund. If your new phone breaks..same..refund..and so on. Only with films, music, plays, concerts or mainly anything 'creative' or 'art' based do you pay your money without some form of guarantee. Cinema going, D.V.D and blue ray purchase are expensive interests and there are more of us poor people than wealthy. Movie piracy is the only guarantee those with little money have against the multi billion dollar film industry if a film turns out to be 'not' as advertised or in your opinion crap. 
 'Mother' in my opinion is an astounding film..I have not been affected by a movie so deeply since at age 16 The Exorcist scared me senseless ( not long after leaving the Catholic faith I was it's targeted audience ). I am 52 now and maybe Mother hit me so hard due to my Theology degree and my Catholic upbringing. Not 'getting' this film does not make people stupid and getting it does not make you intellectually pretentious..firstly this film was misleadingly sold as a horror film..it is NOT A HORROR FILM. If i had opted to watch this instead of 'IT' I would have been very annoyed and felt cheated. This in my opinion is why people do illegally download and in this case I understand why. 
 A friend recommended this to me..it has been out awhile. I knew about it but I let the critics argument sway me away from seeing it... Mother is a totally personal experience. At one point a fan of the poet says ""I feel these words were written especially for me""..and the poet says they are. Rather like the scene in John Lennon's Imagine where he speaks to a fan who has been wandering in his garden. Mother is a completely subjective and personal film written for all of us..some people will hate it and others will praise it.

An allegorical film which will be either loved or hated.,"Overall, mother! was an interesting film which will be either loved or hated by members of the audience. The ones that love it will understand the message that Aronofsky was trying to paint, while the ones that hate it will be mindless fools who went in with the intention of it being another stupid horror film. Luckily I had a small bit of knowledge going into the film so I was able to understand the picture pretty well. While others might not have the same luck, it's really not hard to catch on by the third act. In the end mother! was a truly unique film that featured a beautiful hidden message, and won itself a ""Good"" on theVade Review Bar or a 7 out of 10.

Overwhelming and Poignant,"Firstly, this film is not for the feint of heart. With its religious under tones and stern/bold imagery, this is the type of film that follows you for a while after.I've noticed a lot of heat and people bashing this film, so if you are interested in a more open minded spoiler free review, look no further. I can agree the film was marketed quite poorly. It was presented to be that of a thriller/horror mystery about some backwoods cult like family, with action at every turn. Do not go in expecting this.In my opinion, the acting was superb, especially Jennifer Lawrence, whom I am usually not a fan of. It is the first time, I truly felt her emotion bleed through in a performance. Of Javier Bardem shines through as usual. I loved the direction of this film along with the set and atmosphere. It really gave the impression, that the viewer was a part of the story.I can see why the division between viewers regarding the actual story itself. This will not be a movie for everyone. It is not your typical thriller/horror/drama movie. I've see a lot of people calling it contrived and self-indulgent for Aronofsky, but that in a sense was the message of the movie. You are supposed to be comparing the hierarchies and rough personalities between the characters, which some may come off that way. My biggest advice to any potential movie goer is, not to look too deep for the message, it is quite blatant, and once you understand the meaning behind everything, you can properly enjoy the movie.All in all, I enjoyed it.

Brilliant movie with layers of themes.,"The movie touches upon a wide range of themes from identity crisis to adverse side of fame, to being vulnerable of losing fame and lacking inspiration to create, to a dried up relationship and being overcrowded in marriage. Javier's character is a selfish poet who is after his fame and disregards his wife's needs and desires. He is not really a hostage to his fame, though, he is a predator whose only desire is to drain emotionally his wife, use her and others' dramas as a source of inspiration to create poetry and be worshiped. He can't possibly choose a calm, humble life, while his wife is isolated from the world, she is sort of a control freak and doesn't want any outsider to intrude her ""world"". People eventually intrude her house and destroy and shake her ""world"", she is unable to save her child from becoming a victim at the hands of her husband's fanatic worshipers.

Oh Mother! where to begin,The film Mother! is difficult to review without giving much away. I think the best way to start is to say it's not a horror movie at all. I feel it's more in line with a psychological thriller/mystery/metaphor . The performance by Jennifer Lawrence is outstanding and she raises the film to a higher level by simply being her. She is the main focus of the movie and although everyone else brings their A game she just seems to raise above. There are several meanings which can be drawn from the film and some are more obvious than others but I think this is the type of movie which will be studied for years to come. The film footage and angles add to the levels of suspense and are masterfully executed and the overall feel gets into you keeping you on edge with Lawrence's character. Keep in mind that even though this in not a horror there are parts of the film which are difficult to watch. I hope you found this helpful!

"An emotionally exploitative, roller coaster ride","Alas this movie comes already saddled with the baggage of it's controversial and divided reviews, but I found Mother! to be a curious, enjoyable, emotionally draining but ultimately highly satisfying film.In many ways the approach of this movie reminded me of Joel Schumacher's ""Falling Down"" in that it takes the viewer on a close emotional journey with the lead character (Jennifer Lawrence) where you initially empathise strongly... and then there comes a point when you realise what is happening has turned completely bonkers and you've been going along with it for the past 20 minutes.Many reviews have centred on the religious connotations of this film but I didn't see that myself when I watched it. The film continually and cleverly plays on your emotions and sympathies for it's entire length, pulling the strings one time after another. It gently stacks up more and more characters and situations of increasingly bizarre, offensive and ultimately dangerous nature until it's final scenes of confusion and desperation for Lawrence.What a fabulous cast; the camera is never off the excellent Lawrence. Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer seem deliberately cast as part of Aranofsky's psychological game with the viewer, and Bardem produces another of his enigmatic, kooky performances to tie things up.I hope that history will judge this film better than many of the reviews have done this year. It's hat tips to Rosemary's Baby are obvious and respectful I think. A film that deserves it's place in the Horror Hall of Fame.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen,"Wow, so...yeah...terrible, terrible movie. I have never written a review on here or anywhere online before, have never even been remotely tempted to write a review online before, and yet, here I am. I just feel like it's my duty to help people from making the same mistake that I did by wasting my time and money on this film, because, I mean, on the surface it looks like it could be a good movie. The trailers depict it as a tense horror movie helmed by a capable director and starring an A-list cast. Ed Harris and Javier Bardem are two of my favorite actors and despite some of the negative press that Jennifer Lawrence generates, you have to give her credit, the girl can act. So I can see how a lot of people would be drawn to this movie like I was, but please, if you're reading this, avoid it like the plague.After looking at some other audience reviews, I see that the typical rallying call the fans of this film are clinging to is that 'if you didn't like it, you didn't get it', and to those people I say: get over yourselves. This movie is not some complicated film that is hard to decipher. It's a relatively straightforward allegory that fails amazingly on almost every level as a movie. Its neither entertaining or (with the exception of Ed Harris) well acted, and there is some truly terrible CGI present as well, as if Aronosky wanted to make sure his film was awful in every possible way.Listen, when I say this movie is BAD, I don't mean the so-bad-it's- almost-good kind of bad, I mean its the I-feel-like-I-have-been- sitting-here-for-seven-hours kind of bad.

an audacious absurdist masterpiece of political and religious satire,"Art cinema and genre film are often regarded as opposite ends of the movie spectrum. One flaunts filmmaking rules, the other depends on them. When they are blended, the result can be confusing, challenging, and very refreshing. The film Mother! (2017) is an example of a filmmaker deliberately provoking audiences with a multi-genre exploration that defies labelling. Calling this a horror drama does not even come close to describing the way it ramps from a story of domestic abuse to home invasion, demonic possession, messianic madness, and then explodes into a supernatural fantasy of biblical proportions. Be prepared for a wild ride.Talking of plot wrongly implies that the film's narrative is based on logical progression whereas it feels more like a never-ending nightmare. It's held together by imagination not logic. We meet an unnamed couple in a sprawling isolated country mansion: Mother (Jennifer Lawrence) is a young home decorator, and Him (Xavier Bardem) a famous poet whose writing has, like their sex life, dried up. One evening, two people arrive unexpectedly: Man (Ed Harris) is followed later by Woman (Michelle Pfeiffer) and soon the couple are making themselves at home, much to Mother's discomfort. More people arrive and violence erupts among the strangers. The house is cleared, the sex life and poetry resumes, and fame returns. People line up to hear Him speak and the crowds keep getting bigger. Mother becomes a captive in her own house as her tummy swells with new life while the crowds spill into every room. They revere the ground on which Him walks, hang off Him's every word, and souvenir anything they can carry while she is in fixated panic at the disintegration of her world. The crowd's adoration turns to greed, then carnage, while Mother gives birth in a full- scale war zone compressed into a house. The new life is shared among the hordes as the apocalypse descends. It's totally crazy.The originality, absurdism, and audacity of this film are breathtaking. It makes more sense if viewed as a montage of interconnected visual metaphors, loosely assembled according to taste. There are clues that help decode its possibilities. For example, being nameless renders the cast into avatars for universal stereotypes, so the film is not just about a house full of people. History is littered with belief systems and their damage to humanity, while the birth is Mothers' single unifying power that is ripped from her arms in an horrific Biblical allusion to 'feeding of the masses'. The score is virtually non-existent, allowing natural sounds free reign to create a mood of Gothic claustrophobia. The camera-work pulsates with hand-held rhythms and variable depth of field that isolate different planes of psychological and physical reality. The constant camera close-ups on Mother's face or over her shoulder assumes her viewpoint and makes this a feminist experience of a 'man's world'. The casting is perfect. Jennifer Lawrence's youthful Madonna face becomes a powerhouse of depicted terror while Xavier Bardem's turns into a stencilled visage of divinity, a self-absorbed messiah.Whatever else it may be, this film is also a masterpiece of political and religious satire. Completely unbounded, it can be taken as a weird horror film or read as a meditation on gendered existentialism or an absurdist parody on the saviours that arise in every society throughout history. It is also completely here and now: when Him survives the dystopian chaos that he has created, ask yourself: who does he remind you of?",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Disturbing and ambitious,"Director Darren Aronofsky has followed the same pattern in the creation of his films throughout his career, following a narrative that rises in insanity as he progresses, and he cannot help but continue on this path, even more so in 'mother!'.
The film is about a couple who live seemingly calm, but are disturbed by unexpected guests. Through this premise, Aronofsky constructs an allegorical story, full of metaphors at the same time that it is disturbing, dark and disturbing.
The story, being unclear in its plot, is open to multiple interpretations by the viewer, which transforms this story into a very intimate one. However, despite the brilliance of the allegory presented, it is impossible not to take into account the ambition and arrogance with which Aronofsky relates the story. And this, while it can please many viewers, it can cause perplexity in others and frighten people, not in the good way that would be expected.
Really 'mother!' is that. A madness of its director that may have a good hidden metaphor, but because of the way it is drawn, it ends up being buried.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A visually intriguing waste of time,"This is my first IMDb review and I just had to write this and warn all of you exactly how terrible this movie is. I have never ever considered leaving a cinema during a film and I have watched some pretty awful films and also some very far flung and art house films such as this. The trailer promises an intense and suspenseful psychological thriller as the sharp music and intriguing shots and dialogue compel you into the cinema to see just exactly what is going on in this film. What I got was two hours of boredom, No character development, Tedious and clichéd themes, Monotonous dialogue and the only question I left with was 'Can I get my money back?'. The only element this film has going for it is its use of lighting. Seriously this is the biggest wast of time and a lot of people will defend this film for the sake of pretending they are cultured and sophisticated.

Can a film be brilliant if you need help to figure out what it's about?,"When a film presents as a mystery, we come to expect that at some pivotal point in the story the filmmaker will reveal the film's true nature to us. Those of us story-consumers who chase after mysteries and thrillers do so for that feeling of profound epiphany when everything clicks, illuminating the past and setting the stage for a riveting finale.Darren Aronofsky has not made that kind of mystery. ""Mother!"" it turns out, is an allegory - a story that on the surface appears to be about one thing but is actually symbolic of another - in other words, no one's going to spell the true nature out for you. That's the poetic beauty of an allegory; either you find the perspective that allows you to intuit its meaning, or you don't.So for many viewers, ""Mother!"" will be a confounding, maybe even terrible movie until a quick Google search for its meaning makes everything crystal clear. Once you know, you know, but the debate around ""Mother!"" will be whether Aronofsky's creative concept is nothing but pretentious preaching if the average viewer has to visit the movie's IMDb trivia page to understand it.""Mother!"" immediately shrouds itself in secrets, beckoning us to guess them and pay shrewd attention to the story's details. From the opening shots there's a magical, surrealist element at play, but one we assume to be part of the film's hidden secrets rather than part of the film's very fabric. Recognizing this is a key to cracking the allegory without ""cheating.""We meet Jennifer Lawrence's character, who lives with her husband (Javier Bardem) in a beautiful, secluded house - his house - that she has lovingly and painstakingly restored after a fire. He is a famous poet, but he has struggled to produce his next great work, and that preoccupation has made her feel neglected and forgotten. When a mysterious man (Ed Harris) and later his wife (Michelle Pfeiffer) shows up at the house, their questionable guest manners exacerbate the situation and suddenly things spiral out of control.At surface level, the film is a homemaker's (and anyone who believes in order and structure's) worst nightmare - guests who come in out of nowhere and overrun you and ignore all the rules. If Aronofsky fails at conveying all his other messages, he doubtless succeeds at creating a powerful empathy for his main character, and that's probably the most important of all the elements this story needs to work. This also requires an actor who makes that easier and few talents today are as beloved as Lawrence. Her character serves as a stand-in for our own frustrations and confusion at what's happening around her and expertly conveys the hopelessness of losing control.The rest of the film is too tough to dive into without spoilers, but things get pretty off the rails, especially if the film's meaning hasn't become clearer by the final act. Even so, only having a hint at some of the themes and ideas that are at work in this movie isn't really enough to bring audiences on board with some of the events and challenging visuals of the tumultuous finale.Aronofsky at least deserves credit for the filmmaking. ""Mother!"" has a riveting intensity to it from start to finish which is all the more impressive when you realize there hasn't been a note of a musical score in the entire film. There's a reason 99 percent of films use music and that Aronofsky makes a compelling thriller without one earns him accolades regardless of whether the experience felt like a waste of time.Anyone who does discover (or Google) what ""Mother!"" is about will surely see some if not a ton of brilliance in Aronofsky's vision, but can it truly be brilliance if it requires ""help"" from outside the film like some kind of secret decoder ring? Objectively, one would think not, but once you have that decoder, it becomes impossible not to see the film through that lens and begin rabidly reassessing the entire experience.The fact of the matter is that cryptic films have been made before and some of the great ones do convey their ideas clearly enough to connect with an audience during the experience of that art. ""Mother!"" fails in that regard, and so even with Aronofsky's incredible ideas, vision and storytelling, it can't be hailed as great without discrediting the audiences it failed to communicate to through no fault but its own.But it might just be a masterpiece upon repeat viewings.~Steven CThanks for reading!

"Darren Aronofsky's ""Mother!"" is 2017's best picture.","In an age frequently dominated by generic and banal movies, it is refreshing to see that such good filmmaking still exists. Darren Aronofsky's ""Mother!"" is not only the best film of the year, but it is also a timeless piece of art that will still be just as relevant for generations to come. ""Mother!"" is, at its core, a film about the endless generosity of nature taken advantage of by mankind. This film is packed with so much symbolism and so many layers of meaning that one couldn't possible begin to dissect it all in one viewing. The unorthodox style and brutal honesty of the film may turn some viewers off, but this is a very important narrative that we must not shy away from. Aronofsky is well aware of the fact that history repeats itself, and unless humans decide to take responsibility for our actions and stop the endless assault on Mother Nature, we might wake up one day to find that she has no more love to give.

Better Than Expected,"Intriguing and strange. This is not the terrible film I heard everyone make it out to be, but it's also short of the brilliant allegory that I imagine Aronofsky was going for.

"Profoundly ambitious, horrifyingly jolting, indescribably exceptional","It's all well and good for a movie to be a fleeting bit of fun, whether it's a comedy or a genre romp. Far more fulfilling are those pictures that dig their claws in deeply, even if we don't fully understand what the filmmaker is communicating, and make us feel every last scrap with a pervasive, guttural, gnawing intensity. What, exactly, is 'mother!' about? What are the themes and big ideas that rake their talons across every square inch, just under the surface and itching to burst through? I'm not sure I have an answer, or could articulate it, and perhaps trying to would force a reexamination all over again - the Heisenberg principle by way of film criticism. Maybe trying to elucidate the nature of the story is worse than betraying spoilers. Maybe such analysis is pointless in the first place, and like the most honored of canvases, the real truth of Darren Aronofsky's work is what we each individually get from it. This is as much psychological horror as it is an art film; a microcosm of Everything (possibly, literally, Everything), and a blank slate. Of all else one might say of 'mother!,' however, there's also this: it's unfailingly exquisite.It speaks volumes of Jóhann Jóhannsson that, having scored the feature, he then realized the movie was served better without it. I can imagine how the project might have looked and felt if there were music over top, but at the same time, the absence allows all the rest of the audio ring out all the more, and the rest of the content. Truly, the sound design is immaculate: every small sound, line of dialogue, cacophonous uproar, and deafening silence is felt just as wholly as the imagery to greet us. This might actually be Aronofsky's masterpiece, as both writer and director, and I say that as someone who dearly loves his other films: in 'mother!' I recognize a grand vision, a towering ambition, that far exceeds anything he's given us before; 'The fountain' was mainstream by comparison. The screenplay is mesmerizing in every sense of the word, for within these two hours is encapsulated more content than could ever be neatly summarized, yet the tale (such as it is) is complete, coherent, and cohesive, but also inscrutably abstruse to the point of near total abstraction. The scene writing is all over the place, but intentionally so; the dialogue is fierce and biting; the characters are wholly beyond definition. Contained within these two hours is an exploration in a single house of gender, family, male ego, the unpaid labor of women, home invasion, privacy, death, love, grief, jealousy, enmity, misogyny, mob violence, state violence, dystopia, and so much more and everything else possible up to and including the life cycle of the Universe - and it works. It actually bloody well works, to dazzling effect.It's a truly extraordinary cast that was assembled here, and none of them have ever been in a movie like this. Jennifer Lawrence, Javier Bardem, Ed Harris, Michelle Pfeiffer, Brian and Domhnall Gleeson, Kristen Wiig - all. One might well argue that they've never given performances like this. Extreme, brutal violence adjoins utmost beauty; ghastly horror and dire drama that are as clear as day are abutted with an explosive kaleidoscope of superficially disordered successive scenes that require and enforce our undivided attention to even begin to parse. The production design and art direction, lighting, effects, blood and gore, stunts and choreography, hair and makeup, costume design, props, editing, cinematography, and every other possible element contributed behind the scenes are utterly stupendous, adding wonderfully to the astounding tableau. 'mother!' is an exemplar of film-making craft, with tremendous acting to boot. Whether the same can be said of Aronofsky's writing is perhaps in the eye of the beholder. Yet for my part I think, without a doubt in my mind, that for as sharp and intelligent and excellent as all other aspects of the film are, the screenplay might after all be the best part of all.I recall well when this was released how the reception seemed to be rather polarized; reactions were ones of either love or hate, with no room in between. Now that I've watched it for myself I absolutely understand why, for 'mother!' is about as far as one could get from ordinary and easily digestible. It's a difficult viewing experience in part for the feelings it elicits, but even more so for the wild, disparate leaps from one moment to the next, in every way. This is a title that doesn't just want its audience to think, and assess, but demands it, and even for those who are receptive or accustomed to such fare, I can readily see how this would cause divisions in those ranks. Still, one could him and haw all day about the details and the imponderables, but the fact remains that as far as I'm concerned, this is brilliant. I can hardly say it earns a typical recommendation, for this is not a typical movie and it's only a very select few who might truly get the most out of it. For anyone who is open to fully, wholeheartedly committing to a feature, though, and all that it might entail, I believe 'mother!' is a must-see. Two esoteric thumbs up!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Oh Mother, where are thou?","Horror movies continue to be a popular trend in Hollywood. IT's successful launch last weekend, surely inspires the trend to continue, so what the heck put out another one this weekend.  Jennifer Lawrence takes center stage in what looks to be a psychosocial thriller to usher in a new age. Will the artistic styles of Darren Aronofsky be a welcome change to the milieu, or does its odd premise promised in the trailers might dive too far down crazy town to enjoy? Robbie K happy to fill in some gaps with another review. Let's get started.LIKES:Unique vision: Call me crazy, as many people do, but originality is something difficult to come by these days. Mother, certainly gets points for standing out, not only in the bizarre presentation and mind messing visuals, but also in the symbolism represented in the story. Amidst the mystery, drama, and other oddities in the film, one will get their fill of morals in that artistic manor Hollywood loves. One certainly won't forget this movie, or itsoriginality.Acting: The chemistry between Javier Bardem and Lawrence is perhaps the biggest selling point of this movie. Much of the mystery comes in the tension between the two protagonists, Bardem's deceptive nature and double speak is on point to keep you wondering what is going on. Lawrence's curiosity and desperation kept me intrigued as to how far she could go, before breaking and challenging his words. It's a relationship dynamic brought out in spades, further leading you down the rabbit hole into the mind meddling to be had. In addition, Lawrence also knows how to sell psychotic with screams, tears, and just enough raspy voice to sell suffering.Prosthetics/makeup: Grasping for straws here, but the team did a nice job with the prosthetics at hand. Injuries that arise look festering as if plagued by infection illustrated in text books. The degrading house seen in the trailers is only further detailed in the shots, black marks and degrading wood in all its glory. And Lawrence's pregnant belly is flawlessly blended into her normal skin, creating the roll that she could pop at any point.DISLIKES:Slow: Forgive me, but horror movies often move quickly to get to the scares at hand, even though they sacrifice story. While mother has a storyit moves dirt slow to the point of inducing sleep in the movie. The drama aspect takes more precedence than anything, and unfortunately it is dragged out relentlessly to the point of being annoying. This snail's pace doesn't do much for the quality of the movie, despite building up suspense for something never to come.Not Scary: Aren't horror films supposed to be scary, or at least try to get me to jump? Mother failed on this aspect much of the time, resorting to a few loud noises and people sudden turning a corner as their fright factor. The tactic grew old and soon became nothing more than a ploy to try to salvage scares. For me, the creepiest factor was seeing humans devolve into selfish, unthinking cretins makes me fear for the future. Outside of that though, not much got me on edge for this movie.Editing: I stated above the pace was slow, but that's because there was too much unneeded details for most of the movie. The drama was dragged out, the weird concepts were even longer, and there were a few scenes that I could have lived without and been just fine. Editing needed to jump in and get rid of some of this fluff, because it didn't work for me at all given the lack of scares. Yet, their hands were tied by the fact the writer was also the director.The Story: All the symbolism and artistic presentation doesn't save the audience from an incoherent story. Mother has a lot of weird subplots in it, many of which held little relevance to the overall plot. Additionally, there are lots of gaps in the plot, unless you like theorizing and reflection on the plot, because that's the only way to fill in the vague data points. The writer got so centered on its uniqueness, it didn't close the story the best I think they could do. Questions are great for discussion, but I like my films with a little more explanation than what I got in this film. And when you draw most of the conclusionsyou can't help but say, ""Really? That is what this is?"" Which reminds me.The Weirdness: Mother started out artistically weird, but as the movie hit the halfway point it dove deep into the tortured artist route. What didn't make sense, quickly turned into a trippy, random display of negligence and rudeness, mocking the modern human while deterring from the mystery. Soon rapid time progression and sequence changes led to even more head scratching moments, that continued to shock me further to the point of asking what I was watching. The obscene violence and darker phenomenon only grossed me out, and again seemed pointless in the grand scheme of things.THE VERDICT:Mother is artistic and unique, I'll give it that, and certainly makes bold statements about a lot of cultural quarrels plaguing our world. But outside of that, it's not so much a horror movie as a though provoking, psychological thriller. A slow pace, trippy visulas, and just overall weird atmosphere, does not make for the best horror movie. So, if you had your hopes up for this one, do yourself a favor and skip this mind bender until it hits home theaters. Go see IT again instead.Scores:Drama/Mystery/Horror: 6.5 Movie Overall: 4.0",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Meh.....not bad,"Mother! is the story of a couple that settle down in the middle of know where (so they think) and soon enough weird things start happening when strangers begin to let themselves in their own house.First off, this movie is hella weird, but its a good weird. Its weird in a way that is unsettling and crazy at the same time. I liked the characters and their performances were on spot. But......with that being said i was a little disappointed with this film.When i first saw the trailer for Mother! i expected a thrilling and intense mystery that would leave a horrifying taste in my mouth, but its not a horror movie at all.Its a metaphorical movie that has some religious themes about how we treat our earth and how Mother Nature would feel about it. It irritated me that nothing is really explained.So in the end this movie is a watch once and forget about it for me, but overall i would call it a somewhat enjoyable film. For me it was just a big Unsettling, confusing, crazy, unexplained mess. C+ or 6/10Some people love this movie and some people hate it, but i fall in the middle section of that argument.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Beware of Movies with Titles that Use Punctuation,"A ham-fisted,* klutzy, self-indulgent cornucopia of schlock.I'll leave it to others here who have done a fine job in trying to explain the ""message"" of the movie. I laughed through most of the first half of this movie and got bored through the latter half when, I guess, I should have been shocked and moved by the imagery.At TIFF, the director/writer said he wrote this out of his own ""anger"". Well, after his temper tantrum, he would have done well to take a timeout to reflect and, perhaps, to introduce some self-discipline to edit this. Instead, he was more like Little Jack Horner, who ""pulled out a plum, And said, 'What a good boy am I!'.""

"Unnerving, disturbing, enraging, confounding","Mother! begins like a Peter Weir film, with increasing unease as unwelcome guests proliferate in the young wife's large home. Then it begins to resemble Polanski's Rosemary's Baby as her husband seems to join the Dark Side of the crowd of intruders mistreating her and making increasing shambles of her house. In the latter stages this becomes like a Ken Russell film of Grand Guignol or the seventh level of hell.Jennifer Lawrence is excellent, and that is apparent since the camera holds so tightly on her throughout that it seems almost her POV if not her hallucination. In any case, this is on some level a fable with a moral, but I wish it were clear what it was. I offer no spoiler because I'm not sure what to conclude.The film as a metaphor is not without worth but it is challenging if not irritating to sit through, especially if one is sensitive to exotic violence and an infuriating level of repeating chaos in a helpless wife's life, with a husband who is of no real help to her or us at all.Perhaps this was about a victim of mental cruelty who needed to leave her husband and seek a safe house, but that's not what happened and I really couldn't say. I'm sure the filmmakers would disagree with me on that deduction.As an audience member I can stand some abuse as long as I find out what it was all for at the end. I can't say that here. I suppose the pointlessness could be intended to tell me the God of this world is mad. It would certainly please Ken Russell. Maybe polonsky too.But again, I have no idea if I'm near the mark.

Misunderstood Masterpiece - A must see,"I usually don't post reviews but given the massive number of negative reviews here I felt like I had to.It seems like a lot of people saw that mother! was starring Jennifer Lawrence and assumed it would be their cup of tea, without really knowing what they were getting in to.It's definitely an assault of sorts on the viewer and not for everyone, but make no mistake, that doesn't mean it's a bad movie.It's terrifying, hilarious, clever, and completely unique.Don't read too much about it as the development of the story is part of the fun.Things get more brutal than expected by the end which is what I think has turned a lot of people so intensely angry at the film, but I think everything that was done was warranted and there a lot of valuable messages to unpack here.The performances are top of notch by everyone as well. Jennifer Lawrence plays the role perfectly, especially once you've finished the whole story and understand the dynamic.

How to-movie,"Don't let my rating effect how you judge the movie, but I just came from the cinema and feel a huge need to vent, so you are going to be my audience. First of all, I have to be totally honest with you. I am one of those people who have to finish a movie before making a judgment and putting a review out there in the world. Second of all, David Aronofsky is one of my favorite movie-makers, director, producer, writer, for a while now. The Fountain is my favorite movie of all times, the only movie I wasn't a big fan of was Noah. Mother! has been on my To See-list ever since word came out it went into production and even more after seeing the trailer. I was so excited to go and see it. This must have influenced my expectations of this movie. Also, and that's where the review title comes from, I might have been influenced by the audience that was in the cinema I was in. The room was almost full, over 200 people and I went alone because I wanted to experience it in my own cocoon, not having to explain why I loved the movie so much to friends who might think otherwise. And yes, I've read raving reviews and also read about people thinking it was pretentious. So why this title? Why just a rating 1? First: how to get a cinema empty? By the time the war broke out, there were only 7 people of the 200 left, myself included. How to miss a point so much with a movie? it gives you little hints, with the chrystal, you must think either he's this or either he's that. There was one point in the movie, I can't recall when and don't want to give any spoilers, that I felt I was questioning myself if I was dreaming or not. I could just not be watching this, was I? It just didn't make sense. Yet, people kept leaving, should I leave? No, I have waited so long for this movie to come out, I should sit it out. There must be an explanation in the end. Then, the wtf moment when Kirsten Wiig appeared and she just felt so miscast in this miss. I'm not a fan of her, but it totally felt as if she just came from any other movie she made and just stumbled into this one.Somehow I have to give credits to this movie. Even though the images were grainy, some shots were visually stunning, some scenes were fantastically acted, some monologues were fantastically written.How to disappoint a fan? How to really be pretentious, even though I was ready to totally defend that? How to make a viewer feel so much emotions and not guide them into giving them a place while watching your work. How to abuse the art of movie-making? That last one is meant for a good reason, because making art is an art itself. you make it to make a statement, to evoke emotions, reactions, anything. But it only evoked anger, misunderstanding and for me sadness, because I can no longer just go to the cinema when another Aronofsky movie comes out. For one simple reason:How can this movie be unseen? I seriously wish I had never ever seen this movie. But that can't be taken away. So that's why I can only give it a 1 star rating. Even though the movie can be seen as art.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Everything but the kitchen sink.,"If you are debating whether to see this film, it is definitely worth a shot considering how many people absolutely love it because you might love it too! On the other hand, if you have the feeling Mother might not be for you given what you've already heard about it, then feel free to skip out because you're probably right.To start, everyone should go into this film expecting to be very uncomfortable. What you should not expect is a true horror movie like what it was advertised as. There is an excessive amount of religious symbolism within the film along with an added, mostly unnecessary, plot twist. Creators threw in everything but the kitchen sink.The best thing about the film is the camera work. The wide shots of the outside of Him and Mother's house showing how large it is followed by close-up shots of Lawrence's face as she walks around inside emphasize just how claustrophobic and constrained she feels throughout the movie. These shots do a lot to establish the atmosphere and are one of the more clever ways the director created a sense of unease and discomfort. Despite this and Lawrence and Bardem's performances, the film is still lacking because it tried to do too much.The audience is beaten over the head with the religious imagery. While it makes sense for God (Him) to be in control and drag Mother Nature (Mother) along for the ride and to have Mother's outbursts represent the way the natural environment reacts to being forcibly altered by humans (represented by the other characters destroying her home), it leans on the metaphor too hard. Mother's extremely passive personality and delayed reactions despite her clear exasperation may be representative of how Mother Nature - an inhuman force - rolls with the punches until being acted upon from the outside by irreparable damage, but they don't translate well to a human being.Lawrence's character is desperately uncomfortable with the actions of her husband and the other characters. When she snaps, she justifiably explodes, but it is obnoxious how much it takes for her to react. The intent is to show she is a force to be reckoned with when pushed too far, but given the way she practically cowers around Him and goes back to being complacent nearly immediately, she isn't believable as a personified character. Her complacency in the face of extreme situations is clearly meant to frustrate viewers but comes across as if the writer's desire to make people uncomfortable overtook the actual story. It also makes the film more inaccessible to many viewers who may not understand the ""deeper meaning"" of every moment, which is why so many viewers find the film to be pretentious.Without giving too much away, the added twist at the end was also unnecessary. It wasn't a bad ending, but the existential dread and the potential religious implications of the final minutes come across as another unnecessary metaphor since creators included everything but the kitchen sink by jam packing the rest of the runtime. Because the rest of the film beat the metaphor to death first, it could've simply ended after what Mother does when she reaches her breaking point without adding further symbolism. With that said, I do find the twist rather interesting, and the movie's final image adds to the broader impacts of Him's actions and is artfully unsettling, so it would've been a better movie overall if the rest of the religious symbolism weren't so severe, which would make the final seconds into an interesting, thought-provoking conclusion rather than just another way of making viewers uncomfortable.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

If you knew before you went in what this movie is supposed to be about and what it all means, you'd probably have a very different experience. Your experience watching it wouldn't be as nonsensical. But I'm glad I watched it knowing nothing beforehand.The whole thing is allegorical and everything in the movie is a metaphor. But I'll admit, I didn't realize what any of it meant while watching it. I had to look up the meaning afterwards and then it all came together, what the movie's story is alluding towards the whole time. Oooohh, of course, now I get it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A cause célèbre sprung out of this year's Lido island,"A cause célèbre in this year's Lido island, Aronofsky's MOTHER! has crushed and burned in its homeland's box office front and precipitated polarized reactions from both critics and audience, which is a usual given to galvanize a cinephile's interest.MOTHER! has a disguised threadbare set of components but its construct is vastly ambitious, even errs on the side it. It is set in a single location (an antiquated villa), in an indefinite space (the wilderness) and time (there is a telephone but no signs of cell-phones), score-free, no name is designated to its dramatis personae, (after checking online after), a married couple, Him (Bardem) and mother (Lawrence), is living in his family residence, Him is an acclaimed poet stuck in the writer's block and mother, decades younger than him, starts to re-decorate the house all by herself.Their placid domestic facade is disrupted by two interlopers, credited as simply man and woman (Harris and Pfeiffer), him, a gravely ill man with a wound in his rib (in a transient scene one can barely discern the locus of the wound), the signs are all over the place (only it is practically an incomprehensible task for an audience entering the movie with a tabula rasa): the biblical metaphor, which continues when later in the story, the man and woman are evicted by mother for breaking Him's precious crystal, following by their elder son kills his younger brother in an impulsive rage, now you can feasibly connect them with their unsaid names.Up to this point, Aronofsky has fervidly contrived a hybrid between a home intruder thriller and a haunted house horror (literally a beating heart within the walls has been presented more than once), and Jennifer Lawrence's heroine is the undivided cynosure of the story, often in jittery close-ups enclosed by a claustrophobic and dreadful palette. Heralded by the film's foreboding title card, motherhood is in the offing and Him regains his inspiration but all hell will break loose in the night when their baby is born, topping off with a disorienting, anarchic maelstrom with inarticulate transgressions. It is an ire-fanning third-act jam-packed with cult craze, frenetic editing and smothering pandemonium, until mother incinerates their domicile as the last resort and resets the Garden of Eden to the ground zero, an iteration of the film's gnomic prologue, displaced with a new mother.The parable is intentionally to be construed as how mother earth has been slowly encroached and finally destroyed by humanity's wantonness, but in hindsight, it is more revealing as a cautionary manifesto about a trophy wife, living under the throes of her husband's authority, habitually being neglected by him and treated like air by others, and her functionality is boiled down to either as a catalyst for his creativity or procreation, nothing more, and in the end of the day, she can be anonymously superseded by another young flesh, is this a feminist agitprop in disguise?Headlining by a solid star-turn from Jennifer Lawrence going down through an excruciatingly disturbing path of self-demolition and a dastardly Javier Bardem emitting increments of creepiness and noxiousness, plus an eye-catching menacing presence from a barnstorming Ms. Pfeiffer, this masochistic allegory is shunted to a less savory orbit by Aronofsky's abandon in his well- intentional ideology and a no-holds-barred modality (is that you Kristen Wiig?), when you make God acts like Satan, the ennobled epithet ""auteur"" is incontrovertibly degraded as ""provocateur"", thus, no universal acclaim can be garnered from that stigmatized word.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

There is no connection between the characters - even with ""Mother"" and her husband. The dialogue between them was almost non- existent and there was absolutely no chemistry among any of the characters.There is a lot of confusion about what is actually happening with all the various characters who show up until probably about the final 15 minutes; at that point, it went from the worst movie ever to a trip to Hell; this movie really crossed the line of decency as there are some things that just should never be in a movie.

If someone didn't like it they didn't get it,"I have seen and rated tens of thousands of films thru the years, but never before have I seen a movie with such a stark contrast between the lovers and the haters on IMDB. Which can be very confusing. For those who haven't seen the film yet who might do as I do and head to IMDB to read a few reviews before seeing a film, someone needs to set the record straight. It's true what other reviewers have said: those who are rating the film a 1 to 4 and just ""hated it"" either didn't get it, or they sort of got it but it insulted their religious views. Which ultimately still means they didn't get it. No, Mother! is not an enjoyable film to watch. It's not fun. It's not easy. But it is a thrilling and brilliant work of art. A true masterpiece by a real auteur at the peak of his game who took a major risk of boldness creating and releasing this nightmarish cinematic allegory to mainstream audiences. Of course it's being received with such controversial divisiveness. It simply isn't meant for mainstream folk. And that's fine. That's okay. Plenty of great art isn't.

"Not what I expected going in, but what a ride","Quite a lot has been said about Mother!, but what's most clear after seeing the film is that it knows exactly the type of film it is and what it's trying to say. People can say they're confused but dig a little deeper and the answer is there. So the question shouldn't be whether the film has specific themes in mind. It does, no doubt. The question should instead be whether the execution of those themes was successful. In my opinion, it is. Do I think it was a flawless film? I mean, obviously not. But at the same time I struggle to think of anything it did significantly wrong. The progression of slower- paced atmospheric thriller to full-blown horror insanity is very well done. The camera-work in the way its captures the singular perspective of the lead character is incredibly impressive, and the film continues to build its mystery throughout. It can get a bit repetitive, and I do think it could have been trimmed by about 15 minutes, but the film works spectacularly as a guessing game and then, once you've guessed it, works even better on a thematic and metaphorical level. The performances are splendid and fearless, with Lawrence showing all of us again why she became such a star in the first place, and the directing powerful. The screenplay very much works on a surface level, even if it isn't anything that is incredible, because everything it's representing is supposed to be under the surface (well, up until it's very much in your face about it). If there's one glaring flaw it is that the film's final minutes make everything incredibly clear and hammer the point home, but perhaps that's best for certain audiences. Overall, destined to be one of the most memorable films of the year and certainly another great horror film in a year already filled with them.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Great imagery, but subtext doesn't work","This movie has lots of great imagery and has some beautiful cinematography. And the big end set piece is interesting and well done and clearly has lots of effort put into it. And this movie is not afraid to ""go there"" and doesn't censor itself which I really respect.

It's basically just a re telling of the bible and it's very on the noise.

Science may resolve this,"Science tells us that the right brain, more dominant in some than others, accounts for peoples' understanding and appreciation of abstractions such as metaphor and allegory.

In any case, if I didn't get it, I'd be less inclined to accuse those who do get it of pretension and more inclined to learn what they see that I don't. That would be the left brain thing to do.

Easy to hate. Should you watch it?,"I think the biggest flaw of the movie was marketing it for a wide release. This is definitely a niche film. While it was plainly going to polarize audiences, I feel sad at the pure vitriol being leveled at it. So, if you haven't seen it, should you?First off, how you feel about Aronofsky in general is likely to color how you feel about this. If you find him indulgent and pretentious, this movie isn't going to change your mind. If you think he's a masterful auteur, you'll probably like this based on that. Is it pretentious and indulgent? Indulgent: yes. Pretentious: probably. I thought it was slightly, but YMMV.I feel like this movie needs the proper context, as it's going to have limited appeal. At its essence, it's a nightmare with a loose allegorical structure. It's essentially as close that Aronofsky has ever come to making a David Lynch film. The characters are unrealistic, there is a bit of a mixed metaphor and everything follows dream logic. What appeals to me about it is that while I like the aesthetic qualities of Lynch, it's always missing some thread of meaning outside of a few ideas. This movie fills that gap by hinging it on a classic story and an environmental lamentation.That's not to say, ""omg bro, it's super deep,"" but it keeps a straightforward structure to launch its assault of a nightmare. I did find it very visceral and off-putting. I like that in movies, and I felt at the end that it meant something instead of being a series of meaningless set pieces. While it didn't make me feel fearful or disturbed (like the trailer implied), it did make me feel very anxious and at points sad. I also feel like accusations of condescension and pretension are a little overblown, because DA has been very upfront and humble about what he was going for. Since before the movie was released. I feel like a lot of that is projected onto the film, possibly due to the misleading marketing, and preconceived notions of the filmmaker.So, this movie is not for most. Not because people won't get it (although, some haven't), but because it's a very specific sort of film. If you can stomach the indulgence and the detachment from reality (and can handle discomfort), I think it's worth a watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Interpretation and review.,"This review is going to be a long one of bare with me everyone, I'm starting off with just general things about mother! And then I'll share my interpretation.Mother! Really stressed me out more than any other film I've seen in recent years, the first half of this film is basically a recurring nightmare I've had, having strangers in my home is one thing but having them welcome themselves in like basically everyone does is stresses me out like nothing else. You can probably already tell, but I really hate social interaction and people in general.My one issue is that I think the CGI fire won't age very well as it doesn't look amazing as it is, it works for the time being, but I don't think it will hold up too well during inevitable rewatches. Other than this Mother! Is technically masterful. The cinematography is beautiful and colourful, but also very unsettling and claustrophobic. The editing gives the whole film, but the second half especially had such an urgent tone, something had to be done about the situation they were stuck in. That made me very anxious. The set design is some of the best I've ever seen. The sound design and sound mixing were also really good, I loved the piecing jabs that we sometimes hear. The overall production is just so well made, I can't get over it.Jennifer Lawrence was brilliant, my biggest worry going into this movie was Lawrence might not be good and it might be hard to separate the actress from the character. Luckily I had no trouble separating the actress from the character, she delivers one of my favourite performances of recent years. As usual Javier Bardem is great. Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer are also really good, everyone is fabulous including the extras.The final element of filmmaking I want to mention is the spectacular screenplay. It is so well written and obviously planned out by the filmmakers to make the best film possible. I can feel how much heart went into the production of Mother! And I'm so glad we still have people like Darren Aronofsky working in the film industry because of films like this one.Now onto one of the most complicated things I will ever explain in a review, so as you can imagine I'm not the most excited about writing this. I'm not even sure how I should structure this.If you have done virtually any research about this movie or are familiar with some biblical stories you will know about the biblical references riddled throughout. Javier Bardem's character, who I will simply be referring to as HIM or HE so this doesn't get too confusing, represents God. Jennifer Lawrence's character Mother and the house they live in represent mother nature. Ed Harris's and Michelle Pfeiffer's characters Man and Woman represent Adam and Eve, their kids represent Adam and Eve's kids Cain and Abel. I could go on there are a lot of these.I mentioned that HIM represents God, I believe this as all he cares about is that people love him. Even when Mother is begging for these people to leave their home HE doesn't want them to go, they love him and that's what HE wants. HE also doesn't die in the explosion at the end showing that he is some kind of supernatural being.Mother and the house represent mother nature as they are infatuated by HIM just as mother nature is infatuated by God, but the complete opposite of HIM. Mother is content being alone fixing the house forever even though she knows all of her efforts to bring life to the world are in vain as in the end it will be destroyed, but then again everything will be destroyed eventually. There are moments that suggest Mother and the house are one in the same, a few times Mother puts her ear up to the wall, closes her eyes and can see the heart slowly decaying over time, slowly decaying just as nature is and will continue to do. The house is the garden of eden which is why Mother never leaves it and cares so much when people come in without a care in the world and starts to destroy everything she worked so hard to create. Everybody loves and worships God over anything but he needs mother nature to continue the life cycle that suits him best. The life cycle where people will always take the easy way out by worshipping God and believe he will fix everything rather than making a difference themselves like mother nature.I've noticed a lot of people who have analysed this movie have overlooked the birds eye view shot of the house. It shows the house and vibrant nature surrounding it, until a certain point. Past this point everything is dead. To me this is showing the effects that the infinite cycle of destroying mother nature with zero repercussions has done to the world. Every time God/HE just resets and let's humans do it all over again they destroy everything more and more until eventually they end up in the house and destroy it, they eventually destroy the garden of eden and mother nature herself.Man represents Adam as he is the first person to enter the garden of eden, he is the first person to come into the house. He also has a scar on his back, the same scar Adam has after he gave up a rib to create Eve.Woman is Eve and the start of this cycle of destruction. She is the one to convince Adam to do the one thing they were told not to do, it is human nature to become curious and eventually rebellious no matter what the consequences are.The book the HE writes is the bible, this is supported by the way people talk about it. People feel as if it is written for them and everyone interprets in their own way, bad and good. Some believe they need to start rounding up people who don't believe what they believe and kill them, something that had been happening for a long time. Some believe they must sacrifice, some believe they must worship him and they will be rewarded in return. But the sad truth is that God does not care about any one of these people and they just want to feel as if they are doing something worthwhile with their worthless lives.The child is Jesus. Mother doesn't want to hand him over to God as SHE knows that HE will show him to his worshipers and knows that can not end well. Jesus was a gift to the humans from God in an attempt to save them, Jesus is killed and by most, at first at least, he is not respected. He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not - Isaiah 53:3. God trusts people to do good but instead they kill his son just as HE trusts his followers with HIS son and they kill him. Even after committing these heinous acts HE and God in the film and the bible forgive the people for what they have for the love him and that is what HE cares about.Like I said earlier it is human nature to take the easy way out by not respecting mother nature, in the end they die. This ties into the overarching themes of climate change and human nature. Humans don't respect the environment, some refuse to believe in climate change, some don't want to believe and some simply don't care. This could all be because it scares us, if we don't do something we are all going to die, we know this and people still decide they have better things to do, we need to start caring more about what matters for our children, for our grandchildren not just what matters for us in the present. Every cycle the Mother ends up dead, the house destroyed, the garden of eden destroyed... Nature destroyed and therefore humans destroyed.Mother! Is not for everyone, it's a lot to take in and feels like a nightmare. I have left out paragraphs and paragraphs of information I would love to mention but didn't. I grew up with one side of my family being cristian so naturally in when I was younger I had to go to church each week and I picked up a lot of biblical knowledge while I was there. A lot of the biblical references were very obvious to me on first watch and gave the already great experience another deeper layer. I apologise for the lack of structure and rambling nature of this review, honestly I'm not sure I could write a more structured review about mother!, it's so dense. You may have noticed my struggle to write reviews for more complex films if you read them you can really tell. I find it difficult to put my thoughts into words so writing a review like this one is very time consuming and taxing for me, it sounds daft but it's true. I first watched mother!

A claustrophobic and exasperating experience,"I chose this movie from my watchlist to end my day and I don't know if it was a good decision. Dark director Darren Aronofsky envisions a twisted, claustrophobic thriller that makes you experience it regardless of whether or not you understand the plot.I liked:The decision to follow the camera that at first confuses but is the idea, each time it makes you feel that woman who is invaded and cannot do anything or understand what is happening.An exquisite, detailed and direct script.The way of projecting the states of the protagonist, they were in a process in a growing and natural way.The decision of the cast, all great. Jennifer Lawrence is one of my favorite actresses regardless of what the industry says, this work shows how multifaceted she can be with an incredible performance that gave the thrilller a certain particularity. Throughout the course, she is in charge of carrying the anxiety and despair that worsens more and more, the last 30 minutes I suffered it.Javier Bardem as a superb and mysterious character who approaches him with a good naturalness.Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer simply amazing, impossible not to hate them.Aronofsky makes it clear that he takes psychological thrillers very well, I take advantage of all the resources mentioned before and more to make the viewer live a gloomy and despairing experience.The only thing that I did not understand so clearly is the metaphorical message, there are certain clues that they show during but that I cannot associate them in the course, although none of this ruins the great movie that it is.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Oh Brother,"I tend to enjoy things about movie like this. With movies like The Tree of Life or The Fountain (guess who was the director) I can find things about them.

The opening monologue of ""The way of nature versus grace"" speaks to me. How Darren Aronofsky can tell a story of a man coming to grip with the loss of his wife, so majestic and at the same time so simple.Then you have this tub of vomit telling the greatest story ever told. Its doing well for about a 2/5ths of the movie and it goes off the rails to the point of you actually can no longer follow it and don't care too. You just want it to end.

Insanity,"This is the first movie I have seen from the director Aronofsky but it assured me I will want to see more of his work.This was quite the movie. If anything it's been the most unique movie I have seen in years. The directing here is fantastic, but it is something not everyone may like on a technical level. Most shots are focused on the main character Mother, combined with long takes and a very zoomed in view of her face it can be incredibly dizzying or disorienting. I felt it a bit myself towards the end. You get no time to breath and take in the surroundings. The camera ''throws'' you around in the environment which is cramped and puzzling as is.The acting is phenomenal here. Really the core strength here for much of the movie. Though at some points i had issues with the writing for the character and her reluctant/muted behavior in certain scenarios.Pacing the movie gets going pretty quick, but then for me it hit a point where it was ''stalling'' around the hour mark. I think this movie would have benefitted a few cuts here and there to speed up the middle section.The overal story seems to hold many religious influences, but none of it was actually trying to recreate anything. But it felt very reminiscent at times with the adam and eve, Jesus's birth, Maria. But with a twist I guess, a much darker and weirder one.Time is not of importance to this movie, it will make you as confused as it can possibly can and soon you will understand to just ''let go'' and try to flow with the movie.Now seeing this marked as a horror seems a bit far fetched. As it is not a typical horror at. All. It's mostly a dramatic psychological thriller. If anything would be horror it would be *the* scene, you know it when you see it. But's it's one short snap.The lack of music throughout the movie (just a few sections but only in movie music) makes the movie a lot more tense and especially towards the end. Highly recommend a good sound setup because it's all about ambience.What it all meant, that's something to think about.

Then I considered he's a catholic director criticizing god for letting mankind do all the mess.I think it's both, he aims to shock both atheist and catholic audiences, maybe other religions too, on showing religion's paradoxes and how religious ppl insist on relying on their deities even when such deities don't (seem to) deserve it, while real things that we do rely on and which are great (Nature) are destroyed and desecrated.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
What a twisted Evil load of Crap AGAIN by Darren Aronofsky,"This film is an embarrassment to anyone paying good money to be entertained. Does Hollywood not get it? Darren Aronofsky is not good at writing or directing, his twisted ideas are not worth the time and money. Did no one learn from that ridiculous drug trip of a film ""The Fountain""? It is my understanding that Hollywood is a business. So why is it that they keep giving this idiot money to try and make money with a movie? The plot is thin, like it was written without any thought, overnight, just a bunch of malice towards good people! The acting is honestly campy and embarrassing. The plot is beyond any rational persons time. It is not entertaining, it is not good for anyone to watch, it is just another waste of good money. Money that could have gone to Hurricane victims instead of this writer Director! And Lawrence, what was she thinking? Did she even read the script before committing to it? I have lost faith that she understands what a good script is. She was lucky to hit it big, and now we have to endure her attempts at acting. If she was not so self righteous, and arrogant, she would be taken more seriously. But to align with this film... Obviously she knows she has no talent. It would also be nice to see an actress who is not so full of herself, and actually earn her stripes instead of just lining up for whatever film falls in her lap, no matter who she is sleeping with. Get a brain and get serious about your craft... and the business. Keep your mouth shut, select good scripts, and Earn your respect.

Set your expectations lower...no even lower.,"I went into mother with high expectations. Its a star studded cast with an incredible director and creative team behind it, but this show honestly sucked. It started out as a snooze fest. The cinematography was excellent and there were some creative shots, but for the most part it was pretty boring. And then came the house guests. Oh boy. The whole story line was just obnoxious. I hated every character. You have Michelle Phiffer who is a horrible human, Ed Harris who is off his rocker, and Jennifer Lawrence who plays the submissive housewife who takes all of their crap. She doesn't stand up for herself or to her husband and it drove me NUTS. I wanted to put my arms through the screen and shake Jennifer Lawrence the whole time and tell her to stand up for herself! After the house guests leave the story became absolutely crazy. Not crazy in a good way. Crazy in a ""why am I sitting here watching this film"" way. While I understood the film in the end, there was absolutely nothing redeeming or entertaining about this story line to me. About midway through the movie I turned to my friend and said ""maybe we should just leave"", but we decided to stay and I truly regret that decision. The last half of the movie was utter chaos with no light at the end of the tunnel. I felt this entire movie had no sense of direction. The ending was artsy, but totally bazaar and there was truly not a single moment of this film that I enjoyed. I didn't give it a 1/10 because of the cinematography and creativity, but if it weren't for those things this would have gotten a 1. I HATED it.

"A brilliant film, (that most of you will probably hate)","I don't think I've ever seen another film like this.
It should have it's own genre, as it doesn't really fit into existing genres well.
Oronofsky has created a work of genius here - an inspired and completely unpredictable work of passion. At first it just feels a bit surreal - just two characters somehow disconnected and relating awkwardly to one another in a quiet setting. Then the ride begins. I don't wish to spoil anything for anyone, you just have to sit back and let this one unfold, let go of expectations and preconceptions of how films should be experienced. Virtually none of the characters are likeable. They act obscenely toward others and treat the space their in without any respect. It's hard to identify with most of the characters, as they're not respectable, and act unconscionably. The vibe in this house becomes more and more dysfunctional and downright bizarre. It quickly shifts from uncomfortable to horrific. The behaviour's become more shocking and disturbing as the story develops. For me, parts of it were difficult to watch, whether I understood what was going on or not. 
This film is full of metaphors.The whole story has subtext that is as disturbing as what happens on the screen.It's not a film that's easy to like, simply because IT IS NOT ENTERTAIMENT.Most movies take you on either an emotional journey, or an adrenalin ride.This isn't meant to do either. It's not meant to sell popcorn.It's meant to make you think. 
If you can get past the difficulty of wanting to reject what you're seeing as simply absurd, implausible and surreal - you'll get to the point of it all.I personally was very moved by this film. There is a blatant attempt to make viewers consider the behaviours and actions, and recognize that, metaphorically, something is seriously broken and in need of our attention.I highly respect what the director/writer has done here. I wish more film makers would attempt to open our eyes to an important, bitter reality. Maybe awareness would make us embarrassed enough to think about making a change in our lives.

Abstract Thoughts and Analysis,"Full of spoilers.You see a death and then a rebirth. He puts everything back to the way that it was before each time the relationship fails. It might be a time loop but I'm thinking that it's a series of marriages. It's showing how someone can ruin one marriage after another. Jennifer is just one of the marriages in a series.Their marriage shows one very important thing - how relationships fail based off of different needs in the relationship. In this case, she's completely introverted and he's the opposite. The movie decides to put her in the focal point, showing us how disrupted her tranquil state is once outsiders invade. The celebrity of just one person in a relationship can be damning, therefore, we're shown how protective she is of him, then her baby and then when her baby is lost, all is lost and the relationship implodes. At the end, we see her charred body, he takes her love and recreates something else with it, it all starts over and the whole cycle begins again.It's all very abstract, very indirect and I could be completely off but the concepts are there, just displayed in the most mind-blowing way.

a movie to divide,"It really all depends on what you want out of a movie. even within the narrow confines of movies that work entirely on the basis of metaphor, do you want that metaphor front and center like this or do you like it lurking in the background as in most Kubrick films. i wanted to hate this movie going in, but found myself oddly enjoying it while still recognizing it's flaws. It's unbending fidelity towards being metaphorical, combined with it's inability to quite perfectly work out the kinks of that metaphor, and it's habit of taking it's self so seriously makes this a movie that would be perfect for Mystery Science Theater 3000 to lampoon. The whole thing hovers precariously on the precipice of total ridiculousness but in my opinion manages just barely not to go over the edge into farce.

"It is an allegory, but of what exactly?","In mother!, directed by Darren Aronofsky, a couple, played brilliantly by Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem, live in an isolated house, far from distractions so as to allow him to finish his next poem. Meanwhile, she tends to their house, wanting to make it into a paradise, in her own words. But then strangers start appearing on their doorstep and things spiral out of control.On a purely plot-level, the film juggles tropes and conventions found mainly in horror and drama genres. The imagery gets increasingly more gruesome, the unsettling feeling of having your home invaded is ever-present and the final third of the film ceases all attempts at subtlety, bombarding our senses with scenes so violent and out of the left field that you absolutely will leave the theater exhausted.And if that was all, I'd probably hate this film. Because it would lack meaning. It would simply aim to shock, to maim your senses of propriety and value.But the film is more than that. It shouldn't be seen as a straight and narrow story about a couple living through unexpected horrors. Rather it's a poem, an allegory about creation, about letting go and trusting your proverbial children to unknown masses. You need to think, who these two represent, what is the house, who are the strangers, why is he so accepting and why is she so guarded.And when it clicks, when you can examine the film through its intended allegory, it becomes quite something else altogether.mother! is not an easy film. And that is good. We need films like this to broaden our horizons. To break the borders of our thinking and force us to venture into paths not yet traveled.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Intense experience!,"I am shocked at the number of 1/10 reviews for this film, and not because I don't expect difficult films to be misunderstood by a lot of people, but because this is 1. a film by a director notorious for making films like this, and 2. because it's fairly obvious throughout that the film is not to be taken at face value. From the very first shots of the film we're told we're going to be dealing with heavy allegory and symbolism. If anyone didn't get that, it's entirely their fault. If anyone has seen any of Aronofsky's other films and expected something other than the type of experience this movie provides, it's entirely their fault.That's not to say you have to like or appreciate this film. But I see a lot of people who seem to dislike it because they didn't get it or thought it was pretentious. That's honestly lazy. Art is almost synonymous with pretense. I hate to be that guy, but if you can't handle that, you're best sticking with safe films that don't ever stray outside the surface level narrative comfort zone. God forbid anyone try to make a film that does something different, explores ideas through unconventional means. I think people want to have their cake and eat it too: they like the idea of films that are different but then when they actually see one that is profoundly different, their reaction is to say ""WTF, I want my 2 hours back!""Suffice it to say, this is a crazy film. I was really impressed with all aspects of the production. I honestly went into this expecting to hate it. As a full disclosure, I am definitely not a fan of Jennifer Lawrence. I find her to be one of the most overrated actresses of all time and I had yet to see her do anything that remotely impressed me. I won't say that I now love her, but she did really well here, as did the rest of the cast. The direction and staging of every scene is incredibly well done. The characters are all so adeptly calculated to be as loathsome as possible. Michelle Pfiefer's character in particular will probably just make you seethe with hatred every time you see her. And that's the point! On a certain level I understand why some people hate this movie, because it's supposed to frustrate you. If you can't get past that, then look elsewhere. If you are the kind of person who can really look through your reflexive reactions and see the intent of the film, know that it is trying to have a certain effect on you, and allow yourself to appreciate how well it is doing that, then this is probably your movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

This Film Is Bashed For No Reason & Left Me With A Pretty Good Experience,"I feel this film is given negative reviews for all of the wrong reasons.

Yes, there are a lot of confusing parts in this movie - a lot of things that you won't understand unless you put forth effort into discussion, research, and thought. This is obviously a highly symbolic and metaphorical film. I promise you that if you try, you will find meaning to the contents of this film. If you don't like what you find after that, only then will your review be valid in my eyes. The only ""fact"" you can go off of as to what the meaning of the film is and how that is portrayed is by what the director says - and quite honestly, that's also subjective. If you don't like movies that challenge you to think and in some cases come up with the meaning for things on your own, then this movie is not for you. Yes, this film can be frustrating to watch sometimes but the overall theme and general meaning behind it supports that beautifully if you actually think about it. For me, the movie was fairly enjoyable to watch. Some parts did irritate me because it simply got unrealistic and redundant. Also, the pacing of the film was a problem for me.

This beautiful and creative film does not need any more bad reviews. As an avid Shyamalan fan, having seen literally every one of his films, I'm used to being open to possibilities.Overall I was truly blown away by this movie. I gave it 8 stars, reducing a little for the roles of Mother and Him.

"The mother of all allegories goes slightly overboard, still creative and thought-provoking","One does not need any deep knowledge of Christian theology to see through the painfully obvious allegory of 'mother!'. As an allegory, it takes itself too seriously, so that every almost every action in the movie feels unnatural, and is not supposed to be taken on face-value but rather as a part of its metaphorical argument. This makes the movie highly creative and thought-provoking, but leaves no room for any realistic character development or plot. All the principal characters are also metaphors for specific qualities, so while their behaviors can seem one-note and jarring, they make perfect sense once you realize the underlying intent. As with any Aronofsky movie, this is not a cosy or comfort watch, and while there is an ominous undertone almost from the beginning, the movie explodes into a orgy of violence and destruction towards the end, albeit again with an allegorical intent.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Either preposterous nonsense or a cathartic masterpiece,"Darren Aronofsky's Mother!, or mother! as it is often printed, has already generated more controversy than most movies can achieve in an entire lifetime. A fever-dream of chaos, violence and nightmarish imagery, Aronofsky's latest seems to provoke extreme reactions from both sides of the spectrum. After its premiere at the Venice Film Festival, the film received both a standing ovation and a chorus of boos. Whether you love it, hate it, or simply cannot make up your mind, Mother! will be successful at yanking a reaction out of you, be it repulsion, confusion or laughter. Yet the biggest shock is not the orgy of brutality at the climax or the religious undertones, but that a major studio would ever fund this at all. Paramount were apparently convinced when star Jennifer Lawrence signed on, but there is little here for fans of The Hunger Games, and not much more for those hoping for a straight-forward haunted house flick.We open with a woman burning, before apparently jumping forward in time. The house in which the stranger met her demise has been repaired, and is currently being turned into a paradise by 'Mother' (Lawrence). She wants to shape the home into a place of tranquillity for her much older husband, 'Him' (Javier Bardem), an artistically-blocked famous poet who has failed to write any new material in over a year. Things seem peaceful, but something isn't quite right. The house is in the middle of nowhere, hidden away from civilisation, so Mother is shocked when a doctor - billed as 'Man' and played by Ed Harris - turns up at the door claiming to have mistook the house for a B & B. Mother wants to be left alone but Him seems eager for the company. It becomes clear than Man has no intention of leaving when his wife ('Woman', played by Michelle Pfeiffer) turns up at the door. She is obnoxious and rude, carrying a clanking glass and glazed eyes with her wherever she goes, and events start to spiral out of control when their bickering sons (played by Brian and Domhnall Gleeson) also show up.Things seem to calm down when Mother becomes pregnant, and the couple withdraw into isolation once again. Fatherhood reawakens the artist in Him, and he soon has a new book published. But this only starts to attract more outsiders, which rapidly turns from a small crowd of book fans to a hoard of crazies, who start to systematically destroy the house. Think Gaspar Noe meets some of Ben Wheatley's more extreme works and you can start to grasp the tone of Mother!'s climax. It's a clusterfuck of unpleasantness and claustrophobia, like a house party crashed by Satan himself. Aronofsky makes sure that you're uncomfortable from the very get-go, with camerawork nearly always from point of view of Mother, or directly in her face. Classic horror elements also establish feelings of unease, such as a bleeding floorboard, a dingy basement with a bricked-up wall, and a strange instrument heard through the walls with the appearance of a beating heart. Aronofsky possibly thinks he setting the audience up for the nastiness about to be inflicted on the heroine, but nothing could have really prepared me for the last 40 minutes.Mother! is one of only a few films I've really had to wrestle with. As I was watching, I felt disgusted, patronised, and in need of a good wash, and the end credits made me feel like I was exhaling for the very first time. As time passed, I could only admire the way in which Aronosky had forced such a physical reaction out of me, and the many ways in which the film can be read. Essentially it's a story of motherhood and creating a home for your family, but it also works as a religious parable, with certain characters clearly stand-ins for figures from the Bible. Most of all, this is an artist's reaction to terrifying reality of our times, with nuclear war, global warming and terrorism a constant threat, and dangerous, unpredictable leaders seated at the head of some of the most powerful countries in the world. The director himself stated that he woke up one morning and spilled out Mother! over the course of four days, and the film certainly reflects Aronofsky's urgent, scribbled approach. It's hard to recommend Mother!, but I would urge anybody to see it at least once. You may find it to be preposterous nonsense or a cathartic masterpiece, and you'd be right either way.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

What role God the director will leave for God the character. Being subjective critic of art created by an artist, here I feel frustration of the idea that writer of the film is the Poet and the audience is the Mother. It is a bit out of topic to put myself in the mothers shoes, but I just can neither stop questioning what director wants of me as a viewer (thats a rhetorically religious question and probably he does not want anything), nor stop loving the director and its work for bringing all the questions and the subject hopefully for the good/best...Thought by thought and now I am left with the confusing neutrality which might be the reason why so many of us decide to stay blind.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Spellbinding and highly creative piece of art,"Darren Aronofsky always turns heads whenever he releases a feature film. I can't believe that a completely original movie can still be made in today's Hollywood, it gives hope for the future generations of directors and producers. Aronofsky came after the contentious epic biblical film ""Noah"", which took heavy hits from critics, to regroup his efforts and give another stab at his creative nature, only to yet again be questioned by critics.""Mother!"" stars Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem as a couple living in a battered, run down house in the middle of nowhere. Bardem's character is a poet who is struggling with writer's block and is hoping to recover by moving to this old crummy house secluded from society. His wife decided to support him and starts renovating the house room by room, piece by piece. One day, a couple of strangers, Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer, knock on the door and they are let in without any second thoughts. From here on chaos slowly starts to ensure in ways that no one would suspect will carry on. 
The film starts slow, building up the tension of the main character's relationship, but after a third of the movie, things start to pick up and it is just spellbinding. There is about half an hour of non-stop madness that will leave you speechless, incapable of taking your eyes off the screen.All of the characters are unnamed, given just their position in the family, such a mother, man or son, leading to the impression of an eerie Garden of Eden setting, where later Lawrence would go on saying that her character is an allegory of Mother Earth and the film depicts the destruction of nature.The distinct sound editing makes ""Mother!"" an interesting piece of film. Aronofsky decided to scrap the original soundtrack after seeing a rough-cut without music and instead focused on set-sounds from the landscape.The filming also offered us a different camerawork approach from the norm involving heavily of close-ups that may leave you dizzy when watching it on a big screen.""Mother!"" is controversial though-provoking film with deep philosophical and biblical undertones that should not be missed.

Pretentious twaddle,"Aronofsky has said that he wrote this film very quickly. It shows. The intriguing set-up: a blocked writer and his young wife are trying to create an artistic oasis for themselves, but are visited by random strangers, falls to pieces very quickly. Jennifer Lawrence is compelling, as always. In fact, each of the four main actors are solid and much of the movie is beautifully filmed,particularly the dizzying use of hand-held or close-up tracking cams.

"A Strange, Unsettling Horror That Doesn't Quite Work","As someone who admires Darren Aronofsky as a director, I was looking forward to this highly unconventional but deeply disturbing psychological horror. While the film is surreal and shocking, it unfortunately does not quite all hold together. It ends up being something that seems to lack a clear meaning as well, which is disappointing given that it is directed by a highly respectable auteur.The film is essentially the twisted story of a husband (Javier Bardem) who is a writer, and her pregnant wife (Jennifer Lawrence.) To say anything else more could possibly reveal spoilers, and you don't want to walk into this movie knowing what's going to happen. All I will say is that the story gets increasingly more outlandish, surprising, and violent. The film's acting is uniformly strong across the board, with great lead performances by Lawrence and Bardem as well as considerable strength in the acting quality of major supporting characters. Michelle Pfeiffer is particularly strong here. The film is filmed nicely, with a thoughtful and commendable mix of wider and narrower shots.Unfortunately, as the story gets more over-the-top and outlandish, the viewer's interest in the film begins to wane. The increasing ridiculousness of the plot completely lacks any sort of point, and just when you think it can't get any stranger, it does--but once again, without any point! As a result, you leave the film thinking ""what was that?"" This feeling is particularly heightened by the lack of attachment or emotional response towards any of the characters--let alone empathy. As a result, the film's sheer outrageousness will linger in your mind--but nothing else about it will. This isn't a terrible film by any means, but it's unfortunately a bit of a disappointment. I don't regret seeing it per se, but wish I had gone to ""Brad's Status"" or ""It"" instead. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A very good scary movie if you want to view it as just that,"Mother! is a psychological horror film written and directed by Darren Aronofsky. The movie is about a married couple living in a secluded country home being visited by strangers with the husband welcoming them in with open arms, much to the chagrins of his wife. The film has similarities with another movie of Aronofsky's, Black Swan, in that both are told through psychologically worn out female protagonists' eyes, forcing the audience to walk in her shoes and question their own sanity as the madness unfolds. Mother! has been extremely divisive since its release due to its controversial allegory and graphic content. To be honest, the popular interpretation of the metaphor did not even cross my mind once when I was watching, instead I took the movie for face value and it still had me enthralled, uneased and disturbed throughout. I believe if you go in to the movie having read about the supposed metaphor, it would greatly bias your opinion and affect your viewing experience, for that reason, I am going to review Mother! as a pure horror film to 1) avoid spoilers and 2) be objective.Mother! is very gorgeous-looking and wonderfully-acted. The film might be slow to some, but it is never boring as the situation is always building towards something keeping you captivated. It is a very strange and surreal film told through Jennifer Lawrence's eyes. We do not know much about her except she is married to Javier Bardem's older character, but as the film establishes early on, Lawrence is possibly the sanest thing in the film. The camera literally follows her everywhere in the house, which we never get to leave, creating a sense of dread and claustrophobia. The first half of the film has mostly psychological horror, with Lawrence having to deal with unruly guests with unpredictable behaviors and her slowly deranged husband. I was intrigued at frame one and found myself gripping on my seat whenever Lawrence is in confrontation with anybody, even if it is somebody that logically should pose no real danger, but the film causes you great doubt regardless. The second half contains most of the controversial visceral horror, and detailing anything therein would constitute as a spoiler so I am just going to say: viewers discretion is advised. It gets really insane and crazy to a point where you will just be dying to know how it ends.Technically the film is excellent. The cinematography brings the creepy house to life and the sound design is harrowing. The film captures the fear of being alone in your own house but not knowing if you are truly alone very well. Jennifer Lawrence gives the best performance I have ever seen of her yet; she touched the notes of vulnerability and weakness, loving, reluctance and then finally anger and contempt. Since she gets close to 100 percent screen time, any sort of hiccups or off- night would have put the film in jeopardy, but she brought it every second. Javier Bardem as the husband was wonderful as always, performing like the world-class actor he is.There are some negative though, namely some pacing issues, particularly it being a little too long and dragging towards the middle, repeating certain situations over and over again. I just want to wrap my arm around the director's shoulders and tell him, ""I get it buddy, the guests are rude, and she's vexed, now can we just move on?"" The whole thing should have been shaven down to a leaner 90 minutes, which would have been sufficient to tell this story. Also a lot of weird things happen unexplained and never expound upon. I guess this feeds into the film's interpretational and allegorical approach, but also kind of lazy as it theoretically gives Darren Aronofsky the right to just throw in any bizarre content in the cauldron he can conjure and not have to worry about explaining it.Mother! is a very good scary movie if you want to view it as just that. When you start to unravel the film and break it down, that is when objectivity usually gets thrown out the window in favor of own personal beliefs. Even if the metaphors are what Aronofsky intended, within the film itself it was never stated as canon, so everything is still just an interpretation and what is most important is what you choose to see the movie as. As a superficial psychological horror flick, it worked because it was scary, disturbing and jaw-dropping like a genre film should be.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Aronofsky and his cast created a work of art, and art is not necessarily pleasant, easy or comfortable, but it is fulfilling, both for the artist and the observer, who through the communication of art can become as one mind, as one soul, as one heart.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Well... that was interesting,"Mother! is... what is it exactly? That's the question. It's basically an allegory, so one could argue none of the film's events are real. It's nothing like anything Hollywood has put out in the last... well, have they ever done this? I won't say anything about the plot; all I will say is that if you're expecting a home invasion horror film... denied! This is a singular artistic vision from Darren Aronofsky, boasting dazzling close-up based cinematography, incredible acting (Though Javier Bardem's character felt a bit underwritten and wasn't the best use of his talents), thought- provoking themes and utterly bonkers storytelling throughout. I won't lie; it's often tedious, highly self-indulgent, completely ridiculous and not always massively enjoyable. But do you know what? That's fine. I quite like Mother. It's an intelligent, sometimes powerful and clever (To some extent) allegory, although the limited nature of its narrative would make a second viewing somewhat unappealing. It might not be enjoyable, but it is certainly very well-made and I think that if you go in knowing what to expect, you'll be able to appreciate this more. It's got enough visual dazzle and Jennifer Lawrence's usual awesomeness to keep the film afloat. It's also got one of the most messed-up scenes in any recent mainstream American movie... so there's that.6/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Trump Towers,"For me a film directed by Darren Aronofsky is very much event cinema and much of my admiration for him is the way he divides critics. He is a director with unlimited talent and absolutely no shame and for that alone he deserves much credit . On the surface MOTHER! seems to be a mystery drama involving a home invasion of sorts. However the way both the critics and the mainstream audience have reacted to its release gives a clue that you're not going to be seeing a mainstream thriller. We are after all watching a film by AronofskyOne vocal criticism is that MOTHER! drowns in its own obsession with metaphor and allegory. Again this shouldn't be taken as a negative point. For much of the early part of the film we have something not too far removed from other home invasion movies where a couple take in a stranger and the stranger isn't who they seem. The plot turns start coming very thick and fast and before you know it the film has mutated in to something else very quicklyThere's a downside to all this and that is that it stops being in anyway realistic . Okay you can excuse Javier Bardam's ""Him"" naive stupidity in order to set up the story but there has to be a limit and Aronofsky doesn't do limits so you have been warnedOne gets the feeling that it's an extension of the director's previous film NOAH where these nasty human beings are destroying mother Earth but equally you can jump to the conclusion that it's a metaphor for America under the Trump presidency. Of course the production dates make this very unlikely but the constant conflict between Mother and Him as to letting strangers in to the house does strike a cord and perhaps in the future this film will be remembered as a social comment on America in the early 21st Century ?

Director Aronofsky clearly favors extreme close-ups which are effective in creating a palpably tense and claustrophobic atmosphere, before eventually spiraling into an ugly, interminable abyss of madness and despair. Bardem, Harris, and especially Pfeiffer are all convincing, but this is Lawrence's show and she gives the kind of gut-wrenching performance that echoes the very reaction of the audience. Fluctuating between riveting, confounding, and downright appalling, the gamut of emotions on display here are simply exhausting, but buried somewhere beneath all the mishmash and chaos there are some poignant allegorical themes...deciphering them is not a task everyone is likely to embrace.

Anyways, here's what I thought of Darren Aronofsky's ""mother!""Like others have said, this movie is what it would be like to watch a nightmare unfold in the third-person. In fact, as I'm sure most people know, around 80 minutes into the film, the up-until-this-point relatively held-back narrative descends into what I can only describe as a no-holds-barred fever dream for the remaining 40 minutes. All of the performances are great, particularly from Jennifer Lawrence and Michelle Pfeiffer. The direction and cinematography are great (as one has come to expect from a collaboration between Darren Aronofsky and Matthew Libatique). So many shots in the film are very up-close in the actors' faces and it really helps establish a feeling of claustrophobia and anxiety, as well as the invasion of one's privacy (which obviously echoes Mother's predicament in the film). There's a few technical things, particularly some of the editing, that I think could've been executed better, but overall it's still phenomenal.Overall this is one of Aronofsky's best films and if you enjoy films from surrealist directors such as Lynch, Jodorowsky, etc., then I highly recommend you check this movie out.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

There is no way one could minutely believe this movie, how it had such high rating makes me wonder what the IQ was of the people who gave this high marks or wrote this garbage. 
In order to like this movie you would more than have to suspend belief, The plot is utter madness. This movie is a prime example of why I have been driven to cast aside all Hollywood movies. The writing is atrocious there is no rhyme or reason to this .This movie says absolutely nothing.It just goes to show no matter how much money you put into a piece of trash, it is still trash. Waste your time at your own peril. This was my last attempt to watch anything made by the brainless Hollywood bunch.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
God,"I can't believe that people don't see the parody here in this movie between God and his relationship with mankind. Evil is always trying to take over his world while God continues to try to help and even gives his son up in the process. In the end, everything is destroyed but God tries again.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The film was released in a prominent style by Jennifer Lawrence,Jennifer Lawrence is the only actress in the film who has been in the making of the movie. It is a great way to think about the story of the movie ... the dialogues of the film are very low. Most tell you about Jennifer Lawrence Inaya the upper hand ... Some scenes are not clear The film is left with an impermeable and Untraceable...,,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Culmination of Aronofsky's Works,"'Mother', the latest film from Darren Aronofsky, starts off with an enigmatic shot of a scene near the end of the film, before we're introduced to a couple who live in a house, Mother (Jennifer Lawrence), and Him (Javier Bardem), an artist struggling with writers block. One day somebody comes into the house, and this creates a divide between Mother and Him, pulling them further apart as the film progresses. Darren Aronofsky has described his film as a roller-coaster ride, focusing on the slow, steady climb, which is the gradually mounting dread and unease, before plummeting straight down in its final act, which is an explosion of frenzied insanity, chaos, and destruction. This film also leaves a lingering impression, both on the surface level and the underlying ideas it expresses, and in way, it's the kind of film that begins when it's over, shifting in your mind to become something different than what you experienced in the cinema, and we don't get too many films like that these days.For all the the comparisons that could be made with the early work of Roman Polanski, such as 'Repulsion' and 'Rosemary's Baby', 'Mother!' has no subtlety or restraint, no basis in character, psychology, or realism, instead opting for a freak show of garish, grotesque, extreme, and visceral excesses. The film only ever relents as a ruse, before thrusting us back into a nightmarish and unbearable insanity that is at once outrageous, exhilarating, and horrifying, displaying ghastly extremities of human behaviour, and a boundless energy and imagination that never once opts for the predictable, only the inevitable, continually pushing as far as it can be taken, even crossing the line, and proceeding to go further. It has the same frenetic intensity as the final montage in 'Requiem for a Dream', combined with the biblical mythology of 'Noah', the ambitious grasping's of 'The Fountain' and 'Pi', and the delirious insanity of 'Black Swan'. In a sense, this feels like the inverse of that films suggestion of the protagonists struggle with mental illness, instead depicting the rest of the world as insane, while our titular character Mother represents the order trying so desperately to hold it together.The film works on multiple levels, as a blackly absurd farce, feverish nightmare, home-invasion thriller, and eco-parable. The characters aren't realistic or believable, but symbolic, which works for what the film's trying to achieve, and leads into the endless amount of interpretations and layers of meaning one can extrapolate from this film, which can leave one thinking and debating long after it's over, as well as stick with you for days, weeks, months, years even. It addresses terrorism, refugees, police brutality, imprisonment, marital breakdown, celebrity, martyrdom, biblical mythology, climate change, politics, artistic inspiration, and I'm sure it doesn't end there. This is a film with such ambitious aspirations, yet distills it into one location, and mostly into the final act. The films extremities and absurdities reflect the state of the world in a way only great surrealism can. This is a film that can stand alongside the great surrealist work of Buñuel, Cronenberg, Gilliam, and Lynch, that keeps pushing the boundaries, and is uncompromisingly the work of a singular vision, which is especially an achievement given it's such a mainstream film.This film demonstrates Darren Aronofsky as a provocateur and showman as much as an artist, seeking to divide people, rouse controversy, stir strong reactions, and get people talking about it, and that in itself is admirable, even necessary, especially in a world with so many safe and pandering blockbusters. Moreover, Darren Aronofsky strikes me as someone who's gotten all this anxiety, frustration, and negativity off his chest by writing it all down and filming it. That's what art can do, give you permission to confront the deepest darkest aspects of the psyche, and healthily relinquish it. Therefor Aronofsky comes off as calm and reasonable, with strong ideas of what the film's about, but open to anyone's interpretations. 'Mother!' Is a film that works on both a visceral and intellectual level, a roller-coaster ride of insanity that provokes thought and discussion, that mingles spine-tingling excitement with ghastly shocks and underlying anger about the state of the world, whilst pushing the envelope and bringing an individualist sensibility to a mainstream movie. This is a film I imagine will stick with me for a long time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The only emotion it stirred was boredom,Generally Art House films leave me cold because of their pretentious nature. At least normally we're spared them because they're relegated to the Film Students circuit. One for art house junkies only - be warned it is not a horror film.,1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Unique and exhilarating experience,"I can see why the film is so polarizing. For me, it was awesome. Jennifer Lawrence did the best acting that I've ever seen her do. Everyone else was good but she was definitely the star of this show. After watching the film I read the explanations for the movie - I encourage people to read up after the film, you will learn something about the incredible experience you just had.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
It's an experience!,"Well it's... weird, different, allegorical, disturbing.. is it also good? Maybe, not sure! I had a giant headache while seeing it plus it's really quite weird..",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A REQUEST TO ALL MOVIE REVIEWERS: Please be Truthful and Accurate!,"Movies, like all types of art and entertainment, are subjective. Different people like different movies. But sometimes a truly lousy movie is made. A lousy movie that the producers simply put no effort in developing, researching, writing, directing, used cheap sets, props, photographic & sound equipment, or wrote a rambling senseless script and screenplay. Most people will complain about that movie. But a few people will say just the opposite. They'll call it wonderful, beautiful, and use the word 'masterpiece' a lot, and give it a very high rating. Then they'll quote a lot of artsy, religious, or psychic words sounding very ambiguous and complicated. These people often do this to impress others, to make people think that they possess some special art talent or perception. This makes them feel intelligent, and sometimes, for the first time it sets them apart as special, makes them feel important. But it makes other people feel angry, because people don't like to be told nonsense, or told lies. Maybe you do this. Maybe people do this for attention, or maybe just to downright cheat us and sell us a cartload of manure. I wonder if they even realize that sometimes the cart really can contain just manure. Because we certainly know lousy movies do exist. Those people may simply not have the ability to judge, and may not have much of an understanding of reality, film production, or art.When we go to a movie theater, or purchase a DVD, or buy a pay-per-view movie, we can't get our money back if the movie is lousy. And worse, we can't get back the time we've wasted. This, again, makes people angry. No one likes to get cheated, and NO ONE likes to be told lies.So, to the people who post glaring reviews, often containing the word 'masterpiece', for movies that most people find outright dreadful, I ask you to try to be realistic. And TRY to be TRUTHFUL. Because the time may come when a load of manure is delivered, and you tell us its chocolate, you might be asked to prove it by eating it.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
