Very good...,"""Deja Vu"" is a Crime - Sci-Fi movie in which we watch an A. T. F. Agent trying to find who is responsible for a ferry bombing in New Orleans. He uses surveillance technology to investigate and find the bomber.I liked this movie because it was full of suspense and its plot was very interesting and unexpected at many moments. The direction which was made by Tony Scott was very good and he presented very well his main characters while he succeeded on creating a mysterious atmosphere and make the audience feel it. The interpretations of Denzel Washington who played as Doug Carlin, Jim Caviezel who played as Carroll Oerstadt and Val Kilmer who played as Agent Pryzwarra were very good. In conclusion, I have to say that ""Deja Vu"" is an interesting movie and I recommend it to everyone.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Illogical But Entertaining Enough,"Continuing my plan to watch every movie in Denzel Washington's filmography, I come to Deja VuIf you can get on board with a lot of the technology (the ability to watch the past, through walls with audio) and time travel aspects, a lot of fun can be had with Deja Vu.It's totally illogical, with incomprehensible definitions of how things work, and I still don't know how many time lines there were, but I recommend turning your brain off and just going with it, as it is entertaining, enough.'Deja Vu grossed $64 million at the domestic box office and was the 42nd highest grossing movie of 2006.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
See Deja Vu... twice (har har),"First glance of Déjà Vu's DVD cover presents what appears to be another action flick with a bunch of good looking people looking too cool for school. Not that there's anything wrong with that, they can't all be ""Agent PW"" (Peewee Herman), but with the oversaturation of such action flicks it's easy to let one slip past you. Then I noticed who directed this film: the late, great Tony Scott.Tony Scott committed suicide by jumping off a bridge in 2012. We'll get to that in a minute. First let's go back in time, as this movie does (speaking of which, here's all you need to know about Déjà Vu's plot in 1 sentence: the movie opens with a tragedy in the first 5 minutes, and the remaining 121 minutes take our hero on a wild ride to unravel the truth and possibly... change it?).Tony Scott, younger brother of Ridley Scott (""Alien"", ""Blade Runner"", ""Prometheus""), was just as stylish and atmospheric with his films. Although best known for the more mainstream ""Top Gun"", ""Days of Thunder"" and ""Beverly Hills Cop II"", he first turned heads with his phenomenal debut ""The Hunger"", which was to vampire flicks what Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" was to scifi flicks. It brought a degree of sobriety and realism to a genre dominated by fantasy and cheesy special effects. Or in other words: ""sh!t gets real.""Here in Déjà Vu, we get the same sober treatment of ""time travel"" movies. It's not just Marty McFly flooring a suped up Delorean and cruising into the past. Rather, we are presented the somewhat credible idea of being able to observe the past in real-time, similar to the way our telescopes allow us to observe the past of stars unfolding in real-time even though they have burned out billions of years ago. That's about all we get as far as explanations which I think is good. Nobody wants to spend 15 minutes talking about flux capacitors and stuff when people are about to get killed.The action doesn't let up for a single moment. That doesn't mean that there are continuous car chases and shootouts, but what I mean is that there's a thick air of tension that Tony Scott achieves even during quiet moments because there is always a sense of impending peril. Take the opening 5 minutes, for example. Even if you hadn't read the IMDb description (which I always advise people not to!) and even if I hadn't told you that there's a tragedy in the first 5 minutes, you can feel something is going to happen because that's what Tony Scott conveys to us from the 1st frame.A quick word about the acting, even though it should be obvious with Denzel Washington: fantastic. He reprises his signature action role of a loner who's somewhat cynical but not above showing tremendous humanity and compassion in addition to explosive outbursts. He also adds some great comedic moments, although most of the film's comic relief is handled by the excellent Adam Goldberg (remember Chandler's psycho roommate for 3 episodes of ""Friends""?) who plays the fast talking, sarcastic, pop-culture-quoting computer nerd ""Denny"" who throws out zingers referencing everything from ""Saturday Night Live"" to ""Airplane!"" Now back to director Tony Scott and his suicide (you thought I had forgotten).The undisputed power of this film is carried by its mystery. I'm not just talking about whodunnit, but more importantly: whydunnit? Powerful themes of fatalism vs. free will, acceptance vs. action, and even a tasteful dose of logic vs. spiritualism are thrown at us around every corner. The result is a thriller where we can't figure out the director's strategy or motive until the very last scene. Some filmmakers are somewhat predictable (you always know Disney will end happy, you always know John Carpenter will end with a few gallons of blood). But here Tony Scott plays with his cards so close to his chest, and not only that but he fakes us out quite a few times, that your fingernails will be deeply imprinted in the armrest of your chair or the flesh of the unlucky person sitting next to you. And isn't that how Tony Scott left this world? An unexplained suicide (although some family members mentioned a secret battle with cancer, the coroner's official report showed no cancer, no serious medical conditions), the only thing that everyone could agree on was that Tony's leap from the bridge was ""inexplicable"". Who knows, maybe watching this film will give you some insight into the mind of the great director. Perhaps coincidentally, a bridge figures into this movie as a prominent symbol.Who knows, maybe you just wanted to watch a run-of-the-mill action flick with a bunch of good looking people looking too cool for school. But there's so much more here. Déjà Vu will definitely make you do a double-take.",,Anonymous,Crime
Tremendously enjoyable,"I had never heard of this movie, but it appeared on cable and when I saw the cast, I figured ""how bad could it be?"". I thought it was terrific. Nothing of great dramatic or historical significance, of course, but who cares? Denzel is his usual infinitely watchable self, Val Kilmer is quirky with yet another interesting dialect and Adam Goldberg is fantastic. All three are smooth, assured and entertaining. A lot of posters and reviewers talked about how ""unbelievable"" the science fiction aspect of the plot was, but that never bothers me. Once I figure out what I'm supposed to suspend my disbelief about, I just do so and enjoy what the filmmakers are doing. I actually found this particular sci-fi plot quite intriguing and really liked having to try to follow its twists and turns through the action.As has been said before, this is definitely a Sci Fi/ Film Noir/Action/Romance. How many of those have you come across? Highly recommended. Big fun and smart besides.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Delightfully intricate,"Deja vu is one of those intricate action thrillers that requires a bit of faith and attention, but it does it so well. The cast is outstanding, each playing their part with depth. The storyline is well developed and plays out in an interesting and exiting way. This is by far my favorite Denzel movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Near perfect hi-concept Hollywood sci-fi fantasy hero film,"The reason I waited a few years to do this review is that I wanted to see the film a few times - something that reviewers should consider before dashing off a critique.I have seen Deja Vu four times top to bottom and my comments:1. Near perfect hi-concept film. Involves sci-fi, time travel, detective work, etc. But when push comes to shove it is about connection and saving the person you love.2. Technically flawless. Well written. Great acting. And with Denzel holding the camera scene to scene even if there were some flaws, you would not notice them anyway3. I will be honest. The picky reviews bother me because the purpose of the IMDb is to create a record for viewers of the futures, not a whine fest for reviewers of the present. I am a film buff (see my other reviews) and I tried to make a list simply of other films in this category, yet alone films that are this good. Maybe a dozen tops in the last 100 years. Which means that films like this are rare and when a good one comes along you treasure it, not belittle it.Highly recommended. Hi emotional impact. A feel-good film.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
U can save herDéjà Vu,"It's a real shame that everything I had read about Déjà Vu concerned the high-powered explosions and loud clatter of guru/producer Jerry Bruckheimer. No mention, except maybe as a footnote, was given to A-list director Tony Scott and the magic he has woven in his past three films. The man who brought us Top Gun has seen a sort of revival in style lately with the entertaining Spy Game, the amazing Man on Fire, and the kinetic Domino. Scott has taken the quick cuts of music videos and has infused them into his shooting style. His editor better be making some good money as these films fly by with filters, jump-cuts, grain, and camera angles swiveling at every turn. Greatly overshadowed by brother Ridley Scott and his more serious, award-winning epics, Tony has been pumping out some of the most solid and entertaining films of the past couple decades. With a reuniting of semi-regular star Denzel Washington, Déjà Vu proves that when Bruckheimer is paired with a like mind, his usual drivel can become great. Scott shows us how to hone the explosions, noise, and clutter to an effective level and gives us a helluva ride.Déjà Vu could have easily reduced itself to timetravel farce, going by the books to show a time warp in order to solve a crime. The far-fetched premise of being able to see the past as it happens four and a half days later should seem crazy and by watching the previews you are given the idea that it will be just a series of do-overs. Fortunately the trailers these days show a totally different movie than what has been crafted. Scott and his screenwriters have not only developed a sci-fi tale seeped in enough reality to at least be looked upon as plausible for the sake of the story, but they nicely tidy up any chance of their being a plothole. Our story begins with a devastating domestic terrorist act upon a ferry carrying over 500 people, Navy and family. Washington's ATF agent is brought in and discovers that it was no accident. Intrigued by the efficiency he displays, an FBI agent, played with nicely effective restraint by Val Kilmer, calls him in to check out a new toy they have to find who the perpetrator is. During the use of this screen of the past, Denzel acquires a feeling of obligation to do all he can to prevent what he sees from occurring in the present, no matter what consequences that might entail for the future. The quest to stop the violence begins with an attractive young woman who unknowingly has become an integral part in what will ultimately transpire.The beauty of this film is that with multiple timelines being shown parallel to each other, there are many questions that desperately need answering. To credit all involved, they appear to have put themselves in the audience's shoes and piece-by-piece wrote in a reason for everything. Anything that is seen either in the past, present, or future has a reason for being there and will be intelligently explained. Also, the performances are stellar, Denzel and Kilmer as well as a quietly maniacal Jim Caviezel and the emotionally exasperated Paula Patton, and the visuals unique. While Scott has toned down the ultra-kinetic cuts and filters for the main action, his style is still stamped on the graphics of their screen showing the past. The motion trails and speed scans lend a stylized digital editing program feel and are gorgeous to watch. Déjà Vu's best sequence, however, is the crazy car chase during the present in pursuit of a vehicle in the past, definitely a rush and orchestrated almost flawlessly. Even though Ridley gets the accolades and Tony gets the hack/overproduced label, I must say, while they are the best directing duo in Hollywood, I might have to give the edge on pure cinematic entertainment to the younger Tony. He is on a roll and doesn't seem to be stopping anytime soon.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
A hot mess,"Denzel's great and all but there are more holes in this than Swiss cheese. I didn't mind suspending disbelief for the main premise, but the film just kept piling it on, culminating in (but certainly not limited to) the ludicrous scene in the woman's apartment (why would he be wasting time, why would he bring her to the ferry, why would he not call it in, etc). Don't expect to think too much, or at all really. On top of that, this thing is primarily slick Hollywood shlock, complete with a voyeuristic scene of the woman in the shower after 500+ people have died, a car chase instigated for nonsensical reasons, and more big explosions than actual science fiction. Meanwhile Denzel's character does every damn thing, limiting all of the others. Just a complete hot mess.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
Denzel's most driven performance?,"I've seen countless Denzel movies. I've seen Training Day, Bone Collector, Fallen, etc. You take his best action flick and pit it against his best dramatic flick. It doesn't matter the genre, Denzel can't make a bad film. It doesn't matter the demand, Denzel's emotion exceeds your expectations.From most of his films, I've seen, Denzel plays some form of a federal agent or police officer. In this film, while Denzel shines with the rays of the sun, Adam Goldberg, Val Kilmer, James Caviezel, and Elden Henson also perform vigorously in supporting cast.I especially enjoy the fact that Denzel can go from antagonist Alonzo Harris (Training Day) to protagonist Detective John Hobbs (Fallen) to protagonist-antagonist John Archibald in John Q to this powerful performance of protagonist Doug Carlin. Then you have James Caviezel who can play a protagonist in Frequency (2000) to this antagonist.It's plot is something to behold, most of all. When it comes to time travel it's one of the top things to discuss about movies. When you finish (and even during in some cases) you can't help but talk about the dilemma of going back and changing something for better or worse.I know that it's fictional, but it's fantasy and I allow for it because at least the screenwriters have tried to connect realism to their storytelling. With the actors showcased, you can't help but be grabbed and dragged into this spellbinding tale about a hero.It's been four years since my first viewing of Deja Vu and yet this second viewing is better. After watching over two hundred films or more between the first and second viewing, I think it's hard to remember every little detail about the great masterpiece of cinema that it is.While it's rating is PG-13, I think that children should avoid this simply because it's disturbing and this is a type of film where you have to think while watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"A decent thriller with the right amount of twists in it, yet an amusingly corny packed ride","This movie was pretty much what I expected. Nothing too serious, just a fun ride from the beginning till the end. The plot has this good twist in it, which makes the movie interesting and there is overall pretty much the right amount of sci-fi and thriller blended together.What to expect from a movie produced by Jerry Bruckheimer? Explosions, gun fights, car chases and over the top dramatized scenes. Well, that's pretty much what you get from Déjà Vu. The movie's enjoyable, but like said before, it's nothing too serious. Denzel Washington is entertaining as usual, a right man for the role indeed. Don't expect this movie to contain any phenomenal role performances, as that is really not the case when it comes to movies like this one. This is just another perfect example of a movie which is only made for entertaining purposes. If you want to see this and you see this, it's what you expect it to be, nothing more or nothing less, you finish the movie with that usual smile on your face. Your entertain level is satisfied.The movie's a big cliché overall, quoting myself on what said before; Over the top dramatized scenes. I mean, it's so predictable. The cinematography almost does that all for you; Fast forwarding, slow motions, shaking the camera, the screen flashing white every now and then.. I could go on and on, but oh well, you get the point. That is sadly pretty much what the cinematography always does in these kind of movie nowadays. It's like every possible way of cinematography is already used before and no-one tries to make anything unique anymore. You could always just cut down the cliché(ish) ways and keep it simple and normal. Well, then the movies like these wouldn't actually be movies like these, so the cinematography does what it's supposed to do after all. You can't complain about that, now can you? The music is also used to make it more over the top and it's just a bunch of corny compositions put together to make the movie more emotional, but for me it's more like a bad joke. Overall the music is also so predictable, giving a random example of that; ""Now he sees a dead man, now his eyes freeze, now he walks next to the body, close-up shot of the body, corny piano music starts playing, close-up to the main character's eyes, now a tear drop, oh how sad"" Yup, got it right again. So predictable. Well, you can't complain as then again, you get what you order.Like I mentioned before, the plot has this good twist in it and it does make the movie interesting. It's also a bit unique in its own way. Though it is surprising at first, it's all downhill after that, as then it catches that famous predictability. Well it's not as bad as you may think from that last sentence, it's just is what it is. Despite from all of this negative feedback I'd still recommend the movie if you're looking for an action packed ride with a bad ass lead actor in it.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
An absolute thriller...,"I'll start by saying that I was reluctant to even see this movie but after some insistence by family, I sat and watched in pure enjoyment.Articles, reviews, trailers, TV spots, DO NOT do this film justice. Denzel Washington pulls out another great performance as well as an aged Val Kilmer. While some will point out that the plot is hard to swallow, it doesn't matter because it's wrapped up in sheer entertainment. You feel for these characters. There are no holes to be found in either the plot or it's twists. It's believable at the same time unbelievable. If you can get past the middle 20 minutes or so while they explain what the team can do, you're in for a great ride.I can't, in three paragraphs, paint a picture like Deja Vu. Of the many films Mr.Washington has put out over the last 4 years or so, this is by far his best if not one of the best of the year.Highly recommended for the open-minded.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Don't Worry Baby,"Greetings again from the darkness. Explosions, Noise, Helicopters, Car Chases and guns ... all staples from a Tony Scott/Jerry Bruckheimer production. All of these are most certainly abundant and at the usual sensory overload level. What is a little surprising about this one is the somewhat complex, if almost impossible to believe, story line. Sure time travel and parallel universes are common in film, but the whole criminal element is a nice little twist to the theme.Denzel does his customary strutting through with his favorite partner ... his enormous ego, but it somehow works here. Val Kilmer is drastically underused as Mr. FBI and Adam Goldberg somehow only gets to fire off a couple of wise cracks during his scenes. The spark for the film actually comes from Paula Patton as the victim-or-is-she? and Jesus (Jim Caviezel) as a really bad guy ""patriot"" Sure, the film is pure malarkey as far as being reasonable, but as escapism, it is actually much better than anticipated. The best news ... no Jon Bon Jovi or Bryan Adams songs on the soundtrack!",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Reality Crime Thriller With Neat Sci-Fi Twist,"I usually like sci-fi when it's pure sci-fi. I usually like present day drama when it's believably real. Disaster, at least for me, looms large when sci-fi meets real life drama. So here we have a present day crime thriller crossed with sci-fi time travel...And, this movie kicks butt, works so well, in fact, it's nuances should be studied in film school. It's original enough to be compelling-where we are not in some distant future, but the here and now.The story, the characters, and the effects mesh well to suspend belief to the point that you ""get on-board"" and enjoy the ride. This is the way to do sci-fi with believable real life situations. The cinematography, the implementation of technology, and even a beautiful (but presently dead) damsel in distress, combine to give the actors, who are uniformly good to excellent, the boost to put this in rarefied good sci-fi territory. Genre fans are shoo-ins and those who think they don't like sci-fi should enjoy this one too. 7.5 to 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Deja Vu is a great ride!,"I was also at that Century City screening last night, and I was probably one of the people who were saying they thought this movie was awesome. I enjoyed it immensely. It has been described as an action-adventure-romance-sci-fi pic and it truly is all of that.First of all, the cinematography was stunning. Tony Scott and his DOP, Paul Cameron, do fantastic work -- every shot is beautifully composed. And all the footage that involves a cast of thousands (meaning the crowd scenes) is masterful work.I don't know why I started with commenting on the photography (also the editing) of this movie. It's probably because that is what struck me from the very beginning, particularly when there is so much going on in the opening sequence. Yet you never get lost. Above all, the performances and story are great and really suck you in. Yes, this movie requires a fair bit of suspension of disbelief. I would go so far as to say the plot was far-fetched, but the heart of the story just takes you along for the ride.For the record, I felt Scott's most recent teaming with Denzel, Man on Fire, was one of the best movies of 2004. I don't think Deja Vu is as good as Man on Fire, but it's right up there as one of the most entertaining and thrilling movies I've seen this year.For sheer entertainment and an intriguing (though not flawless) plot, Bruckheimer, Scott and Co. sure have DELIVERED the goods.I recommend you see Deja Vu on the big screen with a big, loud audience for maximum enjoyment. Part of the appeal last night was exactly that; hearing the audience -- as one -- laugh, applaud and sigh along with this movie and getting swept up in that communal experience.post scriptum -- Any fans of Otto Preminger's wonderful 1994 classic Laura may be delighted by the echoes of that storyline in Deja Vu.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
A superb and brilliantly crafted thriller,"It has been quite a while since I have seen a film that was this beautifully crafted and nearly flawless. The acting is very convincing and the storyline follows quite closely to a Michael Criton-esquire novel. I was rather surprised at the 6.8 rating this movie has received thus far, and I hope that more positive reviews will come in order for the score to be bumped up to at least the mid 7's. I can guarantee you will not be disappointed by this film. For one thing, it stars Denzel Washington, Jim Cavizel, who I felt did a marvelous job at playing the antagonist, Val Kilmer, and Bruce Greenwood. With these four actors, you typically cannot go wrong. I notice that these four are also never in the tabloids and don't get caught up in the typical Hollywood tripe that is so prevalent today. They have raw talent, are not just getting by on their looks, and their performance, especially in this film, shows it. ""Deja Vu"" is one of those rare films that grabs a hold of you from the very start and does not let go of you until the very end. People even clapped after the film ended and such applause was well deserved. If you do anything at all this Thanksgiving weekend, then by all means, put going to see ""Deja Vu"" on your shopping list. I can promise you that both you and your family/significant others will be blow though the very back wall of the theater.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
I don't condemn the whole movie.....,"Parts of it were truly truly excellent. I'm a fan of Denzel and love his low-key approach to these meaty roles he snags. And here he doesn't disappoint. The movie had me from the beginning right up to the four-day delay relay of New Orleans. the technology was fascinating and believable and I'm a fan of good sci-fi along with anyone else.However and it is a huge however, once the movie slipped into time travel it literally blew up and totally lost me.Great trouble was taken by the director and the script writer to keep the interesting clues consistent in both the past and the present and kudos for that.But it was alarming that the major plot hole of only sending a note of warning back in time once only and then to the wrong man who gets himself killed as a result. Puh-leese. And then I kept re-working the script - in my head - to more coherence.I found the scene of the mad smashemup Hummer ride inserted strictly for the young teenage boys of the audience, it was like a video game, innocent tiny passenger cars were totalled willy-nilly with no one to ponder the carnage of bodies that would result. On to the next. The fixation of Doug (the Denzel role) on a dead woman was almost pornographic at times and reminiscent to me of ""Laura"". But all the knots were neatly untied in Laura.And here? The time warped Doug dies, the ferry is saved, and in true Hollow-Wood fashion the new and improved Doug sallies forth to embrace the teary heroine.Serious movie let down from a quite auspicious beginning. Almost like two movies put through a blender. Badly. 6 out of 10. A shame. There was a superb suspense thriller in there somewhere waiting to get out. Everyone ignored it.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Terrific underrated thriller,"The late Tony Scott and Denzel Washington collaborated on five films, the second last of which is underrated sci fi thriller Deja Vu. It contains Scott's trademark visual style, all skitchy sketchy frames, deliriously rapid editing and deep, gorgeously saturated colours that pisses a lot of people off in its garish, flippant aesthetic. I for one love his style, and here he is coming down off the high that was his masterpiece, Domino, exercising restraint that was no doubt mandated by the studio bigwigs. Nevertheless, the same unmistakably heightened forces of filmmaking that flow through the veins of this crackling thriller can be found in most of his work, just in smaller doses here. The film tackles a lot in its unassuming narrative, from terrorist bombing, an elliptical story that's put in an otherworldly trance by a plot point involving a high tech time travel capability, and a surprisingly heartfelt undercurrant that somewhat sneaks up on you. During a captivating opening credit sequence, we see a horrific explosion onboard a navy transport ferry in the New Orleans harbour, killing over five hundred people including women and children. ATF Agent Doug Carlin (Washington) is called in to investigate, and before long his cunning intuition catches the eye of FBI Agent Pryzwara (an unusually calm Val Kilmer) who is spearheading a very hush hush investigative technique that's being used to track the terrorist in the days leading up to the incident. What Kilmer doesn't tell him is the mind- bending metaphysical implications of it, but keener Denzel gets wise to their act, and throws himself headlong into a quest to stop the bomber, save the mysterious Claire (Paula Patton, just phenomenal) who was murdered and has ties to the event, and reverse time. Denzel is an implosive wrecking ball of determination, his ingenuity and reserve made me wonder why Carlins career aspirations stopped short of the ATF. I don't know why Patton isn't in more films (she recently starred alongside Denzel again in the super fun 2 Guns), she brings a battered resilience to her work, and is a radiant beauty to boot. Peppy gerbil Adam Goldberg is the obligatory one liner spewing techie who's got more going on than his exterior may read, and Bruce Greenwood is all stern bluster as the FBI honcho in charge. This film doesn't often come up in discussions of either Denzel's or Scott's greatest hits, but it's ripe for rediscovery and praise. Propulsive action, far fetched sci fi intrigue that's hard to digest and follow, yet simultaneously wicked fun, and like I said before an emotional core that takes you by surprise. There's a sentence that I internally intone to myself whenever I see a film, or aspects within a film that fire up my adrenal glands, tear ducts or simply rouse my soul. Be it a banger of an action sequence, a romance that hits all the right notes, a good old fashioned fantastical invention or visual flights of fantasy that stir wonder within me. That sentence is ""This is why I watch movies"". I get no greater pleasure in my cinematic escapades than being able to say that to myself as my heart pumps to the tune of whatever grand spectacle I'm witnessing before me on screen. I can tell you, the sentence was uttered while watching this one, and now that I think of it, pretty much every film in Scott's portfolio. Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Somewhat OK,"When a terrorist blows up a ferry full of people an ATF agent is called to the scene. When a female corpse washes ashore she proves to be a piece of the puzzle - but dead women tell no tales. Or do they? Deja Vu plays with the idea that a deja vu isn't an erroneous action of the mind, but something real. With the invention of a device that allows the investigating team to see the actual past as it is happening it opens a premise for a story that might be fun enough for a film.And granted, it is. Watched as a mindless action flick this film isn't half bad - the plot is believable enough to pack the elements that keep the story rolling and the play-out is good enough to make it more than just acceptable. For me the one thing that demolished bit of the film though is something that happened at the very end of it - it just didn't belong in there or was just plain wrong (in combination with the events that lead to that moment).Still.. Acceptable material. Nothing to remember more than a few days after seeing it, but good enough to visit the cinema.6 out of 10 memories from the future",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
It Really Got Me,"I've seen and read so many time travel things over the years that I know one could pick at this forever. Still, once we embrace the technology and go with the plot, it's hard to stop watching. This evaded me when it first came out. I rented it and was captured. First of all, it's that cool Denzel thing he does. Especially when he is quizzing someone. He knows he's the man and he leaves the person being spoken to looking to see if his wallet has been stolen. I remember some of this from ""Remember the Titans."" The passing in and out of realities begs the question of what will happen to the characters when they make it back? Especially if we like them. And we do. The government, of course, does what it can to screw up, but the rebel always get his way, doesn't he? This is a film one thinks about long after seeing it. I decided to ignore the science and just enjoy it. I would have given it 9 but there are some plodding parts in the middle.

An intriguing but unlikely film about an A.T.F. agent joins an unique investigation using experimental surveillance technology to find the bomber.,"Doug Carlin (Denzel Washington) is a lonely ATF (Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms) agent with incredible analytical skills. In Algiers, New Orleans, an explosion of a ferry transporting sailors from the USS Nimitz and their families on a Mardi Gras excursion causes 543 casualties. Carlin is informed by Sheriff Reed (John McConnell) about the corpse of a woman, Claire Kuchever (Paula Patton), that washed up on shore. Her body was found one hour before the explosion but burnt with the same explosive. The agents believe that her death was meant to look like part of the explosion, but the body arrived too soon. Then Doug is recruited by a strange research team led by FBI agent Pryzwarra (Val Kilmer) with a fantastic machine that can see what happened in the past, but he soon finds himself becoming obsessed with one of the victims. Doug also learns that his partner, Agent Larry Minuti (Matt Craven), is missing. If you thought it was just a trick of the mind, prepare yourself for the truth !. What if you could change the past?A fast-paced science fiction thriller whose greatest asset is its star-studded cast. An overwhelming and suspenseful movie with a nail-biting and improbable premise: a ferry carrying an explosive cargo and causing a catastrophe; is it possible to avoid it? . The incombustible Denzel Washington (The Bone Collector) as ATF agent assigned to investigate the terrorist attack and Val Kilmer (Batman Forever) head the line-up. They are joined by Paula Patton (Precious) and James Cazievel (Passion of the Christ) in one of the antagonists. Adding other secondaries in brief appearances, such as : Adam Goldberg, Bruce Greenwood, Erika Alexander, Elden Henson, Matt Craven, Donna Scott, Brian Howe and even Elle Fanning. And with the guarantee of the prolific and usual of big-budget films Jerry Bruckheimer (CIS) in the production ensured 'Deja vu' a box office success, grossing more than 130 million euros worldwide. The film is dedicated to the people of New Orleans, who after the destructive floods knew how to overcome and fight against the disaster. That's why just a few weeks before production was to start, Hurricane Katrina devastated the city. With the location in ruins, the movie made the decision to find a new location to shoot. A few weeks after the decision, canceling the movie altogether was in talks. Eventually, three months after the hurricane, the film returned to New Orleans, Louisiana and began pre-production once again.It contains a rousing and thrilling musical score by Harry Gregson-Williams, Tony Scott's regular. As well as a colorful and adequate cinematography by Paul Cameron. The motion picture was competently directed by Tony Scott and using his frequent trademarks. Tony and his brother Ridley formed a stunning couple of producers and filmmaker, being Tony's final film: ¨Unstoppable¨(2010) before his death by suicide on August 19, 2012. Tony was a good filmmaker whose works received some great reviews , his first big hit happened when was asked by producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer to direct ¨Top Gun¨ (1986) starring Tom Cruise. He would work again with Cruise on another high adrenaline film ¨Days of thunder¨ (1990) , which proved less successful. He followed the success of ¨Top Gun¨ with the sequel ¨Beverly Hill cop II¨ (1987) with Eddie Murphy, which was well received . In 1993, he directed the cult movie ¨True Romance¨ (1993), which was written by emerging director Quentin Tarantino but Scott had a lot of control over the film. Tony Scott and Denzel Washington colaborated in 5 films and Unstoppable (2010) was their fifth and final film collaboration. The others were ¨Red tide¨ (1995), ¨Man on fire¨ (2004), ¨Déjà vu¨ (2006), and ¨Pelham 123¨ (2009) all of them got big successes . Rating : 7/10. Well worth watching . The picture will appeal to Denzel Washington fans .",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Story in the Story: Tony's Bladerunner,"My regular readers know I harp on and on about the tricks of narrative folding. Sometimes it must seem a stretch, but I believe this collection of devices to be at the core of cinematic storytelling. And others do too, obviously. This time, everything you see is built around this notion.The simplest folding is where the story provides for a movie within the movie, so that we the audience can merge with the audience we see on screen. Its all about getting us engaged; simple as that. I wish we had more films that mattered, that we can actually use in building a life, but Bruckheimer has his place too, I suppose. Especially when a Scott is involved.So what we get here is simple but extremely effective narrative folding, Scott's standard super-effective camera which knows how to be ambiguous in these matters, and both turned to the goal of grabbing us by the throat for a thrill.The fold this time is us watching a crime as detectives, and what we see is a detective watching the same crime. So perspectives overlap and we have several scenes where our screen contains people looking at their screen, notable in the same proportion. And we also have time folding, in fact the designated scientist explains it as folding with a piece of folded paper. This allows Denzel the opportunity to be driving at high speed in two time periods at the same time. Very clever if you must follow the Bruckheimer rule of car chases  that they be spectacular.As with any Scottfree film, you must see it on a big screen, and I say that with some hesitation. That's because I know a director's cut will arrive on DVD. It'll feature some enhanced nudity. Ho Hum, nipples. But I expect it to alter the story the same way brother Ridley's director's cut of ""Bladerunner"" did. You will know from the trailers that Denzel's character goes back in time. Once. But you will see hints here of something that has been edited out, hints that he would have had to go back many times, like ""Primer.""When he appears at the hospital, he has a marking on his chest that only an experienced traveler would place, and that isn't there the first time he goes back.. At Clair's house, he carefully moves a glass of water as a signal to one of his future selves. At the marina, there's the appearance of corpse-reducing alligators. Note my prediction on this, I see into the future: Scott will un-dumb down this story.One interesting thing is that for the first time I can recall, Denzel's style of being is appropriate. Less interesting is how Hollywood thinks technical projects like this might look, all nice and neat with military guards all around and no maintenance techs to worry in the background. Nah.Summary: The girl is pretty. The threat has a ticking clock. The folding works and we are thrilled. Washington isn't repellent. Stay tuned for more complexity on the DVD.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,Crime
Another Good Collaboration Between Tony Scott and Denzell Washington,"If I have the feeling I've seen DEJA VU before, it's because I have. I'm a great fan of Denzell Washington, who makes the most unlikely situation seen real. He has a simple, grounded manner of saying his lines that convinces me.He's an ATF agent called in when a bomb goes off on a ferry on Mardi Gras, killing a lot of people. As he investigates, he finds some odd glitches, like a message from a women he doesn't know. Then he's called in to help direct some wonks with a machine that seems to recreate the events of four days earlier. He soon forces them to admit it's a ""time window"" and helps them use it to identify and track the bomber. It's his job.... but he's haunted by the possibility that instead of just using it to convict the bomber after the deaths, he can use it to prevent those deaths.It's a nice pulp sf story, well directed by Tony Scott, who worked with Washington a lot.DP Paul Cameron uses a greyed-out color scale to lend an atmosphere of unreality to the movie, supporting the idea that this version of reality is mutable. Val Kilmer plays the lead scientist. Jim Cavaziel is the bomber, and Paula Patton is the victim at the center of the story.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Top notch action flick,"This was a terrific movie, plain and simple. It kept you thinking and guessing at what was really going on, and in the end, all the holes close. That is unusual for any kind of ""playing with time"" kind of film, and all those involved deserve credit for doing it right. While the whole premise of the science involved has a deep flaw in it, it's not the sort of flaw that precludes the suspension of disbelief. Denzel Washington, Jim Caviziel and Adam Goldberg give memorable performances. Of course, there is no one better than Tony Scott when it comes to telling a story with pictures, and he's as good here, if not better than in Enemy of the State.10/10 because I finished my popcorn before I even noticed it was running low.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Very Viewable, if...","Fast-paced thriller, very, very viewable if one is prepared to overlook the time-travel-cum-quantum-physics questions that inevitably arise as the plot unfolds. The problem with this theme is that the storyteller invariably has to deal with the type of realism that the audience comes to expect, not that there ever was a time travel story that ever satisfied an audience's taste for realism.This time, instead of an out-and-out take on time travel, the writers merged this worn-out concept with that of quantum physics' multi-verse. Not with great success because one asks the question how would altering the past affect the other branches of the time-space continuum. And so forth...The ending was somewhat lame in that it failed to answer this question to satisfaction. However Denzel's acting was superb, so was his role. The pacing was electric and the story, while dealing with a complicated premise, was surprisingly not very difficult to follow.Very viewable indeed...",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Time Travel = Automatic Plot Hole,"Yet another pairing of Washington and Scott, this time they are tackling time travel. As it is with every time travel film there are plot holes, but it's always neat to see how the writers tackle such a heated topic and Deja Vu tries to attach an action thriller into the mix.Tony Scott has a certain style to him now, anyone whose seen Man On Fire or Domino knows this, here it isn't as blatant, but it's till there. I enjoy his films, they never try to inspire or be more then what it sets out to do.There are some interesting scenes here, like trying to drive in the present while using a device to see the past and follow the killer. Did you understand that? The supporting cast, including my man Kilmer, basically sit around and 'teach' Washington about time travel. Washington is the only one who really gets to have fun and do stuff.As a time travel film, it's okay, as an action thriller, it's alright. The film never truly steps outside of that mediocre box, considering it has so many things going for it, one might expect a bit more from those involved. The characters are somewhat likable, and....creepy? Watching her shower in the past...yup.This is not a film to rush out and see, unless your a big time fan of Washington or Scott.

"Blending solid science-fiction action with pulse-pounding mystery, Deja Vu is a competently crafted ride","""Wait a minute, have I seen this before?"", a question that appropriately suites the overarching theme of this flashy mystery picture. This science-fiction action thriller, directed by Tony Scott, capitalizes on compelling concepts involving time travel, a sci-fi element with a constantly fluctuating reputation throughout most of the history of cinema. If there is any detriments to Scott's direction dealing with time travel, it is that he doesn't offer anything particularly new or original. Fortunately, that doesn't stop this film from being the entertaining tale of mystery and techno-compulsion. The title describes a phenomenon in which someone meets someone or faces a situation they believe they have encountered regardless of whether he or she has or not. This concept serves the centric theme of the story which places Denzel Washington in the lead role as a man seeking for justice against a heinous crime. In a solid conclusion, Tony Scott proves he is capable of tackling the concept with precision, if without inventiveness. This film follows Doug Carlin (played by Denzel Washington), an ATF agent who is assigned to a case involving a bomb explosion that takes the lives of 500 innocent people on a ferry in New Orleans. Boasting incredible detective skills, Carlin is invited by Agent Pryzwarra (played by Val Kilmer) to join the surveillance team who are responsible of using high-tech surveillance technology that allows him to travel back in time four days prior to the bombing. So Carlin must hunt down the man responsible in attempt to stop the disaster, while pursuing after Claire (played by Paula Patton), a woman the terrorist is hunting down to kill.Arguably one of Tony Scott's biggest achievements in this picture is effectively tackling the use of time travel in the way that avoids the common dilemma overcomplicating the narrative. Scott proves he is more than capable of telling a solid story without slipping into the cracks of irrationality or dullness. That is not to say that the film doesn't fail to offer anything inventive. Easily the film's sharpest detriment is its execution never stands out among other and more superior films that tackled the concept. On the bright side, Scott does not fail to bring on the thrills once the plot finally kicks into gear. The first half-hour focuses on the lead character and the team establishing an investigation on the terrorist responsible for the bombing, while introducing their groundbreaking technology that allows them to seek answers with powerful ability. This entire segment is driven with pulse-pounding mystery that opens doors for a suspenseful atmosphere. When the action, consisting of car chases through a moderately congested highway and gun shootouts that end in explosive chaos, arrives, the thrills begin to fly. Shot with slick cinematography, Scott captures the intense heat of the action with effectiveness, particularly the jarring opening explosion sequence, and the results are solid. As for Denzel Washington, this actor, who has reunited with Scott after 'Crimson Tide', plays the lead role with versatility and grit. Washington leads a supporting cast of Val Kilmer, Paula Patton, Kim Caviezel, Adam Goldberg, and Bruce Greenword -- all of whom are given only little time to show off their acting chops. However, none of them giving anything that allows them to standout among one another.Deja Vu is a slick, entertaining science-action thrill ride blossomed by the hands of director Tony Scott. Blending solid action set pieces with pulse-pounding mystery, this film offers a decently crafted rendition on time travel for those hungry for some adrenaline-fueled action and creativity. But do not go in expecting anything groundbreaking.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

An good Sci-Fi action movie but more was expected,"Déjà Vu is a science fiction action movie directed by Tony Scott and stars Denzel Washington, Val Kilmer, Paula Patton, Adam Goldberg and Jim Caviezel in the leads.There are both positive and negative points of the movie so will start with positive.The movie is intelligent and the director and the screenplay writer are successful in keeping the movie intense and captivating. The acting is strong. The execution of the plot is also good. Background music is another strong aspect of the movie.Now the negativeThe plot doesn't seems fresh as we have seen many such films in the past but as mentioned earlier the execution is good.

Exciting Thriller !,"Deja Vu is the more than intriguing title that was chosen for Denzel Washington's long anticipated new film. A Deja Vu is a strange phenomenon that modern-day science is yet to sufficiently explain. The simplified definition is ""The sensation you are doing something you have done before."". You're no wiser now than you were a minute ago when you started reading are you?... I didn't think so :-). If you're hoping to learn more about the story itself I suggest you stop reading this comment immediately because the above is all I'm going to tell you about the story as it is a heavenly delight to watch this film ice cold( the regular IMDb user will know what I mean). Just lay back and you will be blown away by the story.Deja Vu is a fast-paced action thriller that has all the elements to keep you glued to your seat throughout the movie. An a-typical Denzel Washington movie but then again is there such a thing as a typical Denzel Washington movie?! He's played civil war soldiers, police officers, boxers, basket ball players and he manages to make it work every time.This is an intelligent action film( yes, there is such a thing) and will leave some thinking even after the credits have rolled. I know that was the case for yours truly. Don't miss out on this one, see it now because you never know what will happen tomorrow.Denzel Washington is great as always, he doesn't have as much to work with character-wise as in Training Day or The Hurricane but he still makes it work and makes the character 100% believable as he always manages to do. Jim Caviezel is unbelievable in his role. I've seen him in some roles before where I judged him to be average, but this was the firs time I was very impressed by him. ( I must admit I haven't seen him as Christ). The other actors are a bit overshadowed by those 2 amazing actors and deliver just OK performances.Tony Scott does an amazing job directing the film. He applies a very modern style in the camera shots ( frequent use of close-ups and fast paced switching of camera viewpoints), allowing the public to feel the excitement of the scenes. He is very careful not to overdo it, the slower and more intense scenes are given the chance to develop (without too much switching between camera viewpoints) and have the intended effect on the viewer. An example of a film that overdid the fast switching of shots is Smokin' Aces, which made the film very chaotic and sloppy. The pacing of the story itself is masterfully done.Deja Vu is one of 06's best. I haven't been so impressed by a film since I saw The Prestige some time ago. Both these films show that modern films with daring scenarios do have the potential to become classics and that the general film quality is going up despite what some cynics may say.See it yesterday rather than today...?!! :-D",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Polished Cliché,"I hate to say this but there is nothing special with this picture. Deja Vu has nothing new.this is all about a time machine and story about changing the past.Which you have seen so many times before (and in some cases better movies). you see denzel Washington is great like always.But nothing new. Camera Changes its point of view many times within few seconds like any other Tony Scott's movies. only thing that saved this movie is the scene which Denzel Washington is driving the car with in pursuing the past with the Rig. Yes i admit that that was perfect. Beside that the little love story which is lying under the movies skin is not that bad but unsatisfying. All characters are rerun and they looks more like Types. music is so-so and Special effects are as good as any large Budget movies. what is great in this movie is its cutting and editing. there are some new ideas and some twists in the plot. But if you'd seen some movies in this Genre with similar stories , they all could be Preguessed. its not a bad movie but if you are looking for action-Thriller with a rich story or sci-fi theme i suggest you watch minority report or Man on fire again.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Cool sci-fi idea on paper,A ferry filled with USS Nimitz sailors and families is blown up in New Orleans during Mardi Gras. ATF agent Doug Carlin (Denzel Washington) investigates the suspected terrorist attack. They find the body of Claire Kuchever (Paula Patton) who seems to be killed before the bombing. FBI Agent Jack McCready (Bruce Greenwood) is in charge. Carlin's partner's car is left in the ferris' parking lot and ends up in the investigation. Agent Pryzwarra (Val Kilmer) brings him into a new experimental FBI unit called Snow White run by scientist Dr. Alexander Denny (Adam Goldberg) who uses spacefolding to see events 4 days 6 hours into the past. Carlin suspects that he can change history.This is a great sci-fi idea and I imagine that it would make a great book. However it's biggest difficulty is to make a bunch of people sitting around watching a monitor as something exciting. The sad truth is that it's not exciting no matter how well director Tony Scott films it. He is probably the only one capable of energizing that room with kinetic power. However even he has his limits to his fast quick edits flashing sound-and-fury style. It's noticeable that the drive in the middle of the movie is derived almost exclusively from Tony Scott trying to make watching computer screens exciting.,6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Interesting Concept!,"Deja Vu is a good movie with a mind-bending twist, good action scenes, and a plot that is hardly understandable unless you have the scientific mind like me. This film also boasts a good director-actor pairup in Tony Scott and Denzel Washington. This movie can be confusing at times because it is one that will make you think and the plot has many scientific terms especially regarding time travel.Tony Scott's film is about a ATF officer who is taken off a site of a ferry explosion to an area where he is told about some new machine that can take people back in the past to see if they can find any information about the crime.This is the second pairup between Tony and Denzel with the first being the 2004's Man on Fire, which is better than this film. However, Denzel still has what it takes to be a lead actor and his personality takes this movie out of mediocrity. This film also supports a well-rounded supporting cast with the likes of Val Kilmer, Bruce Greenwood, and Paula Patton.Overall, this is a energetic, fast-paced, and skillful movie. It features some very good editing and cinematography which is always present in a Tony Scott movie. Despite that, I felt Tony could have done better with this film. It's not a classic by any stretch but I wanted more of a story to be told. But, I admit I loved the style of the movie. I may be generous, but I rate this film 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Give the movie a break!,"Yes. It's a cop story. Yes it involves time travel. It's well written, Denzel and Scott pull off a suspenseful movie, with an emotionally voyeuristic (in a good way, if there is such a thing) plot device in which Denzel's character finds himself inexorably attracted to a women he's never met before... or has he? It's not a movie about transporter beams, phasers and light sabers. It's not a science fiction movie at all.If you had the power to go back in a fixed amount of time to save one you felt strangely attracted to, as if you knew her (or him) would you do it? What if at the same time, this plot device may or may not also simultaneously serve to prevent a terrorist attack that killed 500+ people? Are you in? Or are you going to pout because you don't like the (actually well-defined) science principles in relationship with space-time. Ironically, Denzel's character, Doug, wasn't to keen on the tech talk either. He was the protagonist. His job wasn't to be a scientist, rather an ATF agent investigating an act of terror. That it became personal due to the loss of his partner and the odd feeling that he had a connection with one individual of the many who lost their lives in the attack made for a compelling story.I, for one, appreciate when a director and writer change up the bullet-proof, super-strength 50 year-old storyline: the shot-up, physically super-powered aged hero who can take a few bullets and still jump 10 feet between buildings, fall two stories then waste the rest of the film antagonizing the 30 dim-witted thugs he will single handedly kill while spitting out one-liners. Ultimately, he will face Super Antagonist for the Hollywood kill shot and last laugh. (Typically starring Bruce Willis, which is a shame. He's capable of so much more but has been roped into a stereotypical caricature)WARNING: This is a film with a legitimate plot and you will be required to think. No, time travel, as demonstrated, isn't technically possible. In the scheme of things, it works as a plot device that keeps the story interesting and moving at a smooth pace. Forget the science-fiction, it's not a sci-fi film and it sure as heck isn't a documentary on Einstein's Theory of Special Relativity.Enjoy the movie. 8 stars for originality, style and writing. I never had reason to give a film 10 stars. Too much hyperbole. (Like most, I ignore 10-star and 1-star reviews. I trust 3 - 8 star ratings for their honesty.

Compulsive time travel entertainment.,"A man attempts to prevent a terrorist attack and save a woman with whom he has falling in love with.Satisfying science fiction that handles time travel more subtle than most. Tony Scott's Déjà Vu is a very rounded well constructed piece of entertainment. Although the closing ties things up a little too nicely in terms of Doug Carlin's 'duplicate' it still manages to inject some ambiguity into the end.Déjà Vu has plenty of heart and is more thriller than scifi, it's not too gadget/techie driven and Scott's realistic style of filming and the New Orleans setting draws you in from the off, it's quite compulsive viewing right up to the conclusion. With a great supporting cast actor Denzel Washington is on his usual fine form, Paula Patton is convincing and Val Kilmer gives a great performance (even with his limited screen time).Scott slightly drops the ball with the chase scene and a few plot points don't appear air tight.

exciting and intriguing but too implausible,"Intellectually stimulating, although when watching it had the sensation ""I've already seen it before"".

There are some plot inconsistencies as well as some violence disturbing scenes but this science fiction movie - that's surely the genre it belongs to though it's not been touted that way - is smart and enjoyable.

He's then invited to join a special FBI task force that utilizes cutting edge tech to render images from satellites and cameras everywhere in the area, but from events that happened several days ago. They don't know where to start, so Carlin suggests they look at Claire. Sure enough, she's selling her old SUV and gets a call from the perpetrator. Carlin's partner who is supposed to be on vacation actually died on scene as well. Claire has some strange reactions so Carlin has his doubts about the technology the FBI is using and sure enough there's an exciting twist about how the FBI can access the info from the past. It also has some portable device which allows them to expand their radius, which involves Carin having to drive to places after the bad guy in the past to see what else he did. Here we learn that his partner actually went after the bad guy thanks to a mysterious tip and how the Claire ended up dead.I missed Deja Vu when it came out so I was quite surprised by this movie watching it years later. The beginning was pretty bad though, it looked like something out of those ridiculous Michael Bay movies. Washington is also a problem as he often struggles with knowing when to get serious and when to act like a goof. But it's the story here that shines and how it combines police work with science and science fiction to come up with something surprising and that requires your full attention to little details. It's also is one of those movies that does explain itself and everything that happens.

Been there done that?,"Deja vu the concept does you in because it doesn't answer to you but instead beckons and then has its own rules. You know that feeling one gets where they have some familiarity about a situation or person? We shrug it off or take note that it is beyond our understanding to process thus we call it Deja vu alluding to the supernatural. That's really all we can do however in this movie, they go beyond that. A plot twist and hook that never misses is the concept of time travel. It plays very nicely with your head and when being discussed, there are no wrong answers only one mystery after another, plenty of aha moments together with how can that be? This movie and its characters captures that quite well. Good intensity levels here and I was impressed with the directing and explosions which become integral to the plot. After scratching your head a few times afterwards and of course discussing this with someone else, one has to wonder what happened after the movie ends and who really knows what happened within the movie. A sequel wouldn't have hurt at all and as we all know, many time travel-movies proved a success if they respected the concept. This movie did. As usual, Denzel is a delight to watch as is Val Kilmer.

Promising action-thriller that mixes Science-Fiction quite well.,"ATF Agent Doug Carlin (Two Time Oscar-Winner:Denzel Washington) is investigating the bombing of a ferry boat that killed over five-hundred people. Doug finds out that one of the victims (Paula Patton) didn't died from the bombing. His partner's (Matt Craven) car from found in the ferry and he's missing. Then an mysterious government agent (Val Kilmer) takes Doug to a top secret government lab that uses a time-shifting surveillance device to help from prevent time. Doug thinks that the best thing from preventing this crime is looking back on the woman from a couple of days before her murder happened. Doug finds out that they could sent something back in the past. Which it's possible for the high-tech device but they are not certain if a person being could return back to the past. They find the terrorist (Jim Caviezel), who did it. Once he was a ex-marine, who never got his respect from his country and he's a raving psychopath as well. Doug thinks it's possible to return to the past to save the woman, he falls in love with this woman and as well for stopping the bomb before it's too late.Directed by Tony Scott (Crimson Tide, Domino, Man on Fire ""2004"") made an interesting suspense/thriller that has elements of romance and science-fiction that mixes quite well. This movie has some fascinating ideas. Washington as usual gives an excellent performance in this. Caviezel offers an change of pace role in this and it is also the first time, he plays a bad guy. The film has good roles for the supporting cast like Bruce Greenwood, Adam Goldberg, Elden Henson and Erika Alexander. But the film went on to be an box office disappointing in the U.S. (It did quite well in Overseas) and it is Scott's first PG-13 since ""Days of Thunder"".DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has ""The Surveillance Window"", which it could bring back in time from the movie by watching the behind the scenes footage. Which it's option by watching the movie or u could watch it separately from the movie. DVD also has Deleted Scenes and Extended Scenes with optional commentary by the director. Which there's no commentary track from the movie for some reason. There's rumours that Scott might release an Unrated Version of the picture in the near future. This thriller is well made, it's entertaining but it's goes on longer than it should. Some viewers might find this confusing or predictable but It's pretty good solid entertainment. Don't miss it.

Entertaining Yet Scientifically Flawed,"""Déjà Vu,"" featuring the always compelling Denzel Washington, sets out to blend the intrigue of science fiction with the intensity of a crime thriller. Washington's portrayal is top-notch, delivering a character that is both dynamic and engaging. However, the film's scientific elements, which are central to its plot, fall short of believability and coherence.The narrative hinges on a high-concept, time-altering technology used to prevent a catastrophic event. While this premise is captivating, the film's execution of scientific ideas is more fanciful than factual. The so-called time-travel technology, intriguing as it may be, is presented without any solid scientific basis, serving more as a convenient plot device than a believable scientific concept.The portrayal of time travel in ""Déjà Vu"" aligns more with science fiction clichés than with any real scientific theories. The film simplifies the inherently complex nature of time travel, sidestepping the paradoxes and theoretical implications it entails. This approach results in a narrative that is easy to follow but scientifically unsubstantial.In summary, while ""Déjà Vu"" offers an entertaining experience with a strong performance from Denzel Washington, its scientific aspects are significantly lacking in credibility. The film chooses narrative simplicity over scientific authenticity, making it a fun watch for those less concerned with factual accuracy. However, viewers hoping for a movie that respects scientific principles might find it disappointingly inadequate.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Well done entertaining movie!,Let's face it. nowadays you go to the local cinema to look at a movie and 99% of the time you can see the ending coming half way thru the movie.This movie is quite different from that because it does not sell you the ending until the actual end which is great. Yes the movie is far fetched but it is so wheel written that it all makes sense and there are more twists and turns in this movie than a formula one course. This helps make the movie entertaining.Denzel is superb and driven. Th rest of the actors do as well as Denzel with their screen time.All in all i can say it has been a long time since i watched a movie that good and it was made years ago!,9.0,Anonymous,Crime
What If You Could Solve A Crime BEFORE It Happens?,"Usually, police officers are only able to REACT to crimes and then investigation. However, what if one officer was given the opportunity to stop a crime BEFORE it could occur? That is the basic premise behind ""Deja Vu"".For a basic plot summary, this movie begins with the tragic bombing of a ferry in New Orleans. When Agent Doug Carlin (Denzel Washington) is called in to investigate, he discovers that the bombing is somehow connected to Claire Kuchever (Paula Patton). Via a team of secret scientists, Carlin is able to view a live video stream of the past in order to help him piece together the mystery of Ms. Kuchever.At its core, ""Deja Vu"" is a very interesting (and fresh) take on time travel. More specifically, the ability to create a ""window to the past"". It is an intriguing concept from beginning to end, and one has to give much credit to director Tony Scott, who manages to seamlessly weave all the intricate pieces together (no easy task when dealing with relative physics!).Yet, thanks to a tight story and some incredible acting from Washington and Patton, this is also a very emotional and dramatic film. One cannot help but be sucked into the odd relationship between the two and wonder ""what would I do in a similar situation?"".Thus, I consider ""Deja Vu"" to be one of the most well-rounded films a person could ever hope to find. It has action, adventure, drama, science fiction, and even that smug Denzel Washington humor that always plays so well. Unless you have very little imagination, this film will interest you on at least some level.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Nice Ideas, perfect execution, gigantic plot holes","An ATF agent investigates a terror attack that killed more than 500 people and then joins an FBI team which has a access to a novel surveillance technology to help them find the culprit.DEJA VU takes its title from a psychological phenomenon in which a person feels as though they had previously experienced a situation they are currently experiencing. Without spoiling the plot, let's just say that this movie takes the idea behind it in a literal direction.There are a lot of really nice ideas for story elements, especially on the dramatic side. The writers clearly thought about how to make the proceedings interesting, and little touches which reveal attention to detail are everywhere.I also enjoyed the philosophical questions this movie raises. For example, even if we could go into a past, could we actually change anything?The direction by Tony Scott was essentially flawless, hitting all the right notes at various stages in the development of the plot and the actors did a good job. The special effects can hold their ground even today.This movie could have been among the very best in its genre, but unfortunately, several large plot holes and gaps in logic bring it down. Not enough so that if you turn off your brain, you won't have an enjoyable movie experience, mind you. But in my case, doing this is difficult, especially if a movie raises philosophical questions.That the movie has such glaring plot holes is all the more baffling and disappointing given that, as mentioned, the writers clearly paid a lot of attention to other aspects of the script.Many of the plot holes relate to the central conceit of the movie which I cannot reveal without spoiling it, but there are some that are independent of it. For example, in one scene late in the movie, the protagonist is in a hurry to get somewhere, but right after he mentions how little time he has to get there, he decides to stop somewhere to basically freshen up.Anyway, I am still rating this overall as a good movie because in all other aspects the movie is strong, and because I am an ideas guy (i.e. Someone who sees genuinely value in ideas just for their own sake, and feels profound satisfaction at being exposed to new ones) and that aspect of the movie appealed to me especially.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"great action scenes, but not very plausible.","Spoiler alerti have to admit, with the stellar cast of Denzel Washington, Val Kilmer,Adam Goldberg, Bruce Greenwood this movie was kind of a let down. Even Tony Scott couldn't save the seemingly week storyline.Good actions? Yes. Good acting? Perhaps, Denzel with his usual flair.But if anything,what this movie actually does is to bring forth an explanation about time space... and actually telling the audience this is what we think about time space...the theory of time space is tediously complex,near if not absolutely random, and perhaps may never be proved by science.The movie claims that only did we discovered the definitive theory of time space, but that humans can actually exploit it.This group of law enforcers had in fact meddled with the fabric of existence itself, messing with reality as we know it..earth,the sun, birds,flowers,matter,antimatter,heaven,hell etc.Don't get me wrong.The characters were decently written, and the movie tries to paint the scenario of would man do if he had stumbled upon a larger than life scientific discovery .One tries to play God( note the disaster when we discovered the atomic source of energy)Not his fault though, they've played God from the moment they developed the time travel technology. good actions scenes though. just don't expect it to make sense.",,Anonymous,Crime
"Aw, Screw It!","I've seen a lot of sci-fi lately, some good, some criminally bad. Although Tony Scott's Deja Vu will never be accused of being awful, it's too dumb--on a logical level--to be taken seriously.Yet.This homegrown-terrorist-blows-up-500+-people-and-it's-up-to-Denzel- to-use-time-bending-to-save-the-day-suspenser is so entertaining that, ya just can't get angry with it, right down to the part where somebody shows up at the end of the flick you thought should be dead.I'm not hitting that spoiler alert, period!Time travel movies are, by and large, incoherent and illogical. Nothing new here with Deja Vu, but Washington and Paula Patton and Jim Caviezel and Adam Goldberg are all such comfortable performers that I actually shrugged at one point and got my harumph out of the way.Do not go all Spock on this flick.

"A novel concept, great execution","I've long since aged-out of the demographic for Jerry Bruckheimer movies; and I mean nothing personal by that, it just happens. So I came into Deja Vu with expectations of fiery spectacle and Tony Scott's hyperactive editing from Man on Fire. And both were subverted.The right people were chosen for this movie and that makes all the difference. This is ultimately a love story rather than straight time-travel and Denzel and Paula Patton really go the distance in bringing out the film's romantic spirit. Granted, there are action scenes, and not all of them work, but god direction and solid performances make this work; and the third-act payoffs are well-earned.Very pleasantly surprised with this film.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Deja phooey,"I love Denzel and most of his movies, but this one was, like most of them this year was mediocre at best and ridiculous at worse. A cross between Timecop and Terminator, but at least the Terminator kept going back trying to get it right. The movie was interesting until he started falling for the girl and before the girl started getting in the way. I hate it when movies cast a female for distraction. I hate it when the female does the opposite of what she's told to do. The whole surveillance and possibility of changing the past was interesting, but like Timecop it would have been more interesting if alittle reality had crept in for the ending and not the ridiculous man being able to control everything ending that we got. Just one more thing I don't know about most people but I kind of getting tried of things blowing up and the whole terrorist, patriot thing.

"Washington and Brokheimer, a winning combination","Deja Vu is a high-action, crime-drama, sci-fi, thriller which is exactly what you would expect from Jerry Bruckheimer, producer of such action-adventures as ""Con Air,"" ""Enemy of the State,"" ""National Treasure,"" ""Pirates of the Caribbean,"" and another Denzel Washington favorite, ""Remember the Titans.""The story opens with an explosion on board a New Orleans Ferry, and takes the audience back through an unfolding of events that leads up to the tragic scene. Even the most modern technology hasn't gone as far as the storyline takes us. The premise is thrilling and the implications stimulate the imagination. For example; ""how would altering the past impact people and events of the present?""The acting is superb, with Denzel Washington and Paula Patton as romantic leads. James Caviezel does an extraordinary job as the villain, which is a departure from his role as Jesus in ""The Passion of the Christ.""There is plenty of action and some of it violent. Be prepared to see a few corpses like those on television's ""CSI"" or ""Crossing Jordon."" There are gun fights, but with a minimum of blood. While the movie is certainly intense, much of the severe action is implicit and takes place off camera.For an action packed, PG-13 movie, I was particularly impressed with the limited amount of rough language. I imagine with Denzel and James in the cast, there was an effort to keep it ""clean."" This is one of the few remaining Touchstone Pictures releases.

is more than a deja vu. is one of the best sci-fi movies ever made.,"Is one of the best movies i have ever seen. Goes deeper and deeper to show that people in your life is priceless, and you need to care about them. Basically the movie starts with a terrorist attack in a ferry in new orleans who happens in the first 5 minutes of the movie. Already the tone is here. Is a dark and sad movie because the big question is how doug carlin would save the people in the ferry and claire. The movie shows that destiny and fate always have influence. Even when doug try to changes things, everything already is happening, so from the start to finish is thrilling and shows that every person counts, and every life cares, even if doug carlin needs to sacrifice himself to save everyone.Is one of the few movies that can make me cry.Lets just make it clear, if there was 100 or less movies to watch before everything ends...this movie will be first for me.I dont know if is the music, the plot, the whole movie, denzel acting and the many car-chases-with-emotion that make me feel like this movie is one fo a kind.

thoroughly enjoyed this movie,"Even better than expected after seeing the previews, not at all what is suggested, that it's kind of a mind game thing. great effects, shooting style, very sci-fi , but not corny, and of course Denzel Washington approved as I'm sure he has his contributions to the story and the character he plays. Beautiful female lead too. It has a bit of a love story, but it's really more of an infatuation with another character,and in that light, you won't be disappointed that it doesn't develop completely, just enough to tie the story together. Don't let anyone talk about the story in detail, good chance of spoiling it. Val Kilmer adds a bit, I actually like his character, different than other parts. highly recommend it.

This Is My Favorite Movie Of All Time!,"Because Deja Vu is my favorite movie of all time, I figured it was only right for me to submit my own review for it.If you have never seen this movie, I think it is very important that you know as little about the plot as possible going in. That's how it was for me, and I must say, the twists will really shock the daylights out of you this way.I actually think it does this movie a GREAT injustice giving away certain information regarding the story the way it does basically everywhere I've read about it. Like imagine seeing A Beautiful Mind for the first time knowing the guy is a schizophrenic? Obviously the suspense wouldn't be the same.Deja Vu is the same way. All you need to know is that it's an action thriller starring one of the best actors of all time, Denzel Washington. If you are fortunate enough to only know this seeing Deja Vu for the first time, it will change your rating from a 7 or 8 to a definite 10, I promise you!That being said, even if you take away the initial suspense, this movie is so perfectly crafted that you will definitely want to own it so you can watch it over and over again.

Good executed story with some flaws,"First I have to say that unfortunately I bought a defect DVD and so I couldn't enjoy DEJA VU as usual.DEJA VU is worth trying but I warn you that this is not a very good action thriller but just okay to spend time when you have really nothing to do. The story is very complex but I think director Tony Scott succeeded quiet well to smelt fiction and reality in a logical order. Anyway, I find the plot lacks sometimes and you must be very tolerant with all these elements. Denzel Washington did a great job here giving a believable performance as the agent and Jim Caviezel was very cool in his role because I have never seen him playing this character.

Another Masterpiece of Tony Scott,"Tony Scott films are really amazing pieces of art!, since Top Gun, The Last Boy Scout (with Willis), Crimson Tide (with Denzel), The Fan (with De Niro), Enemy of the State (incredible movie with Smith),Spy Game (with Redford and Pitt) to Man on Fire (the best of all!). With this movie, the third of his saga starred with Denzel, i can say that Scott is definitely an auteur, a director with a special talent and with his signature on his great quality films. The fiction and police subjects of this movie are just great; Denzel, as always complement a great directing and a good script with an extraordinary and realistic acting, he shows again why is one of the best actors of the decade!. The plot of the movie is amazing; how you can use the visualizing of the past to solve crimes; it resembles in some way, the Spielberg film Minority Report, but this one is much better. The shots, the action scenes, the feeling of tension is a delight for those who like intelligent films where you have to think a lot to understand fully the story, i personally love this type of films!. Like Tony said: with Malcom X, Jesus Christ and Jim Morrison, how can this movie be bad!ABOUT THE MOVIE: This is the story of agent Doug Carlin (Denzel Washington) who was assigned to the investigation of a Ferry bombing in New Orleans where 563 people died; in this investigation he finds a woman corpse, this woman called Claire Kuchever (Paula Patton), will surely give a lot of clues to find the responsible for this terrorist attack, when she was actually found dead and burned in the river before the explosion had even occurred. Some special agents, including Agent Pryzwarra (Val Kilmer) and Jack McCready (Bruce Greenwood) invite Carlin to use a special and new tool to find the responsible, this tool is some kind of visor that put on video the events held 4 days ago, is like viewing the past and to possibly move trough it like navigating. Denzel, impressed with this technological aid, start to use it in order to find this terrible terrorist and while doing this, he get somehow involved and touched by Claire's last moments of her life.9/10! two thumbs up for Tony Scott, and one movie to add to this incredible Scott collection of action masterpieces.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Great thriller with sci-fi flair if you take it as it is.,"I'll start with the biggest issue most people have with this movie: you need a healthy amount of suspension of disbelief to enjoy it. The sci-fi parts of the movie are not very sound and it's easy to be bothered by the plot holes it creates if you focus on that a bit too much. But if you just take it as they barely explain it in the movie, then it's a pretty well told story, with great directing and pacing, and acting to match it. If the sci-fi elements had been a bit more polished a la Christopher Nolan I might even have given this movie an 8/10 as it is greatly entertaining and kept me engaged from beginning to end.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Moving, Visually Fine and Well-Acted Sci-Fi Love Story and Adventure","This is a thoughtful adventure that I found to be part sci-fi, part thriller, part love story and an unusually riveting filmgoing experience. Unsurprisingly, it has few well-developed characters; but uncharacteristically for the genre, almost all the piece's characters, however brief their appearance may be, become memorable. There is a special effects disaster in the film, a rousing car chase and many other interesting technical achievements; but I suggest that in this unusual achievement, these adult devices help to move the story along rather than detracting from it as is more usual. ""Deja Vu"" I find to be unusual in its structure also. Boy Loses Girl, Boy Pursues Girl is not the typical scenario for many films--least of all for a sci-fi narrative; but that's what one encounters here. The fun in the film is I suggest mostly provided by just how the boy loses the girl and exactly how he pursues her to the end of this one. Tony Scott directed this action masterwork for producer Jerry Bruckheimer, from a script by Bill Marsilli and co-producer Terry Rossio. Production Designer Chris Seagers makes use of understated but consistent lighting of and New Orleans streets and backgrounds just enough to give the real flavor of the Crescent City, which I have visited and experienced more than once. Paul Cameron's cinematography, the controlled art direction supplied by Drew Boughton, and the award level and very complex set decoration by Rosemary Brandenburg all in my opinion add greatly to the film's unusual believability. The makeup task was enormous in this movie; and the costumes well-handled; but these elements mostly provide a background to the main storyline's progress. Among the exceedingly large cast, standouts include Val Kilmer, James Caviezel as a terrorist, and a number of good actors in small roles as FBI and ATF officials. It is difficult to do justice to the pace, intelligence and gradual unfolding of so interesting a story. Most reviewers cannot understand sci-fi, especially time-travel stories. So, the success of this modest but ""A"" production effort is worth noting as a milestone in cinematic history. Add in a strong folksy performance by Denzel Washington as the lead agent and attractive Paula Patton as his love interest; throw in good or better music by Harry Gregson- Williams, and you have a first-rate film that deserves even more attention that its many nominations would attest.

It has no connection to a ""deja vu"". The movie should have been name d different. Another thing i hated was that the movie sticks to one story, one idea and than, by the climax, they risk all their existence and thats why the movie lacks reality and the story that goes after the big turn of the story just seems to go downhill.

Sci-fi procedural,"For the first two-thirds of this film from Tony Scott, I thought it was going to be his best film, and it wasn't even going to be very close. And then the final third just kind of became a typical action film, Tony Scott on auto-pilot. The writers, Bill Marsilii and Terry Rossio, insist that their script was tighter than what Scott actually filmed (undermining my idea that Scott never, ever wrote a thing on his movies), so I suspect that Scott just pushed the final act towards his own milieu, having worn out his patience on all this quiet, investigatory work that started things.A car explodes on a ferry in New Orleans, killing over five-hundred people, and ATF agent Doug Carlin (Denzel Washington) starts investigating, quickly going off on a tangent because of a body meant to be one of the victims but found an hour before the explosion in the wrong direction of the tides. This is Claire (Paula Patton), a pretty young girl who lives in the city, missed her meeting with her father, and tried to sell a car the night before. Figuring her connection out and presenting it to the task force led by FBI agent Jack (Bruce Greenwood) and run by FBI special agent Paul (Val Kilmer).All of this is told is surprisingly restrained style, especially after the stylistic bombast of Domino, feeling more like a high-budget CSI episode rather than a Tony Scott film, and this allows Scott the time and space to focus on his actors. I mean, this is a procedural with an eventual scifi skin, so there's not a whole lot of space for them to go. This isn't a deep drama, but it is a place where people like Washington can professionally do his job with few frills. Doug walks into the scene, does his work, and Washington sells it well.The interesting scifi skin is that Paul heads a unit that's using an Einstein Rosen Bridge to look four days and six hours in the past. There's some thin covering of the actual reasons when the team talks to Doug, a narrative decision that feels thin since, watching a movie and not assuming this is the real world like Doug, the audience figures it out real fast. I'll admit to being amused by seeing the same description of wormholes delivered by Dr. Alexander Denny (Adam Goldberg) as in both Event Horizon and Interstellar, though.So, the investigation continues with Doug following clues through the screen while questioning the limits of what the team is telling him that he's watching. It's a neat whodunit with this extra layer on top, and Doug falls in love with Claire. I mean, I get why the film does it. It's standard movie trope that cop will fall in love with woman being threatened, but there's this extra creepy element that the movie does touch on in amusing fashion where they're watching a woman without her knowing in her own home, without her consent and after she's already dead.The stakes get escalated with a nifty chase as Doug has to follow the terrorist who planted the bomb in the past while driving in the present. It's a rather inventive way to make a chase, and it fits Scott's stylistic wheelhouse quite well.I wouldn't say that the film falls apart after this, though, but it just becomes...more normal. It becomes Scott pursuing his action inclinations as Doug makes a dangerous trip and has to face down the villain in a new circumstance. The ideas of time travel, that, admittedly, never felt like much more than hand-wavey nonsense used to establish a new way to tell a police procedural, largely just get forgotten. This ain't Looper. Instead, it's Tony Scott casting aside all concern for science-fiction mechanics in favor of guns, car chases, and a romance that never quite works.So, the first two thirds may not be perfect, but it's actually really solid and quite well done. It's Scott taking the criticisms he faced on his previous film and actually trying to course correct while doing it quite well. I mean, it was never groundbreaking, really just a combination of police procedural and temporal mechanics that seemed to make sense, anchored by a solid performance from Washington and a good supporting cast. When Jim Caviezel comes in later, he gives what is the most interesting performance as well, but he also marks the stylistic changing point, moving from temporal police procedural to action movie.And that's not to imply that the action movie stuff of the final third is bad. It's perfectly fine. Scott pulling back on his excesses works well. It's actually pretty clear what's happening, and things move clearly, all built on the characters established in the better first two-thirds.So, what seemed like it could have been Scott's best work ends up being pretty good. Near the top, but there are others where things come together slightly better. Still, it's pretty good stuff.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Non-stop suspense!!!,"I just got back from seeing ""Deja Vu"" with some friends, and I must say, I have not seen such an original, truly suspenseful thriller in a good long while. Denzel Washington gives (As You might expect...) an awesome performance. Along with Val Kilmer, and Jim Caviazel. I have always been a rather big fan of Tony Scott's work, (Domino, Top Gun, Man on Fire.) And I was not disappointed with this one either. This movie provides top-notch suspense! A near two-hour movie truly felt like one hour. Jerry Bruckheimer and Tony Scott knew what they were doing. I recommend this movie to thriller lovers, and I cannot wait until the DVD comes out.

Going Back to Look Forward,"DÉJÀ VU is a riveting film about time travel in tandem with crime investigation that works on every level. Tony Scott is back in his element as the top director of intrigue/thrillers. Working with a challenging script by Bill Marsilii and Terry Rossio that asks the viewer to accept the possibility of time travel, Scott is able to make the story work clearly despite the interplay of mixing the viewing of the past form the vantage of the present with placing a character into that past to alter it.The setting is New Orleans, still suffering from the devastation of Katrina, where a ferryboat explodes killing hundreds of people. ATF (Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms) agent Doug Carlin (Denzel Washington) is brought into the investigation of the 'accident' when he discovers elements that suggest the explosion was the act of a terrorist. Agent Pryzwarra (a very fat Val Kilmer) and his team of secretive experts (Adam Goldberg, Elden Henson, Erika Alexander and Bruce Greenwood) introduce Doug to a highly sophisticated machine that coordinates cameras and heat detectors from satellites and security cameras that is able to mix images and reveal the past - a tricky means of examining a crime scene ex post facto to capture the perpetrators. Spurred on with Doug's discovery of a beautiful female body (Paula Patton) washed up from the water before the explosion, Doug examines all the evidence, observing the replay of the days leading up to the explosion, and finally asks to be placed in a time machine to return to the scene in hopes of altering the inevitable and unmasking the terrorist (Jim Caviezel). How this occurs forms the climax of the film, and while many viewers may have trouble swallowing the time travel aspect, the action is so tight and the technique of creating the incident so convincing that few viewers will fail to be wholly involved.The cast is excellent, beginning with Denzel Washington as a terrific lead to the work of Jim Caviezel and all the more minor roles in between. The musical score by Harry Gregson-Williams and the cinematography by DP Paul Cameron heighten the tension of this exciting suspense movie. Grady Harp",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
How to rip off CSI and The Terminator in 5 easy steps,"Had it matched its title just a tad bit more, this movie would have been more believable. When I bought the ticket my mind was somewhat made up that a cop with certain clairvoyance skills would draw a case to a close but man, this time travel thing just gave the movie a wrong twist I can't honestly buy -not to enter the fact that over the first 30 minutes it hints to become a 2-hour-long CSI episode, if one only refers to the electronic incidental music, two guys and a corpse at the morgue, and so on so forth as evidence of my theory, LOL. As a matter of fact, by minute 30 I was already labeling this as ""CSI New Orleans"".Interesting that a movie can be led in a logical and plausible sequence to its very end on such weak pretenses, not to say that this doesn't come too far beyond, either, from being a 1984's The Terminator's failed rip-off. Nonetheless, The Terminator succeeds in passing the time traveling thing over a secondary place, which is not a merit of Deja Vu. You have to forcibly suspend your disbelief on this movie's intended time travel method if you want to get this past and not to find yourself wanting your money back. Otherwise, it won't work.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Denzel in distress,"This is good stuff even if you're not a big sci-fi fan. Crazed patriot blows up New Orleans ferry killing hundreds of people. Denzel is a federal officer investigating the explosion. In the process he identifies Patton as being intimately, if unwittingly, a piece of the crime puzzle. A little further along he stumbles upon Goldberg and his crew, who seem magically able to watch events happening four days in the past. Add some sci-fi spice and garnish and Denzel is trying to rewrite history. Patton is enchanting as the unwitting victim and Denzel is on his A game in a role made for him, as is Goldberg. I dare say this is as good as any Denzel movie out there. Lot's of good excitement with a satisfying if very unexpected wrap.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"You've seen it all before (pun welcomed though not intended), and it's still good","We know that Denzel Washington can helm a thriller and we know that Tony Scott is more than capable of guiding him in such a project, so reasonably, expectations for ""Deja Vu"" are high. Knowing that the film puts a time travel twist on the traditional federal investigation thriller and was the first film to be made in New Orleans post-Hurricane Katrina makes the interest level soar.""Deja Vu"" ends up being one of those movies that meets your expectations. It takes the conventional aforementioned thriller full of CSI and mystery nuggets and combines it with a typical Hollywood sci-fi depiction of time travel. You've seen both before, just never like this, and the result ends up being --like you've seen it before. Deja vu anyone?Washington plays ATF agent Doug Carlin who begins investigating the explosion of a boat in a New Orleans harbor believed to be an act of terrorism. When the FBI gets involved, Carlin gets pulled onto the crack team to figure out who did it. They introduce him to an incredible technology that via satellite allows for an invisible camera to travel four days back in time. Carlin, however, is not only interested in apprehending the killer, but is smitten by a young woman (the Halle Berry-esquire Paula Patton) that while dead in present time is central to the case, and he goes about trying to reverse her fate.Scott's style with the film sort of cleverly imitates that of the ""invisible camera"" that goes back in time. He gets all these sweeping shots of the bay where the ferry exploded and aims to get as many perspectives as possible. If you want a director that will deliver surefire quality in this genre, there are few guarantees other than Scott. It may not be a touching or deep film, but it will satisfy viewers.Washington does his job here too, taking over the film with his presence and giving it the sense of urgency and importance it requires. This is why he can play basically the same part over and over again from movie to movie and no one will say anything about it: he doesn't create a character, he just invests himself into the part. He just sort of makes every role his and it's so convincing that you don't care that you've seen it before.The only thing not ""standard"" about ""Deja Vu"" is that Jim Caviezel was cast as the terrorist, a part usually reserved for an unknown actor in these types of films so that the antagonist is easier to hate. I can't say it makes a difference, because it's immaterial, but what really misses the mark is the film's attempt to insert some post-Katrina-sensitive patriotic themes. The way Scott captures the city with such great awe is testament enough to how it endured, there doesn't need to be anything in the script about it outside of mere setting context.There's plenty of great action shots and mystery unraveling to keep ""Deja Vu"" interesting and the actors hold their own to create a solid film that although not capable of astonishing most viewers, will earn a lot of fans.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Tony Scott has mastered his craft.,"Tony Scott has become a fantastic director during his run in Hollywood doing bigger budget films and cheap shorts. Man On Fire takes a step into an experimental direction that went even further on his next movie, Domino. After Domino Tony could really do anything and have it come out visually stunning. In Deja Vu he takes on the idea of heightened reality with giving a grittier feel to the image and going hand held with plenty of zooms in all the right places. You lose the idea that you're watching a PG-13 film because of this and you get the feeling you're viewing an R rated picture. Like Man On Fire, Deja Vu starts off in one direction and moves quickly into another. It's only every once in awhile that action movies bother to stand out and be different from the heard. Deja Vu dares to do this and succeeds magnificently.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Fails to convince in its central concept but still has some good moments,"A car bomb destroys a loaded ferry on its way to Mardi Gras celebrations, killing hundreds in a terrorist attack. ATF agent Doug Carlin impresses his peers in the early stages of the investigation and is brought onto a select team by FBI Agent Pryzwarra. The aim of the team is to review surveillance footage from about four and a half days before the incident. Carlin quickly smells a rat and is told that the footage is actually made possible by a loop in time and is essentially a live feed from the past. With the murder of Claire Kuchever their only lead, the team start to follow her movements in the lead up to the attack; but can Carlin stay remote from his subjects when they seem so alive in front of him?It is no wonder that the trailer struggled to sell the high concept that this film is built around because the film itself really struggles with it. I'm not even sure where the writers started when coming up with this idea because, although it does have nice touches, it is generally very messy and nonsensical. It is not necessarily a problem in the idea itself but rather in the delivery. Is the central concept in The Matrix (for example) less silly? Well no, but it convinces within the universe created by the film. However with Déjà Vu this is not true and it doesn't manage to sell the idea to the viewer, with nothing really being constant within it and the concept conveniently drifting to help the plot. The problem with this is that it then gets in the way of what is otherwise a perfectly serviceable run-of-the-mill thriller coming out of the Hollywood machine (I don't mean this as a criticise but just an acknowledgement of what it is).As a result it doesn't flow as well as it should because the shaky foundation it is built on keeps on rearing its head. Individual moments are professionally and slickly done to the point that you forget the bigger picture and lose yourself in the moment (Fox's 24 gets by on this same idea of momentum keeping you questioning the past too much) but this doesn't last and soon you can't help but look around you and be unsure.Is it a bad film though? Well, no, it is actually OK but nothing more than that. Scott does all he can be expected to do with the material and he injects as much style and energy into it as he can and does produce a good thriller  albeit a good thriller build on a very, very weak foundation. Washington is a strong presence and he relies heavily on that  turning in an OK but entirely predictable performance. Patton is pretty but struggles to build a character with her position in the film  it doesn't help that the makers decided that she has more value naked in an unnecessary shower scene. Kilmer is solid enough, as are Greenwood, Alexander and Goldberg. Caviezel deserved better than his simple character; he tries hard but can't really be the presence he needs to be.A solid enough thriller then, but just one that is hard to get into and stay with consistently mainly because it fails to deliver its concept in a convincing and engaging way. It has its moments but as a total film it isn't up to much.",,Anonymous,Crime
A decent ride,"Deja Vu is another solid Tony Scott film. I don't love it, but I definitely didn't have a bad time watching it, as is the case for many of my experiences watching his work. It begins feeling a little like Minority Report, though not nearly as futuristic, and does end up feeling more strictly like a time travel movie as it approaches (and then goes into) its final act.Denzel Washington does a lot of the heavy lifting, being reliably good as always, and the film had enough entertaining sequences to feel like a decent way to kill two hours. It's got the right amount of Scott-isms, too; he doesn't overdo his signature style (sometimes he does, and the results can be torturous to watch - see his Taking of Pelham 123 remake or Spy Game for the worst examples of this, in my view).",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Not what I expected and not bad at all,"The previews I saw for this movie led me to believe that it was a supernatural thriller like The Sixth Sense or Stigmata. I never got the sci-fi tech angle from the trailers. That ended up being a very pleasant surprise.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Tony Scott's direction reminded me at times of his earlier films like The Hunger or Revenge. The guy's a painter. The look of the film is beautiful.I read a couple of reviews on here saying that the acting was sub-par. Absolute nonsense. Sure, if you're looking for over-the-top hamminess, this film will let you down. Denzel Washington is understated as an ATF agent based in New Orleans. He's got an easygoing way about him and speaks economically. There's a bit of Sam Elliot in this character. Val Kilmer plays an FBI agent with a big secret. He's believably tight-lipped. Both these performances were fantastic. Too many idiots in this world believe that a person has to be bombastic to truly be *acting*. That's why Tom Cruise has a career.Yes, I'll admit that the time-loop logic is flawed but it's not enough to kill the film. It's not a huge glaring flaw that left me yelling ""Bullsh*t!"" like the one at the end of Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes remake.And along the same lines, I thought that the way the technology was explained was perfect. It was explained exactly the way those characters would have explained it. We're used to films explaining made-up technology to us, the audience, through lots of convoluted on screen exposition. This film chose a more realistic path. ""It doesn't matter how it works. Sit down and help us prevent a crime."" I like that.

"An entertaining, thrilling and intriguing sci fi-inspired action movie","Although it's over-stylized at times with too many shots to count and an over abundance of slow motion scenes, it did grab my attention. I really enjoyed watching Denzel's performance, I really liked his character. Val Kilmer's performance left more to be desired. There wasn't any passion from him, he fell kind of flat. It felt like his character was side-lined. Quite a gripping story and movie though. Wow, Paula Patton is beautiful. There's some unexpected humor sprinkled throughout that I really appreciated. Very interesting concept with the generated images that can look back 4 days ago to any moment in time. The sci-fi elements were very intriguing. The soundtrack is really good. Reminded me of the soundtrack in Hitman Blood Money.Really good storytelling and fast-paced. This movie's a stark reminder of how these people that always commit acts of terrorism - whether it's bombings or shootings - are all mentally unstable people that need help. Mentally unstable people that think they're doing God's work and a service to mankind. Nut jobs is what they are.Plenty of action and full of thrills. Once Denzel's character goes into the future, everything starts to add up and the dots get connected. It's really cool to see why there were bloody bandages at the house and all the other stuff. The logic behind some of the sci fi concepts gets kind of muddled and messy, but for the most part it kind of makes sense. The movie warrants a second watch. This was a very solid movie. It made me think about what that feeling of deja vu really is. Is it something we've experienced already in the past or in our dreams? Highly recommended. Raw score: 7.4/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Have you experienced this before? Quite probably . . .,"Have you ever had the feeling that you've seen something before? Like when you're in a cinema and it all starts looking sickeningly familiar. Tony Scott's new movie starts with a hectic mix of shots of people having a good time but the discordant editing or whatever made me say to myself, ""Any minute now, there will be an explosion or a similar disaster."" I waited another full minute of meaningless collage. If this was TV I need that explosion about now to stop me changing channels. And then, sure enough, Whooooomph! Big explosion. Déjà vu!Denzil Washington is a law enforcement officer (Doug) who cannily discovers, after the explosion, a woman burned to death. Except that closer examination reveals to him that she died beforehand, so her death is probably a clue to the terrorist. He joins an elite force with the technology to see four days into the past. They give him an unbelievable explanation as to how this is done, and eventually a 'real' explanation (which is not done very convincingly either). Doug, being the sad, sensitive type, has fallen in love with the dead woman and offers to be flung back in time to save her  just so he can prevent the devastation of course.About this time you will be getting Déjà yoohoos along the lines of, ""I think I've seen this before  was it in Terminator II or The Prestige?"" At least by this point the explosions-per-minute ratio has ratcheted up a bit, so you may grudgingly feel you're getting your money's worth. But when you realise the two best scenes were in the trailer, it's easier to accept you've been had and just spend the rest of the movie waiting for them to appear.On the plus side, the action does eventually kick in, making it at least better than a bad episode of CSI, and a car chase conducted simultaneously in two time frames stretches the brain momentarily. Against this is a sci-fi element that will be clumsy and unconvincing to the most credulous of sci-fi fans and it bit too daft for those who hate such things. I was touched by the fact that it was made in post-Katrina New Orleans, although they probably needed the tax breaks just to break even.Déjà vu is neither pleasantly mind-numbing entertainment nor intellectually stimulating sci-fi, but is a tolerable action movie with a sweet enough twist. Some of the sets are cleverly constructed and the plot is a bit different to the average cops and robbers movie. Ironically, it is not likely to be a film you will remember.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime

Basic high-priced junk that throws in crazed science-fiction that only eggheads will care about or even try to understand. The film starts promising enough, but dies by its second hour with more outlandish and far-fetched elements that just do not add up at the end of the day. Val Kilmer does what he can, but is not utilized enough here and James Caviezel is totally out of place as our antagonist. Denzel must be congratulated for attempting to take the whole project seriously, but his choice to be in this production is one of life's major mysteries. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,Crime
Clever mainstream action-thriller,"The trailer introduces the premise that a government unit has the ability to go back in time. This premise introduces a unique way of investigating a crime and raises various paradoxes that can occur when time isn't linear.There are multiple subtle (and not so subtle) clues and hints littered throughout the film that hint to the twist. It's a clever film that is simultaneously marketed to appeal to those wanting a mainstream action or thriller. Enter an over the top and angry portrayal of an ATF officer by Denzel Washington and some pretty silly car chase and action scenes.Overall, it's a solid watch that will appeal to most people, even if its 'let's please everyone' approach probably means it will be few people's hands down favourite.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Overlooked modern day (minor) classic - but you think you've heard that before.,"I'll make the obligatory joke early: It seems that I've reviewed this before somewhere Ho. Ho. Ho.The only thing that made audiences shy away was a confusing plot device - that many critics couldn't seem to look past - it is taut, well acted and cracks along for 2 hours, and once you've finished it the first time there is definite merit in watching it again once the pieces all fall into place for you.Denzel isn't a supercop, just a regular cop named Doug from the Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms (ATF) section, which may or way not involve checking kids for fake IDs, I'm not sure.The opening scene gives him reason for involvement by showing the explosion of a big New Orleans Ferry carrying hundreds, perhaps thousands of oblivious passengers, many of them members of the US navy. A car bomb stored in the parking area goes Ka-Boom, and reports put the death toll at 500+.Denzel is called in to check for signs of criminal activity among the debris, and he immediately discovers some suspicious evidence that he passes onto an FBI agent called in to assist, played by Val Kilmer. (I can't remember his character's name, this is Denzel's movie. Move on.) Security footage scrutinized in the following hours and days shows a shady character on the bridge just prior to the explosion, and the situation is labeled an act of terrorism.(It is worth mentioning at this time that many other seemingly minor things go on aside from what is described above, most of them have a pay-off later in the film but seem inconsequential at this point. You need to see the film to understand why.) Among the many bodies in the morgue is that of a young black woman identified as Claire, only her badly burned and charred body showed up before the actual blast, leading Doug to believe that she was killed and left there as a cover up, and that finding her killer might lead to the cause of the ferry explosion.His initial visit to the victim's home causes even more confusion, ""U Can Save Her"" is written on the fridge with plastic kid's magnets, there are bloody swabs and bandages in the bathroom, and when he checks the answering machine he hears his own voice from a message he left the previous day. He decides to concentrate his investigation on solving the Claire murder, and being the team player he is he passes his theory and information onto the FBI.This is where things get messy, and infinitely more interesting.The FBI conscripts Doug into their team investigating the incident, and in doing so provide him with a lot more access and information. Most notably is the availability of a Whiz Bang satellite system that allows the FBI to view events as they happen from any angle they decide: only the camera actually sees events as they occur 4 days and 6 hours previous to ""now"", due to a loophole in some scientific thingo.This seems to be a major sticking point with many people as such a thing obviously does not and (probably) will never exist. The genius of having such a fake reason explaining how they trace the events and ultimately the perpetrator, is that the filmmakers can dictate the abilities and limits of the system to justify plot events and further the story at various times, leading to some suspenseful and exciting scenes later on.Seriously, it is a plot device, don't understand it, just accept it and move on, or turn off and miss a really good second half. We can't fly to Mars yet either, but every year a movie comes out saying we can and no-one blinks an eye, should we penalize someone for making a sci-fi film that is set on Earth and not 3,000,000,000 miles above it?The camera system can only view what the operator is telling it to exactly 4 days and 6 hours previously, there is no rewind and recording can only take place of the current view, it can be directed all over the New Orleans area, can see through walls and can pick up audio of the events on screen. Doug's job is to tell it where to look so that they might find the guy who caused the incident and track how he did it up until ""Boom goes the dynamite"".And they only have three days to go.For some reason Doug comes up with ideas and theories that the FBI guys who invented the system don't think of right off the top of his head, and needless to say they find their man.Doug starts musing on the abilities of the system and starts wondering if it might prove more than an ""Information only"" device.I can't expand further without confusing myself so I won't. I really enjoyed the first ¾ of this film and had already jotted the grade down as a very solid 7.5, but the movie comes home strong, and the final 20 minutes earned it another .5 for sheer audacity.Déjà Vu features a solid believable performance from Denzel despite the leaps of logic that are required, but if you can move past these and watch the movie as a movie, and not a thesis about the merits and capabilities of time travel, you will see that all the events that seemed extraneous in the first half now make perfect sense.In one 6 or 7 minute scene the entire film comes together for the viewer and for Doug's character, and I actually got chills when the pieces all fell into place for me.Final Rating – 8 / 10. Very underrated.

You never know what will happen next and your always going to be left questioning the environment and characters in the story. Things are not what they seem like. With Denzel in a leading roll things don't go bad often and part of the movies charm is his own charisma shining trough. to sum things up it is a mild action movie that, like all movies with the theme this one has, doesn't have a script that adds up 100%.

Amazing Cast Marathon..,"""what if there's more than physics?""It was incredibly brave of Tony Scott and Jerry Bruckheimer to go all in on a thoughtful action flick in the heated milieu surrounding two national tragedies. Dedicated to NOLA and Katrina survivors, driven by a surveillance state in hyperdrive post-9/11, and anchored by a truly awesome sci-fi spin. Performances are ace.

Outrageous yet entertaining movie.,I can justify watching all sorts of movies - as long as they find a way to entertain me - and I guess Deja Vu succeeded in that department - it's quite a fun ride. That being said - the story..... where to even begin!? I couldn't believe my eyes as I read some of the user reviews here - some how some people find it to be good-great!? - That's just wrong! The technology this team have at their disposal is amazing to say the least- the stuff that they can do and the stuff they can't do is pretty mind blowing - all though Denzel doesn't seem to have too much trouble accepting the rules of the game - but he's always on top of thangs I guess. Writing the script must have been one big struggle to try and explain how this whole time-travel thing works. In the end - it doesn't - but if You can ignore this minor detail - the plot being one big hole - then You'll probably be alright.,6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Skip this one unless you only want mindless Hollywood action,"WARNING: Minor Spoilers First off, the movie does deal with Time-Travel but no real explanation given. The only explanation is the wormhole shown buy folding a sheet of paper make point A and Point B intersect which has been shown in numerous movies,by Stephen Hawkins, and probably on the 2nd gen of Star Trek Series.That is the end of the explanation. The government has created a machine that connect Point A to point B. They use it to look back in time and work to prevent a terrorist act.Washington (who is a great actor) does a decent job with the material presented but quite honestly,this move is no better or more realistic than Timecop although it has slightly better acting.If you want to see a good movie about Time Travel then rent Donnie Darko. If you want to see a humorous but unrealistic movie about Time-Travel then rent the back to the future movies.This movie is basically lake house meets Timecop. It has the action segments and the unnecessary love plot just to give en excuse to send Washington's character back to the past.With all this said, if you can turn off your brain, this is not a horrible rainy Saturday Movie when it comes out on DVD.

He usually chooses his starring roles carefully, so, my expectations were high.

The ending could've saved the story IF Carlin didn't ""come back to life"". If he would have ""stayed dead"", the beautiful sub-theme of sacrifice and patriotism would have been better expressed.

Above Average Example of Typical Hollywood Dumb Thriller,"""Deja Vu"" is a movie along the lines of ""Enemy of the State"", where the basic premise is acceptable and the actors likable, but the plot depends on too much contrivance and a lazy script that insults the viewers' intelligence. Contrast this with exceptional genre films like ""In the Line of Fire"", and you can see how much more memorable such a film will be when the plot is both realistic AND thrilling.While I was generally entertained by the action, I was also constantly distracted by things that just made no sense: SPOILERS***** When Denzel Washington's character is shot through the body (not just a flesh wound), he is not at all bothered by it...he is not hurting, not in shock, not inconvenienced or disabled, and not even really bleeding....are these actors and directors intelligent enough to at least add some small element of incapacitation when characters are injured like this? This reminds me of ""The Bourne Identity"", where Matt Damon's character is fished out of the sea with multiple bullet wounds. All he is wearing is a foam wetsuit, yet the bullets stop just inside the skin, as if he had a steel body under the outer layer...this makes him recover immediately after the ship crew digs the slugs out of, oh, 1/2"" inch deep holes...what, no punctured lungs, arteries, nerve damage, internal bleeding? What crap! One has to suspend a certain amount of credulity when viewing fictional films of this genre, but what cretins the screenwriters must think the viewers are when they come up with these amazing computer labs where only a few talented, and very young, people have such immediate access to everything. Anything the lazy script writers find convenient for the plot is suddenly possible with the wiggle of a joystick or the tapping of a few keys. I wonder where the lab is that it can be hooked to the power grid in such a way that it can cause a black out over a huge region? Must be a really big extension cord. Sorry, but a single load cannot do this...I'm in the power industry, but almost anyone can figure this out easily enough.The time warp machine has a limited radius, but it can magically fold time at a remote location over a low power headset device? Geez. We need better writers, Hollywood! That said, the dual car chase, with a car in the present chasing a car in the past was a pretty cool concept.I just got all clammy when Denzel aimed a laser pen at a flat screen monitor showing the folded-time woman in the past, and she saw it on the wall of her house. I don't care how the machine works, a monitor is a monitor and does not work backwards. Even if it was a special two way monitor designed by the creators of the lab, then it follows that the people in the past would all be standing around looking at the funny people in the lab watching them like so many zoo animals...if it is two-way, then all light would go through backwards, not just the laser pen light, for God's sake! I'm just getting started, but you get the idea.In my opinion, this movie will insult and bother intelligent, thinking viewers. Only through deliberate effort can such a viewer shut down their higher cognitive functions sufficiently for the film to be enjoyable.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

"So let me get this straight, you're trying to tell me that on the other side of this bridge, is the actual past?","Déjà Vu is directed by Tony Scott and written by Bill Marsilii and Terry Rossio. It stars Denzel Washington, Val Kilmer, Bruce Greenwood, Paula Patton, Matt Craven, Adam Goldberg and James Caviezel. Music is scored by Harry Gregson-Williams and cinematography by Paul Cameron. Plot finds Washington as ATF Special Agent Douglas Carlin, who takes up the investigation when a ferry is bombed leaving many dead. Struggling thru with conventional investigative methods, Carlin's job receives an unexpected, and bizarre, boost when Special Agent Paul Pryzwarra introduces him to a top secret time machine. The device can show the events leading up to the bombing, but can Carlin avert the tragedy?With Jerry Bruckheimer involved in the production and Tony Scott directing, there's really no surprises as regards the texture of this film. Time travel is the given excuse this time, the premise smothered in bangs, crashes and adrenalin fuelled excess; with Washington adding considerable screen charisma as the focal point. The plot's a bit of a head scratcher if you try and delve deep into it, so best just to sit back and enjoy the ride. Take in the fun to be had with the notion that the cops have a time machine, therefore the baddies (a seriously creepy Caviezel) are at a disadvantage. Shift uncomfortably in your seat at a troubling love story etched into the narrative, and marvel at prime Scott chaos during a split-screen car chase. It's dumb popcorn fodder for sure, but at least it's fun dumb popcorn fodder. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Deja Vu is NOT to be missed,"As most great movies, Deja Vu may be enjoyed on many levels. Many will just enjoy the pure fast-moving entertainment value of the movie - Denzel Washington puts in another stellar performance, and is supported by an excellent cast. About the only thing negative I'd have to say is the lack of depth in the other characters... but that's simply necessary in a 2 hour movie with so much to tell.Many (especially us guys!) will enjoy the sci-fi aspects of the movie... and leave the gadgetry at that. Which is a shame. Because there's so much more that is being intimated here.Of course, there are the romantic aspects that Hollywood must have... and the predictable ending.But the part that excited me most, and I hope gets some others thinking, is what makes this a GREAT movie rather than just another predictable Hollywood moneymaker.And that is those elements that get us thinking... maybe there's really more than just what's in front of our eyes in this experience we call being ""human""? The movie does a really good job at opening up a line of questioning that leading Scientists have been approaching over just the last couple decades... and that many folks exploring ""off-the-beaten-path"" forms of spiritual thinking are doing in greater and greater numbers today.Witness the surprisingly massive audience for best-sellers like Neale Donald Walsh's ""Conversations with God"" series, and more recently Gary Renard's ""Disappearance of the Universe"" and ""Your Immortal Reality"" book series.As these authors and some leading Scientists explain, there may be more to heaven and earth than meets the eye! These authors confirm Deja Vu's premise that parallel threads of ""reality"" are not only possible, but happening as we speak, simultaneously with the only existence we seem to be conscious of in this moment.And as explained in the great spiritual text we would all do well to read, ""A Course In Miracles"", the ""reality"" we seem to be experiencing here is but another dream, and we are the dream makers... so we get to make it up in new and different ways as much as we want. Our job here is to awaken from the dream, and become aware again of who we really are (spiritual beings have a brief, human experience) and where we really are (with God, and all God's sons and daughters).And if that's a bit too far out for you, then just enjoy the movie at whatever level you choose... it's all good!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

That would be OK with me as I liked Denzel in that role. But then it goes off into the space/time continuum and theoretical physicals. Hang on to your hats because this is heavy stuff. No, you really don't need to understand it to follow, but it sure is interesting.Add the usual car chase - Denzel in a hummer chasing a car on a bridge; crashing into several vehicles and sending cars flying in its narrow path - and explosions and firework and you have a thriller with a twist.Paula Patton (Idlewid, London) is definitely one to keep an eye on.

Good show that doesn't fall into the usual traps,"Perhaps it's just Washington's presence, an actor who's always only somewhat serious about himself and about the characters he plays. Anyway, the movie as a whole doesn't seem to take itself too seriously, too. Therefore, in spite of several loopholes and inconsistencies, it provides good fun without getting too heavy or self- important. Points to Scott for that, and let's hope for more entertaining stuff by the Washington-Scott duo. What begins as a seemingly ordinary disaster film turns into a geek-pseudo-sci-fi high-action and even slightly romantic drama. When moving through time is introduced, it is done organically and, again, the movie doesn't make too much of a big deal about it, and - thank the gods - doesn't try to over-explain it. It remains, above all, a good show that's fun to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Good Movie & Entertaining,"I have read some of the comments on here and comparisons to Terminator 2 etc. Honestly I don't see how that connection can be made when the films were not even really related. deja Vu I found was cleverly done and of course similarities to other films CAN be found but then again every film you watch can be tied to another movie in one way or another if you wish to look at it that way rather than watching the movie rather than trying to exploit it with pointless references. IF the movie had ripped another movie off then I could see this point but has there was enough originality in this movie to separate it from a ""clone"" movie I think nitpicking is pointless. I saw comments slating the movie one minute and then praising it the next. Personally I watched the movie and enjoyed how cleverly things were tied up and could read between the lines enough to see where the plot was going. I saw enough in the storyline for this to be original and found the cast excellent and all this gripe about all the action bits being in the trailers I don't understand has the movie came across to me has a thriller NOT an out an out action movie.

The Best Time-Travel Film EVER ! ! ! ! ! !,"Denzel Washington and director Tony Scott ( both collaborators on the hits, ""Man on Fire"" and ""Crimson Tide"" ) team up for the third time on this brilliant film that mixes philosophy, dram and action along with brain-twisting physics.The plot: A New Orleans ferry is destroyed by a terrorist bomb set by an mysterious figure. Detectives trying to solve the shocking devastation are introduced to a special crime solving machine used to reenact murders and other situations after they have occurred. It turns out that one murdered woman, who's been missing, might be the key to solving the entire crime. Can this entire puzzle be cracked? Can they go back in time before the entire scenario even occurred and change all of this from even happening?Review: Everything in this film is excellent. The actors ( Washington, Val Kilmer, Adam Goldberg, Bruce Greenwood and James Caviezel ) are all in top form and fans of them will be pleased; the special effects are used to tell the story instead of being just ""gratuitous eye candy;"" Terrio Rossio ( writer of The Mask of Zorro, Shrek, Pirates of the Caribbean, and other similar Dreamworks/Disney/Bruckheimer fare) and Bill Marsili's script is full of imagination and ideas even worth discussing after the film; Tony Scott works beautifully with what content he hes; while I'm not a huge fan, I will think Jerry Bruckheimer for financing this thrilling adventure; and, last of all, the musical score by Harry Gregson-Williams is a blast! This guy has written electronic/instrumental musical scores for both Tony and Ridley Scott's films, as well as animated ones and video-games, and has never disappointed his audiences.This might be more of a 8/10, but seeming how I throughly enjoyed every minute and want to own this DVD so bad, I'm going to rate it the total amount!See now !",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Time and again,"Tony Scott is a funny director, funny in the sense of bewildering at times. He can bang out an instant classic like ""True Romance, ""Crimson Tide"" or ""Man on Fire"" but also crank out instant turkeys like ""The Fan"" and ""Domino."" He also has directed his share of hackneyed Hollywood fare like ""Enemy of the State"" and ""Days of Thunder."" In the case of ""Deja Vu,"" this quasi sci-fi effort falls somewhere in the middle. The first half is breathtaking, beginning with the abrupt explosion and sinking of a vessel with hundreds of people aboard. ATF agent Denzel Washington investigates, and soon discovers the body of a woman that has washed ashore in the aftermath, but that was actually killed days before the bombing. He senses a connection. Government types show Denzel a sort of time machine, a device that allows them to view events several days in the past. They use the contraption to try to spot the bomber, and this is followed by a wild car chase wherein Denzel uses the device to ""pursue"" the bomber prior to the bombing. From there, things go quickly downhill. Denzel figures the machine can be used to actually travel back in time, and does so. His journey into the past is so preposterous as to ruin everything that went before. While there is shifts it focus to a romance angle between Denzel and the mystery woman. My advice: watch the movie up until the point when Denzel takes off his clothes and climbs into the machine. Then go find something else to do. Better yet, watch ""Man on Fire"" again, which doesn't strike a single false note.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Extremely entertaining movie, although probably impossible","I wasn't exactly sure what to expect when I walked into the UCLA sneak preview, but boy was I glad I went.First off, what surprised me most about the movie was how sci-fi it was. I thought it'd be some supernatural phenomenon regarding deja vu, but it's really not, and even though the story they try to spin is fairly far fetched, it sounds cool. Don't try to analyze it afterwards either because you'll probably find some hole and then you'll think its dumb. Just watch, don't think. Overall though the story was pretty easy to follow.The cinematography was beautiful too, very stylish. The action scenes were intense and very realistic, similar to Tony Scott's other movie Man On Fire, which I thought was pretty good too. Deja Vu compared to Man On Fire? I think Deja Vu wins... but only by a little tiny bit.Denzel Washington is GREATTT as always. Val Kilmer is slightly weak in his role, but not to the point where it's painful to watch. He's also gained some weight... and has a weird bump on his neck. As for Paula, I haven't seen her in any movies before Deja Vu, but she is pretty convincing as well, and not to mention HOT. Acting overall was solid.The ONE thing that peeved me was the extremely WEAK love story that they tried to weave in. No. That's all I have to say.Long story short, go see it when it comes out. It'll be worth your money. 1337",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Engaging action fantasy thriller.,"Wow, the film has an impressively made opening sequence - filled with the ultimate terror, and emotion. The photography is also stunning.The film's first half was incredibly captivating and had me glued to the screen. I enjoyed their simplified explanation of the technically advanced Snow White program. They explained it in a way the guy on the street could understand. However, later it does become more complicated when they start meddling with the past, and what the character experiences and what we see is are different time zones - four days apart, to be exact. Fortunately I understood the set-up, but many people might have a very difficult time following the film, and understanding what is actually happening - and when. It was a bit much to process, but nevertheless fascinating. The film seamlessly blends fantasy and reality.Denzel Washington delivers a powerful performance as agent Doug Carlin. I also enjoyed Jim Caviezel as the antagonist. Unfortunately midway through the film the obligatory love interest enters the scenario, and the film shifts a bit from the issue at hand. Although it never took over the film, it was constant and became the protagonist's main driving force.I also have mixed feelings when time travel movies alters time for the sake of the love interest. Again, not entirely in this case, but to a great extent. Despite this, 'Deja Vu' was a thrilling action thriller with plenty of action and suspense, and excellent all-round performances. This is indeed a top notch production.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Time Travel has never been so Boring!!!!!,"I went into this movie, not expecting much and believe it or not that is exactly what I got. This was another Hollywood attempt to be creative and imaginative. They came no where close... Like in the past, with 'Back to the Future', Deja Vu attempts to have fun with the prospect of time travel. But unlike 'Back to the Future' this was not fun.I am a guy who loves his science fiction movies, from Donnie Darko to Primer. I was blown away by these films...Jeja Vu was a non-stop, time traveling disaster. The plot was weak, the characters you couldn't care less what happens to them and as for the science behind the time traveling... well... lets just say they bought a book called 'Time Travel for Beginners'. There was no suspense and everything seemed to fall into a perfectly neat package. Oh and as for the shocking ending, as Jerry Bruckhimer said on a interview, I'm still waiting for it.If you want to just switch off the brain because you had a hard day, watch this film. If you are a time travel fanatic and sci-fi buff avoid at all costs. Because you will end up wanting to go back in time to tell yourself not to go see it.",2.0,Anonymous,Crime
Denzel Washington tries to deter a terrorist attack upon looking back in time,"After a terrorist explosion of a ferry in New Orleans, an ATF agent (Denzel Washington) joins an experimental FBI surveillance unit that uses space-folding technology to find the culprit and maybe even avert the disaster. While looking in the past he starts to fall for a notable victim of the tragedy (Paula Patton). Val Kilmer plays the head FBI agent and Jim Caviezel the antagonist. Adam Goldberg is on hand as a tech geek.While watching ""Deja Vu"" (2006) I couldn't help thinking of ""Enemy of the State"" (1998) because of the kinetic editing and advanced surveillance technology. Turns out they were made by the same director, Tony Scott, Ridley Scott's brother, who unfortunately jumped off a bridge in Los Angeles in 2012, ending his life at 68 years-old. (Ridley claimed it was due to his secret struggles with cancer while others say it was due to two antidepressants known to cause suicidal thoughts or paranoid ideation).""Deja Vu"" is good, especially the compelling last act. Although it may not be as great as ""Enemy of the State,"" the filmmaking expertise is off the charts, particularly in regards to the depictions of surveillance technology. It's mind-boggling to think of the effort that was put into making everything gel and dynamically move along without confusing the viewer. However, it admittedly does get a little convoluted in the second act with the experimental observation equipment, which culminates with a thrilling-but-highly-unbelievable past/present car-chase sequence.Another problem, a minor one, is the revelation of the terrorist, which brings to mind someone like the infamous Timothy McVeigh. Never mind that 99% of the terrorist attacks the world over are by radical Islamists (e.g. 9/11, Orlando, San Bernardino, Chattanooga, Fort Hood, Boston Marathon, Paris, Nice, etc.).

Great flick until the last few minutes,"I really liked ""Deja Vu"" until the last few minutes (more on that later). The acting (Denzel Washington, Val Kilmer, etc.) was great as you'd expect. The story was creative and very different, in a good way - a totally different perspective than anything I've seen or read before. Special effects were good and surprisingly fewer that I'd have expected (or at least that I noticed).Basically, *everything* about ""Deja Vu"" was brilliant until (drum roll please) the last few minutes. Then, all of a sudden, all good deeds were undone - and exponentially so, to boot. *Everything* good, all the way from the writers to the director to the actors, to the towel boys etc. it was all simply obliterated in a few brief minutes with a really lame and poorly executed ending that wasn't fitting to end a pre-schooler's first film (sorry if I insulted any pre-schoolers). I was just *so* disappointed in the ending that only writings the size of an epic novel would fill my despair. I'll give only one example - so I don't spoil anything. And that is... Since when can a blazer type vehicle get from 0 to ""flip over at spectacularly *high* speed"" in about a 5 foot distance? This is just one of a multitude of sins we observed in the final minutes of ""Deja Vu"". Many other, more serious flaws can't be mentioned without introducing possible spoilers.Seriously, I loved the movie until very close to the end. I would have debated between a 7 and maybe a 9 out of 10. But the ending was so poorly conceived (did I say that? - it was never conceived, they just took some old ""Dukes of Hazzard"" footage or something like that and used it - sorry ""Dukes of Hazzard"" fans, no foul intended) after a brilliant first 100+ minutes of film, that I just couldn't give it better than a 6, and I wanted to give it even less, I was so mad.My bottom line final thoughts - I just can't get over a movie being so brilliantly conceived and executed by so many people. And then at the very end, everyone said ""hey this has worked in other lame movies"". Did they not understand what they had created? It was genius up until the ending. I really believe that whoever was involved with the first 100+ minutes of the movie plot/storyline must have had absolutely no involvement in the last 10 minutes or so of the movie.The ending was a disgrace!

A Very Enjoyable Thriller About Time Travel,"To fellow reviewers, this is about time travel, and second chances. Since by currently known physics, time travel is IMPOSSIBLE, there are going to be lose ends, and things which can't happen, so if you feel that a movie ""insults your intelligence,"" don't go. Every time travel movie is chock full of ridiculous events, because what we all are watching is something quite impossible. That's why, when we walk into a theater, or turn on a TV, we are expected to ""suspend disbelief."" If you can't do that, this movie isn't for you. Go watch a documentary, or get a book on statistical thermodynamics.
For those of us willing to suspend disbelief, this movie grows on you. The main characters are well acted, and, including the villain, are enjoyable to look at. The easy-to-follow story centers around an episode of domestic terrorism, and with new technology aiding in the attempt to catch the culprit. To those looking for the reason for this attack, you'll be disappointed again. Senseless violence rarely makes sense, but for those who enjoy Denzel, action and explosions, have fun!",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
awful,"*SPOILERS* I went to see this movie because of Denzel Washington. I walked out at about halftime, I couldn't take it.Basically, it starts off as a decent detective movie, with nice directing and all. Denzel is good. Then, after about 30 minutes or so, they walk into an FBI center type thing, where there is a machine that is able to display the past (!), but only 4.5 days back (?!), by using satellite imagery. There goes the cop story. At this point I asked my GF whether we could leave, but she wanted to stay a few more minutes. A few minutes later in the movie DW discovers that the machine is actually a time machine (?!?!). Then one of the characters started off with the same old explanation about space-time and demonstrated it by folding a piece of paper. They used words like entropy. At this point we couldn't take it anymore and walked out.According to other posters here, later in the movie DW actually time-travels into the past and changes the future. GREAT. Where can I get my money back?",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
Just really couldn't get into this one.,I still give this a six though because I could see how people liked it but I did not and heres why. I actually had not watched this movie until recently after already seeing the movie Source Code. Although these movies are not the same they are very similar and it just hung in my head because Source Code is better.That clearly is only opinion though. If you look at the facts is was above average. Denzel did a great job as always and it was an original idea I just feel Tony Scott (R.I.P) ;lacks writing in his films and tries to makes up for it with action.This movie is about an explosion that kills 500 people and the ATF send a man to find out who did it. While in fact they actually have this sort of time seeing device which they use to try to find it out.Overall this movie was not bad but like I said Source Code is better obviously a little less now though seeing how they ripped the idea off pretty hard.,6.0,Anonymous,Crime
True potential unrealised,"The concept certainly boasts vision and ambition, but the execution lacks the required ability to make-believe, which is kind of imperative in these kinds of experimental features.When you're incorporating sci-fi elements into a crime thriller, the amalgamation must convince the audience of plausibility, a vague rationale of sorts that will give the spectators a solid reason to immerse themselves inHowever, if you fail to do so, it becomes quite hard to invest in that notion as the aspect of believability takes a drastic hit.I'm afraid that's what happened with Tony Scott's ""Déjà Vu."" Despite helming a unique idea, the outcome could not realize its true potential.If Denzel weren't there in the lead, I highly doubt if it would have even worked in the first place!

a quality suspenseful 2 hours,"This movie was a major surprise! I hadn't heard of it when I watched it with about 30 people & I noticed of those around me, that the sense of suspense I was impressed by, was seemingly much broader appreciated, as you could have heard a pin drop, & looking around twice, I noticed every eye was engaged on the evolving plot of cleverness but delicacy on the screen! Time & again, I didn't see how the plot was about to unravel! I doubt it could succeed. But I was pleasantly surprised, time & again. It did! It did succeed! My only reservations being the flawed improbabilities of the car chase scenes. All I can say is that a 10+ movie in my eyes, became a 10/10.I looked at the protagonist gazing at the images of the past projected before his eyes. He was questioning, even sceptical. But he kept churning through the possibilities into impossibilities! So did the car seller amidst her innocent emerging predicament of trauma into tragedy! And potentially, much more tragedy! Hero & heroine, beckoning, but not without individual flaws! So surely realistic. But evolving into their transformed existences of abstract suspicion but not total distrust, that would have served the interests of powerful interests that covered up most of their conglomerate dealings to their fullest intent of deception, into more deceit & injustice! I was impressed by the time travel aspects presented but acknowledging its shortcomings! I didn't see how it might be sufficiently drawn together, but it was! At least to my satisfaction.A night at the movies I thought would be without much merit, but turned out to be a masterpiece!Personally, I thought it was the superb drama of ""Three Days of the Condor"" updated 25 years! My only reservation being, that I would have given ""Three Days of the Condor"" 10+ that I cannot give this!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Predictable, but alright for brain-dead Thursday hours","I'm not too fond of predictable Hollywood flicks, but hey, I had a free ticket so I thought I'd give it a chance yesterday evening, as I like going to the cinema and there wasn't anything else to see.It would be a lie if I'd say that this one wasn't predictable, at least not in my humble opinion. One could figure out most of the flick pretty fast, and besides the plot, I even found the scene development to be too familiar with the typical Hollywood touch to it; a girl facing herself in the mirror while wearing only her bra on top, the implicit promotion of certain ideals and industries... well, you know it. It kind of makes me wanna throw up, but anyhow... it wasn't too difficult to blindfold oneself for these kind of things and just focus on the plot, as the flick kept a quite decent pace. Even though by judging what's written above might draw one to an easy conclusion that I wasn't fond of the flick it all, I must emphasize that it was after all a quite good brain-dead action.

Takes a while to get going ...,"This movie has a ""scifi-esq"" element to it so it's hard to imagine that it would take a while to get going. Yet, somehow, it manages to stall for the first 2/3 of the movie. Fortunately, it does finally pick up and get interesting.Basically, the movie is about a police officer (Denzel) who investigates a high-fatality ferry bombing. When he is teamed up with a government unit to look for answers, he learns they have a very unusual tool at their disposal: a device that can look back in time.The basic plot sounds like it's going to be incredibly interesting - but a couple of things are off so it is pretty low key for a while. The story is a bit slow in developing and the characters aren't that interesting. Not even Denzel - who is almost always interesting to watch - is not very engaging.The scifi element is interesting, but only for a little while when it is first introduced. Only in the last third of the movie does a feeling of suspense and unpredictability really come to the forefront.I do recommend seeing it if you're looking for an above-average movie.

Entertainment with a little thought,"Déjà vu"" first got my attention by the trailer. It had everything a trailer should have  a cool, recognizable lead; some sort of gimmick; great music; a little taste of the story, yet not too much so that you can't figure it out; and some glimpses of great action sequences. ""Déjà vu"" stars Denzel Washington as an ATF agent, Doug Carlin, who is called to a crime scene where a ferry has just been blown up, most likely due to foul play. Doug seems vaguely familiar with the place, a recurring theme in the movie, hence the title. A body of one of the burned victims turns up, yet not only does Doug sense something familiar about her, the body had been washed up before the bombing.Doug then goes to her apartment, and then things start getting weird. I'll let you discover the weird elements and clues yourself. Just know that the subsequent scenes involve time travel, a crazy ex-Army guy, a car chase where one car is 4 1/2 days ahead of the other one, and a lame ending, that, when you put everything together, makes little logical sense.While I was not thrilled with all the plot holes, everything else is very well done  the car chase I previously mentioned is actually pretty tense and actually believable. Denzel Washington gives another very good performance and director Tony Scott knows how to manage his stylistic camera moves and action scenes.If you're looking for a fun movie that challenges you just a little bit, here it is. It is tense, exciting, action-packed, and somewhat clever  although the script is not as clever as it wants to be, it still delivers most of what the awesome trailer promises.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
More like Deja Pooh,"I've had more thrill-packed poops than Deja Vu.Where to begin? Denzel Washington is NOT a time-traveling do-gooder as he would have us believe. Instead he proves once again why he is one of the most inconsistent actors of our time, delivering a stale, if not poopy, performance. It was like The Crotch Chronicles all over again. Come on, Denzel! Mommy loves you.There are many more problems with the film, but there's not nearly enough room here to list them all (think Gabe Kaplan on a shrink's couch). I don't know what Val Kilmer is doing in this movie. As usual, he makes you long for the poetic subtlety of Robert Hegyes. Here I was hoping this would be the movie where they finally bring back Bull the bailiff from Night Court.What I will say is that Deja Vu has a pretty crazy performance from Paula Patton as Claire. This lady knows where to find the pickle! She's got a bright future ahead of her, if Hollywood knows what's good for it. I read she likes corn.Overall, I do not recommend Deja Vu.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime

It is full of mystery and thrill, it makes you think what if and no way! Mainly this movie is just the type of movie that gets you away from everyday reality and puts you in a situation where you have to think that the impossible could actually be possible! This movie was outstanding in every aspect.It has something for everyone the romantic, the thrill seeker, the action adventurer or even the mystery that is desired by everyone.

Whatever your seeking you can be thrilled and satisfied with this outstanding movie. Watch it! It is worth every penny and every second of your time.",,Anonymous,Crime
Could have been so much better,"SPOILER WARNING: Don't get me wrong, this film was very well made. I was taking note of the techniques used and the effects were not too over the top most of the time.The main problem I had with the film arose towards the very end. The film led up to Denzel Washington's character being unable to change anything in the past - which would have made a much more interesting film... too many movies have been based around people altering the course of destiny.The other problem I had with the film was the practicality of the equipment that the FBI were using. Initially, the film alluded to the equipment using different satellite images and thermo imaging from 4 days in the past to produce a world in which investigators could move around in - that was a very very interesting idea, regardless of how difficult it would be to recreate in today's modern world... I liked this idea much more than the science-fiction turn the film made by claiming to fold the time/space continuum in order to look into the actual past.So in summary, the film wasn't bad, it was just lacking so much more.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"High-class entertainment, anchored by the usual solid Denzel performance","In concept alone, DEJA VU is fairly unique. The government has invented a device that allows time to be manipulated in a way that the actual past can be viewed exactly how it happened. A thought like this could be analyzed forever, but DEJA VU isn't that type of movie, it's an action movie. Which isn't too bad, I guess.Denzel Washington plays Doug Carlin, an ATF agent assigned to a possible terrorist-related explosion on a boat in New Orleans, that has left 543 people dead, including a group of Navy sailors on leave. It is clear very quickly that the explosion was a bombing, not an accident. A woman (Paula Patton) with significant burns marks washes up on shore, but Carlin believes that she was not on the boat, making her a key part to investigating the baffling crime.Called to a secret operation involving the said time warping instrument, Carlin finds himself over his head. FBI agent Pryzwarra (a very chubby Val Kilmer) and a group of techies (played by Adam Goldberg and Elden Henson in a couple of seriously funny bit parts) explain that they can go back in time four days and see the past. Things get interesting when not only does Carlin start seeing the past, but starts living in the past. The movie's most exciting and conceptually innovative scene is a car chase in which Carlin chases after a person who is actually in the past. Trippy? I think so. In all seriousness, it is one of the best chase sequences of any kind ever put into a film.While the film is almost great, it stops short of greatness. Where similar sci-fi masterpieces such as THE MATRIX capitalized on its epic, mind-bending concepts, DEJA VU wimps out in a way at the end, closing on a good note, but only after a disappointing final scene. Overall though, it is high-class entertainment, anchored by the usual solid Denzel performance and with restrained direction from the usually frenetic Tony Scott (DOMINO, anyone?), as well as a thought-inducing premise.Review written by James Chapel for www.boxofficefanatic.com",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Solid first half,"I gave DEJA VU 7 stars because of a slam-bang, tension-filled first half. The second half detracts from the score, as the movie goes off in the wrong direction and comes to an implausible finish, even for a science fiction movie (and make no mistake, this is a science fiction flick). Washington stars as a cop investigating the bombing of a ferry that kills hundreds, including many servicemen. The mystery of the event deepens with the discovery of a woman's charred body miles downstream. A bunch of mad scientists working in a big, expensive lab show DW using their newly developed wayback machine a way to view the immediate past, in an effort to figure out the who and why and when of things leading up to the explosion. OK so far. But then, the movie shifts into time travel, and other than Jim Cavaziel popping up as the mad bomber, interest quickly wanes. Sort of like the second half of EVENT HORIZON, when Sam Neil becomes Pinhead. Not one of DW's best, for sure. You have to see him in his undies, curled up in a tiny box, being flung into the past via the mad scientists' wayback machine. I'd like to say, what was he thinking?

Sophisticated thriller with a tad too many explosions.,"Massive fan of time travel stories and films, and also a fan of Denzel so it seemed a good choice to watch Deja Vu.A ship containing a load of navy officers and their families is blown up and AFT agent Denzel Washington arrives on the scene to investigate. He soon gets mixed up with a special crime investigation unit who claim to use some kind of mechanism to look back in time. As it turns out there's a little bit more to it than that, and Denzel finds himself falling for one of the female victims of the disaster.I don't want to spoil the plot too much but it's the kind of film you need to watch twice to get the full low-down on the plot, I do need to go back and watch it when I get the chance. Also look out for Jim Cazviezel, he also starred in Frequency - another great time travel film which might just be a tad better than Deja Vu.In some parts it is a sophisticated thriller, whereas in others it ends up being a tad OTT - lots of explosions, classic Bruckheimer style. But don't let that take it away from it.Val Kilmer is also in this, although he is wasted really - he gets a lot of screen time but his character does little to help the story.

Clever manipulation makes a generic scenario seem fresh,"A serviceable action thriller, given your typical Tony Scott quick cuts and typical Denzel Washington protagonist, still manages to rise slightly over it's tired mechanics with the inclusion of a well integrated science fiction element. For the first half hour of Deja Vu, viewers may be shaking their heads in disappointment, fearing that they are watching the same old mainstream cop mystery they have seen a thousand times over. Scott's typical direction does not help freshen things up either. What was once entirely stylish, edgy film-making has become completely predictable with grainy coloring, frenzied editing, and generic scoring somehow making the film feel dated more then it has any right. Viewers are taken through a typical detective procedure, as Washington's tired ATF agent tries desperately to gather clues from a massive explosion that rocked a newly opened New Orleans port. Certainly not a chore, the setup here remains completely average with hardly an effort made to differentiate this film from the many others like it, some starred in and directed by this team themselves.Thankfully, once the routine plot mechanics are set into play, Deja Vu finally offers up what will separate this popcorn movie from countless imitations. Borrowing from what made guilty pleasures like Strange Days such voyeuristic fun, the neat concept this script introduces, regarding what seems like the ultimate in surveillance security, will help take the generic thriller to fairly unique sequences. Toying with concepts of time travel while centering around this cat-and-mouse game helps Scott get some extra mileage out of the vehicle, and finally gives him a reason to implement all of the hyperactive edits he relishes in so much. Rather then barraging viewers with an onslaught of creative direction (which has been shown to prove contradictory and excessive with previous releases), Scott wisely finds a proper venue to work his magic. It is in these dazzling sequences of omniscient direction, when Washington is monitoring potential subjects with the precision of an infinitely floating camera eye, that any unique perspective and technical accomplishment shines through the otherwise predictable work.Suffering from a typically bland lead performance from the uninspired Washington, a confusingly underwritten antagonist played by Jim Caviezel, and a denigrating plot twist that makes the far-fetched reality behind this seem even sillier, Deja Vu is still a trip worth taking once (though no need to repeat!) for the brief stride hit in the middle which elevates the stereotypical proceedings with a fresh sheen of techno-paint.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

"If you can work out the resolution, then congratulations...","Have I seen this before? Sorry, an obvious blundersome and unworthy introduction, probably brought about by my recent viewing of another of Val Kilmer's movies, TOP SECRET, where he meets a French Resistance operative named Déjà Vu who introduces himself with the line ""'Ave we not met before monsieur?"".As part of their investigation, Doug Carlin, Agent Andrew Pryzwarra and Jack McCready, investigators of a post Katrina New Orleans ferry terrorist attack in which over 500 persons are killed, are viewing on screen the events of four and a half days previously. Initially, Denzel's character thinks he's watching simple enhanced satellite and CCTV footage, but then realises there's more to it than that. He then at one point flashes a penlight at a supposedly four day old image of a girl on the screen and she reacts to it. It turns out that this is a system which, through the bending of the oft-taken-advantage-of space-time continuum, enables them to actually watch, live, the events of four days previously and that the observers can also interact with the observed. So, the premise goes on, if we can watch the said events, can we influence those events? Denzel's character's motivation is the simple fact that he has already seen this girl's body in the morgue, and now he may have a chance of saving her life. And she's cute. First they send a document back, then, inevitably, they send Denzel himself back.There's an interesting chase sequence where, with the aid of some hi-tech jiggery-pokery head-set jobby (a goggle-rig they call it), Washington chases a four day old image of the suspect's vehicle, with the current-day world in one eye, and four days previous in the other. It is admittedly imaginative.As with all films of this type though, there is the problem of the paradox. If the motivation for changing things in the past is removed, then those events will not be interfered with and will therefore occur. It's not a spoiler, but if you have to go back in time to save someone's life and succeed, then there is no reason to go back in time, so you don't, and therefore they will die, so you have to go back in time etc etc. It's a no-win scenario. Also there is the problem that if, as the technos tell us in the movie, that nothing can be sent back, why have they got a chamber constructed, that will hold something the size of a man, in order to do just that? However, as I've said, it is imaginatively done and will keep you hooked from start to finish, and Washington gives a great and easy looking performance, which is a skill in itself.And if you can work out the resolution, then congratulations.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

As he attempts to solve a crime, our protagonist ends up falling for and stumbles across an unusual solution to finding a killer. The film is well written, and has a lot of material that we rarely see in such high profile blockbuster films in this day and age.Throughout the film, it is quite fairly biblical in its themes of redemption and resurrection. The story is a stretch, to be sure, but the storytelling is crisp and engaging. What makes Deja Vu a great popcorn film, is not only the acting from Denzel, but the overall storytelling of the film.

Enjoyable but ultimately forgettable - 60%,"Recently, I've been spoiling myself by rewatching some absolute gems on DVD. Reacquainting myself with the likes of ""The Lord Of The Rings"" trilogy and ""WALL·E"", it's easy to forget that not all movie are stone-cold classics. Take this middling effort from a couple of year ago. Despite having a big-name lead actor, a director with a proved track record and a superstar producer, it just failed to excite and entertain me in the way I expected. To be honest, I had high hopes for this (certainly the excessive publicity around the time of release suggested this was a corker) but ironically, I suppose hindsight is a wonderful thing.Denzel Washington plays AFT agent Doug Carlin, called in to investigate a massive explosion on a New Orleans ferry. But after meeting FBI agent Paul Pryzwarra (Val Kilmer), Doug is offered a unique opportunity. Using the latest technology and advances in surveillance, the team use a window into the recent past to uncover the bomber and investigate the murder of a young woman (Paula Patton) who appears to be connected to the bombing. And as Doug begins to develop feelings for the woman, he starts to wonder if he can really change the past for the better.It's difficult to specify why ""Deja Vu"" isn't the runaway hit I thought it would be. The plot, while clearly nonsense, offers enough to keep the viewer interested thanks in no small part to Washington as the increasingly perplexed agent. The problem is that like nearly all time-travelling movies, the plot ultimately lets itself down. This isn't a problem with stuff like the ""Austin Powers"" movies which don't take themselves seriously but ""Deja Vu"" takes itself very seriously indeed. Personally, I felt a strange sense that nobody was really trying. The action, when it eventually comes, never felt like it was pushing any boundaries and the story takes a long time to get going. At no point did I go ""oh, that's cool"" or see anything that I felt I hadn't seen before. In a weird way, it reminded me of another Denzel flick ""Out Of Time"" which wasn't a classic either but through good story-telling and another magnetic performance from Washington, it was eminently watchable. ""Deja Vu"" is just that, a fine film to watch on TV if nothing else is on but nothing more.Maybe I've been spoiling myself with classic DVDs too much but in truth, ""Deja Vu"" isn't in the same league as what I've been watching. Yes, Denzel gives another performance that reminds us why he has a Best Actor Oscar on his mantelpiece but with a typically confused time-travelling plot and lazy direction, it doesn't match the performance Denzel gives it. Like ""Out Of Time"", he is a big fish in a small pond. With a little more effort and a better ending (which badly let the film down), this may have been the classic I thought it was but sadly, this is a wasted opportunity that's gone by begging.

Haven't I Seen This Crap Somewhere Before?,"In the final analysis, this is a time travel action flick, with a few good lines of dialog, and a heroine with nice breasts.The plot has enough holes to drive several Hummers thru sideways.There is no depth whatsoever to any of the characters here.Tell me how Denzel Washington plays ""chicken"" on a suspension bridge, without killing anyone or himself, and without getting nailed by the police? I kept hoping something better was coming around the bend, but it just kept spiraling down into tinseltown pyrotechnics.In fact, there was a movie just like this about 10 years ago, same plot, same ending, same bogus science, and it was just as disappointing.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
A film with potential shoots itself in the foot,"If you're looking for a film that is different, a little out there, and plenty of fun then Deja Vu is the film for you. Denzel Washington stars as an ATF agent who is investigating the tragic bombing of a New Orleans ferry. In order to track the bomber down Washington is introduced to a top secret government technology that allows him to view the past. When Washington draws connections between the bombing and the murder of a young woman he starts to watch her past as it unfolds the mystery in a smart yet fairly far-fetched film.Deja Vu heavily demands the suspension of disbelief. The film starts out pretty clever with this super secret technology that transcends time and space. The movie tries very hard to explain this technology and there are points where you just can't buy it. It is undeniably ridiculous at times but watching this unbelievable technology at work in the film is pretty fun. The whole film is fun, it just demands a lot of slack because it can be too much at times. But I have to give the film props for making a more or less coherent story out of this far fetched and fairly unique idea. And there is a nice amount of movie magic at work here because the film is loaded with good actors. These actors portray characters that believe in what is going on, and it allows us to believe it as well.The sad thing about this film is that despite any brains it has, it ends up shooting itself in the foot by being a formulaic and clichéd action flick. It has the familiar action movie score that doesn't stir any kind of emotion and is sort of just there to add some fat to the film. Tony Scott's jumpy cuts in his direction are more obnoxious than thrilling and overall it has that action film feel to it that is just too typical for me to enjoy much. It is a feeling that is hard to put into entirely into words, but anybody can recognize it once they see the music, direction, and script come together. And of course with any below average action flick Deja Vu has a very weak script at times. Throughout the film there are lines which just make me hang my head. Lines that easily could have been cut to create a much better film.There are a lot of things you have to look past to enjoy Deja Vu but if you can then it isn't a terrible film. It isn't great but there is a faint unique flare in here that makes it more or less worth the two hours of your time. You have to take the movie's technology and ideas for granted as there are times that it doesn't exactly add up. But the film is different and has smart aspects that sadly end up being shot down by action film clichés. And then to add insult to injury the film has a terrible ending that could have been done so much better. It's unfortunate but it's just another thing to accept for what it is. Overall Deja Vu just earns a big shrug.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"An absolutely average thriller, where central idea fails to be credible.","When a bomb destroys a passenger ferry in New Orleans, killing hundreds of people, investigator Doug Carlin is recruited to a special investigative unit, which aims to uncover the perpetrator using video surveillance footage four days before the attack. But Carlin soon realizes that, after all, they are using a ""wormhole"" that allows them to watch, live, what happened in the past, within that restricted area where the attack took place.Well, what we have here is an original idea. We have seen a series of films, mostly pure sci-fi, that explore the idea of ""wormholes"" linking the present with the past and allowing time travel. What we have here goes a little further, with professional surveillance machinery that overcomes building walls and ravages people's privacy most easily (which, if one day is true, is at least a terrifying prospect). Although the film's central idea is imaginative and has little credibility, the movie plays well with that and the possibilities, positive and negative, of altering the past: paradoxes, alter egos, we have it all. Nevertheless, I did not always feel convinced. As I said, there are credibility flaws. The biggest problem this entails is that this is the only differentiator of this movie... without this issue of time travel and ""wormholes"", the movie is a trite thriller like so many others.Tony Scott, whom I didn't know until this movie, seems to have done a decent job. I liked the work of Denzel Washington, who is an extremely capable actor, even when he has no material at his height and experiences a boring and banal character, as in this case. Val Kilmer has a faded and discreet character that is not well suited for the actor, and Jim Caviezel also received bad material and a weak character. Paula Patton is the victim, serving only to die or appear half-naked in scenes designed to attract male audiences.From a technical point of view, it is a regular movie that brings no surprises. A trite photograph without great artistic elements, a discreet soundtrack and unremarkable visual elements. Special effects, with all the explosions, chases and action scenes, are the most striking technical element of the movie.This is an absolutely average thriller, which only stands out due to a conceptual originality of the script, which was not always presented and developed as effectively as it should.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

It is about some guys who invent a time machine and is really nicely put together on a very low budget. The reason being that it doesn't tie up the loose ends so you'll literally spend hours trying to figure out what the hell is (or was) going on.As with this film, if they had tied up the loose ends completely, it would've been dull.

A Well-Produced and Compelling Thriller,"10 December 2006. This richly dense action-thriller has Denzel Washington as his typical but well cast character in this well thought out script that uses the idea of time and space in a superb manner. In one of the best genre thriller of its type, this consistent execution, high-quality production provides an intellectual and mostly satisfying experience. the movie also contents musical strains reminiscent of the intense and action-focised Bourne Identity series (2002) that also offers a similar strength and sharpness the movie's appeal. Except for a ""Stargate"" (from the movie and television series) like structure that unnecessarily detracts from the scene and the obvious impossibility or at least gigantic leap of science two-thirds way through the movie, such lapses are minor compared to the intensity and small deja vu clues that actually enhance the movie till the end.

"""Hey, i think we've seen this film before""","I have a problem with 'travel back in time films'. If you go back in time you have the potential of killing your father or another ancestor hence your 'future' existence is impossible. What happens if you 'meet' yourself? That being said this was a great action picture with a breathtaking opening scene. It will definitely be one for the DVD player to pause/rewind and watch it in slow motion.Denzel Washington plays the archetypal, non-conformist, ""ill do it myway coz i'm smarter than you"" ATF agent as Doug Carlin. I'm not sure why the ATF were involved in a terror attack or even the FBI. Surely it would have been Homeland Security who would have carried out the investigation? He gets recruited to join a top secret FBI operation that has found a way of viewing events from the 4.5 days ago as they happen 'live'. Of course it uses masses of electricity and has been used to explain the various North American blackouts that have occurred over the years.As a sub-plot he is also assigned to solve the mysterious murder of a very attractive young lady, Claire Kuchever, who appears to have died from injuries similar to the terror attack victims. Doug is like a dog with a bone and won't let go of his hunch. With the FBI and their super viewer he tracks down the terrorist and brings him to justice. The FBI ""powers that be"" then orders that the ""viewer"" be shut down because the case is solved.At this point I thought we might be in for a typical ""conspiracy theory 'the Govt was behind the attack"" tangent. But no. Doug goes off on his quest to save Claire and win her heart.Provided that you don't think too much about the whole travel back in time thing then this movie is fast paced and well done.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Another Touchstone...,"This movie was a piece of work. Up from the very beginning we get a surreal image of New Orleans' people being ""grateful"" about Katrina. That is pictured by a slogan saying ""Katrina only made us stronger"". Then, there's the Fox News helicopter being the only one covering the ferry. Of course, the whole movie seems part of the relentless post 9/11 scare mongering tactics. Too many direct and indirect allusions to ""support the troops"" and ""mission accomplished"" makes it a blatant propaganda piece. The little sci-fi part was absolutely pathetic. Don't get me wrong, I like being lied to for entertainment's sake, but way too many trivial things didn't add up.The acting, while backed by names like Denzel and Val, was not anywhere near what the standard of a ""good movie"". The only thing the movie had going for it, was the very good job Tony Scott did with the action scenes. All in all, go see this one if you're a lobotomized action fan. Otherwise, better skip it.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
"The usual Denzel performance, with a strong, subordinate, supporting cast","As an exciting, involving, thought provoking thriller, this film was an excellent example, and a great addition to the many other exciting thrillers of its type. It had the formula, the gimmicks, the characters, story, and the personalities.Unfortunately, the formula of this movie was also based on the same character that the very competent Denzel always plays. Look closely, and you can see the same persona, same acting and reacting, and same influences and events in this movie that you see in almost everything else Denzel is in. He is the star, up against an incalculable amount of adversity and stress, including most of the other characters around him. But, as always, his character's ego is big enough to take care of the problem.In every hi-tech, or not so hi-tech, story line our hero is in, the script demands that he manually manages the rest of the cast. This management is accomplished by the innuendo of shaming all of the others into their proper places, so that Denzel can accomplish his super hero mission and goal in the plot. A closer look might even suggest a very carefully concealed bias, or even racism, in Carlin, Denzel's character. This character always seems to find it necessary to put all of the others in their places, because all of the other character's explanations of technical conditions don't match what Carlin expects to hear? Presumably, this lecturing, or boisterous act of holding the rest of the cast accountable for every word they utter, sort of shows a little bit of self-infatuation. And, for further food for thought, could we picture Carlin behaving the same way toward a room full of black computer/time warp whizzes, as opposed to the white ones he seems to try to belittle? As a further bemusement, isn't this all too common necessity of the cynical trademark lecture to the subordinates or supporting cast getting a little dry? From a very middle of the road, neutral standpoint, and with an open mind, one can see that though he, Denzel, is the one doing the lecturing, it would be infinitely more logical if he were the one being lectured to. Or even belittled? The nonsense of his scolding the rest of his accomplices for not being clear in their explanations of technical conditions is strictly theatrical, and wouldn't hold any water at all in the real world of science and research.Other than character flaws of this type, that are generally inherent in most ensemble settings, this movie has merit. The unbelievable plot is almost believable, and the film has enough going for it that it should be entertaining to a wide audience. The terrorism theme hits home, since almost everyone is familiar with it to some degree, and there is enough intrigue to hold most audience's attention. Also, as always, Denzel is the perfect and charming gentleman towards the opposite sex. After all, the hero should always be charming and magnetic to help form that hero and rescued girl combination.From the standpoint of story telling, this one is good. From the super hero character standpoint, it is mildly flawed. For an escape, the story is definitely recommended. Just don't pay to watch it hoping to attach any credibility to it.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Good beginning ... lousy ending,"I watched this film with great anticipation especially with actor like Denzel Washington. For most part, it was very entertaining but the ending ruined it. Although I'm a Sci-fi fan, the story line just doesn't gel. On one hand, everyone was saying that history cannot be changed and whatever that had happened, happened. For most part of the show, it seemed to follow that logic - and I liked that. But towards the end, everything starts turning the other way round. The story fell apart! I felt that the ending was done in a 'convenient' manner. I was hoping that the ending would be more thought provoking or at least with a twist.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
typical Tony Scott vehicle (which is not necessarily a bad thing),"Denzel Washington plays an ATF agent being sent on a terrorist attack site and assigned to a special and secret FBI team to maybe, possibly, go back in time and avoid the incident to occur. He plays his character straight forward without frills and thereby, I guess, finds the right note in such preposterous story.I had a problem with the following: Washington's character's transition from meticulous cop to action superhero is too sudden. Also, his character seems like a nice and caring and, again, meticulous guy and, yet, once behind the wheel, he causes so many accidents and damages, putting many other people's lives in danger, without looking back even once. He does request paramedics to be sent on one of those crash sites but you don't see the call being made. This is something recurrent in Batman movies, for example, and has been parodied by the ""Hancock"" movie.Nevertheless, this being a Tony Scott movie, you know what to expect: a good-looking no-brainer where you ought to just relax and enjoy the show. That's all it intends to be and does perfectly.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Thinking Man's sci-fi,"'Deja Vu' is definitely a film that you haven't felt like you've seen before *boom boom* - it's actually as 'original' as any modern Hollywood film is going to be. And by that I mean it's probably quite similar to a few others, but presented differently enough to make it worth a watch. And, if that's not enough of a recommendation, it has Denzel Washington in it. What more could you want? The ever excellent Denzel plays a cop who has to investigate a domestic terrorism incident where someone blows up a boat full of naval servicemen and their families as it draws into port in New Orleans. However, instead of taking witness statements and making public appeals, he chooses to team up with a shadowy government agency who have invented a machine that can 'look into the past.' However, just because they can peek into the past, doesn't mean they can easily identify the killer. Unfortunately, the machine can only look into the past exactly four and a half days ago – and time is constantly moving forward. Even in the past. Confused? Don't worry. Denzel will explain it better than I can.Although, it is one of those films where you do have to pay attention. It's not one where you can check your Instagram account and wander off for a cup of tea. I'm not going to go into how the plot unfolds, as there's more to it than I've mentioned. If you're slightly put off by the sci-fi element, don't be. It works on many levels. Obviously, there's a strong sci-fi feel to it, but nothing too over-the-top and the machine has a 'real' look to it, like it could really exist in our world. However, it's primarily a cop movie where the good guy has to track down the bad guy. So, hopefully it should appeal to more than just fans of the sci-fi genre. And, obviously, you have Denzel. He'll probably never win any Oscars for his performance here, but it is definitely enough to lift the film to even higher heights.Don't expect wall-to-wall action. This is definitely not a 'Transformers' movie. And it's all the better for it. Get ready to follow closely and see what the future holds for the war on terror.

A sleeper in '06,"Deja Vu really flew under the radar. For it to not have gotten much attention and much publicity, it was very good. It was a good mix of sci-fi, mystery, and suspense. This movie took the age old and much revisited issue of time travel and put a different spin on it. Instead of a machine that gives one the ability to travel back and forth through time to any time or era, the government developed a highly experimental machine that can view exactly 4 days and some odd hours into the past. With Bruckenheimer being part of the production team, you had to expect something decent. Denzel plays his role well, as can be expected, but this movie was more about the story; the who-dun-it aspect of it, the is-he-going-to-be-able-to-do-that aspect of it, and the makes-you-think aspect of it as well.

Anybody with a shred of intelligence, and a natural inclination to make sense of things, will find themselves crying for a resolution to this plot until the very end.

"Like a good wine, Scott matures with ""Deja Vu""","""Deja Vu"" is an intelligent and sophisticated thrilled from master craftsman Tony Scott, and sublime actor Denzel Washington, that delivers on all counts: plot, acting, script, cinematography, score, action, tension and coolness factor. James Caviezel is one of the best on-screen villains in a long while. And it's not just Washington who falls for his leading lady, Paula Patton, we all do. She is stunning and believable without the prima donna factor of her ingénue predecessor, Halle Berry.Easily one of Scott's best films in the last decade, if not a contender for one of his best ever. I would rank this one above the top-notch, ""Man on Fire"", simply because it is not so dark and more accessible, i.e. it's not just a guy's flick like so much of Tony Scott's canon.This film is deserving of the same level of audience attention his blockbuster smash hits with Tom Cruise generated in the 80's and 90's with ""Top Gun"" and ""Days of Thunder"". However, unlike those populist, decade defining films, this one is not pure pabulum for an excess-craving masses. ""Deja Vu"" has a brain working hard beneath its visually arresting exterior. It's concerned less with glamour than with its chief purpose, time-busting. This pays off in dividends, as it ranks as one of the most well thought out and believable time travel films ever made.More poignant than ""Domino"", with little to no ""cheese factor"", it feels like, ""Deja Vu"", is the film Scott's been attempting to make for the last half-decade since ""Spy Games"" in 2001. In 2004 he conjured character and mood with the revenge themed ""Man on Fire"", then O.D.'d on form and style with a saturated palette in ""Domino"". Having worked those forces out, he's cleared the way for this toned-down, grown-up thriller.The various techniques Scott uses to take his audience on a visceral ride: the blending of film stocks, ""Domino""; technological wizardry, ""Enemy of the State""; cojones, ""Man on Fire""; awesome car-chases, pick a film; and great romantic intensity, ""Top Gun"", are all contained in ""Deja Vu"".""Deja Vu"" grabs you by the heart and brings your brain along for the ride. Two hours fly by and you've lost track of all time, literally. A reviewer I know has a reverse scale for rating films. She judges them by how many times she looks at her watch during a film, no watch glances equals a great film.This film grips its audience with the engaging premise of reweaving the fabric of time. With flawless execution, ""Deja Vu"" achieves its goal so masterfully, viewers will quickly forget their own investment of time with nary a watch glance.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Much, much better than the last Washington/Scott movie, Man On Fire.","Even Tony Scott's irritating tendency to over stylize his direction cannot stop Deja Vu from being a great piece of action cinema. The complex and involving story, coupled with great performances from its talented cast (including Denzel Washington, Paula Patton, Val Kilmer, and James Caviezel) ensure that you soon learn to ignore Scott's annoying visual techniques and concentrate on the story being told.Washington plays Doug Carlin, an ATF agent called in to investigate a terrorist explosion on a New Orleans ferry. Impressed by Carlin's efficiency, FBI Agent Andrew Pryzwarra asks him to join a special team who are utilising a high-tech piece of surveillance equipment to try and solve the crime.The boffins on the team tell him that their top secret gadget reconstructs the crime scene in 3D via some satellites and a whole load of computer imaging software. Carlin (quite rightly) suspects they are lying to him, and eventually manages to get them to tell him the truth: the machine is able to warp the fabric of space, enabling them to actually see into the past.Carlin wonders whether it might be possible to use the machine to actually travel into the past in order to prevent the ferry disaster, and also to save the life of a beautiful woman who somehow holds the key to the identity of the terrorist.Starting with the simply amazing destruction of the ferry (one of the most impressive cinematic explosions I have ever seen), Deja Vu keeps the momentum going right to the exciting climax in which Carlin is sent into the past to confront the maniac responsible for the bombing. Like many time-travel tales, the story throws up the possibility of all manner of paradoxes, and one is advised not to question the science too much, but just sit back and enjoy the ride.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

A great achievement in mediocrity,"This film succeeds in three ways. The first: you can smuggle a sci-fi plot onto the big screen if you put enough A-list actors and big money behind it and use the leftover music from Bad Boys 2. The second: You can totally destroy a sci-fi script if you load the production with A-list actors in a vain effort to pass it off as a mainstream film. Thirdly and most importantly, if you are an aspiring filmmaker or screenwriter, you have hope. This was reported the biggest ""spec"" script ever picked up by a studio for seven figures and it's not that good, although there are some interesting plot elements. One can only hope that merely decent writing can do even better. This film has so many needless visual elements and effects it's comical. If I didn't know any better, this film was made as a writing lab exercise for film students to learn what NOT to do in film-making. The dialogue is laughable. There are two lines in the film that the entire movie seems to be written around. Once again, as destiny prevails, a sci-fi film will never win an Oscar.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
Wow!!,"Other than knowing it was a Denzel/Bruckheimer (sp?) movie, which was enough to get me there, I didn't know what else to expect. I saw a trailer at a Focus Group on ""The Sentinel"" and decided it looked intriguing enough I was going to see it. I definitely wasn't disappointed! One thing I would like someone who hasn't see it to pay attention to though and comment on. This won't spoil the movie at all, just watch and please report back.I have heard of theater's/ studios changing certain aspects of a movie for different regions. I want to know if this is the case in this movie. On the front of the ambulance, there was an ""Olathe Ford"" license plate on the front. That is the city I viewed it in. Is this in all the theater's? If so, bravo to their (Olathe Ford's) PR people or maybe just a coincidence?",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Great, Quality Entertainment",Saw this tonight on filmflex and read the reviews before choosing it. Denzel is usually a good bet and we decided to go for it. After nearly 2 hours we felt thoroughly entertained - if not a little confused about the time-travel. This is a great movie and I really don't understand that bad reviews.All the main actors delivered. The plot which is not without it's loopholes (but it doesn't matter) keeps you hooked and things are explained well throughout in the main. It's what a film should be - ENTERTAINING! I think some of the reviewer on here have forgotten that.For me it was money well spent and I would certainly recommend it.,9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Like this flick,"I really liked this movie - lots of great time-slip foreshadowing and well-thought ""time machine"" twists. It is very difficult to impress me with a time twist anymore - and this one was a lot of fun to watch. Denzel is also a lot of fun as a plainspoken ATF agent amidst what initially appear to be stuffy techs who don't really know how to apply their amazing technology.In the end I think most everyone will really like this ride and find a surprise around every corner - I won't write any spoilers - but if you really like time-travel or techno thrillers, this one's for you.And by the way - pay closer attention to the first time you watch it - then watch it again. There are just tons of little twists that you'll pass over when you first watch the movie - and watching it a second time is a blast because they all come rushing at you. I think the directors intended this considering the theme of the film.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
You should all be ashamed,"I came to IMDb after seeing this movie hoping to be told that it was a farce, and meant to be a campy action flick. I'm not sure what writers get paid these days but obviously not as much as the special effects guys. Who needs a good story anyway? This one was more likely to appear on Days of Our Lives than the big screen. Clumsy, awkward, forced, contrived, devoid of pretty much any redeeming quality unless you can wear ear plugs and watch the movie purely for the special effects. By the end of the movie I was laughing out loud at the ridiculous plot developments and had several times convinced the two people I was with (a man and woman 25-35) to stick through the movie in hopes there was a redeeming ending. I was disappointed that I indeed had wasted another Sunday afternoon watching an over-budgeted mess.",2.0,Anonymous,Crime
Fantastic,"One of the best thrillers sci-fi movies. Everything is great about this movie (actors, story etc).

worst movie of the year,"""Deja vu"" is the worst movie of the year. Denzel Washington, in that movie, looks like somebody whose asking himself "" what am I doing here"", ""why did I accept to do this stupid movie"". You feel like the actors are making fun of you. The actors are so bad. They do not believe at all in what they're doing. The story is so unrealistic that you'll start laughing. I can't believe that an actor as good as Denzel Washington accepted to play in that kind of movie. I can even say that it's one of the worst movie of all time. DO NOT RENT THAT MOVIE AT ANY COST. I really hope that Denzel Washington will be more caution in the future when choosing a movie to play in.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Suspenseful thriller, fascinating drama and sci-fi action all integrated into one ambitiously entertaining ""Déjà Vu""","It's heartwarming to know that the film was shot on location in New Orleans post-Katrina. ""Déjà Vu"" directed by Tony Scott with Denzel Washington in the lead role is 100% entertaining - top notch delivery all round vs. the disappointing/misleading ""Happy Feet"" rates only 50% - dazzling animation with musical numbers but poor story (in spite of #1 box office three weeks in a row).A hint to enjoy viewing ""Déjà Vu"" is to 'shadow' Denzel Washington's character Doug, ATF agent - just stay close to him and you won't be lost. Be fascinated by the space-time travel aspects at the 'time window lab' presented to you/Doug. Suspend your disbelief and you'll follow the plot with excitement and anticipation. A sci-fi fan or not, you'll be caught up with the pace that Doug is traveling, or his mind which is constantly thinking/rethinking, dissecting/searching for evidence, next steps - it's a ride you want to hold on to till the very end. It is human drama after all and you will be content. There are sprinkling of clues here and there if you should recall (but not essential) - loose strings will be gathered and you'll somehow get to understand/put together. Dashes of subtle humor we're given, too (for instance, ""we once held hands"" so Doug casually said) - it'd bring a smile and quickly we're transported to the next point. Hang in there with Denzel/Doug and a great time you'd spend guaranteed.Distributed by Touchstone Pictures, this is a Jerry Bruckheimer with Scott Free productions. Third time collaboration for director Tony Scott and star Denzel Washington (previously 'Crimson Tide' 1995, 'Man On Fire' 2004). Tight script co-written by Bill Marsilii and Terry Rossio (who's also co-executive producer), with matching, enhancing score by Harry Gregson-Williams. Of course, the visual/special effects, explosives and chase scenes are challengingly striking, especially the 'time warp' vehicular sequences. (Washington's role and his air reminds me of his acting in d- Gregory Hoblit's ""Fallen"" 1998.) Jim Caviezel gave us a devilish heartless villain (yes, quite a departure from the sacred role in d- Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"" 2004). I appreciate the two woman roles: Paula Patton as Claire playing opposite Washington and Caviezel with comparable energy and spunk; Erika Alexander as Shanti sitting there equally with her other colleagues (Val Kilmer, Adam Goldberg, Elden Hensen) at the time window lab - cool, how she describes the branching theory.Should you be interested in absorbing more about the 'fabric of space-time folding,' 'wormhole,' 'string theory,' visit the official site 'dejavu.movies.go.com' - click on 'About' tab and you can download the full production notes PDF file. (On page 8, physicist-consultant Dr. Greene explained in simplified terms about time travel, parallel universes, including the bit about seeing yourself in the mirror, that ""you are actually looking at yourself as you existed 16 nanoseconds ago"" ).We may have time travel, time warp movies before: d- Robert Zemekis' ever popular ""Back to the Future"" 1985, d- Peter Hyam's cop thriller ""Timecop"" 1994 (with Jean-Claude Van Demme), but ""Déjà Vu"" is special in that the production made the city of New Orleans, its people and landscapes very much 'a character in the film.' At the end credits, it's thoughtfully included that the film is dedicated to the strength and enduring spirit of the people of New Orleans.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Wow, edge of your seat suspense.","Truthfully, the best movie of the year for the simple fact that after I was done biting my nails, I began to bite my toenails. She, whoever that woman was, is beautiful and Denzel keeps the action going throughout next to Val and the cool Goldman guy (sweet hair dude). The story begins as believable and we struggle to validate it but soon it becomes so far fetched that we can enjoy ourselves for the pure fiction of it all. I am telling, yes you, reading this, that Deja Vu is the best movie of the year, Borat was sweet also, but different sweet. Also, shout out to J.C.

Flawed and Corny,"In Algiers, New Orleans, after the explosion of a ferry transporting the sailors from the USS Nimitz and their families with 543 casualties, the lonely AFT agent Doug Carlin (Denzel Washington) is assigned to investigate the terrorist attack. Without any lead, he is informed by Sheriff Reed about a corpse of a woman that was found one hour before the explosion, but burnt with the same explosive. He is invited by FBI Agent Pryzwarra (Val Kilmer) to join the surveillance team leaded by Jack McCready (Bruce Greenwood) in the investigations, using a time window and Einstein-Rosen bridge through seven satellites to look back four and half days in time. He discloses the identity of the mysterious dead woman called Claire Kuchever (Paula Patton) and decides to follow her last moments trying to find the criminal. Along the surveillance, Doug falls in love for Claire and tries to change destiny, saving her life.""Déjà Vu"" is a great deception, with a flawed, shallow and corny screenplay. The paradoxical story is full of inconsistencies, but the worst is the ridiculous and incoherent conclusion. I like time travel movies, but the plot of this overrated flick is full of holes. I believe the misleading title ""Déjà Vu"" refers to the role of Denzel Washington, very similar to many others of his movies. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): ""Déjàvu""",3.0,Anonymous,Crime

This is an intense movie, because while you are busy guessing, the actions keep unfolding, and you will never be able to guess how it ends.

Tony Scott and Jerry Bruckheimer make a very good team, and will hopefully team up again in the future (or the past? lol).

jerry bruckheimer at his best,"Jerry Bruckheimer as a producer has made a lot of popcorn movies in the past... and I mean A LOT! Déjà vu definitely is one of them, however one of the best J.B. has ever brought out.In some ways its different from all the others. The storyline I think is brilliant, even though the explanation for the time travel and all the technological stuff thats being used is somewhat poor, Tony Scott still made a movie that'll make u sweat until the very last second of it. Basically, you know what happens and what has happened... and that's where Denzel comes in, going back in time when the movie actually is over, to try and save the woman he fell in love with - 4 days and 6 hours in the past. Of course you recognize Bruckheimer, especially by the quote which was already usend in The Rock: ""The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.""

"From now on, whenever I see an AWeSoME Movie I'll be having myself a 'Deja Vu'!","'Deja vu' has more class to itself as to use its title word 'Deja vu' in the entire movie, especially at the very end, where you'd realize just why it was called 'Deja vu' AND NOT by anyone's words, by the shear MAGNIFICANCE of Denzel Washington's tremendous solid acting.'Deja vu' can be classified as a Sci-Fi/Action movie, yet it's a Thriller like no other. Right when you'd think you've figured out where the movie is leading, it shows you, you're wrong. 'Deja vu' is a Thriller, while it contains significant messages of human dignity, value and of sacrifice & patriotism. Therefore, I'd say that 'Deja vu' has it all, including my rating of it as 9/10. Few movies work well across all these genres and that's what makes this awesome movie stand out.The Sci-fi might seem at some points in the movie, too advanced for our times, but given the fresh ideas offered in that theme, it adds extra delight to the captivating events on screen.It's really interesting & relevant to have a movie like this be produced after Hurricane Katrina occurred, in New Orleans, because of how this movie & the role of 'Doug Carlin' sacrifices himself & proves how sacrifice is an essence of patriotism. That's a lesson I believe Katrina proved to us too.Denzel Washington, as always, takes this storyline where it should be lead & he carries a lot of it all by himself. Paula Patton does a really good job too playing the role of 'Claire Kuchever' & all the scenarios that she goes through. I was surprised at how sensible 'Adam Goldberg' appeared since I'd mostly seen him in only comedies before. Overall a good cast & excellent art direction for this movie, result in 128 minutes of a compelling thriller, with no faults to be mentioned at all at the end of it.

Brilliant,"The TV ads for this film fell way short. Had I known the awesome suspense sequences in Deja Vu I would have seen this in the theater instead of in my hotel room. Time travel is the least part of this performance -- it is the final answer--not the subject--not a science fiction film. Denzel can make any story real, but the dual present and past storyline is both original and riveting. The chase scene is absolutely fantastic! Best I've ever seen! One eye in the present and one in the past. Deja Vu belongs on the big screen. I'm mad about the previews. Space-folding is all I've heard. Deja Vu is a love/detective story.

An exact deja vu,"I seriously get tired (bored) of some stories, because the stories of such movies are always the same, nothing new or different and some of them is lack of entertainment or action or both which is unbearable. We go to the cinema or buy DVDs to see action movies or thrillers and to be entertained, but... Deja Vu is the most tasteless action thriller ever made to me which is surprising because the director is Tony Scott who I enjoyed almost all of his films that I have seen so far. The movie looks good, but not stylish. The movie was not fun at all to me, because many parts of the movie take place in a research center, scientific institution where Carlin spends most of his time to illustrate the case. I very seldomly call a movie boring, but these scenes are boring, there is only one, yes one action scene in the movie which we can see almost nothing, because Carlin sees the present and the past at the same time in this action scene. This scene is also pretty short. I don't know how can I explain this, but the movie was crude a sort of. The action thrillers about time travel are usually very bad, even if it is not as bad as Deja Vu, Next was very bad, but at least pretty enjoyable. The plot of the movie is based on a psychopath who detonates a bomb in a cruise ship and a cop who tries to stop him. What a cliché and banal story, oh dear, extremely dated. Didn't they realize that the story itself is a real deja vu? Why they don't give up writing same stories about a man who detonates somewhere and people who race against time? The Dark Knight was the same either, wasn't it? Almost all the people who watched the film say it is a fun ride. Is it?",4.0,Anonymous,Crime

How lovely it would have been to see beautiful Paula Patton on the big screen. Nonetheless, it proved to be an enjoyable rental! The love story beautifully unfolds as Denzel's character becomes involved with a mysterious woman. The clues he uncovers never gives the story away. And the explanation of the secret technology was just scientific enough to keep us interested without going over our head.

Incredibly exciting and difficult to pause,"A ferry with hundreds of people on board explodes as a result of a terrorist attack. Agent Carlin (Denzel Washington) is sent to New Orleans' port area to investigate the tragedy. The body of a young woman puts him on the track of the killer, and through an extremely sophisticated surveillance system, he can go back four days to see what happened.In other words, it is the setting for a déjà vu experience. The hunt can start, the point is to stop the killing of the woman - and to prevent the bomber from blowing the ferry into the air.Director Scott and TV producer Jerry Bruckheimer are an experienced duo in terms of crime, action and police stories, which clearly characterize this witty film. This is CSI with a touch of sci-fi and a dose of romance, effectively told - though the story winds up in a few obscure threads.With Denzel Washington as lead, it's easy to join the game. His authority as an actor rests on his keen eyes, boyish smiles and ability to be a cat gentle gentleman with tiger claws.As excitement entertainment is fine, and the perspective of what opportunities are under surveillance is worth taking.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Deja Vu,"Time travel is a consistently popular plot device, a Hollywood convention for its mass appeal; depending on the ambition of the work, it can be as simple or as complicated as is desired or required. 'Deja Vu' achieves a consistent balance, presenting its hard science fiction concepts to viewers in an easily understandable manner. The result is a complex film that doesn't buckle under the weight of a convoluted screenplay, remaining a thorough action blockbuster throughout despite its intended depth.Denzel Washington carries the film to great effect, his convincing performance and clear enthusiasm for the material an influential factor in how the feature doesn't necessarily demand a great amount of suspended disbelief. Granted, there is an abundance of fallacies and ambiguities throughout that could threaten to detract from its credibility, but the film is ultimately as much for a popcorn audience as it is for the intellectual crowd. The cost of heavy scrutiny and flawless coherence would appear to be an extremely entertaining experience, and in the case of 'Deja Vu', it is most certainly a price worth paying.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Rock video editing and impossibly improbable,This movie is a two hour music video. Jerky so called documentary style shooting and an edit every 8 frames or so. Even an epileptic experiencing a seizure could hold a camera steadier then what's presented here. I'm not sure if it's the ego of the D.O.P. the editor or the director that for so long this style of film making has been popular. Get over it folks....move on...this is a completely hackneyed look. So much of the viewers attention is brought to what's going on behind the camera instead of what's going on in front of it. To compliment this style of shooting you will find included a music score that never stops. I understand why though....this movie is so poorly put together that without it dictating how we should be feeling at any given moment we'd be completely emotionally nonplussed.I almost walked out on this film but I was hoping that with so many apparent holes in the plot line that it would somehow miraculously pull itself together with a surprise ending that would at least bring some intelligence to the film. It doesn't.The movie is dedicated to the spirit of the people in New Orleans.

From the look, music, style, emotion & characters it's so linked to ""State"" & Scott directed to hell out of that Classic Thriller & that's the Scott style i always remember & it was the blueprint to these later sci-fi tech Thriller's.When Denzel works with Tony Scott they deliver something very special & create such fun, exciting & thrilling big budget blockbuster popcorn Thriller's such as the excellent Taking of Pelham 123 & the excellent Man on Fire & the excellent Unstoppable.Here the great Denzel Washington gives another great performance as ATF Agent Doug Carlin who is investigating bombings & joins forces with the FBI. ""Deja Vu"" is a very stylish Sci-fi Thriller & deals with Time travel as our hero Doug is able to go back in time & try to stop a terrorist attack & save the women he's fallen in love with. It's a crazy story in a way but it's a fantasy sci-fi Thriller so it all works in fine & adds to the Blockbuster fun & popcorn Thriller feel of it all.Denzel to me is like the king of the ""Thriller"" especially the investigating Detective type of Thriller, he's the best to do it & with each of his characters he gives such richness to each one & commands your attention like no other actor!!!!

Despite the fact that the director didn't ""want"" to make a sci-fi, it turned out to be a very good sci-fi. Smart move to go sci-fi and not sci-fact. If the movie would've just used satellite technology as a basis, I wouldn't have like it as much. Especially since time travel is a part of the story. Hello? Time travel is sci-fi Mr. Director! Other than that, the movie was well done. I very much appreciated the car chase where Danzel's character is car chasing a villain while the villain is in the past and Danzel is in the present. Very cool concept... Wish I would've thought of it first! (Damn.) I also appreciated the director going with practical effects instead of computer effects. I love computer effects, but if you have the ""money"" try the practical first.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Absolutely RIDICULOUS story, RUINING the entire movie.","I have been bingewatching director Tony Scott movies and contrary to his other movies this one is NOT big, loud and fast. It's quite long in the tooth, but that's only a lesser problem...The bad: what absolute rubbish of a story. NOT credible whatsoever, but THAT isnt the worst part of it. What's worse than the absolute moronic story is that we have to watch over half an hour nothing but talking heads watching at video screens trying to solve a crime. BORING. This whole plot is rubbish. The movie IMPLODED the moment they started injecting this ""looking back in time"" with cameras. Ridiculous.Not any good then? Denzel Washington is always enjoyable to watch. And so are the other actors. Really solid performances all around. It's photographed nicely. There is some supsense, although not nearly enough to keep me engaged, because this movie is one heck of a FLOP. To be avoided even for the Denzel Washington fans, of which I am one.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Engaging and fast-paced, yet sometimes philosophical","I love this movie. It's just perfect for me. Entertaining, a bit mysterious and it leaves room to breath. It's fast-paced but also contemplative at times. Everyone is great in it. It has a good soundtrack. I don't care a bit if the time-travel-part doesn't make any sense or if it's paradoxical. That's how time-travel in movies mostly is. The story grabs me from the beginning and sucks me in. That's all I care about in this case. And Tony Scott's trademark visual extravaganza, the constantly changing camera-angles etc. Are just great. I like however that this film is not as stylyzed as ""Man on Fire"". The stroboscopic flickering of the images in that film was a bit much sometimes. But ""Déja vu"" finds a great balance between the unhinged camera-movements and more relaxed moments. It's pleasing to watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
The most emotional roller-coaster and thought provoking ride I have EVER experienced!,"Before I saw this film, my favorite film of all time was without a doubt TOP GUN.Tony Scott was the best director of our time - FACT.
Denzil Washington is without a doubt one of the finest actors of our time and it shows in almost every movie he is in.I am a guy and I cannot think of another film that has me completely choked up and tears in my eyes which the final scene of this movie does, EVERY TIME I WATCH IT !!!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
A thrilling and riveting film that keeps you on the edge of your seat!,"I love Denzel Washington and think he is a very good actor. The last time this director and Washington teamed up they made the gritty and violent thriller, ""Man on Fire"", but this will definitely appeal to a wider audience. Denzel plays an smart and inventive detective who sees things differently from most people. When a terrorist attack is made on a ferry holding over 500 people he is called in to investigate, he is soon recruited to a new investigation team using ""cutting edge"" technology, but he soon realizes things are not as they seem.Paula Patton, a relatively unknown actress was so convincing as the victim in this story made you care for her. The plot overall wasn't the most amazing thing, but the acting and characters are what make this so intensely personal. Val Kilmer also appears in this film, but in a very small role. Another actor though who made the movie feel so intense is Jim Caviezal as the insane and insanely ""patriotic"" terrorist who will let nothing in his way of making his statement to the world.This movie proves that Jerry Bruckheimer can still pick good movies to produce and even if this film wasn't exactly a blockbuster is was an interesting, intense, and smart thriller that has high flying surprises and top notch acting that will make your jaw drop. Deja-Vu went beyond all expectations.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"A terrible movie, just awful...","This movie is not even a science fiction movie. Its ridiculous. Excuse me Denzel, but how could you get involved in this? Oh, for the money!

Denzel Washington is usually worth watching, but not here - the movie is just too awful.It's a really sorry piece of work, anybody with the least knowledge of Sci Fi will Agree that this movie is just ridiculous.Tony Scott jumped off a bridge in L.A. not too long ago, probably dismayed over the portfolio of junk movies he'd made during his career.

Small Error... otherwise so good.,"Excellent movie, and I have watched it several times, with years between viewings, but, this ONE thing always bugs me... They abandoned looking up the number plate of the car, too soon. ??? That way they would have known the culprit's name much sooner. They tried, but that time, it was too dark, but after that the number plate is LIT UP, multiple times, so why not get it, and find out the guy's name. This happens many TIMES, over... and they never bother looking at the number plate. Drove me crazy, when I am not... but they are, supposed to be ""super observant law enforcement"". Yet, they never bothered, after that one time, when it was too dark. Annoying to no end.Ok, also when the cops SHOOT at the EXPLOSIVES in the SUV... and it has no effect. They should / could have skipped that bit, making the cops look bad. If the cops guessed there might be a bomb in the SUV, they would not have acted as they did to those in the SUV, nor SHOT at it. !?! That makes NO sense, and makes cops look like idiots (from ""Police Academy""). *BOOM*Otherwise excellent movie; exciting throughout, unexpected twists, and all. Love it.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Relatively original,"Obviously there are other films similar to this one, even, perhaps especially, in recent years. I won't name them here, as that might tell you too much, about this or them, before viewing. I would advise against reading anything about the plot of this before watching it. This presents a couple of interesting concepts(one of which is extremely beautifully realized, and possibly unique), and the explanations, while varied, show that thought was put into this. The tone isn't overly dark, though this surely can be intense, without going overboard. The pacing is good, it never really loses the audience. There's humor, and most of it works. Characters are fairly fleshed out and well-written. Denzel is largely spot-on in his portrayal(it might have been negatively affected by the script, also). Caviezel does great with what he's given, which could and should have been more. The cinematography and editing are marvelous. There are utterly fascinating visuals in this. The action is well-done, effective and entertaining(and at times amazingly thought up and put on the screen). It does beg the question, however... is it perhaps too ""Hollywood""? If it had focused entirely on the intellectual aspect of the story, it would definitely have made a different movie. I'm not sure this fully reached its potential. They had places to go that they didn't even seem to consider, and, in that respect, the titles that use ideas akin to that of this feature are better than this. Also, this might be mistaken, particularly from the trailers, for a simple flick with big explosions by some, and they will be disappointed, and selling it short. It has very little language, and not the worst it could be. There is a tiny bit of nudity. Finally, there is violence, a nominal amount of which is strong. The DVD holds deleted and extended scenes, complete with English subtitles and optional director's commentary(that are subbed, as well), and a group of featurettes, each corresponding to specific parts of Deja Vu, that can be played as you watch it(complete with an audio track of Bill Marsili, Tony Scott, and Jerry Bruckheimer, during the picture itself, that seems to have been recorded at different times and put together) or altogether, from the Index. I recommend this to fans of science fiction and thrillers, of productions that ask you to think and can provide food for thought, as well as of the actors and/or anyone else who helped make this. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Terrific, thrilling, engaging .....","This film really surprised me. I got a lot more than I expected which was to see a stereotypical action, sci-fi, thriller. But it wasn't at all, it's engaging from start to finish, as you follow every move of the protagonist you succumb to his struggle, his weakness, his hope. This definitely impressed me, with it's clever take on scientific experimentations on changing a future. The way they project the notion is quite over the top but sure is acceptable for the way technologies going on right now. rarely do I actually enjoy a movie for what it is and it's contents, but this one really made an impact.Denzel plays his role as refined as always, as does the rest of the cast, except maybe that I had a little problem accepting caviezels performance. It's probably because his characters undeveloped and all I new about him was that he got rejected by the government as part of the service. Which brings to the conclusion that he really is messed up in the head, why bomb just for an unjustified reason, yes once again his character is crazy. Still I wasn't convinced on his portrayal(it wasn't intense enough). Coming back to the film, it's brilliant explosions, use of effects, camera techniques, that car chase, and unique story telling is definitely worth anyones time. Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Dramatically Heartwarming.,"Director Tony Scott has managed to accomplish an excellent film by casting Denzel Washington as the lead actor in this film and the mind-numbingly gorgeous Paula Patton as the prominent female character intertwined in a mysterious terrorist plot set loose by a right-wing extremist (James Caviezel). Val Kilmer's performance is above par as well and the elements of this movie go well with its stellar cast.Tony Scott is best remembered for his films like Domino and Man On Fire (which also starred Denzel Washington). Having achieved success in those films, he pulls us into the plot of this film with considerable twists and unexpected occurrences.The premise of this film is simple - a ferry laden with civilians and Navy personnel explodes just after casting off from the docks of New Orleans. Denzel Washington plays ATF agent Doug Carlin, a no-nonsense, determined enforcer who is stunned to learn that the explosion was a result of a bomb meticulously planned and planted.Val Kilmer is an FBI agent who enlists the help of a more experienced Doug Carlin to review and investigate the bombing and slowly reveals to Carlin that they possess the technology to virtually go back in time and conduct surveillance prior to the bombing. Caviezel plays the right-wing extremist and is clearly suited for the cold-blooded, heartless role.Eventually, Carlin discovers that he can save the life of Claire Kuchever (Paula Patton) who is simply at the wrong place at the wrong time. It may get confusing at times but if you've watched 'back in time' movies like Back To The Future and such, you should be able to grasp the logic and practicality of this film.Without giving it away, the film manages to remain interestingly compelling and I consider it a rare heartwarming movie which is well-rounded in all aspects without being over- dramatic.An obvious masterpiece on Tony Scott's part and the talented cast bolster this movie's appeal. A must-see if you're the type who enjoys psychological thrillers like Memento etc. A definite two thumbs up!",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Watch this movie back-to-back for four solid days, and I think you might understand it, and if you don't, there's help available for you somewhere ... maybe.I'm 83 years old and I have a physics degree and I was a computer a top level computer programmer for 35 years and this movie is bending my brain I'm having a really rough time staying with it.But I must say, a Denzel and Caviezel battle sounds terrific and is going to be fun, and people are really going to enjoy it.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Deja Vu is an outstanding gripping thriller.,"Déjà Vu is a gripping psychological thriller that masterfully intertwines reality with glimpses of the future. Featuring stellar performances from Denzel Washington as ATF agent Doug Carlin, Jim Caviezel as the conflicted terrorist Carroll Oerstadt, and Paula Patton in a breakout role as Claire Kuchever, the film captivates from its opening moments.The story begins with a brilliant and thought-provoking premise: How could one prevent a catastrophic act of terrorism by using untested technology to peer into the past and potentially alter the future? This question launches us into an intense journey, tethering us to the characters through skilful storytelling. Claire's tragic situation-being in the wrong place at the wrong time-builds deep empathy, especially as her relationship with her father underscores her humanity and raises the stakes.Jim Caviezel's portrayal of Carroll Oerstadt is outstanding. He delivers a chilling performance as a misguided patriot, driven by a warped ideology to justify his heinous actions. While the film allows us a glimpse into his troubled psyche, his senseless and cold-blooded determination, including the brutal murder of Larry Minuti, makes it impossible to excuse him. This moral complexity heightens the tension, leaving the audience questioning whether the use of the experimental technology is justified, particularly when its interference may have sealed Larry's fate.The writing and directing are flawless, with tight pacing, engaging twists, and an edge-of-your-seat intensity that never falters. The cinematography by Paul Cameron deserves special mention-it elevates the storytelling, adding depth and visual intrigue that perfectly complements the narrative's shifting timelines. From the meticulous stunts to the atmospheric soundtrack and authentic costumes, every detail aligns seamlessly to enhance the viewing experience.Déjà Vu is a timeless thriller that not only keeps you hooked but also challenges your perceptions of fate, morality, and technology. It's no surprise that this film earned widespread acclaim and box-office success-it's a masterclass in filmmaking that remains as compelling today as it was upon release.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Tenet before Tenet,"Déjà Vu is a great action thriller with a genuinely high concept premise. If this was made now it'd be a streaming film with no style, designed to be as generic as humanly possible. It makes every detail of this version so much more entertaining, like how the film really takes its time with an extended opening credits sequence that streamers would never let exist now for fear of the audience losing interest.All that really matters with this concept is that the twists work in the moment and it achieves this in a constantly engaging manner. It doesn't matter if they fall apart under intense scrutiny and to be honest, the part of this narrative that's the hardest aspect to buy into is the romance. Even then though, the shades of Vertigo make it work better than it should.A film like this needs a movie star to lead it and Denzel Washington is the perfect actor to do it. He's the coolest character in any scene, immensely believable with his character's expertise and yet he's still the best one to experience this slightly futuristic world through. The little things are just as eye-catching with his performance, all the way down to the way he holds a gun.The supporting cast really understand how to play it when it comes to how serious to take this. There's no doubt that the premise requires some suspension of disbelief so having the mildest bit of humour courtesy of Adam Goldberg whilst Val Kilmer, Elden Henson, and Erika Alexander all playing it completely straight creates the ideal tonal balance.A significant portion of this film has people staring at screens and watching so Tony Scott directing on maximalist mode ensures everything remains highly cinematic. He had a unique talent for this kind of filmmaking and the car chase that simultaneously takes place in past and present not only showcases his greatest strengths but guarantees the film doesn't squander the premise on that scene alone.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

BATF Doug Carlin is brought in to assist in the massive investigation, and gets attached to an experimental FBI surveillance unit, one that uses spacefolding technology to directly look back a little over four days into the past. While tracking down the bomber, Carlin gets an idea in his head: could they use the device to actually travel back in time and not only prevent the bombing but also the murder of a local woman whose truck was used in the bombing?",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

During the investigation, Doug starts to fall in love with the victim (yes this has happened before in ""Laura"" with Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney -Déjà Vu.)The question is willing life and technologies allow Doug to make a small correction to future history?

The kind of thriller that will send shivers down your spine,"With a movie that has so many twists and turns, writing a review without a spoiler is a challenge. But if you've seen the trailer you already suspect that this film is part ""Enemy of the State"" and part ""Millennium"". I'd add its also part ""The Lake House"" and part (here's a stretch, but when you it you'll agree) part ""Sharkey's Machine"". The genre of films/TV shows that explore such subjects such as distant-viewing past events, alternate realities, time travel etc. have to tell an interesting/thrilling story while navigating a minefield of paradoxes and continuity nightmares. When they're bad (""Time Cop""), these films force the viewer back into reality to critique ""mistakes"". When they're good (""Somewhere in Time""), these movies sweep you along in a state of suspension of disbelief that lasts until you reach that shivers-down-your-spine moment (similar to the big Reveal in ""The Sixth Sense""). That's the feeling I got watching this film.Finally, if you are a fan of Denzel Washington playing a character similar to ones he's played in ""The Siege"", ""Out of Time"" or ""Inside Man"", you'll enjoy his performance. He's a great actor, but he also has a knack for playing tough, sympathetic, confidence-inspiring ""cops"" -- the type you'd hope were working on your case.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Silly with a capital S,"I guess there will always be a market for movies that have to do with time travel.Unfortunately, when it comes to the gimmick of going back and forth in time, inevitably the writers are confronted with something called ""logic.""That ""logic"" is missing in droves in this movie and suspension of disbelief is more than an unusual occurrence.Also, I think it is time that Denzel Washington stops playing cops, whether they belong to the federal branch or not.His acting has become predictable and worse, boring.He is a good actor whose talents are going to waste.Every character in this movie is predictable and never hint to any kind of originality.To make the movie even more unpalatable, Val Kilmer, who is in his own right an extremely talented actor with a powerful range, is totally wasted in this film.He could have e-mailed his lines.Also, I don't know whether he gained weight for the role, but his leading man good looks were left at home and in their place was a pudgy, overweight mug of someone who does not care what he looks like.In Hollywood, that can be dangerous.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Great action movie, in spite of the improbabilities","This is a very involving and exciting action movie, chockfull of spectacular car-pursuits, explosions, high-tech investigations and even the hint of something romantic. Denzel Washington does as usual a fine job, and I also liked Val Kilmer in his more modest part. So when the movie came to its gratifying end I felt perfectly entertained.But still, I had some reservations as to the time travel concept. In my (humble and a total layman's) opinion there's not any movie concerning time-traveling that in any satisfactory or convincing way can solve the notorious problem of the time paradox. Here it's no different. With a lot of flexibility as to my sense of realism and probability, I can still go along with all the curved-space and wormholes explanations that the experts in the movie come up with. But when the last scenes of the movie imply that Denzel Washington's character actually could have met his former (or the other way around: his future) self, then that's where my simple mind draws the line.Anyway, that doesn't make the movie any less enjoyable, so if you're able to step over it, you'll have a fine 2 hours of exciting entertainment.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Interesting idea with too many plot devices and TNT,"Doug Carlin is an ATF agent investigating a bombing of a crowded New Orleans ferry which left over 500 people dead. He joins a new, highly secretive investigation unit that can literally look into the past with a new high-tech machine as they try to solve the crime.It starts as an interesting thriller, but the misleading marketing becomes very apparent very soon. The trailer reflects a different movie and the much hyped ""mystery of deja vu"" is nowhere to be seen. The whole ""big secret that he government doesn't want you to know"" is hokey by today as it has been in science fiction since the 1940s. The plot line is admittedly interesting, but favors gimmicks, plot devices, and pyrotechnics over something truly interesting. Basically, you're run of the mill Bruckheimer flick and it is getting quite old by now. Also the plot sounds interesting, but like mentioned before, the ambitions presented in the trailer are merely marketing and go nowhere in the actual film. But they do get you to buy a ticket so Jerry Bruckheimer can add to his his Scrooge-size mountain of cash so remains happy and eager to squeeze out his next turd.The only real good part is Tony Scott whose kinetic direction adds some decent flavor, but it is nearly ruined by some truly bizarre things. In the car chase cars get flung up to in the air for no reason, they just literally BETWEEN TWO CUTS appear to be on the ground and then all of a sudden in the air and then they land in a heap of twisted metal. However, soon after our hero gets slammed head on by an 18-wheeler and he and his car remain virtually unscathed. I mean, please, I don't want 100% realism, but you have to keep things consistent WITHIN THE FILM.That stuff would be forgivable if the story was good, but ridiculous plot devices push the story to a sappy end and that effectively destroys the interesting premise. 3/10Rated PG-13: violence and intense action. Gets pretty close to an R though. Maybe after he is done blowing everything up, Jerry Bruckheimer will invent a new rating: NC-13. Just a thought.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime

Denzel demonstrated all that is best in an actor ... intelligence, passion, persuasion, leadership and charismatic appeal. I'm sure the ladies like his good looks too. The success of this movie was pivotal around Denzel. With that spoken, Paula is on her way to stardom ... she has all the best qualities. Val Kilmer's supporting role was really good ... he will always be one of my favorites.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Mind Bending Thrill Ride!,"I'm sure some folks might disagree, but this is one of my favorite Denzel movies. I think some people take themselves too seriously when it comes to certain sci-fi elements in this film, because no matter what movie you see, there are always going to be things in the film that don't make any sense, but the purpose of a movie like this is for some good Summer movie relaxation with a tub of popcorn and friends or family, and what is wrong with that?Denzel, Paula Patton, Val Kilmer, and especially Jim Caviezel were outstanding in their roles, Mr. Caviezel in particular. It's a shame he is not cast in more roles, because in my opinion, he is one of the most talented and versatile actors in Hollywood.In any case, this movie is a thrill ride from the beginning to the end, full of suspense, and great interpersonal dynamics between all the characters as well.Highly recommend you see this, if you haven't already had the chance!",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Awesome but confusing at times,"This movie was definitely the $10. I thought this movie had the suspense and action yet the technical aspects. It's definitely a trick of the mind, Deja Vu. If you do get to watch this movie be careful and pay close attention to what's going on. At times it gets confusing, but at the end you'll realize it wasn't so difficult to understand. I also thought Denzel Washington did a terrific job in this movie, using his acting skills in a very complex situation. He portrayed an agent very well as did Val Kilmer. I was particularly blown away by the terms and technical concepts of Snow White. If that was actually a real life machine, it would be one of the greatest inventions ever built.

A Great Movie On its Own Right,"There are times when all of us, fans of filmaking,get tired of all the trashy movies that keep invading our theaters. We want to see something really different,something we would remember for months to come,that would really blow us away. ""Deja VI"" is the feeling you start to get when all the movies you see from a genre feel like they were taken from the same place...That being said,""deja VI"" is movie magic. Its a mix of great directing,some of the best acting i have seen in a long time,and a script that works in so many ways,that the only way to make it justice is by watching it. I kid you not my friends. This movie has action,drama,and a great sense of ""toying"" with the viewer. Its art,plain and simple.The cast,is an important part to make this movie the ""feel"" it has. I don't want to get in details, but Denzel Washington is simply brilliant, his acting is top notch,in my opinion it is his best performance in recent years. Jim Caviezel also is a screen ""stealer"" every time he appears on film. A word of appreciation to Val Kilmer's role,his acting is also convincing. I am not going to go into details about the other cast members, but i can honestly say there is not bad acting on this movie,none what so ever.I am not going to say what the movie is about,everyone out there reading this,should just go and see it,its just that good. Action fans will not be disappointed,thriller fans will be blown away,and even sci-fi fans will love this one. Confused? Well there is only one day to solve this mystery. A theater near you. A word to producer Jerry Bruckheimer...Once again you recognize an excellent script when you see one,thank you.

Great movie,"When it first started I thought it was boring - the ferry and the band etc. No hint of what was to come though, and at the end I was sorry it had finished. Spectacular cinematography, Denzel Washington is always great, and a twisting story line make this an engrossing and entertaining movie. The plot is based upon scientific probable reality although, being a movie, it twists and turns into ways that make the probable reality impossible. Hints of 'Big Brother', hints of future scientific achievements, a modern day terrorist plot, and fantastic acting. This must be one of the better movies I've seen this year and I'd recommend everyone to go and see it. I gave it an 8 out of 10 only because I'm interested in the probably scientific reality the movie deals with, and was disappointed the script went into paradoxes and other scientific non-probabilities instead of dealing more accurately with the scientific theory behind the whole movie. All in all though, it was great - I'll be seeing this one again.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

An interesting movie,"I found Denzel Washington to be excellent, as usual, in this movie. Val Kilmer was good in the role he played. Give the guy a break, we all get older.

This is really a movie that you need to watch 100%, if you are distracted with other things during the viewing process, you will be disappointed.If you like Denzel Washington and if you like Val Kilmer, you will enjoy this movie.

A great film in a time when we're surrounded by shallow garbage,"I liked this film from the moment I heard the story-line. The thing that I REALLY like about it is the fact that the production team found a way to put sci-fi elements into the story while still making it believable. The acting was good on all fronts; the African-American woman (I think her name was Shasta or something to that effect) was very natural in her conversations with Washington. Carlin's (Washington's) curiosity about the inner working of the agency he is later employed by in the beginning of the film is very believable. It is this seamlessness that makes the movie as a whole more believable. I would definitely recommend this film to anyone old enough to understand it; although it's gotten mixed reviews, I still think it's a gem among other more shallow, lackluster films.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

DEJA VU is just rubbish. I can only imagine the story meeting where ten wannabees each add their 'fave moment' to be inserted into 'an action flick' and presto: the recipe for a variation on 55 other similar films is 'given a surprise twist' (now no surprise). DEJA VU starts with an insulting stunt to the residents of New Orleans wanders into CSI drivel, loops into sci-fi gibberish and then (aw, shucks) goes romantic. In order for us out there in the mallplex cinema no 99 guzzling a mega Coke and chomping through the cheops pyramid sized popcorn to keep gawping in wonder at this dazzling mesmerising experience our trusty producer adds pointless car chases, 'swoosh' sounds between scenes and misty shower scenes, thus fulfilling his shopping list of usual visuals and hilariously calls the whole celluloid hailstorm DEJA VU.

Denzel Washington use time machine to save boat explosion and girl.,"Trust me I don't know this is science fiction about time travel before see this title. I only watch this for Denzel and get surprised. Interesting science fiction movie with mind blowing plot of time travel. Only keep in basic thing of time travel that if you go back in past and change some incident then a new time line is created and such is called ' Paradox'. Beginning part of the movie is a little slow but when investigation is going with multiple angles surveillance you are starting get interest in the movie, and then it will grip you till end with highly tension climax. However there are some flaws in the story such can a paper sheet travel back ? what is about interruption done by Doug while watching suvillience? and most questionable thing is where is crossing point between future Doug died in car blast and present Doug is coming from bank to see Claire ? Denzel is dashing as he is always. Photography is good especially boat and water. Must watchable for science fiction lovers.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

"artful pictured, technically brilliant presented BOREDOM","The movie starts in the middle of the war on terror. A super-gangster has been able to burst one of the prestigious flagships of the army into little pieces. Over 500 killed and thousands injured. Starting in aesthetically slow motion and scenic soundtrack the movie worsens continuously .An selected AFN-guy is starting to take part in the investigation and what follows is a eclectic clash of time-travelling action-sequences and more or less predictable interventions into the path of time. The unconvincing plot wants us to believe that a time-machine could have been developed without making use of it - and that just because of a more or less disinterested government and scientists.Unnecessary violence, yelling of pseudo-exciting and pseudo-scientific rubbish as well as thrilling intimations of being burned alive, being shooten and brought to death by cars doesn't necessary lead to an good action movie - at least not when served in the context of a plot that insults the intellect of the thinking spectator.

"Another one of Jerry Bruckheimers unpredictable, brilliant films.","Deja Vu had me on the end of my seat throughout the entire duration of the movie. I get right into CSI, Cold Case and all those crime scene dramas which is why i enjoyed this film so much. If you like this genre, this is the film for you.One of the most attention wrenching factors that this movie possesses is unpredictability. Denzel Washington does a great job playing his part, however the woman he is trying to save, Claire, seems a little experienced with the general shock a normal person would have.The general prospect of traveling back in time seems a little far-fetched, however Jerry Bruckheimer does a great job disguising the 'fantasy factor,' and makes it seem very real. The excitement you feel overshadows this, therefore you tend to forget about it and concentrate on what's going to happen next.There are several twists within the movie that are not foreseen. At the end, something happens with such a magnitude you think the movie will finish, however once again it ends with a brilliant unpredictable twist that leaves you feeling almost disorientated with excitement. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Time travel technological thriller fun...,"It seems like Deja Vu is in three parts...the spark, the truth, and the conclusion. I won't go into detail because that would ruin the whole movie...but keep in mind Deja Vu is not a big mess of plot...it works.If there is one thing, however, that is a mess, it is the technological part. When they were talking about technology, I sure didn't understand what the hell was going on. Did it make sense? I have no idea, and I don't really care...just try to ignore the fact that all those big words and the explanation of time and space may be a little over the head...Then there is the plot hole problem. All movies like this are bound to have a plot hole...but again, that doesn't bother me. The film's plot made enough sense and was clever enough to the point where it doesn't matter. I actually can't figure out any plot holes but then again I don't care to waste my time trying to find them...why not just enjoy the movie? If you can ignore all that and just enjoy what the movie is trying to do...which is entertain, than go see it. It is definitely worth it.

"Action, tension and romance","From director Tony Scott, the one who brought us Man on fire, we have another movie called Deja Vu. The title itself gives us a clue about what's going on. A ATF detective(Denzel)is called upon to investigate a ship bombing that is later revealed to be connected to the murder of a woman named Claire. During his investigation he is recruited in a special division of the FBI. The movie basically focuses on the relation between Doug(Denzel) and Claire, the dead woman while he tries to identify the culprit. (SPOILER)The scene where he goes to the screen and sees her in her everyday routine and he almost wishes he could touch her is just amazing.(/SPOILER). The movie also deals with time and space distortion, but it has some plot gaps, gaps which will be easily overcome. But the main ingredient is the tension, which builds up an releases and so on. This is also done with the help of the fast camera moves and the same image editing used in man on fire(they are brilliant). It's a shame it didn't get a nod for the superb imagery. So there you have it- brilliant acting by Denzel, action and tension, quality image and that superb touch of romance would give it a 9, but the plot holes only earn it a 8.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Deja Vu,"I went to see this movie being pretty aware of the fact that the movie would be a typical Hollywood action movie and was not expecting much more from it. I had seen the trailers and it looked very much of what I had intended the movie to be.The story is about a cop trying to stop a (patriotic) terrorist who wants to blow a US navy ferry with a stolen vehicle full of bombs. The movie starts with the ferry being blown off by the terrorist  so where is the story line gone? But wait  the frames unfold to a new dimension where our hero can travel back by 4 days into time and stop the terrorist to blow up the ferry, and in turn save our heroine and lots of dead people. Is this all possible in real life? NO would be the answer  but scientific movies like ET, Star Wars etc. are big hits on the fantasy of 'What if'? The movie is sleek. Denzel Washington is stylish sometimes overly with his facial expressions; and Val Kilmer  has evidently put on lots of weight from his usual self, but is good in his small role.The movie is able to maintain your interest till the last frame. There are good action scenes  especially the car chase of terrorist through time difference  where with one eye Denzel is able to see the present day and the other eye he is able to see the same road 4 days back  this chase is thrilling.Especially at the end of the movie, the way Denzel is shown traveling from one place to another within the city  seems that the city is very small  which is not the case of New Orleans as a city.

"No mistakes, great success.","Can we change what happens? Would things be different if we knew the future? And if we know it, does the only fact of having that power influence the next moments of our lives? Does it have any sense? The eternal question of the human being. Everything mix up in an unsolved paradox, and represented in this Tony Scott's film. Denzel Washington once again brings life to his character and gives a breath of anxiety in every single scene. Tension gets more and more uncontrollable, and with the running of the seconds, the privilege of being a simple spectator turns in an enormous desire of getting involved in the plot. The details are taken in extremely care. Where it seems there is no reason, for our surprise, there is. And where it seems there is truly a reason..., well, my friends, it's not what you believe it is. The first hour you may think that nonsense takes the control, but don't panic, remember that for every ""why"" there is a ""because"".

For a movie that's 15 years old there were a lot of holds on the DVD at my local library.This film should have been promoted as science fiction rather than a crime thriller, although the best science fiction has at least some degree of believability. That was totally missing in this venture. The story is absurd, even if there's a lot of eye candy for some viewers to behold.

Fine Film,"I am trying to recall any film Denzel Washington made that wasn't well acted, and without an interesting plot. The man is both a fine actor, and highly selective about the films he chooses to be in. I notice the vast majority of reviews show 8 or 10 stars. I was amused by a few that gave around 3 stars, attempting to explain why. One in particular explained why the ""science"" was wrong. Well, this is a fantasy film, not a doctoral thesis. Who cares? It is inventive. One of the ""issues"" being, how could there be 2 Denzels. Well, if someone really could travel back in time, how does anyone know one would ""disappear"", so there would be only one? If it is possible to change history, what makes that impossible? Another remark which amused me was the car was not moving fast enough to push the other car off of the ramp. If that is the case, then Double Jeopardy (Tommy Lee Jones & Ashley Judd) and a whole lot of other films are equally wrong. Well, the cars were not that far apart, you couldn't accelerate to 60mph on that short a distance. But if the pedal is down the the floor, you likely could push it. Somehow that didn't really bother me either, when watching the film. Maybe I was just being entertained, in the manner the film really intended me to be?",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Hampered by unoriginality and mismarketing,"The movie is hampered by unoriginality and bad marketing more than anything else. For anyone who's keeping count this is Denzel Washington's 4th role as a tough guy cop with everything on his hands in 3 years.To review them: In Out of Time, he plays a cop who is in love with someone who becomes a victim. In Man on Fire, he plays a jaded cop who sees his personal redemption as keeping a certain girl safe. In this film, he plays an Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms Agent (I know, big change) who sees his redemption as saving a woman who's about to be murdered, who he's also slowly falling in love with. The recycling of plots and inability to find something new for Denzel Washington to do is the most appropriate use of the title Deja Vu, because it really doesn't have much to do with the plot.The film is actually more of a time travel movie, in which Denzel Washington and company are able to look through a window in time back 4 and a 1/2 days and try to travel back in order to prevent a massive explosion. Doesn't that sound much cooler? It is in fact much cooler but there was absolutely nothing about that in the plot description at the movie theater. My cousin, who i went to see it with, thought that that was because sci-fi movies don't sell. Personally, I thought it was because the perfect title for the film ""Out of Time"" was already taken.One of the main gimmicks that makes the movie cool is the use of surveillance technology featured in the film, that also made the 1998 film ""Enemy of the State"" so cool.

A Slick Sci-Fi Action Movie With an Interesting Story and Cool Time Travel,"Another of the string of awesome Tony Scott/Denzel Washington collaborations, this sci-fi action thriller is a cerebral rollercoaster, and a feast for the eyes, which is elevated by an all-star cast.Scott's frenetic style once again really works here, and his directorial adeptness shines through in the action sequences and crazy cinematography.Denzel is as great as ever, turning on his charm and playing his likable everyman perfectly. He's also aided by a pretty good performance from Val Kilmer, the beautiful and talented Paula Patton, who is underrated as an actress, and Jim Caviezel, who is a horribly underrated actor, and one of my favorites. He is suitably stoic and evil as the villain, and definitely Denzel's equal here.The action sequences are excellent. The opening explosion is arguably one of the greatest explosions put to film, up there with the final explosions in ""Blown Away"" and ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"". The freeway scene was pretty cool, the ambulance scene in the shack was good, and the final shootout is definitely the highlight, and Caviezel demonstrates his need of more action roles.This movie also pushed the limits of the PG-13 rating in terms of violence, with some violent shootings and mildly bloody moments, and a bombing victim with fingers visibly missing.Both a thought-provoking time travel movie, and a gritty action thriller, ""Deja Vu"" is totally worth your time.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Deja Vu has a unique premise, but it didn't work for me","I recently revisited Deja Vu (2006) on Tubi. The storyline follows a bombing in New Orleans, with the FBI trying to uncover who is behind it and their motive. A strange corpse is found at the scene that may be a clue. They use new technology that allows them to see back in time to help uncover the bombing events as they unfolded and how the victim they found was involved in the unfortunate events.This film was directed by Tony Scott (Top Gun) and stars Denzel Washington (Man on Fire), Paula Patton (Precious), Jim Caviezel (The Passion of the Christ), Val Kilmer (Top Gun), Adam Goldberg (Saving Private Ryan), and Bruce Greenwood (I, Robot).This is one of those films with a cool and original concept that goes a bit too far. The cast is excellent, and everyone delivers an authentic and relatable performance. The action scenes are great, and the explosion opening is excellent. The setting of New Orleans is also a worthwhile backdrop.

Very Interesting,"I'm not much of a fan of Tony Scott's movies. Especially if we are talking about his recent efforts like Man Of Fire, Domino and Spy Games. Though many would disagree with them I don't think these were good. Deja vu on the other hand is very similar to Enemy Of The State. There is no much of innovative and experimental shootings, only great shooting angles.The difference in this movie, is that it has a very interesting plot with a twist towards the end of the movie. Adding to this a couple of explosions and a good cast sums to two hours of fun.

"Aw Man, Tony Scott's Toning Down","As opposed to the growing ambition, heart-stoppingly violent tension, and grandiosity in what Tony Scott's been leading up to with his past two movies, Man On Fire and Domino, is deflated with Deja Vu. Deja Vu is just another action thriller about a cop and a bad guy, an interesting twist and an ""unexpected"" love interest, corny comic relief tech teams and a PG-13 rating. I wanted more out of it, because ever since the final credits started rolling for Domino, I was expecting Tony Scott's next film to be next to the biggest rush of grunge, sleaze, eye-candy film-making, and music video editing I would ever get from a movie. I'm sure that somewhere deep down I felt that his next movie would have to be a lighter, almost cute actioner, because it's very difficult not to be stabbed with angry words from a studio exec who just flushed millions of dollars on a flop that read 17 or 18% fresh on the Tomatometer, not to mention the amount of cockiness and filmmakers' rebellion that was so aggressively lunged into Domino, a sort-of-biographyish action extravaganza that featured two stars of Beverly Hills 90210 playing themselves as they get their noses broken and later find themselves screaming as they happen to be there when a crazed Mexican is ripping a man's arm off with Tom Jones's cover of Mama Told Me Not To Come blaring over the soundtrack.Nonetheless, Deja Vu is a good, neat little thriller, even if it doesn't pack a punch or feel as twisted and comfortably numbing as Domino, Man On Fire, True Romance, or even Scott's earlier work like The Hunger and The Last Boy Scout. Deja vu might explain the all-too- familiar characters or the never-ending cycle of love interests that just has to lay its turf in every adventure film, action fans will have a decent time with it, thriller fans will love it, and Denzel fans will be making noise in the theater and aggravating the daylights out of the rest of the audience as usual.Washington, who has played this very same down-to-earth yet abruptly raging cop as many times as Willis has played his tough cop, Eddie Murphy has played his wisecracking cop, and De Niro has played his cocky, boisterous tough guy. This is one of the hints that this is just another action movie, because the star playing the tiring staple role for millions of dollars is a key element in most. Who should've gotten more screen time was constantly inflating but never too routine or drudging Val Kilmer. In a film full of actors with not quite enough charm to carry their corn-stuffed formula roles, I would've much preferred him as the hero. With the exception of Jim Caviezel, taking a huge turn as the ruthless, murder-driven villain from famously playing the most kind and decent man in the world in The Thin Red Line and taking the next step to Jesus Christ in The Passion of the Christ, the rest of the cast is just, well, there.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Denzel...why not just become a cop, already?","DEJA VU 2006 (DENZEL WASHINGTON, PAULA PATTON, VAL KILMER) DIRECTED BY: TONY SCOTT ~ THE RUNDOWN: Tony Scott has done nothing but sh*t since True Romance; here he further corrupts the world by burdening us with this generic and laughable cop thriller. ~ Okay, with all BS aside, this is the premise of Deja Vu: cop uses time machine to...well...go back in time and save people. And upon conception of this ground-breaking design in storytelling, as*hole Jerry Bruckheimer hands a typewriter to a down-syndrome person who just got done watching Minory Report and 12 Monkeys and tells him to get to work. He, of course, makes it explicitly clear that the raw innovation accomplished so far still needs a gimmick...anything good for the theatrical trailer. The plot is ridiculous, and is founded upon the supposed and unquestioned creation of a government-made ""super machine"" that, according to the movie, just kinda...happened. I tell you, though, what's even more ridiculous is that they expect you to take it seriously, cheesy music and all, and care for characters in an absurd, horribly clichéd meshing of science-fiction and cop-investigation melodrama. You can't have your cake and eat it to. And, speaking of cops, how many times now has Denzel played one? I mean, wtf, is this guy like an honorary member of the Hollywood PD? He's been the lead in like every cop thriller of the last ten years. Yes, he HAS proved himself many times and has given several amazing performances including his role as a corrupt officer in Training Day...yet, has he never heard the word versatility? You better get to work Denzel, your legacy is at stake. ~ By normal standards of film-making this is not a bad movie; it was shot impressively and the acting was good. Also, I admit, at times I found myself saying: ""wow, that's actually pretty cool."" However, by the time the last half hour arrived, I couldn't have cared less what was going to happen.

A Cinematic Masterpiece That Keeps You Hooked,"Deja Vu delivers a riveting blend of mystery, crime, and sci-fi, intricately tied to historical events, creating a deeply immersive viewing experience.

As Doug Carlin, he seamlessly embodies an insightful detective driven by vengeance, justice, and empathy.

Re Vu,"It's hard not to spoil the key aspect ""Déjà Vu"" is hiding from its audience in its trailers, but rest assured the movie is assuredly the most conceptually ambitious and science fiction-tinged film Denzel Washington has starred in in quite some time, and maybe even his career.Taking place in a post-Katrina New Orleans where Washington plays Doug Carlin, an Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) investigator looking into a ferry's explosion that killed over 500, he's brought into the fold by FBI agent Andrew Pryzwarra (Val Kilmer), who introduces him to a top secret, mind-boggling technology that a good portion of the movie invests its plot in.Because of ""Déjà Vu""'s heavy dependency on the technology's far-reaching concept, a little mental compromise is required on our part, but it pays off fairly well in the end. In a sense there's definitely flavors from other modern works here: namely ""Minority Report,"" ""Enemy of the State"" (which producer Jerry Bruckheimer also anchored) and ""Frequency,"" the last of which co-star Jim Caviezel also starred in, albeit as 'The Good Guy' then (he plays Carroll Oerstadt, a patriotically confused terrorist, here).Paula Patton plays the confused damsel in distress in Claire Kuchever, who becomes the object of Carlin's desire early in the movie. She's nothing to write home about, but her role is crucial and delivered adequately.Washington does fall victim to several clichés, one being his formerly frowned upon typecast / now pleasingly expected role reprisal of a keen-eyed city detective. The other is the clichéd ""intrigued outsider looking to push the limits of a technology he knows nothing about much to the chagrin of the technology's creators"" deal. What the candid Washington does he does well, however, injecting his usual flair of charm and humor to overcome the film's banalities.""Déjà Vu"" manages to nod towards a number of genres and still make for a compelling two hours that never seem to drift too far outside the lines of reasoning. Despite a number of concepts and details vividly and vaguely familiar, it's a careful mix that quite often works.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"The people part is very good, the FX vary from distracting to good.","Denzel Washington is a favorite of mine. He is selective about what projects he takes on, and does pretty good at making a good movie.I liked the people part of this movie a lot. The emotional attachment Denzel develops for the first victim becomes a romantic interest, with time. I found this progression and conduct both human and engaging.The science is OK, I guess, one of many theories of the universe, but told in a way that seems almost like an inside joke. Only those that have had better introductions will recognize the theory.I found the rapid camera angle change effects distracting and annoying. This stuff might be the current 'technical marvel', but it sure spins my stomach. Nearly literally. And I didn't see that these sequences contributed a blamed thing to the story being told. The smooth angle transitions, similar to the viewfinder sequences in 'Erased' (with Arnold Schwarzenegger), worked nicely. The frame-jump stuff was sophomoric and distracting. I will be glad when the FX guys that like this stuff retire.Deja Vu shows us some heroic acts, some people that are dedicated to their work and kind and responsible with people. People that we want to know better, and that are just like people we already know and love. This is a good movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Good start but non-sensical...,"1st watched 5/28/2009 – 5 out of 10 (Dir- Tony Scott): Good start but non-sensical ending destroys what could have been a good detective story. The movie is basically about a terrorist setting off a bomb on a New Orleans ferry and a detective from the ATF, played by Denzel Washington, trying to figure out who did it and why. Once he's added to a secret team to work on the issue, he's introduced to a machine that looks back four days in time and is able to do surveillance, somehow. But we find out later that the machine isn't just capable of surveillance but is also a time machine. It's not been used much for real interacting with the past(they've only sent small object back) but they try it with a piece of paper that will hint the past cops as to what's happening – it doesn't quite work but gives Denzel's character the idea to try more. He gets attracted to a victim and after the case is solved he decides he wants to send himself back to save her and possibly stop the event from ever occurring. This is where the story gets goofy as the machine has never been tested with humans and it makes no sense that they would allow him to do this. The rest of the movie is ridiculous as most movies that explore time travel are and destroyed what could have been a good movie. Of course, the gimmick had to be used for this purpose to appease our action-oriented, gimmick-driven, good guy gets the girl American movie audience but this is what makes it fall apart. Too bad because it definitely was compelling in the first half.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime

Scott does it again,"There isn't another director working today whose films I look more forward to than Tony Scott's. Not his brother, not Spielberg, not Howard, not Tarantino,not Nolan, not Rami,OK maybe Scorcese and maybe the Coen brothers, but Scott's strength is that he is the PT Barnum of today's directors. Take Deja Vu, ridiculous plot with holes you could lead an elephant through (to continue with the circus metaphor), and yet not a frame was wasted. Critics have said that the convoluted plot took so much explanation that it dragged, and I just didn't feel that one iota. One thing Tony Scott's films don't do is drag. He just entertains like no other filmmaker today. Besides the Usual Suspects, True Romance is my favorite film of the last 20 years. The rest of his films are just solid entertainment.

He causes numerous accidents, some clearly involving injury to other drivers, yet there is no follow-up for actions that could be considered equally heinous to the terrorist bombing, though on a smaller scale.On another note, however, give Denzel props for wearing the Dillard University baseball cap in the opening scenes in tribute to this Historically Black University in New Orleans, as he promised Dillard students he would when he visited the temporary campus in the New Orleans Hilton Riverside Hotel during filming last spring.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
AHHHHHH!!!!!!,"Started off soo strong and then disappointed to a massive degree. Just so unbelievable! They tried to add time travel to this movie which was just so stupid in soooo many ways. So many stupid plot holes. I don't get it.They tried to include space travel technology into a simple bombing crime case. Couldn't they have used this technology for something greater than this stupid case? And why did they bring in lower level police to work with such great technology? Just too stupid, couldn't continue watching after learning about the time travel part. Didn't even understand it.Forget this movie. Trash. Though it might be good all the way through. Don't know though, and don't care. Denzel is good though, as always.Wouldn't recommend.2 stars",2.0,Anonymous,Crime
"An overlong, far-fetched thriller that drowns in it's own preposterousness more and more as it goes along","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningDoug Carlin (Denzel Washington- sure I've heard that name somewhere before???) is a Federal Agent called in to investigate when a New Orleans cruise-liner goes up in flames and terrorist activity is suspected as the cause. He crosses paths with Agent Pryzwarra (Val Kilmer) who he starts to work with and slowly piece the case together. But when the charred body of a young woman who appears to have been killed before the explosion is found, he falls even deeper into the case. Then Pryzwarra introduces him to a new technology that causes a ripple in time and see dreadful events before they've even occurred. So now Carlin is faced not only with the possibility of investigating the crime but going back in time and stopping it ever happening.In between making big 'event' movies and Oscar contenders, Denzel finds time to make pot-boiler thrillers like this and the (fairly) recent Out of Time. Not bad filler stuff, perhaps, but Deja Vu is a film that starts to drown so far in it's own ridiculousness that at over two hours it's a rather long slog to sit through.It's a less flattering patch on Denzel's CV just as much as on director Tony Scott's. And yes, you probably do get the impression you've been here before with this kind of film. **",4.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Great movie, probably second or third best this year","Tony Scott and Denzel do it again. If you did not like Man on Fire's cinematography, not much has changed. I loved it. He is a great director and a great editor. Many of the shots made my jaw drop and eyes widen. They were incredible.The plot was perfect. Everything that doesn't make sense in the beginning is fully explained later. It is incredible and makes you smile when you realize that you are seeing what happened.Now, the biggest complaint is that it is not physically possible. But this is a movie. I mean, it is OK for ten-story apes to exist, but once something scientific doesn't fully seem possible, the movie gets a D. Trust me on this, this movie is great.

Good cinematography,"The fun in the film is I suggest mostly provided by just how the boy loses the girl and exactly how he pursues her to the end of this one. Tony Scott directed this action masterwork for producer Jerry Bruckheimer, from a script by Bill Marsilli and co-producer Terry Rossio. Production Designer Chris Seagers makes use of understated but consistent lighting of and New Orleans streets and backgrounds just enough to give the real flavor of the Crescent City, which I have visited and experienced more than once. Paul Cameron's cinematography, the controlled art direction supplied by Drew Boughton, and the award level and very complex set decoration by Rosemary Brandenburg all in my opinion add greatly to the film's unusual believability. The makeup task was enormous in this movie; and the costumes well-handled; but these elements mostly provide a background to the main storyline's progress. Among the exceedingly large cast, standouts include Val Kilmer, James Caviezel as a terrorist, and a number of good actors in small roles as FBI and ATF officials. It is difficult to do justice to the pace, intelligence and gradual unfolding of so interesting a story.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Amazing and exciting!!!,"It is really a great movie, with excellent plot and marvelous actors! Denzel Washington as for me is the best Afroamerican actor!!! In the beginning I didn't want to see this movie, it hadn't gotten a success in Russia and I thought that it would be boring and uninteresting cheap action but my friends told me THE TRUTH and i am not sorry that I have watched it! The problems in the movie, I think, are very actual nowadays, and ""deja vu"" really forces to think about them. So I call everybody: if you want to see a wonderful, but not easy to understanding movie, you must go to your nearest cinema and watch ""deja vu"". Maybe you will say after viewing: ""I have a feeling that I watched this film earlier. It's like... deja vu.""",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Things that make you go ""hmmmmm""...","I really enjoyed this film. It had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. At points, my head hurt from trying to figure out all the twists and turns - primarily from attempting to figure out the whole time travel aspect. Even though I've seen the film several times now, I'm still not sure I have it totally figured out. But I like when a film has me second guessing my own conclusions. It almost means you have to watch it multiple times to uncover things you may have missed the first time around. This film is definitely like that.Denzel does a good job, but I wouldn't say this is one of my favorites of his performances. Although I do like him in this. I just think this film is less of a character story and is more about the plot itself of traveling to the past and whether we can alter outcomes. So my focus was always more on that, than on the characters themselves. It would have been neat to see Halle Berry in the role of Claire - I wasn't familiar with the girl that played Claire (Paula Patton). It creeped me out a little that the same dude (Jim Caviezel) that played Jesus in PASSION OF THE Christ played the terrorist here. Just doesn't seem right somehow.There are some good action shots. I think it's great they chose to shoot in New Orleans as their economy definitely needed help after Katrina.Go to the message boards if you want to try to analyze timelines, parallel universes, wormholes, paradoxes and such. I looked at some of that, and it just made me more confused. I say, just watch the movie and enjoy it for all the pulse-pumping, adrenalin-raising thrills!",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Ludicrous,"I understand you have to suspend disbelief to some extent to watch any film but this takes it way too far. A plot device so insane and unbelievable it devalues absolutely everything else in the film. There are some big name actors in this that I feel embarrassed for and I'm amazed they signed on for anything so stupid. I can only think all the budget went on the actors because the special effects are terrible, a good 10 years behind the time this film was made. I couldn't make it to the end of the film because I was cringing so hard. I stuck it out for a while the comedy value and just to make sure that I hadn't fundamentally misunderstood the plot device but unfortunately no, it really was as bad as I thought.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
Watchable,"This scientific thriller was only watchable and one of Denzel Washington's worst films and performance. This film was far fetched, but Paula Patton (Claire Kuchever) definitely saved the film. Paula is gorgeous and adorable in this film. I think everyone has a bit of Deja Vu once in their life and would like to go back in time to re-do a moment in their life. This is like the film The Family Man, but poorly done.When we see Denzel at the morgue looking at Patton's corpse she is wearing only one red earring. When Washington goes to see his partner we see one red earring and the assumption is that it belongs to his partner.When Paula has a bag over her head we see Oersted visible through the bag, so Paula should have known her kidnapper was white and not black. She would have known immediately Denzel was not the kidnapper, therefore she would have never pulled a gun on Denzel and called the ATF office.Tony Scott should be ashamed! This film is a one time viewing.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Time Travel, Crime Thriller With A heart","Deja Vu is a top notched policier that effectively bridges the sci-fi cop film romance gap with stinging aplomb. I had my doubts but 20 minutes into this effects filled bonanza I was thoroughly hooked. There is little point in going into the intricacies of the convoluted plot. Reading a description will only make you think, ""That sounds to implausible."" one would utter. Yes there are some inconsistencies. (""Shocked, I am shocked to discover gambling at Ricks!"") If you think to hard about it you will, well think to hard about it. Fact is that when you watch it as opposed to reading about it it all seems to make sense. Deja Vu does an incredible job of suspending disbelief, even if you have to swallow twice you will be too entertained to care.The charge leveled against Denzel Washington is that he doesn't make serious pictures. Well that, my friend, is a good thing because his presence transforms countless Hollywood ""product"" into endearing fun. Remember ""Out Of Time""? And how about ""The Bone Collector""? Even ""Training Day"" was a pretty hackneyed project but the common denominator in all of these films is Denzel. He has done more to make run of the mill studio films bearable than just about any working actor and he doesn't disappoint here giving a great performance and elevating this hokum to near art. Denzel is the ""everyman"" that can act his way out of just about any situation, no matter how ridiculous, leaving the audience wanting more.A minor quibble is running length. Hitchcock once noted that a film's running time should not exceed the carrying capacity of a healthy human bladder and this picture stretches it a bit. There really is no need for about 20 minutes, particularly the film's extended conclusion, but who cares? It is a great deal of fun nonetheless.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
One big Deja Vu itself,"If I'm completely honest I'd say that this movie itself is one big Deja Vu. We don't see anything that hasn't been done before. Denzel Washington plays another charismatic FBI-agent with the task of saving a girl. He did it before, and he most likely will do it again. But since that is the thing he's damned good at, you won't hear me complain about it.The storyline of altering time and the consequences appears deeper on the outside than it actually is. In the end it are the nice explosions and action-pumped car chase that steal the show rather than any philosophical side to the subject. All the SF talk is just a way of making it more believable.I may appear a bit sarcastic, but I'm not. This movie really doesn't do anything wrong by being a well-crafted thriller. You never have the feeling that they elevate any of the subjects to a higher plain nor do you care. Pure fun is good once in a while. And it's never a punishment to watch Denzel Washington act.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

"What if you had to tell someone the most important thing in the world, but you knew they'd never believe you?","Deja Vu is a very interesting take on the time travel spectrum directors, writers, and producers alike are all interested in. Tony Scott (Man on Fire, Enemy of the State) once again goes with Denzel Washington to boost his movie. If it weren't for Denzel's superb acting, I'd give the movie a 7. Putting aside the silly time-travel lingo tossed around throughout, the movie itself has strong performances and good action/suspense...that's all if you're able to set aside the time travel idea. It IS a pretty far-fetched way to do the whole time travel thing.I didn't find the techno jargon too difficult to grasp/understand from an intuitive aspect, but I have watched this with my family and I had to give a run-down on what they were talking about. I understand, some explaining is needed, but Tony may have extended the details a tad bit too far. I like how he makes Denzel just as confused as viewers are, and realistically Denzel doesn't grasp the science stuff easily. That was a good touch. Denzel actually probably wasn't even acting too much during that part, because he sounded genuinely confused. Denzel is a question man in this movie, and boy he was great in this movie. I love a good Denzel role (which I'm sure most of you do too), and his character is basically the reason this movie did well at the box office, and the reason I (along with many others) bought the DVD.So, the whole time, Denzel and co. are trying to figure out (via intelligent global survey satellite) who really blew up the New Orleans ferry boat packed full of Navy officers and civilians alike (which is shown at the beginning of the movie). In the process, gorgeous new comer Paula Patton is tossed in the mix of the whole bomb act, and thus Denzel forms an attachment to her, and is determined to protect her from what she doesn't know awaits her.The movie is really a romantic action thriller. The sci-fi aspect is overshadowed by a very strong performance by Mr. Washington. I think as viewers, you'll really enjoy this movie a lot by putting aside the sci-fi aspect and watching it for its suspense and thrills. I think Tony should stray away from trying to do far-fetched sci-fi from here on out and just stick to his high-octane action thrillers...and use Denzel because as far as Im concerned, he's one of the strongest actors in Hollywood as of now. Pretty good plot, decent sci-fi aspect, great thrills, and awesome performances make up this movie.I'm Will Black and that's my review of Deja Vu8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"A great thriller, Tony Scot does it again","I enjoyed every moment of this sci-fi thriller - and the script allows you to believe it and buy it and if you go with it, you'll enjoy a great thriller! Denzel is one of the few, if only actor who I will go see just because he's in a film. He has that ability to make his character so juicy and believable that you go with what he is doing...Paula Patton is wonderful, as is the entire cast. From the music to the storyline, to the cinematography - I loved it! I was on the edge of my seat and not really sure where they were taking me - which I love! I really don't like predicting a script and this was never a predictable storyline...Well done. Tony Scott is a good solid director - and his teaming up with Denzel (Man on Fire) proved to be a correct marriage of film talent! See the film if you like Denzel, if you like good scripts and thrillers bordering on sci-fi. At several points in the film you are really involved in two films for the price of one! Well done - thank you!",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
U CAN SAVE HER,"I have to admit right away, that science fiction, which includes time travel, is not one of my favourite genres, simply because I struggle to understand the niceties of the story line, more often than not.Not being a very patient person, and hubbie having watched this film multiple times, I made him keep pausing the action to explain both the current and upcoming scenes to me ... frustrating for him I know, but I also hate surprises!Is Denzel Washington typecast? Probably
Does he ever make a bad film? NeverYou could almost believe that he is playing out almost every character he has ever portrayed, in the way in which he approaches real life situations - cool, calm and collected.The plot was well considered and played out without any awkward continuity moments. The special effects and crowd scenes were meticulous and well executed and Val Kilmer played the perfect foil to Denzel's character.If you were not quite as sceptical as myself, you could not have failed to find this a very thought provoking, immersive and intriguing film.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Déjà vu has an interesting premise, and if you allow yourself to believe it then you will have fun.","If you want to be entertained with visually stunning action and excitement, catch Déjà vu on the big screen, because that's the best way to view this incredible story from Terry Rossio (same writer of the Pirates of the Caribbean series, Shrek, Zorro). Déjà vu has an interesting premise, and if you allow yourself to believe it then you will have fun.Tony Scott teams up once more with his fave leading man Denzel Washington, who comfortably fits into the role (although he overacts in one scene in an angry outburst). The rest of the cast is just as pretty: Jim Caviezel marvelously transforms into a credible villain (from playing Jesus Christ in The Passion of the Christ) and he is exceptionally handsome enough for the audience to both fear and be enamored by his sociopathic terrorist turn.Producer-turned-actress Paula Patton is beautifully exotic, which makes Denzel's decision to save her digestible. Val Kilmer also pulls his own weight, literally, putting on the pounds to amply play a supporting role. Adam Goldberg as stereotypical looking scientist provides welcome comic relief, aptly punctuating tense or boring scenes.Scott's trademark staccato editing and messy montages, which somehow amazingly doesn't confuse the viewers, was perfectly executed, as always, in this Bruckheimer action spectacular.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Such a waste of an interesting idea.,"Had this film script landed on the desk of any other producer but Jerry Bruckheimer's, this could have been a great sci-fi action film. Twists, turns and interesting concepts abound. It could have been amazing.However, as it is, the movie is reduced to this: things go boom - a lot, women are there to be leered at in the shower by a room full of meatheads or to pray over bowls of soup (thus showing what 'good' girls they are), cars go fast, men do actiony things and talk tough, guns go off and then, just for a change, things explode.Honestly, Denzel Washington and Jim Caviezel are about as wasted in this boof-headed romp as two actors can be. Both are far better than this swill. I can only hope they were paid handsomely.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
Back To The Future 4 The DRAMA,"This movie as with most movies was marketed sneakily. The trailer made you think it was Deja Vu but in reality it was TIME TRAVEL.This movie wreaks of plot holes, but the biggest problem was the forced scriptwriting to get Denzel into action sequences that were a joke. Apart from the fact that he probably killed several people in the car chase, this was totally unnecessary. For a US Government, Black Ops kind of project, surely if the glimpses of the past 4 days camera goes out of range it would be easier to have a helicopter with a receiver mounted to it to access out of range footage.Come on, sending a guy out in a truck with a helmet that let's you see the 4 days ago NOW, would be the dumbest car chase in Hollywood history, accept for Blues Brothers, but that's a comedy.The scriptwriters had a 22 minute twilight zone episode to work with and were forced to flesh it out in the typical Hollywood formulaic style. BRING BACK TWILIGHT ZONE.The whole thing with the red laser light piercing the time space continuum was in word, LAME, so was throwing a desk chair at highly intricate technology that could create a time space paradox or shut down the entire network, was very immature.If accessing the past was the case, and the fact that they could send back a note stating the facts of the future, why didn't they just send back another note to any one of the characters, like say VAL KILMER or his boss, or the DEJA VU computer geeks. One successful attempt and they give up, only to use a Special Helmet that blocks the vision of the driver. Come on, it's almost as if George Bush was one of the script writers.The clincher was after stating that sending a fly and a small animal back in time failed miserably, why then would they bother sending a human, also why didn't Denzel (A Brilliant Actor, just a bad Agent, where's Ari when you need him), strip down to the Full Monty for his time travel trip, even Arnie traveled back in time naked in T1 and T2.All in all this movie was a multi million dollar Twilight Zone episode that really needed some love and attention to bring it up to speed.Oh Jerry, Terry and Ted let some new writing blood on to the lot, who knows you might earn millions and educate your audience all at the same time.It seems TV is starting to, or already is, out writing FILMS.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
