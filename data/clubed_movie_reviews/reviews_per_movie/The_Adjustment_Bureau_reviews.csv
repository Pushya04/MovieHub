What an interesting thriller,"There's no reason why The Adjustment Bureau isn't included in the top ""fate flicks"", like Inception, Interstellar, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Unbreakable, and Minority Report. It's really good! I went with my family to the theaters to see it when it was released, and we were all on the edge of our seats. Except my mom, who was jealously eyeing Emily Blunt because she knew my dad had a crush on her.Basically, if you like the Bourne Identity movies, you'll love this one. Matt Damon stars in another thriller about fate and total strangers knowing more about his life than he does, but I liked this better than the more famous trilogy. I'm not the biggest Damon fan, but I was so engrossed in George Nolfi's screenplay, the lead actor could have been played by anyone and I would have liked it. He starts the movie as a senatorial candidate, but a chance encounter with a beautiful interpretive dancer (Emily Blunt) rocks his world. He sees her again and they start dating, and pretty soon they fall in love. But one night, he gets kidnapped and taken to a mysterious warehouse by the ""bad guys"".Are they really the bad guys, though? They're the titular bureau, led by Terence Stamp, in charge of making sure everyone stays on his or her path. When people deviate from their predestined path, they ""adjust"" things so life goes back on track. Depending on your point of view, Damon is the pot-stirring villain and Stamp is the hero who sees the bigger picture - which is why this movie is so enjoyable. You can root for anyone you want to, and it can spark any number of conversations afterwards with your friends. You'll also see lots of familiar faces, like John Slattery, Michael Kelly, Jennifer Ehle, and Anthony Mackie, as well as New Yorkers giving cameos, like Jon Stewart, James Carville, Chuck Scarborough, Michael Bloomberg, Terry McAullife, Jesse Jackson, and Madeleine Albright.

Fighting for fate,"The fascinating premise, that there are some talented actors on board and the generally positive word of mouth were my reasons for seeing 'The Adjustment Bureau'. Seeing it, there are no regrets watching it but at the same time it was a little frustrating. It is an interesting and decent film, but had real potential to be a great one and could have been much more.Matt Damon is a charismatic presence and commands the film with ease without ever trying too hard. Emily Blunt has a genuine winning charm as one often finds with Blunt, her character is not quite as interesting as Damon's but Blunt makes it work. The two have great chemistry together, it really sparkles. In fact it is the romance that comes off the best and most consistently, being where 'The Adjustment Bureau' really comes alive. Anthony Mackie is suitably mysterious while also quite likable in the film's latter stages.John Slattery really looks the part and has a lot of fun in a suitably shady role while Terence Stamp brings some sinister dignity and authority to a rather severely underwritten character that appears in the film too late somewhat. On the acting front, 'The Adjustment Bureau' is very good.As it is too with the way it's made, suitably gritty and slick with some inventive moments and an audacious style. The locations are chosen well and used cleverly. The music score has a good mix of understatement and thrilling pulsation. The first half has a lot of very interesting and smart ideas that leaves one gripped enough to carry on and see further how it goes and there is a good deal of fun and a few suspenseful jolts to be had.For all those great things, 'The Adjustment Bureau' would have been an even better film if it had done more with the premise. The romance is the most well done and memorable element of it and the rest doesn't live up. It's intriguing and entertaining, but the second half suffers from playing it too safe and having too many ideas needing to be tied up, meaning that potentially great ideas are not fully expanded upon (even the whole basic premise doesn't feel fully cooked).Pacing does get stodgy, as a result of the lack of risk-taking and struggles with keeping things probable and consistent. Despite the conflict being well performed the threat feels lacking because it is handled in a way that's under-cooked and somewhat repetitive which dilutes the suspense quite badly. The more under-explored 'The Adjustment Bureau' gets, the more confusing, tonally muddled and far-fetched it gets too. This is especially true with the ending, which to me is down there with the decade's ""what the heck"" film endings.Overall, has a lot to recommend but there was a lot more to the film that never fully emerged. 6/10 Bethany Cox",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
very interesting!,"This movie has been a very good experience for me.
I found the story extremelly interesting and intelligent.I enjoyed every second, cause there was a lot of action, mystery (in the nice way of it), romance, humor, and at the same time the story made you think deeper about life it self. About getting out of your little every day life and try to see the ""greater picture"". How ready and capable is any of us ""every day people"" to make a change, to believe, to dare, to even actual think ""differently"" in any part of our lives...",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Intelligence mixed with big-budget Hollywood action to form the new science fiction romance genre,"I'm starting to like this new genre of science fiction romance that ""The Adjustment Bureau"" falls into. Hollywood seems to have learned how to add a significant amount thought to their films, just with their usual dumbing-down procedures.David (Matt Damon) has met Elise (Emily Blunt) and based on one spontaneous kiss and one flirtatious encounter, he's determined that she's the one he's supposed to be with. They have other plans. Oh yes, the indefinable, ambiguous pronoun ""they"". Just to keep a sense of the intrigue afloat, I'll define ""they"" as the men of ""The Adjustment Bureau"". What they want, we don't really know. But David wants the girl—a beautiful girl—but just a girl nonetheless.For us, questions of free will, fate, soul mates, success and pre-defined destinies abound. All running around an intricate maze of New York architecture. Although intricate might not be the best word because there's nothing here for us to figure out; the film lays everything out well in advance, and over and over again in case you missed it. At least there's intelligence to the story but unfortunately no subtlety.""The Adjustment Bureau"" has pretty city-scapes and pretty people playing more profound characters than pretty people usually play. As with most genre-mixing films, there is something for everybody. I got the intelligence that is usually sorely missing from big-budget Hollywood action films although I could have done with a bit more respect.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
An intelligent romantic film with a sci-fi twist,"This film is about a successful politician who has to choose between the woman of his dreams and his career, when he meets a team of messengers who control fate.""The Adjustment Bureau"" is certainly a different romantic film. The plot is an engaging and refreshing mix of romance and science fiction. The thrill and excitement of the science fiction part is well maintained throughout the film, while the romance part melts viewers hearts. Matt Damon and Emily Blunt are so convincing together, making their romance very believable. Once again, Emily Blunt puts on a particularly stellar performance, showing her impressive range of acting skills and on screen charm.""The Adjustment Bureau"" is a good film as it is a refreshing departure from mundane and formulaic romantic comedies.

Intriguing and Ambiguous Story,"In New York, the prominent politician David Norris (Matt Damon) is disputing the election for the Senate but his past of bad boy makes him lose the election. He meets the stranger Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt) hidden in the Waldorf's toilet and she tells that she had crashed a party and the security guards are chasing her. They start a conversation and they immediately fall in love with each other. However the guards find her and David does not see her again. However she inspires him to make a remarkable speech.One day, David is traveling by bus and he meets Elise again. She gives her phone number to him and David promises to call her. However, strangers wearing hats approach to David and tell that they belong to the Adjustment Bureau and Elise and David must be kept apart. They destroy the piece of paper with her phone number and David is unable to contact Elise. Three years later, David sees Elise walking on the sidewalk. He gets out of the bus to meet her and he learns that she is a dancer. But the strangers use their abilities to keep them apart. What is the reason why David and Elise can not be together?""The Adjustment Bureau"" is a romantic and suspenseful sci-fi based on a short story by Philip K. Dick, the writer of ""Blade Runner"", ""Total Recall"", ""Impostor"", ""Minority Report"", ""Paycheck"", ""A Scanner Darkly"" and ""Next"", among other sci-fi films. The intriguing story is ambiguous; the chemistry between Matt Damon and Emily Blunt is wonderful; and it is always great to see Terence Stamp.

Sparkling chemistry between Damon and Blunt,"Fate, coincidence and free will come at odds with one another in this sci-fi romance re-imagined by George Nolfi from the short story, ""Adjustment Team"", by sci-fi legend Philip K. Dick. Nolfi's plot can go from interesting and intriguing to downright silly at times but the main attraction is not the narrative. It is the pulsating chemistry between lead stars Matt Damon and the sensually beguiling Emily Blunt set in all the famous spots of Manhattan and NYC.Having been to New York City recently, I find the sets nostalgic, and I am defenseless to the charms of Emily Blunt.Young Senate candidate for New York City, David Norris (Damon), is rehearsing his speech in the men's restroom when a beautiful stranger (Blunt, right, with Damon) emerges from one of the stalls and starts chatting with him. Before she leaves - in quite a hurry - they have an impulsive, passionate kiss, and he is smitten. Their next encounter in a city bus has to be by chance - and he learns that her name is Elise. He is determined to call her. To court her...And then David comes across a bunch of Men in Black suits and hats, led by a Mr Richardson (John Slattery), who says bluntly: ""We are the people who make sure things go according to plan."" David's relationship with the free-spirited Elise is NOT part of their plan and he must not see her again - for both his and her own good! The rest of the movie is, of course, the tussle between Love and Fate for David. After being charmed by Elise, a rising star ballerina, we can understand why David is bent on seeing her. We can also understand how their relationship would possibly wreck their careers - and why David would want to take a chance on that. David and Elise seem so perfect for each other that we root for them.It is good that Nolfi has written such a romantic angle into this Dick tale instead of turning it into another action flick like ""Total Recall"", ""Paycheck"" and ""Screamers"". He could have polished up a bit more on the second half to keep it from becoming childish, though. Still, the notion of Fates personified could not be taken too seriously - and it would be better to just go along with the flow of the love story so charmingly portrayed by Damon and Blunt - and supported by a sympathetic Anthony Mackie and menacing Terence Stamp as members of the Adjustment Bureau. Emily Blunt has such captivating eyes that look into your soul and make you weep.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A well made and more thoughtful film that you might be expecting,"What if your own free will was nothing of the sort. Every move you made was in accordance with a master plan, any kinks or imperfections ""adjusted"" by persons unknown, constantly on hand to ensure you stayed on track.Many people might assume that their lives are quite the reverse, with all the bad decisions they have made, anything resembling a master plan is unlikely.David Norris (Matt Damon) is a rising New York Congressman with his heart set on becoming a young Senator, everything is going according to plan until he meets the beautiful quirky ballerina, Elise (Emily Blunt) in a mens restroom.Elise inspires him in ways that he could not have imagined but any longer term relationship is not part of the plan the ""Men in Grey"" have mapped out. They do not like their careful plans messed with, ever. Although they do get to wear Trilby's, which not only look cool but are also a necessary tool for their profession.The many scenes between Blunt and Damon are very believable and natural, real chemistry in action and is fun to watch. Blunt is a breath of fresh air in the congressman's driven life, living more in the moment than he possibly ever did before.Just when you think the film will descend into a smorgasbord of special effects, the story goes into the opposite direction. A thoughtful and character driven piece about choices and the ripple effect each path taken, or not taken, has on your own and other peoples lives.Terence Stamp, still with one of the best voices in the business, together with Anthony Mackie & John Slattery, do good work as the agents attempting to get everything back on track.There are some good lines and Damon can play an aspiring politician with ease, no doubt he could be one in real life if he chose to move in that direction.The central question of defining who we are by the choices we make is explored and it is good to see another movie messing with our heads, if only just a little. If we have no free will are we still the people we thought we were, very deep but don't panic, the film does not get too caught up in this existentialism.The action is limited, there are no cars exploding and the body count is non existent, a refreshing change from most modern films. A film that could have been made in the 50's from a story point of view, although actually based on a short story by Phillip K Dick of ""Do Androids dream of electric sheep"" fame, the inspiration for ""Blade Runner"".Production values are good, although not of the highest flight. The costumes worn by the adjustment police are rather dodgy and look like guys with spare motorcycle helmets sprayed black. Not what you would expect in a big budget Hollywood movie, a small point but quite noticeable.Similar to many films of this genre, the movie has to decide how to wrap everything up neatly. The final reel is perhaps a little disappointing but that depends on how you would want the film to end, somehow it feels that the easier option was taken.SummaryA well made and more thoughtful film than you might be expecting.Well acted with a believable romance, a light dusting of Sci-Fi and a great story. ""Inception"" lite perhaps, which is certainly recommendation enough for any film.http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
I am eagerly looking forward to this first-time director's entire career,"""The Adjustment Bureau"" is a first-time piece of directing work by a certain George Nolfi, who before had worked in Hollywood pretty much exclusively as a screenwriter. He also composed the script for this picture and that is half of what impressed me so much. Just looking at the way he choreographed his images, and worked so well with his two stars, despite the occasional lapse here and there expected of somebody making their first feature-length motion picture, I must say I am eagerly looking forward to his entire career. For ""The Adjustment Bureau,"" while not any kind of a masterpiece, is one of the most unexpectedly pleasing and wholeheartedly enjoyable movies of the year.Mr. Nolfi's involvement in the third Jason Bourne movie may have had some input in his getting Matt Damon to take the lead as an ambitious but somewhat dubious New York governor candidate. Through some odd and very charming circumstances, Mr. Damon runs into a bold, pretty young ballet dancer played by the always intoxicating Emily Blunt. Affectionate toward each other at first sight, they slowly fall in love and try to reach each other several times over a period lasting years. But the only thing tearing them apart and stopping them is not a jealous ex, not a terrorist plot, but instead a group of mysterious men in 30s-style jackets and fedoras calling themselves the Adjustment Bureau.The screenplay was based on a Philip K. Dick story called ""The Adjustment Team"" and although the story is completely warped, the purpose of the titular men remains essentially the same. Their purpose, as a character played by very-good actor John Slattery explains, is to control how time plays out. Time and fate is prewritten in what is called 'The Plan' and they work in groups to make sure that things play out according to 'The Plan,' using whatever methods possible to make sure that the rest of the world falls in accordance to it. And as it turns out, the romance between Mr. Damon and Miss Blunt is something that is prohibited in their strategy and the film evolves into a very passionate and exciting story about two people deciding what is more important: to be with who you love, or to do what is better for the world entire.With a plot this extravagant, it is surprising that director Mr. Nolfi did not blunder into an entirely corny yarn. Occasionally, he does falter (some of the scientific lingo gets a little too pseudointellectual for my taste) but as a total, he succeeds in weaving a strong and passionate tale. But that may also return to the surmise that ""The Adjustment Bureau"" is not really a science-fiction tale. Rather, it is a deep romantic thriller that benefits from two sharply-written characters and two very charismatic performances. The movie rides on the romance between Matt Damon and Emily Blunt and you could not ask for better performances. This coming from someone who typically gripes at the 'Love At First Sight' gimmick but became an instant sucker for it here within ten minutes. Mr. Damon, who usually casts himself as tough guys with pasts, takes a chance at playing a softer, more emotional type who does not hurl a fist until the third act and does not instantly become a stuntman. And Miss Blunt does a fabulous job playing a courageous and strong-hearted woman. It's their chemistry and their moments together that really benefit the picture. For right away, I believed in the love brewing between them and it mattered to me whether or not they actually got together at the end. Just looking at these two people together is absolutely charming and even the obligatory love moment between them in bed is performed and shot in such a way that it does not become unnecessarily erotic and doesn't stop the story. Rather, it seems to work, like a piece of a puzzle.That is the definition of a good love story. If you were to take it out and transplant it in some totally different movie, it would still work.The love story is more interesting than the Adjustment Bureau men themselves and that may be one of the weaknesses of the picture. Despite some great performances from John Slattery, Anthony Mackie, and Terence Stamp, and the fact that we see inside of their operations quite a bit, we don't really come to know much about them. In addition, because this is a first-time directing job, some of the shots are imperfect. A moment where Mr. Damon tries to escape from the Bureau men and trips on a rising floor tile is awkward. The shot seems sped-up too fast and his leg hangs in the air for too long.My only real complaint about ""The Adjustment Bureau"" would have to be the much-griped-about ending, which has some religious subtexts that may anger some. Not offended myself, I just felt it, despite that wonderful shot of the two leads - and one of the few times where I liked the shot of the camera whirling 360 degrees around them - was a bit of a cop-out and not entirely satisfying.But my few notifications aside, I must happily repeat that this is one marvelously entertaining and emotionally-gripping little movie. And despite the fact that there have been some better-made pictures this year, few of them are liable to last as long in the memory as it. Sometimes it's better when a picture does not aim for masterpiece-status and it's better for the audience going in with an open mind and not assaulted by a big hype campaign. For then a movie like this becomes even more surprising and delightful. Congratulations all around, especially to Mr. Damon and Miss Blunt for their fabulous performances, and to writer-director George Nolfi, who has made a more-than-impressive first step into the most-cherished profession of directing motion pictures.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Think Charade meets The Matrix in 2011,"The Adjustment BureauThink a scripted blending of ""Charade"" (1963) meets ""The Matrix"" (1999), and you have an idea of the plot that is the basis for ""The Adjustment Bureau."" (2011) All three films revolve around romance, suspense and a heightened sense of place. In ""The Adjustment Bureau"" New York City is almost a third character, and spotting cameo appearances by East coast media elites (past and present) is a side game. Humor is also an element of this story, although it sometimes undercuts the power of the suspense and romance that I imagine is the film's intended tone.There are engaging performances to recommend the film, such as those by stars Matt Damon and Emily Blunt; as well as supporting actors Anthony Mackie, John Slattery, and the ever dangerously sexy Terrence Stamp.All the witty repartee between characters, the striking views of New York City, and the driving pulse of the soundtrack make ""The Adjustment Bureau"" an entertaining film, but not so well pulled together that it demands great thought and consideration after the screening is over.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Nice concept, lovely cast, slight problem with the screenplay and execution","I really wanted to like this because Matt Damon and Emily Blunt are two of my favorite actors and get a dream of a story based on a short essay by Philip K Dick (he of 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep' fame i.e. what turned into Blade Runner). Matt plays David Norris, a young congressman vying for the senate who keeps bumping into a girl (Elise = Emily) who he then manages to lose. Is it coincidence? Is it all meant to be? Are there darker forces at work? Is there a God? Is fate preordained? The film and script ask us all of these questions and then more.I found that the world which David and Emily inhabit is full of seemingly arbitrary rules, that the story was driven by forced coincidences which could not be explained away as semi-ironic, and which sometimes felt more like script conveniences than story, more plot-devices than plot.I found the denouement predictable and was waiting for the last half-hour of the film for Messrs Damon and Blunt to hurry up and get on with it as it was so clunky and PREDICTABLE(ironic given the story-line). Yes I've used the word 'predictable' twice. With good reason.There are many, and I mean many, things, props, tricks, flips etc that you will have seen before and that do appear, again, in this film. I do not want to give any spoilers, so you'll just have to watch the film and spot them all for yourself. This is billed as 'Bourne meets Inception' and I think it's MUCH more like Inception than a Bourne film.I did find the David Norris congressman/senator thing reminiscent of The Manchurian Candidate but without the strength of purpose that that latter film has and in fact, in Adjustment, it was a bit half-hearted and almost all of the subsidiary characters were very poorly fleshed-out with no characterization or arcs at all.Finally, the end message that this film delivers is extremely naive and slightly disappointing. I can see exactly what the filmmakers were trying to do but the problem is they've taken a solid PKD short, conceived a film but then effectively spoiled it a little by not spending enough time on developing the story into a fully-fledged all-singing all-dancing screenplay.Perhaps not enough controls were placed on the writer/director: however, I suspect that this script has been rewritten by a number of people, as certain things appear to be inserted as if part of a scientific exercise than as a fluid story, a sort of 'well, the way we managed to do that is...', continually playing the get out of jail free card.And this, I think, is the problem with the film. Despite the likability of the leads, you just don't feel for them. When they cry, you don't know or even care if it's real or not. They're cardboard cut-outs, doing their best, manipulated by PKD and the writer/director. You never feel like they're in danger. The film's only a 12 too which I think, for this 'darkness' of story, is simply not right.This should have been beefed up, the ante been raised and the MPAA/BBFC certificates upped to R and 15 respectively with some hard-hitting, juicy content which unfortunately this film shies away from at every opportunity.That said, it's still worth a 6.5 or 7 out of 10 because it IS fun: the problem is I also think it was, with that cast and that budget (USD51m), a wasted opportunity.I can't believe they didn't see that coming ;-)",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Refreshing and Intriguing,"I was invited today to see an Advance Screening of this movie by a a friend and was excited to find out it was this movie.

I loved it and know that I will definitely buy it when it's released on DVD in the future.Oh and the theater I saw it in had a couple of hundred people watching it and they erupted into applause at the end.

The Adjustment Bureau has an intriguing premise that seemed only partially successful in execution,"Knowing this was adapted from a Philip K. Dick story, I knew that the premise of this movie was a little out there. Matt Damon plays a career politician who loses an election and accidentally encounters a pretty woman entering the men's room. She's played by Emily Blunt and we later find out she's a ballet dancer with ambitions of her own. Both seem smitten but there's these men in business suits and hats that are attempting to prevent this romance from blossoming. Why? Well, it seems there are some plans involved from up above...Quite entertaining what with the story, dialogue, acting, and an exciting chase though I did wonder if there really was a point to all the exposition that resulted.

Cinematically pretty but ultimately lame,"I read several reviews before I saw the Adjustment Bureau so I already knew that it would not please my scifi or fantasy needs. I had already heard that those elements were limited and that the story was basically about love. Well I consider myself a hopeless romantic so I thought I would at least be pleased with that aspect of the movie. Alas I was not. This movie is cinematically pretty, mostly well acted, a bit humorous at times, but ultimately very lame. Again as has been the case with so many movies the past several years, the writing is poor. We're still waiting for a story that will blow our socks off. And that doesn't just mean a thrilling story, it means an interesting story or an ordinary story told in an interesting way. This movie was so telegraphed that I just wanted them to get to the ending that I knew was coming so I could do home. Too bad once again.

"Controlling Fate: The Adjustment Bureau Blends Sci-Fi, Romance, and Action","If fate was a tangible force, how far would you go to control it? The Adjustment Bureau explores this question with an intriguing sci-fi thriller that's also a passionate romance. Matt Damon and Emily Blunt deliver powerful performances that give their love story a real emotional weight.What really stands out about The Adjustment Bureau is how well it blends so many different genres. It's got all the action and suspense of a classic sci-fi thriller, but it's also a genuinely moving love story. Even though the story is built around a kind of cosmic conspiracy, it's grounded in something very human and relatable - the desire to be with the person you love.The film also looks fantastic, with a vibrant and colorful visual style that really pops. The city of New York is an important part of the story, and the film makes great use of its iconic landmarks. The soundtrack is also excellent, with a mix of thrilling action cues and emotional character themes.Overall, The Adjustment Bureau is a unique and exciting film that's well worth your time.

To pay or not to pay,"Jan 11: I was invited to see and rate this movie at a free audience screening. While biting the hand that feeds you is incredibly bad form, this film is not worth paying a full price admission. DO see it on the big screen, but go to the matinée instead.Caveat, I'm not the target audience, (and hadn't read the short story source first) so for you to calibrate: I rated Jumper at 7; Avatar at 6 bumped up to an 8 for CGI; and Last Airbender at 3.This film has all the individual elements for a great time: The opening draws you into the story; Blunt is engaging and sensual; Stamp is villainous; Damon/Blunt have fabulous chemistry including a great meet; initial mystery, sophisticated humor, snappy repartee, wonderful score, and superb scenery. The supporting characters are well cast and acted. However, the thin plot doesn't sustain the whole movie, and it takes too long for the minimal plot to unfold, even though there are myriad chase scenes to divert you at first.The movie was seemingly created for chase scenes, with a poorly contrived reason for the ""boy meets girl, boy loses girl but continues to search for her storyline"", tossed in to justify all the chasing. In attempting to make everything mysterious, the audience is kept as ignorant as the characters to the point where it became ""THATS the reason he's been chasing after her? How DISAPPOINTING!"" when the cause for separation is unveiled. The secret meetings which presumably either advance or reveal the mystery were annoying instead. Finally, in the last portion of the movie, the opening doors and running become so repetitive, you can feel like the Blunt character, who has her hands over her head and is screaming. The ending is abrupt, contrived and disappointing, a veritable deus ex machina version.Conversely, my companion who loves everything sci-fi or sci-fantasy, and reads Phillip K Dick (including the short story on which this was based) rated the movie ""excellent"" as opposed to my ""ok"". Even though the movie diverges from the short story, he suffered no confusion or disappointment with the story line, big reveals, or ending. He also thought the cast, romance, and humor were great.We both agree--do see the movie on the big screen as it certainly enhances the suspense and startling moments (political crowd scene, adjustment scene, car crashes, action scenes and finale) and shows off the great NYC locations. He says go ahead and pay full price,the movie is worth it",,Anonymous,Romance
"Interesting Story, Though Not What I Expected","First I must say that the trailers make the movie look like something it is not. I'm not saying it was a terrible movie, though if you're going for an action packed, sci-fi thriller, this isn't probably it.The film starts off slowly, taking around 20 minutes to get into the interesting plot which the remainder of the film follows. There are some scenes which really suck you in, but they only last for short periods of time and after they finish the movie becomes dull again.The movie was too romantic for me, personally I feel the movie would have benefited without the love story entwined into the screenplay.As far as direction and acting goes I feel that it was pretty good, not Oscar worthy but not half terrible either.So still wondering if you should spend your money on this film? It entirely depends on your personal tastes. It's not really much like 'Inception' like the trailer says but it's still messing with the concept of different realities. If you expect non stop action don't see this film. But if you feel like a romance with a science fiction twist this film should satisfy you.I give this film 7/10 stars.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"A bit 'basic', but entertaining nevertheless.","'The Adjustment Bureau (2011)' is based on a story by Philip K. Dick and has a really interesting, philosophically dense premise with tons of potential. Though the movie doesn't quite fully capitalise on its stellar concept, it still manages to typically be an entertaining romantic thriller. The characters accept outlandish things a little too easily and are, generally speaking, incredibly forgiving and unreasonably trusting, to boot. The plotting is a little loose, including two jarring time jumps, and there's just this sense that the thing isn't really exploring its themes as deeply as it could be. Still, as I mentioned, it's an enjoyable affair overall. Technically, it's really well achieved; the solid direction, charismatic acting, subtle visual effects and heavy-handed yet successful music score all combine to give you the sense that you're in steady, self-assured hands. The flick is admittedly a little emotionally manipulative, though. Its ending is also quite bad, sort of going against its premise (or, at least, relating to it in an unbelievable way) and feeling as though it (quite literally) relies on a Deus ex machina in order to provide a happy ending. Despite its problems and, for lack of a better term, sort of 'basic' vibe, it's ultimately a solid, somewhat mind-bending romantic thriller. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
And now something completely different... (of Philip K. Dick),"We have here smart and smooth dialog, ontological arguments, great acting, sci-fi, clever editing, space-time dimensions and an inspiring love story. After watching the trailer, when I hear Philip K. Dick + George Nolfi (Bourne's Ultimatum, Ocean's 12, ¡Timeline!...), something disturbing came to my mind: a kind of Dark City-Paycheck hybrid... Nothing further from the truth.The adaptation of PKD's short stories for the screen has no newness, but do it in a completely new shape within a romantic-comedy-like film (preserving all the Chaos Theory/Free Will/Determinism leitmotiv of the text) is a show worth seeing.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Adjusted from the short story....,"Verryyyy different than the short story that it is ""based"" on! I was really looking forward to see a talking dog! Actually, I think it's kind of weird that the dog's part in the story is given to an African American actor. hmmm...Great chemistry between Damon and Blunt! They seemed almost natural and real in their conversations! And she's so dang pretty! I really enjoyed the acting of John Slattery and Terrence Stamp as well! This movie, for me, turned out to be more of a romance than a sci-fi flick, but it was still a decent view. I liked the hats and especially the doors, which were super cool. But I really liked Blunt with Damon and would love to see the two of them together in another film!",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

It may be your destiny to see this movie.,"(Synopsis) Congressman David Norris (Matt Damon) is a charismatic and highly motivated politician running for the U.S. Senate. He is on the brink of winning the Senate seat when he meets the beautiful ballet dancer Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt) in the hotel bathroom while preparing for his speech. David looks into the captivating eyes of Elise, and the two fall in love simultaneously. Once David realizes that he has fallen for Elise, he is contacted by some mysterious men wearing hats from The Adjustment Bureau who have orders to do anything in their power to keep them apart. They must do this because Elise is not part of his written plan and his destiny to be with her.(My Comments) This is a story that has a combination of elements that includes science fiction/fantasy/action/suspense with a spiritual and romantic side all thrown into one. The main point of the story is do we have free will or is it our fate to be who we are? The movie ask the question of what would you do if you had to choose between love or professional success? If it were our fate, we don't have a choice. The on-screen chemistry between Matt Damon and Emily Blunt was done so well that you may think this movie was a romance rather than a science fiction story. Matt's performance in his first love interest movie was done very well. Emily Blunt was mysterious and delightful with her snappy wit and sophisticated repartee. After the movie is over you begin to think about is our life predetermined for us, and maybe we don't have a choice about what path we should take. I know that you will be very suspicious of men who wear hats after seeing this movie. (Universal Pictures, Run Time 1:45, PG-13) (7/10)",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
More wasted potential when the concept was great but the treatment...,"Those who have seen the trailer will think that this is a cool, exciting action film about men who control the destinies of others and the man who says, ""I will not stand for this!"" but sadly that is not the story of the film. The concept is great and there are moments where I thought the film was going to get better because the story sounds interesting.I'll start with the good. As I have mentioned before the film sounds interesting and as these mysterious men enter the film, you are interested to see what they can do. Anthony Mackie and John Slattery were well cast and Matt Damon's performance while not perfect (because of the script) is good and keeps the film together.Apart from the above I can't think of anything else because the script is dull and the characters feel one-dimensional. Emily Blunt has little to do in the film and Terrence Stamp is completely misused. We hear how his character is cold and will do anything to get the job done but the film never shows this.What could have saved the film would have been some kind of emotional pull if we felt that the two leads were meant to be together because that would have kept the film interesting. Instead there is little reason to care what happens by the end.Themes including free will and pre-destination are mentioned and are interesting when they are brought up but the script doesn't do anything with it. Without spoiling anything, Matt Damon does make a discovery halfway through the film and it could have been a major plot point but the way film deals with it feels unnatural and out-of-character.The film also lacks a sense of energy but maybe that is due to my initial expectations as the film is completely miss-marketed as an action thriller. However the film could have played up the villains in the film (if you can call them that) because you learn what they have done and what they are capable of doing.In the hands of another director, this would have been an enjoyable film to watch. The idea is there but something went wrong along the way and this is the result. This isn't essential viewing but if you are interested, rent it.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Emily Blunt & Matt Damon fall in love and question their destiny in ""The Adjustment Bureau""","David Morris (Matt Damon) is running for office in New York. After a shocking photo is revealed to the press, David realizes that his dream of taking office as New York's next Governor isn't going to happen. While prepping for his last big speech to congratulate the winner of the election, he runs into a woman named Elise (Emily Blunt) who changes everything. Elise makes David feel something that he has never felt before and changes his whole outlook on life. This is when the Adjustment Bureau steps in to make sure that Elise and David never cross paths again. An interesting film about destiny ensues...I have been seeing advertisements for ""The Adjustment Bureau"" for what seems like over a year now. The film was originally slated to be released in 2010 but the film went through some re-edits including some alterations with the ending. Needless to say, I was really worried when it was pushed back for so long. Normally in Hollywood, when a movie gets its release date moved so much, its a bad sign. I am happy to report, however, that the film is actually pretty solid and lives up to it's solid marketing campaign.Emily Blunt and Matt Damon are the stars of the film and the two of them work great together. They have solid on-screen chemistry and seem like they really enjoyed working with one another. Damon's character David seemed like President Obama when he was running for office. Damon is skilled at playing characters like the one he played here. He plays the smart yet action packed role perfectly and has done so in several other films. Emily Blunt is great in the film as well. I enjoyed her humor and she has solid on screen presence. Her character is fun yet intelligent, which really made Elise such a likable character. She just felt real, like someone who you would meet in real life.The other supporting actors were terrific as well. There are so many smaller roles in this film that I probably won't name them all but will focus on a few of the main ones. Anthony Mackie who played agent Mitchel, played a really solid character. It was interesting seeing him go through the emotions and fighting the idea of whether or not he should help David. John Slattery and Terence Stamp who also played agents in the film did a good job trying to warn David about adjusting his future. These supporting stars all helped to build the suspense in the film.The best thing about ""The Adjustment Bureau"" is probably the story, which oddly enough is also it's biggest flaw. The idea of an organization that controls our faith and destiny is an interesting one. The film makes its audience wonder about the events that occur on a regular basis in ones life and asks the question was it part of a bigger plan or was it destiny? That idea alone is what makes this film interesting from start to finish. The audience is always trying to unravel the mystery behind what's going to happen next. We want to know how and why this organization is controlling the faith of David and Elise.With that being said, the movie's idea is great but the script leaves the audience wanting more. Its one of those movies where the idea is intriguing but requires its audience to shut off their thinking caps. I will begin explaining this with the simple fact that David is running for major office, yet he is never surrounded by body guards or security. That seems odd from the get go. Then this organization gets introduced and why they pick him isn't really flesh out. Then the idea of going through doors isn't really discussed with enough detail either. The ending, while I did enough it, left me wanting more. I just felt that the story's premise was a great one especially for a film but it just wasn't intelligently executed. The story was more for the non-thinkers and I guess for a Hollywood type film, I shouldn't knock it because at least it was a creative story.In closing, I ready did enjoy ""The Adjustment Bureau"" and thought it was a solid flick. The story will really grab the audience's attention and the performances by Blunt and Damon will have you at the edge of your seat and rooting for them at the same time. Some may argue that the end result was one that was too clichéd but I think in terms of the story here, it really made sense. I think even in life as much as we don't want to admit it, all we really want is companionship and the film really goes the distance to rely that message. Sure, it should have spent a little less time with that message and more about the bureau itself and I will not try to deny that. This film could have been a masterpiece if the storyline was better explained. I realize most people don't like thinking when they see a movie but I think nowadays with film's like ""Inception"" making big bucks, I think a few movies a year that challenge its audience really would be great. ""The Adjustment Bureau"" had the potential of being that type of film but instead it took the turn off your brain route instead. At the end of the day, it was a good flick with some flaws but I really did enjoy it from start to finish even though I had to turn off my brain to do so!MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""The Adjustment Bureau"" was a 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Because I was entertained and that weighed more for me than any of the weak points the movie had.Still even President Obama had a stab at the movie (after he heard that Matt Damon was disappointed in his presidential efforts, Obama stated in one of his speeches, that he could say the same about Damon, mentioning the Adjustment Bureau).

"Finally, a GOOD sci-fi movie, with everything else mixed in","Sci-fi and fantasy is my favorite genre, because they can do so many more things with them. It's definitely not the same old, same old.

Adaptation From the Imagination of Philip K. Dick,"A short story by Philip K Dick titled ""Adjustment Team"" (1954) was freely adapted here by Bourne screenwriter George Nolfi who turned it into a glitzy futurist conspiracy thriller. The movie is entertaining and savvy but I found it hard to get past the scene where the two leads enjoy a flirty moment when Blunt plonks Damon's phone into his coffee leaving him smitten as a kitten. Maybe it's me, but if a someone did that to me on a bus in the morning I'm taking them straight to the nearest Apple Store to buy me a new phone. Suffice it to say it's a fun film not to be taken seriously.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Plans can change,"We know that plans can change but the key question in first-time director George Nolfi's thriller, The Adjustment Bureau, is whether or not ""The Plan"" can change. Very loosely based on a short story by Philip K. Dick (J.D. Salinger would say ""I told you so""), The Adjustment Bureau is a highly entertaining film, filled with an intriguing story line, enough action to keep us awake and focused, and a storybook romance in which the lovers actually have good chemistry together. On a philosophical level, however, calling it murky gives it more credit than it deserves.The premise of the film is that there is a ""Plan"", that nothing happens by chance, and that free will is a comfortable illusion. According to Nolfi, our destiny is not guided by a loving universe but enforced by a cadre of cold ""enforcers"" who advise us to stay on the right path without question or our severed heads will be impaled on a spike on London Bridge for the tourists to take pictures of. These enforcers have been with us throughout human history except for the times when they took a vacation just to stand back and observe us stumblebums get ourselves into mischief like wars, depressions, and going to Justin Bieber concerts.As the film opens, Matt Damon is David Norris, a candidate for the United States Senate from New York and a young man who looks as if he has unlimited promise for future leadership roles. His campaign is attracting large crowds, though he never seems to talk about any issues. Riding high in the polls, his campaign goes off the tracks when the New York Post splashes a sensational story across the front page about a prank that he committed many years ago and his chances taste like the proverbial toast. On the night of his concession speech, however, Norris bumps into Elise Sellas (Emily Blount), an attractive young woman hiding from security in the men's room after she crashed a wedding. It is almost contrivance at first sight, until she is chased out of the building by security without giving Norris her phone number.The chance (or so we think) meeting empowers David to make an honest concession speech which immediately makes him the front runner for the next Senate race, by which time it is assumed his reckless behavior in the past will have been forgotten (unless he decides to moon someone on the subway). Later, he meets Elise on the bus going to work who tells him that she is a professional dancer and gives him her phone number. Their relationship seems to be heading in the right direction until four mysterious spooks enter the picture and gum up the works. Their identity is never revealed, except that they are sort of mid-level enforcers for someone called The Chairman, a kind of a big shot sky captain who insists that ""they do it my way"", even with no Sammy Davis, Jr. in the picture.Unlike the gentle angels in Wim Wenders' Wings of Desire, these guys are no fun to be around. One of the members is Richardson (John Slattery), a straight-laced, humorless kind of guy that you might find at a Tea Party rally. Another is Harry (Anthony Mackie) who was supposed to have prevented David form meeting Elise for the second time but bungled the job and later even becomes sympathetic to his charge, a no-no for these goofballs. When the spooks capture David, rather than treating him to a vegan dinner, they lead him into a cavernous ballroom to let him know in no uncertain terms that their Plan Book says that he and Elise should not be together and that he must stop seeing her immediately.As if that is not enough, they tell him that if their existence is revealed to anyone, even inadvertently, his brain will be ""reset"" which is enforcer-ese for Instant Oatmeal, presumably unflavored. The four guys have one motto and that is ""keep your hat on"". Apparently their hats allow them to enter through one door and come out another door far away such as Yankee Stadium, The Statue of Liberty, or the subway during rush hour. Later someone tells David to ""assume everyone with a hat on is a threat, no matter if it's a beanie, a turban, or a yarmulke."" Hopefully, they won't be put into magic ghetto's. The enforcers carry iPad-looking devices which they use to change someone's fate in real time, entering into someone's mind to screw it up or at least prevent them from finding a taxi (doesn't take a magician to do that in New York).Though we never meet the big cheese, we are privy to the company of Thompson, a ""senior adviser"" who looks and acts like the others, same great taste, fewer calories. Unable to find Elise because the guys burned her telephone number, poor David rides the same bus every day for three years hoping to see Elise again, though you'd think that after a while he might get the idea that she no longer rides this bus. Despite the important snowfall alert that both of their dreams of future glory will turn to mush if they insist on being together, David thinks that true love conquers all, and who knows, he might be right. After all, strong intention can overcome the most powerful force in the universe - yourself.May the force be with you!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Interesting premise sacrificed to silly clichéd love story,"I saw this at a preview screening. The premise of mysterious strangers controlling our destiny comes from the eccentric imagination of Phillip K. Dick; everything else in the movie is cookie cutter Hollywood fluff. None of the characters are remotely believable either in their everyday lives or in the nonchalant reactions to learning mind bending secrets about themselves and human destiny. What could have been an entertaining and creepy paranoid fantasy instead becomes a by the numbers sermon on the power of ""true love"" (which seems to refer to the infatuation you experience after spending a few hours engaging in cute banter and rolling in the hay with a virtual stranger). Has a number of unintentional laughs, not the least of which involves a character recounting a skewed history of the human race that ignores everything outside of Western Europe and America. Beyond all the silliness and the immaturity of the script, however, what really surprised me was how lazy it all felt. The performances were lackluster, the tense scenes were boring, the love story was passionless, the fantasy elements pedestrian. Towards the end I thought we might be at least being heading toward something really outrageous, but even that turned out to be a false hope.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Yes the romance is nice but the idea is lost and presented with such blandness that it is hard to care,"This film offers an interesting idea regarding an unworldly force that nudges and directs the path all of our lives take, it could have done a lot with it but what it decides to do is make a romantic film within this plot. Now there is nothing wrong with that in and of itself but someone should really have a word with the marketing department who decided that a concept-thriller would be easier to sell, since that is very much the film they set their campaign around – not this one. Anyway, cheap marketing aside, I came to this film on DVD with the trailers a long distance memory and average word of mouth having lowered my expectations somewhat.The film starts with some spark and drive to it as we are introduced to the characters and have the curtains pulled back to reveal what is really going on and the power that ""they"" have. At this point I was interested but as the film progressed this was slowly worn out of me. Some will say this is because I am not a romantic; while that may well be true I did actually like the romance between David and Elise, it was well played and the two had that sort of spark that was required to make me believe in them after so little time, so my problem with the film isn't that the central motivator for the events is this potential love between them. No, my problem with the film is with what it does with the idea itself – which is practically nothing.The film has very little pace and generally it drags itself along with the audience always looking over their shoulder to see where the film is – we're already 2 steps ahead and it would be lovely if the film at very least kept up with us. It doesn't though, it plays its spiritual card very early on and it never presents a real danger or threat to be overcome – the men in hats never come off as controlling or a threat or even anything close, at worst they come off as stuffy old kill-joys and in this way they make a poor ""opposition"" for our protagonist. I'm not suggesting I needed this to be an action movie, but the lack of any sort of sense of threat or urgency really hurts the film because this ""idea"" is the majority of the film, not the romance – so to mess up the basis for your film is not going to go well.It is a credit to the on screen presence and charm of both Damon and Blunt that the romance side of the film works well, they both held my attention and kept me interested even when the rest of the film was so very light and surprisingly bland. Mackie, Slattery and Stamp deserved better – all three of them seemed to be phoning it in without anything really going on in their performances, only the odd flutter of urgency gave them good moments but otherwise they are let down. And they are let down by writer/director Nolfi; this guy has been the writer on a couple of big money-makers but he has done himself no favours with this effort – he loses the idea and gets tied up with the romance, forgetting that the idea is the story, not the romance. He lets his cast down and he lets the audience down – it still all looks expensive and professionally done, but this is for little comfort when the story-telling is so fluffed.The Adjustment Bureau may well be built on a good idea (I will find and read Adjustment Team) but it does very little with it. The romance at the core is engaging but the idea is lost and is handled badly. There is little of interest, threat or pace about it; it isn't a terrible film by any means, it is just so average and lacking in edge that I really found it hard to care – and the fact that I was often ahead of it in regards narrative really didn't help either.",,Anonymous,Romance
Philip K. Dick strikes again,"Watching this one for the first time in 2024. I guess I was too busy in 2012 making plans for the Mayan apocalypse or something and somehow this one got by me. I guess it was fate that I found it this year.I got hooked into the story right away, and the subtle mix of modern New York and 40's noir made such a compelling atmosphere. Matt Damon was perfect, Emily Blunt did a wonderful job, and the ""agents"" were perfect too. This film pretty much hits every nail on the head, I'm thinking now was there anything that could have been better and... nope.The story moved along at perfect clip, it seemed like it was both fast paced and a scenic stroll at the same time. Exciting, yet comfortable. How? I don't know how, why you askin me for?So at the end I didn't really watch the credits like I usually do because I wanted to pop over here and review this gem.

Chairman is another of His names,"The Adjustment Bureau starts like an election year movie. As we are in 2012 this may be the right time for such films, but it quickly quits that path to go into a direction that I personally find even more interesting and attractive that the life and career of a politician who may be ruined because of intrigues or just because he will follow his own personal instincts and chose love even at the risk of his career. We get these all in the film but also much more, as we can expect from a film based on a short story by Philip K. Dick.The world, we learn pretty soon is not completely run according to hazard. Actually there is a plan, a well organized plan and a quite big bureaucratic system with a well-established hierarchy which makes sure everything happens according to the plan and in extreme situations takes measures to adjust the disturbances. One of these happens to our heroes – the candidate senator played by Matt Damon meets accidentally and falls for the beautiful and talented ballerina played by Emily Blunt and they do not forget and search each other despite being separated for years and insist on getting together despite the plans of the great institution that was targeting the hero to become a future president, but a bachelor one for some reasons. In the antic tragedy the name of the institution was Destiny, Christianity and other religions call Him God, in this film his name is Chaiman, and his clerks have all very handy tablets which can be of help to a lot of things including shortcuts by secret backdoors in traffic-jammed Manhattan (sure, I want one, Apple, please!).One does not feel at all that this is a first long feature film for director George Nolfi. However at some point I regretted this not being his second or third film – he has talent in telling a story, skills in directing the actors, if he only had dared going deeper in the direction of the dilemma and confrontation between fate and good will – we would have maybe received an even better movie. But even so The Adjustment Bureay is smart and sensible and better than the average.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The magnificent comeback,"The fiction was really fabulous. It has an engrossing plot. In fact, it described the needed message about the fate. Not fair to change the mind of the people by dispelling that intention. They are supposed to determine the fate themselves, not with the hindrances of others. You cannot lead the fate of the people as it was planned secretly. They must always decide what to do in the future. If someone is happy with loved one, it is the most proper option to perpetuate the remainder of the life for him.
Matt Damon and Emily Blunt became lovely couple in this movie. The mixture of the science-fiction and romance. It sparsely seems in the genres. It has a dreary ambience. One of the most remarkable movies of Matt Damon after Bourne. Especially, action sequences of Adjustment Bureau completely evoke Bourne Series.

Needs more adjustment,"(2011) The Adjustment Bureau
SCIENCE- FICTION THRILLERAdapted from the short story ""Adjustment Team"" by Phillip K Dick despite the Idea similar to a Twilight Zone episode involving a young man, David Norris (Matt Damon) running for senator and all seems normal until he comes across a young lady, Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt) whose not supposed to meet for a second time, intervened by some strange people called 'the adjustments' who're supposed to dictate how life peoples lives are supposed to be. More like a thriller without any excitement or suspense and unemotionally slow at times which has a similar tone to ""Moon"" but the ending does a have a superficial resolution which should've been a better payoff.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Nutshell Review: The Adjustment Bureau,"Matt Damon stars as the charismatic congressman David Norris, who's on his way to senatorship if not for some last minute press expose that tanks his campaign. While crafting out a speech in a hotel bathroom, he meets the dancer Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt) and the two fall in love almost instantaneously. However, larger forces are at hand to ensure that the plan for the entire world gets to move according to what they designed, and this love story is clearly to be avoided at all costs. So begin that bewildering cat and mouse game with The Adjustment Bureau operatives adamant in stopping David Norris through all their limited (yes, limited, according to rules that will be explained) abilities of short range telekinesis of sorts, and teleportation powers through the opening of seemingly random doors to portals elsewhere.The science fiction concept here is interesting. There's always a book showing, in indecipherable terms, how events happening now can open up endless possibilities of how things will shape, and showing the one path that unravels in real time, together with alert points and pitfalls that should be avoided, failing which a ripple effect greater than can be contained will be caused. There's also some deus ex machina moments which allowed for the introduction of Terence Stamp's character as a higher order Mr Fix It, nicknamed The Hammer for sledging his way through difficult and sticky situations, brought in to try and provide enticing reasons for David to give up the chase, when fellow underlings Harry Mitchell (Anthony Mackie) and Richardson (John Slattery) have failed. Then there are those hidden portals which open up to probably anywhere in the world, done to perfection through seamless special effects and editing to slice everything together in one fell swoop.But the more thought provoking issues will be that of free will and destiny, whether everything unravels according to a set path pre-determined by someone else, that what seem to be choices turn out to be no more than what's already laid out and planned for, giving the simple illusion that one has that level of freedom to choose. Discussions in the film crank up the appeal factor, and of course introduces us to this particular sandbox of reality that all the characters have to live with and abide by. For the romantic then, if you're told to give up someone whom you've just met and who could be that soulmate you're looking for, at what price sacrifice comes the question, whether one would be willing to fight, even if it may seem futile, for that chance that you may just beat the system with odds tremendously stacked up against.That's when The Adjustment Bureau perhaps required a little adjusting itself. The system isn't perfect, and so neither is the film, since its technology isn't as robust, easy to deploy or efficient such as the flashing penlights of the Men in Black. Being the blue-eyed boy of The Bureau's plan also helped since there are much larger plans for both David and his lady love Elise, and seriously it's quite the hard sell trying to give up all the potential and plans laid out in front of you, where you see the seed starting to grow even, for something quite intangible as love. But a romance this is, so that's the path the film undertook, only for this fight against a higher order not too well fleshed out.I felt that George Nolfi pulled his punches, having set up so much anticipation when David and Elise will try their best to deviate from their destiny, only for one major running sequence - not even the chase we were quite promised and outlined - which underwhelmed, and I suspect could be left as deleted scenes for the DVD. It's like setting the boxing ring for that extended slug, only for a first round knock out to spoil the party and appreciation for the finale, too bright I think, but that's personal as I prefer my science fiction to be rather bleak, so that's a little bias for you readers out there to note since I felt it could have been a more open film rather than a verbatim one, contrary to its theme against the laying things all out for everyone.Damon shines with plenty of likability factors put into his politician (which is rare considering the profession of choice!) and seriously this is one candidate I would root for and support as he struggles to find some meaning into the mess he's in. The romance between his character and Emily Blunt was believable as they engage in the type of banter couples do, and situations that will call for heartbreak after heartbreak, with the powers that be standing in their way employing tactics that is what I call emotionally cunning - that is - if you want eternal happiness for someone living her dream, don't get in her way and bog her down in a relationship. Hmm.Still, the production values are gorgeous, and art direction involving the internals of the Bureau were interesting to gawk at, and deserves a second look, as these men with fedoras move around the world tinkering with small, micro level events that have repercussions at the macro level, going along with the whims of a higher being. There is enough scope here to equate the Bureau with how things are governed here even, with issues kicked up to the higher levels of bureaucracy to solve if it exceeds one's bandwidth, or horrors, pay grade! You don't question, but you conform and comply, and for the mavericks who prove their worth through sacrifice and steely determination, hopefully could one day overcome and emerge winners in some form.

A Tale of Two Halves,"This isn't necessarily a bad film, but it does indeed suffer from a lack of directorial discipline. The first half of the film, though riddled with fanatical implausibilities, is thoroughly entertaining and intelligently engaging. Nevertheless, this promising first hour is all but squandered in a second half plagued by silly expedients and laughable plot twists. In my opinion, the entire second half of the film felt rushed. For example, the acting, which had hitherto in the film enhanced the believability of narrative action, fell off entirely. The last fifteen (or so) minutes of the film are directed with such a sense of slipshod nonchalance that one can't help but feel like they're watching an entirely different film. The saving grace for the film is, in my opinion, the star power of Matt Damon coupled with a captivating first hour.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
An Imperfect Plan,"We make choices every day, and these choices can lead us down any number of paths. It's a plot device that's been used so many times, in so many different ways, that I don't think I even need to describe it any further. In the new sci-fi thriller ""The Adjustment Bureau"", starring Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, and Anthony Mackie, though, a twist is added.Based on a short story by sci-fi literary giant Philip K. Dick, Damon discovers one day that his choices in life are being made for him. A group of shadowy agents are working behind the scenes, literally, changing the course of humanity in subtle but profound ways. In Damon's case, they want to make him a success in life, specifically in politics; and they've been working a long time to make him a success. But Damon himself is thwarting their efforts, unknowingly at first, but soon deliberately.It seems, to the Adjustment Bureau and its unseen Chairman, that humanity is not ready to choose its own destiny, protect its own future (or, indeed, its own survival). It's not made clear in the movie just how much influence they have over humanity, but in Damon's case, it is enormous. When he discovers their efforts, he has no idea what to make of it; but when they try to separate him from the woman he loves, played by Emily Blunt, he's determined not to let them succeed.The movie has been described as a cross between ""Inception"" and the Jason Bourne series; unfortunately, it isn't much of either. Its action sequences are not that exciting, despite several chase scenes through New York City, and frankly, neither is the chemistry between Damon and Blunt. At various points, the agents of the Bureau attempt to reason with Damon, giving him hints of the great plans in store for both him and Blunt which would require they never end up together. It's a potentially compelling conundrum, trading two people's happiness and love with each other for the chance to do great, important works in the future; but Damon can't quite convincingly portray the internal conflict.As for the underlying question of whether any of us can choose anything for ourselves, the focus on Damon and what he will choose completely ignores all the characters, on screen or otherwise, who didn't even know their choices were taken from them. Thus, any ray of hope the movie offers us is a cynical one, at best. The mysterious Chairman's ""plan"" for humanity, as is constantly hinted, is neither infallible nor complete, and may even be subject to change with no warning. You could leave the theater wondering why they bother to change anything at all.It's an interesting movie, to be sure, and the premise, as I said, is a timeless one: can we choose for ourselves, whether we know the possible outcomes or not? Frankly, the movie doesn't even fully address that question. It waivers too long between trying to be a psychological thriller or an action movie that it ends up being neither.(Originally appeared at http://fourthdayuniverse.com/reports/2011/03/an-imperfect-plan/ )",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Advanced Screening,"Just got back from an advanced screening here in Virginia and all I can say right now is, wow. It took it a little bit to start off, but when it did, it hit. Hard. Like, getting ran over by a truck or thrown up a flight of stairs only to fall back down them..after getting hit by a truck. This is great quality and trumps anything I have seen lately. The performances were stellar and, well, I could actually put up with Damon. Granted, I do wish Terence Stamp was in it a bit more, but he serves his purpose. John Slattery and his misfortune brought my crowd a bunch of laughs. All in all, I plan on seeing this again as soon as I get the opportunity.If and when you get the chance to see it, I highly recommend you do.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Kinda dumb, kinda clever, good progression, sloppy ending","When life gets a little off course, the guys from the Adjustment Bureau step in to get it back on track, as they have been doing with humanity since the cradle of civilization. Sometimes it's luck, sometimes it's them, but you'll never know. The Adjustment Bureau is one of those movies which treats science fiction like a business; Explanation comes before imagination, and it has to map out its own set of rules. Call it a realist fantasy if you will, like Stranger than Fiction.The film is enjoyable in the moment but it's never a whole lot more enriching than than. The product feels kind of half baked, only somewhat romantic, only somewhat clever, only somewhat thrilling. Sometimes it actually come close to being funny in a self reflexive way.For a movie that is largely about fate vs. chance, I have no doubt that the film makers would have thought it ironic to use such an ending as the one we get, but it is ironic in the wrong way. The last ten minutes form an insulting deus ex machina/ cheap shot, the kind that makes you want to wonder if the film was rushed in the making. Indeed, the Adjustment Bureau ends up feeling way shorter than it should be. It's a nifty movie to be sure, and arguably a nice movie, but it needs adjustment.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Some intriguing ideas, not fully explored","This feature certainly feels like it was based on a short story.The original idea comes from the legendary pen of sci-fi author Philip K Dick. That idea is essentially that the world is shaped and directed by a group of what I would call ""God's bureaucrats"", who intervene with human affairs in a darkly comic, cloak and dagger 50s spy film kind of way.We explore the idea of free will and divine intervention through the experience of one man, played by Matt Damon, as he struggles to choose his own fate, even as it clashes with The Plan of ""The Chairman"". (Yes folks, Frank Sinatra is running things upstairs. But I digress..)The beautiful Emily Blunt brings charm and emotional depth to the love story, so much so that I can almost forgive its predominance over the broader sci-fi elements. She can have all the screen time she wants.But there's not enough juice here for sci-fi heads - the mind bending ideas are not fully explored, and we're left with more questions than answers. The Bureau remains a mysterious place, reminiscent of Get Smart's CONTROL. It's an entertaining ride, and a love story with a light philosophical bent, but it's not a Philip K Dick sci-fi.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Loved it....,"My husband and I just watched the movie this evening and we both loved it. We had dinner after the movie, then an hour drive home and it was the topic of conversation throughout dinner and our drive home. Matt Damon and Emily Blunt showed real chemistry between them. This was Matt Damon's first romantic role and he was really good. His crooked smile gives him charm. Although I can see why some religious groups may have some issues with the movie as it gives a unique twist to the subject of angels and God (although it never says God - refers to ""the Chairman""). But it does give you a lot to think about and to talk about.

An interesting adaptation of the Philip K. Dick short story...,"Based on a short story called 'The Adjustment Team' by Philip K. Dick, the ideas behind this film intrigued me from the moment I first heard about it. Imagine a world where your fates are determined for you and if you stray from your prescribed path, an adjustment is made to put you back on it. The 'people' responsible for making the adjustments are, of course, 'The Adjustment Bureau'. Now you know that, I can write a brief summary (summary haters and those that don't wish to know anything about the plot please try on some stylish hats while I write the next paragraph).David Norris is a young ambitious politician; he is running for the Senate, representing New York, when his campaign is de-railed by a scandal from his past. Resigned to defeat, he retires to the men's washroom to practice his speech. There he meets dancer Elise Sellas who he instantly falls in love with. She gives him the confidence to give a brilliant speech that galvanises the public enough to call for him to stand for election at a later date but that's in the future. He is so enamoured with Elise that, when he meets her again the very next day, he asks for her number, which she gives him. Now, the path that has been prescribed for David Norris does not include a relationship with Elise Sellas. In steps the Adjustment Bureau in the guise of a group of agents led by a character known as Richardson. They do all they can to keep the couple apart and even reveal themselves to David in an effort to make him see sense. Unfortunately for them, he is determined to be with her and eventually the case is sent up to the next level and Thompson takes charge. He gives David a choice, either continue on this path and ruin both of their lives, or take the path prescribed for him. It's a tough decision, but David has an ally in Harry Mitchell, who has been following him for a long time. And it's here I'll leave my summary don't want to give too much away.This is a very well made film with some great special effects, but it is the story that drives the action and not the other way around. It is very much a love story, but a love story with a rather cunning twist and one that I very much enjoyed. All of the leading cast are excellent; Matt Damon as David Norris, Emily Blunt as Elise Sellas, John Slattery as Richardson, Michael Kelly as Charlie Traynor, Anthony Mackie as Harry Mitchell and Terence Stamp as Thompson.I love the premise of this film and, although I enjoyed it very much, I felt there was a little too much focus on the love story and not enough on the bureau. Maybe it's just me, but I never really felt there was enough chemistry between the two lovers to warrant the effort put in by the David Norris character. In the end though, it's a perfectly watchable entertaining film, without being particularly mind-bending or spectacular. Better than average and recommended.My score: 7.2/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A good film, with more potential","I really enjoyed this film. It is easy to understand, however, in some places the plot dwells on the love story between Damon and Blunt, when I would rather more see suspense and thrilling action. However, the chemistry between Damon and Blunt was very good! I think the plot had more potential (especially at the end), and it is not as complex as Inception, and the plot does not have as much of a build up, which may disappoint some people. Also, half way trough the film the element of mystery is somewhat gone up until the very end, but overall, this is an interesting film.If you like: Matrix, Inception and other mind-benders, you'll like this!Rating: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Damon and Blunt's chemistry on screen is pure magic!,"'THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A man challenges fate itself and it's protectors in this adaptation of the Philip K. Dick short story 'Adjustment Team'. Matt Damon stars as politician David Norris and Emily Blunt co-stars as ballerina dancer Elise Sellas, the two must fight for their love when the enforcers of fate try to keep them apart (for reasons not fully explained). First time director George Nolfi wrote and directed the film (he also wrote and co-wrote the screenplays to two other Matt Damon films: 'OCEAN'S TWELVE' and 'THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM'). The movie is a fantasy / romance / thriller and it doesn't do a very good job of mixing the genres thoroughly but it does play out with a lot of enjoyment all the same.As the movie opens David Norris is a popular and very promising political figure on the verge of winning a U.S. Senate seat when he blows his lead through a highly publicized and very unpopular reunion party prank. This is when 'The Adjustment Bureau', as they call themselves, is first brought into action to clean things up. They work for a higher power (presumably God) and are what some people call angels (although they act a lot like bureaucrats). They have special powers, can teleport through magical doors and alter (as well as erase) people's minds. It's their job to make sure their boss's plan (they call him 'the Chairman') is executed. Their skills are further put to the test when Norris, by chance, continues to run into the woman of his dreams, Elise, who he's not supposed to be with. When he, by chance again, witnesses the men in action he is told of their duties and that he can never reveal them to anyone or suffer the consequence of being lobotomized. They also tell Norris he can not see the girl. Norris following his heart, passion and love of course decides to ignore their commands.The movie is as silly as it sounds and completely over the top (which is odd for a Matt Damon film) but it had a lot of potential to be something really great. The acting by Damon and Blunt is outstanding and their chemistry on screen is pure magic (one of the best cinematic relationships I've seen depicted on screen in a while). That's why I really wanted to like the movie and after a botched and cheesy scene here and another there I kept hoping it would redeem itself. The writing is a little weak and the directing is amateurish (although there are several scenes that work, all involving Damon and Blunt). The whole movie it felt like their was a great movie waiting to break free but it couldn't. Even so it's worth seeing if for nothing else than to see Damon and Blunt in action together. As a romance and a film about the power of love it definitely works.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIAZ2104LOU",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
imdb isn't happy unless their brain is a scrambled egg.,"This is really great movie, especially when you consider the short story it's based on. as a screenwriter myself, i know how hard it is to take a short story concept and make a feature film and the filmmakers did a great job. I'm kind of appalled at some of the criticisms of this movie. someone called it a romantic comedy. i didn't laugh once. i don't know what you think is so funny. romantic drama, maybe, but it's really a sci fi film with a romantic element. imdb just isn't happy until a movie is 'inception' and you have to watch it 30 times to understand what just happened. someone made a comment about the writer of the short story and i looked up his writing. He really is one of the most influential writers of the last half century and a brilliant writer. i think his genius is underestimated. anyway, this is a really enjoyable film that i was glad i could watch once, maybe twice only, to understand. I find it's not enjoyable to watch a movie you don't understand but hey maybe that's just me. Matt Damon is a great actor but we know this already. Emily Blunt also does a great job as his ultimately confused love interest. Their chemistry is really what holds the movie together. you're really rooting for them and feel bad when things don't go well. I wouldn't call this movie AMAZING, but the negative reviews make me wanna offset them. story 8/10, plus chemistry add 1 point plus everyone else's negativity=10. definitely recommend.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

More successful in the romantic department than the sci-fi,"On the night of a failed senatorial bid by David Norris (Matt Damon), he meets the mischievous and beautiful Elise (Emily Blunt) in a bathroom whilst rehearsing his losing speech. They instantly share a connection before kissing, and Norris leaves her feeling inspired, and makes a landmark speech that will put him into pole position for the next election. The two happen to meet again on a bus, and again the spark is re-ignited. Yet Norris is being tracked by mysterious men in hats who seem to be controlling fate and keeping everything in line with 'the plan' of the big man upstairs, and the couple being together seems to go against this plan. Determined not to lose who he thinks is his true love, Norris defies the suited men, and finds himself watched and chased at every turn.Adapted from a short story by Philip K. Dick, The Adjustment Bureau is a pretty solid idea that is confidently played out, but seems thinly spread out over the course of a feature-length running time. The idea that our fate is being tampered with to keep things 'on course', and that our fate is out of our own hands is something that was done much better in 1999's The Matrix. This film, however, focuses less on the sci-fi aspects and more on the idea of 'true love', as Damon's David Norris is convinced that if something feels so comfortable and right, then it simply must be how things should be. John Slattery and Terence Stamp's suited agents are compelled to feel otherwise, although they don't know why.If the romantic angle seems all a bit soppy, it's actually more convincingly done than the science fiction. Damon, although not the greatest actor in the world, is certainly likable as always, but it is Emily Blunt that comes out of the film most impressively. Her sweetness and laid-back quirks combined with her natural beauty makes for a love interest worth caring for, and you can understand the lengths that David goes to be with her. The magic hats, doors leading to anywhere, time freezing and fate maps are certainly quite interesting, but are so casually executed that often just seem silly, although these shady characters are played well by The Hurt Locker's Anthony Mackie, the ever-reliable Terence Stamp, and John Slattery, who I'm a big fan of from TV's Mad Men.After 90 minutes of romance and the odd foot chase, I was expecting a thrilling climax that would perhaps throw in the odd surprise or two as well. But what I experienced was a half-arsed effort that rarely got the pulse racing, and a final scene that could be easily described as cop- out. It almost rendered everything I had seen prior to it pointless. However, this is still an enjoyable film with likable performances all round, and an intriguing idea at its heart, but very far from the best Dick adaptation.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Two worlds,"We live in two worlds with usually hidden doors between. One world is unexpectedly complex, powerful and cosmic in an apparently demented way. The second world we have to put up with. It is a world of rote mechanics and faux imagination.That first world is the world of Phil Dick, something I value and experienced relatively firsthand. The man was a genius. With Agatha Christie, he has had more influence on contemporary, imaginative fiction than any other.One of his minor but still excellent short stories is the inspiration for this.The other world is the world of bad filmmakers. Formulas where artists follow a rulebook and we as viewers respond as we are programmed to. Participants in art that dulls rather than sharpens, that puts us more in the groove than out of it.I recently rewatched Damon in Hereafter. He was something of a miracle there and though simple, the film took us places and he helped.This. This is scrap paper. The reshot bland ending is particularly egregious.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",,Anonymous,Romance
Good story but lacking chemistry,"The adjustment bureau has a pretty interesting story based on familiar science fiction themes however the main plot revolves around a couple who are supposed to be madly in love with each other but this isn't reflected on screen. Matt Damon and Emily Blunt play the lovers and the lack of chemistry between them is awkward and uncomfortable. I never felt they even liked each other let alone being crazy in love. In fact, it seemed to me Emily Blunt's character actively disliked Matt Damon's character in many scenes. Since this love story was very unconvincing and is the main focus of the movie as the story develops it takes away from the fairly intriguing story of Matt Damon accidentally stumbling into a hidden world of a Matrix-like dimension.Terence Stamp plays a powerful chief enforcer type character and I thought he was excellent in this role. By far he had the most interesting character in the movie. Another problem is there are too many celebrity cameos in the film. Well known news people like James Carville and CNN's Wolf Blitzer, Mayor Bloomberg, all these appearances are brief but still make the movie feel artificial. I'm trying to watch a movie not CNN political news.The story is a good one, if a little unoriginal and too familiar of other more successful movies in the past such as The Matrix. This movie is worth seeing but the two actors at the center kind of let down the story line.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""Most people live life on the path we set for them, too afraid to explore any other.""","FILM: 9.5
Yeah, I really like it. There, I said it. The Adjustment Bureau, released 13 years ago, certainly didn't get high critical praise, but it's become a staple in my movie rotation, boasting a solid eleven rewatches. It's that rare gem with the perfect blend of sci-fi concepts, thrilling elements, and a romance that doesn't induce eye rolls.Romance in movies usually makes me want to vomit due to being overly saccharine in nature, but not here. The chemistry among the cast is fantastic. Matt Damon and Emily Blunt play off each other flawlessly, and the supporting trio of Anthony Mackie, John Slattery, and Terence Stamp (though underutilised) are equally impressive. In fact, it's my favourite performance from Mackie and Kelly. Hats off to writer and director George Nolfi, who extracts enjoyable performances from the entire cast.Adapting Philip K. Dick's short story, the screenplay delves deep into themes of free will and predestination on a far grander scale. This exploration adds a layer of intellectual satisfaction, making the film more than just a sci-fi thriller.Thomas Newman's excellent score contributes to the film's full-bodied experience, and the soundtrack injects an energetic vibe. He's one of my favourite film composers, and the music complements the narrative beautifully, enhancing emotional beats and intensifying the suspense.In the grand tapestry of The Adjustment Bureau, the only downside is the criminal underutilisation of Terence Stamp. Despite this minor setback, the film remains a stellar piece of cinematic artistry. There's no doubt that my opinion is not shared by many, but it's a testament to how great storytelling, engaging characters, and a dash of sci-fi can create a movie that stands the test of time and remains a joy to revisit.FORMAT: Blu-rayVIDEO: 9.0

deeply intriguing and enthralling,"Can we plan our destiny, or is our destiny predetermined by forces outside our will? This is the main point of this science-fiction thriller, where the romance between David and Elise captured me so much as to make my attention concentrate more on the extremely attractive couple Damon-Blunt than on that central issue. Their chemistry works out effectively, never seen such a lovable Damon before, with such a charming smile, Emily Blunt proves mysterious and attractive as usual, so when they lips first meet, something explosive is ignited. The central issue is of course not original, but interesting in the intriguing and breathtaking way it is represented, without moving too far to any conclusion. Certainly free will is eagerly supported, certainly the movie sides with the need to dare and not to be afraid to follow what you think important for your life, against all more or less reasonable obstacles, even against your destiny, mainly when the love of your life is involved. The story proceeds with a quick, intriguing pace, the science-fiction and the romance, the supernatural and the realistic blend perfectly, on the stage of a wonderful and an ever-enchanting New York, keeping the viewer always captivated and entertained, and making the movie really enjoyable from the beginning till the end.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

No real spice of substance,"I had mix feeling after watching this and at times during it. Bascally it a love story mixed with sci fi. You could easily perceive this film as cheesy and ridiculous. The whole concept of angles dressed in 1940s noir wondering the streets of new york with dairy books in glued to their hands can be considered to be Far fetched.The love element is fine. Matt Damon and Emily Blunt make a fine couple and the romance between them isn't mushy. The film runs at a steady pace with only the ending seeming rush. These angles who duty it to make sure that everyone stays on the right path in life, spend most of their time running after Matt Damon and failing to keep him a way from Blunt.The Ending was a let down. Of course it all worked out for the couple but a more negative ending would of been more suited and brought a uniqueness to the film. Instead we get the most predictable ending Hollwodd could of made up.Overall, Adjustment Bureau is a entertaining film with fine acting.

A cool concept produces a boring story,"So what all can be said about The Adjustment Bureau? Honestly, not that much. This film wants to offer a lot, but overall it is just glaringly... average. It opens excitingly with the introduction of Matt Damon's character, David Norris, who is running for New York Senator. He is projected to be the winning candidate due to his immense popularity amongst the young voters. He has a sure victory lined up for him until a story about his rowdy college days surface. This article causes him to lose the race. While preparing to give his losing speech he meets a girl named Elise, played by Emily Blunt, in the restroom. After a brief romantic moment with her she leaves. David doesn't see her again for months until one day he happens to meet her on a bus. This time Elise gives David her number before he leaves. He goes into his office, only to discover that all of his coworkers are frozen in time and they are being ""adjusted"" by mysterious men in suits and hats. He learns that these men are adjusters and they control what humans call fate. After filling him in on their operations, the adjusters let David go and he then goes on a persistent quest to find Elise, the woman he is madly in love with but was never supposed to meet more than once.The best adjective to describe this movie would sadly be... boring. It starts well and ends decently depending on how you look at it. But the majority of the movie is just plain dull. Not much happens throughout the middle of this film and all the story lines are drawn out too much. The characters are likable, but not terribly interesting. For the most part this film lacks any kind of interest or excitement until the climax which definitely will draw you back in.The concept of this film is very neat and I enjoyed all of the subtle sci-fi aspects of the film. There's nothing glaringly sci-fi about it. The adjusters all look like normal people and they don't use any kind of exotic looking technology to do their work. They aren't dressed up in some bizarre alien garb and instead they wear suits and hats. The most sci-fi thing they do is travel between various points far away from each other through doors around the city. The unfortunate thing is, the actual plot that comes out of this intriguing concept is a pretty basic and lackluster romance story. The concept of this film can be related back to films like Dark City (1998) or The Matrix (1999). Those films tell vastly more interesting stories than the dull romance The Adjustment Bureau presents. I can't say that anything about the plot itself was horribly constructed or poorly done, it just wasn't that interesting. There are too many possibilities to go along with this concept to choose the one in this film.About two thirds of the way into this film Terence Stamp's character Thompson is introduced. This is when the movie really starts to kick off again. Some important things are revealed along with Thompson's arrival and that made the film start to become a lot better. After Thompson is introduced the film rises and falls a few more times before it ends with a climax that is done very well for what it's worth. By that I mean it gets about as interesting as such a dull movie can get. It has an odd ending, but I think it worked for the most part. It wasn't terribly memorable (I say this because I'm having trouble remembering exactly how it ended right now) but it's about what you'd expect.The Adjustment Bureau isn't a terrible film by any means. It's not great either. The filmmakers could have done so much more with this, but they refrained, and the result was a very boring film. This is not something I would ever watch again and in fact I don't think it is something I'll remember ever seeing in about a week. This is just one of those films that had a lot of potential but fell short and ended up being something that isn't painful to watch, but it isn't an exciting watch either.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"The plan, the plan","Matt Damon falls in love and interferes with ""The Plan"" in this 2011 film also starring Emily Blunt, Terrence Stamp, and John Slattery.Damon plays David Norris, a congressman running for Senate who at the last minute loses due to a college prank that is highly publicized.

They talk, and she encourages him to be who he is and to be honest. There's an instant attraction, and they kiss.

David runs but the men catch him. It is then that he learns that these men are his case workers. Everyone has them, to make sure that they adhere to the plan. The plan has been devised by The Chairman (Terrence Stamp). The case workers tweak little things in order to guide David - not his personality, not his emotions, but with the purpose of keeping him on track so that he can achieve his purpose. The head case worker, Richardson (John Slattery) tells David that according to the plan, David was never supposed to run into Elise again, and they move to make sure he doesn't connect with her a third time. But David can't forget her.This is an interesting premise, building on the idea that everything, even spilling your coffee, happens for a reason; that, in fact, we are all guided by angels, which some people call the caseworkers, to make sure that we achieve the life and goals set by The Chairman.The science fiction premise is mixed with romance here, with both Blunt and Damon giving warm, charming performances. I was left feeling, though, that as sweet as the film was, it could have been better. Nevertheless, it's nice to see an original idea on the screen, and I applaud it.Intriguing.

Honestly felt relationship inside pure absurd fantasy...good stuff,"The Adjustment Bureau (2011)A fun and funny and farcical romp about fate and love. The Bureau is a layer of men— quasi angels—who watch over mere humans and guide their futures. The center of attention is Congressman David Norris (Matt Damon) who encounters a blip in the system. And helping him along (or not) is a young woman he meets twice by accident, Elise (Emily Blunt).The rules are not very clear here, even though they get explained a couple of times. The Bureau men (and they are only men) seem to have unlimited powers at times (moving the floor to trip a running Norris) and other times are helplessly running to try to catch up with him. Then they reappear far ahead. There is a trick about going through doors (rather like ""Monsters Inc."") but sometimes there are no doors and the men pop up here and there.So you can't take this seriously and logically at all. Just go with the flow. Like the stricture that this huge god-plan, mapped in little notebooks, goes all to hell if two people fall in love. Or more accurately, kiss like mad. Remember that trick when the world is against you.The movie works and will make you wonder and laugh and feel good despite its internal flaws. The main reason (for me) is the truly natural on screen chemistry and rapport of the two leads. It's as if they are hitting it off as we watch, really smiling and delivering clever comebacks with great timing. It's worth watching for Damon and Blunt above all.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Love and Free Will and Destiny,"Philip K. Dick ((December 16, 1928 - March 2, 1982) grows more popular as a writer in contemporary culture than he was during his lifetime. He typically focused on the fragile nature of what is ""real"" and the construction of personal identity. His stories often become surreal fantasies as the main characters slowly discover that their everyday world is actually an illusion constructed by powerful external entities, vast political conspiracies, or simply from the vicissitudes of an unreliable narrator. All of his work starts with the basic assumption that there cannot be one, single, objective reality. Everything is a matter of perception. The ground is liable to shift under your feet. A protagonist may find himself living out another person's dream, or he may enter a drug-induced state that actually makes better sense than the real world, or he may cross into a different universe completely.' Given this background information about the origin of the idea of THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU, the story adapted for the screen from Dick's 'Adjustment Team' by writer/director George Nolfi (The Bourne series, Ocean's twelve, etc), offers a new appreciation for this well-timed suspense thriller love story - 'Love' being the operative word.David Norris (Matt Damon) is running for New York Senator guided by the counsel of his friend and campaign manager Charlie (Michael Kelly) and they seem to be on a wining track. David meets the very beautiful dancer Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt) in the strangest of circumstances and their attraction, peppered with very fine comic repartee, is immediately apparently. Past faux pas of David's appear in the media and his chances of winning the election seem to be diminishing. At this point David meets some hatted gentlemen - Richardson (John Slattery) and Harry Mitchell (Anthony Mackie) - who represent the adjustment bureau, a group of men who follow the life plan set by the Chairman to keep people in line with their intended destinies. David is instructed to never see Elise again as she is not part of his planned life (a career that despite setbacks is supposed to eventually lead to the Presidency of the US). From this point on it becomes a challenge for David to either obey the adjustment team or follow his heart and be with Emily. After a separation of three years David sees Elise again and the fire of love burns even more brightly. David is warned that if he follows his heart (his free will) he not only will not become the man of his career dreams but that he will also destroy Elise's assigned future of becoming the world's most honored dancer/choreographer. Which drives succeed and how they happen is a wild chase by David and Elise to run toward their own free will through mazes and secret passages and strange situations a s devised by Richardson, aided by Harry, and controlled by Richardson's replacement, Thompson (Terrance Stamp). It is a struggle between destiny and free will.There is a fine line in Philip K. Dick's story ideas that teeters between the credible and the pure sci-fi direction. In this film the midline is found and the reason the strange story succeeds so well is due in great part to the extraordinary on-screen chemistry between Matt Damon and Emily Blunt, two actors who continue to grow in stature, having that ability to pull off sophisticated comedy with action packed suspense. The entire cast is excellent and seems to be responsive to the well-conceived direction of George Nolfi. THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU is first and foremost a love story, and a very fine one at that. In order to completely appreciate this film the audience must relax and go along with Dick's ideas - then it all seems very right!Grady Harp",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Love story wrapped in a science fiction shell,"When the upcoming young politician David Norris (Matt Demon) is about to lose his biggest election he unexpectedly meets with a young ballerina named Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt). They both realize that something ticked between them that very moment but for some reason they get separated. Again meeting her coincidently on the bus starts to change David's life dramatically. Yet he fails to keep in touch with her. And soon David realized that there is a strange force working behind all this and that force is not letting him to get to know Elise. And when David and Elise starts to fight this force in the name of love things get a little out of hand.The Adjustment Bureau is a love story wrapped in a science fiction shell. And it unique but makes little sense at the start. But when the story rolls on, the viewer has to decide many things by themselves and following the lead roles to find out their fate in all this.The movie provides ample space to wonder about for theories. Some may call them religious and some may call it fate or even just pure sci fi phenomenon. Whatever it is there is a wonderful vibe to it from the beginning to the end.Performances by the lead roles are quite heartwarming. For Matt this looks like a fresh role which he executes well. And for Emily she just floors the audience with her sharp features and breathtaking dance moves. Some of the dance sequences are just bliss to witness. There is a strong message in the movie. About human emotions and feelings and the choices we make, and how it all shapes our future knowing or otherwise.More of my review at flickshout.tk",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Can I watch it again?,"This movie has it all. It has a perfect blend of unfamiliar and popular (Matt Damon) faces. Every actor is perfectly suited for their part and it was over the top writing. The Adjustment Bureau is like a book that you cannot put down. It gets ten stars because at this moment I just watched it and want to tell everyone to watch it right now. The chemistry between the main characters is on top with all of the modern classics that we think of. I believe that this movie will be considered one of the greats. This movie truly hits the ball out of the park. It has emotion, excitement, and intrigue and will keep you on the edge of your seat.

IMDb ratings reflect the colossal stupidity of the average movie goer,"You take a big budget - A list actors, a top sci-fi writer, a big-time city location etc... and what do you end up with? One of the stupidest movies EVER made. I had no idea what I was getting into when I sat down to watch this. I was under the assumption that this would be a movie about how sinister, evil organizations are secretly running our world (reality basically) and how a young do-gooder politician learns the truth and tries to fight against it... if only... Instead you get a lobotomized story about Men with Hats (not the safety dance ones either)that are agents of god who are working tirelessly (and falling asleep at the job) to rectify all the horrible mistakes that mankind continues to inflict upon the world. The Roman Empire - the agents set that one up... (because we all know how good that empire was... ;). The middle Ages? Well that was a big mess according to the ""agents"" so they brought us the enlightenment, reason, romanticism, the wonderful industrial revolution (in which children slavishly worked 16 hour days for the benefit of the wealthy). But then ""they"" let us take control again and we ended up with 2 world wars, Hitler, the great depression etc... Really? Well, I'll tell you I would barf out laughing if some fool in a fedora told me such pile of feces.. but Matt Damon's character buys it hook, line and sinker... So we get a movie that tries to tell us that everything is running according to a plan and that, if by some chance that plan gets disrupted... Well it involves a whole lot of fedora wearing men running around cities through doors... Oh yes... and how can I forget - the love story. Well take one cliché and add two parts cliché and a cherry cliché to top it off and you get that. So what do we learn? That handsome young politicians don't get married and wait for years riding the same bus every single day in order to run across the girl that shared a ""moment"" with him... Yeah... I buy that. Oh... but God doesn't want these two together (cue the fedoras!) so he sends his agents to disrupt any chance at love these two might have.... And that's your movie folks...

Ridiculous story line, things made up just to explain away the poor story line but the explanations even worse than the story line, actors just phoning their performances in, people bing chased for 10 minutes just to pad the movie time out and even worse it seemed to have some insidious religious angle shoe-horned in.I had a bet with a friend that this had 4 tops on the IMDb and I could laugh with my fellow humans at how rubbish this movie is.

originally themed story,"The story tells about the conflict between free will and predestination and raises these questions in a science-fiction thriller with a surprising romance. Everything gets intriguing, since the plot develops into a cat-and-mouse game of the mind, where Emily Blunt and Matt Demon fall in love when trying to elude the ""controllers"". The actors give the impression of being in control of the situation that has also elements of a black comedy and the director knows all the buttons to push as to make an intriguing plot. ""The Adjustment Bureau"" is a smart film which might have been simply great if it had been a bit more daring but the entertainment is certainly heartwarming and suggestive.

Lovely Movie :),"Do we control our destiny, or do unseen forces manipulate us? Matt Damon stars in the thriller The Adjustment Bureau as a man who glimpses the future Fate has planned for him and realizes he wants something else. To get it, he must pursue the only woman he's ever loved across, under and through the streets of modern-day New York. On the brink of winning a seat in the U.S. Senate, ambitious politician David Norris (Damon) meets beautiful contemporary ballet dancer Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt)--a woman like none he's ever known. But just as he realizes he's falling for her, mysterious men conspire to keep the two apart. David learns he is up against the agents of Fate itself--the men of The Adjustment Bureau--who will do everything in their considerable power to prevent David and Elise from being together. In the face of overwhelming odds, he must either let her go and accept a predetermined path...or risk everything to defy Fate and be with her. The Adjustment Bureau is written for the screen and directed by George Nolfi (writer of Ocean's Twelve, co-writer of The Bourne Ultimatum). It is based on a short story by Philip K. Dick (""Total Recall,"" ""Minority Report"" and ""Blade Runner"").This is a very lovely movie must watch for all people !",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Adjustment Bureau: A Thought-Provoking Sci-Fi Romance,"The Adjustment Bureau, directed by George Nolfi and based on a short story by Philip K. Dick, is a captivating blend of science fiction, romance, and thriller genres. Starring Matt Damon and Emily Blunt, the film explores themes of fate, free will, and love, all wrapped in an engaging and visually compelling narrative.Plot and Setting:
The movie centers on David Norris (Matt Damon), a charismatic politician who encounters the enigmatic and free-spirited dancer Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt). Their chance meeting ignites a deep connection, but their budding romance is quickly disrupted by mysterious men in hats, who belong to the Adjustment Bureau. This organization secretly controls the course of human events to ensure that everyone stays on a preordained path. As David learns more about the Bureau's powers, he must decide whether to accept his predetermined fate or fight for his love with Elise, even if it means defying forces beyond his understanding.Performances:
Matt Damon and Emily Blunt deliver stellar performances, showcasing their chemistry and emotional depth. Damon excels as the determined and passionate David, while Blunt brings a mix of charm, wit, and vulnerability to Elise. Their on-screen connection is believable and compelling, driving the film's emotional core. Supporting actors, including Anthony Mackie, John Slattery, and Terence Stamp, provide solid performances that add depth to the enigmatic workings of the Adjustment Bureau.Direction and Writing:
George Nolfi's direction is sharp and effective, balancing the film's various elements with skill. The screenplay, also by Nolfi, cleverly adapts Philip K. Dick's short story, expanding on its concepts while maintaining a tight and engaging narrative. The dialogue is crisp and thought-provoking, often raising questions about destiny and autonomy without becoming overly preachy or didactic.Cinematography and Music:
The film's cinematography, by John Toll, is visually striking, making excellent use of New York City's urban landscape to create a sense of both wonder and claustrophobia. The scenes where the Bureau's agents manipulate reality are particularly well-executed, adding a surreal and disorienting feel that enhances the story's tension. Thomas Newman's score is evocative and complements the film's emotional beats, enhancing both the romance and the suspense.Themes and Impact:
The Adjustment Bureau delves into profound themes such as the tension between fate and free will, the power of love to defy destiny, and the individual's struggle against societal control. These themes are explored through the lens of a romantic thriller, making the film both intellectually stimulating and emotionally resonant. The narrative encourages viewers to ponder the extent to which their lives are governed by external forces and the potential to alter their paths through personal choice and determination.Conclusion:
The Adjustment Bureau is a thought-provoking and engaging film that successfully combines elements of science fiction, romance, and thriller genres. With strong performances from its lead actors, particularly Damon and Blunt, and a compelling narrative that explores deep philosophical questions, the movie offers both entertainment and a reflective experience. While it may not provide all the answers, it leaves audiences contemplating the nature of their own lives and the forces that shape them. For those looking for a film that is both intellectually and emotionally satisfying, The Adjustment Bureau is a must-watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Better than Inception,"It was inevitable that there would be comparisons with The Adjustment Bureau and last year's big hit Inception. Both are about changing time , perception and fate but there is one big difference between both of the films and that is that The Adjustment Bureau is better .This film is not complicated at all , despite being far fetched and at no time do you think "" What the hell is going on here"" as i did with Inception. Sure , it does not have the fantastic special affects but to be honest , affects are not good when the plot is a mess.Matt Damon plays a politician who meets a beautiful woman and it's love at first sight. The problem is the Bureau can't let it progress because it's not part of the plan.I really enjoyed Matt Damon's performance as well as Emily Blunt's and Anthony Mackie's . It's the kind of film that does not patronise the audience with a plot that needs several viewing to understand it and it's not too long either.Well worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
You may just want to choose this one,"David's political(his stance is vague, if it does lean towards the progressive) career is on the fast-track. Then he meets Elise. It seems like a perfect match... then again, it goes against the plan. Whose? The Adjustment Bureau's. They make sure things happen as they should. Their exact nature is kept vague, if the religious allusion(""are you angels?"") is clear(and acceptable, as well as inoffensive... and I am not someone who believes in a higher power). This never takes itself too seriously, as even the work of these ominous men in black is treated to a bit of self-irony. The humor tends to work, and feels as natural as our two leads. Are they ""perfect""? No. They're real, they're charming and we want to see them together. This is ""love at first sight""(and it is the focus(if it is also a science fiction movie)... still, you really get into these people and feel for them, and that's speaking as a guy who isn't that big on romantic pictures), and that does hurt the overall product... in essence, the ""Hollywood"" of this brings it down a tad. However, it does make you think(and Norris' decisions do change, he does consider the alternative) and ponder philosophy, questioning the idea of fate, the choices made, the concept of free will. I have not read the short by Philip K. Dick(I'm getting to it, I love the guy... R.I.P.), so I can make no comparisons. Every character is credible, and no one is black and white. We feel for the ""bad guys""! One of them has a guilty conscience, and the others are also as human as their physical appearance. The acting is great for all concerned. Stamp has gravitas(note that he's only in about half of this), Blunt is cute without being boring, and Damon... well, I'd say that having him ""guest"" on The Daily Show a couple of times in this has us forgetting that he's not appearing as himself, then again, he's kind of like that for the rest of it. He's rather likable, and you find yourself wanting to grab a cold one with him. The climax is fun and this does have fast-paced chase scenes, but it is not an action flick, albeit it was advertised as such. There are hardly any FX, no fights and nothing gratuitous. The dialog is good. While this concept is more or less a spelling out of the defiant ""I will do and get what I want"" cliché typical to Western films, the exploration isn't bad. The conclusion bears marks of having been hastily redone, though it doesn't go where I feared it would. Nolfi does well in his directorial debut, and penning the script worked out well, too. There is brief strong language, some sexuality and a violent image in this. I recommend this to anyone who finds the idea of this intriguing, and goes into it with realistic expectations. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Potentially good movie saved by excellent acting.,"There's a saying: keep it simple. That applies to movies too, especially Hollywood movies. This movie violates that principle, hence the movie stalls. The theme is great. How much free-will do people have? Are the directions of our lives shaped by forces beyond our control? These are deep questions and when Hollywood attempts to answer them, the results could be messy. It's challenging enough to put together a coherent story but when nebulous elements that not fully explained are added to a story, then one of the worst things that can confront the audience occurs: trying to figure out what the movie is about. Matt Damon is as usual excellent as are the rest of the cast, especially John Slattery and Terence Stamp, and their performances save this movie from crossing the line into clunker land, but even their presence cannot undo the damage caused by the story itself. Keep the story simple; entertain the audience.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Film that Goes Beyond Shallow Entertainment,"This was a movie that I watched without any preconceived notions about it. I thought at first that it was a political film as Congressman David Norris (Matt Damon) was on his campaign to be the youngest Senator of New York. Then I thought it was a romantic film when Norris meets a charming mysterious girl in a men's restroom (Emily Blunt), and gets hit with love at first sight. However, the script makes another turn and introduces us to the agents of the Adjustment Bureau, whose job is to make sure the lives of each person goes according to the Chairman's plans. Whoa, there is a supernatural dimension to this movie, as well!I felt the movie was very interesting. You will get into the flow of the story and be very entertained. A big part of its connection with the audience are the very appealing performances of both Matt Damon and Emily Blunt as the star-crossed lovers, David and Elise. Their chemistry was charming and electric! Despite how the story was going, you will want to root for the two of them. I must admit you will have an inkling how everything would end up, but still you will want to follow the story up to the very end to see how it goes. The special effects of the case books and the opening doors add to the thrill of watching.At the end of the movie though, you will be thinking about your own life, religion and fate. The ""Chairman"" is a none-too-subtle reference to God. There is God's will and Man's will. The movie suggests that man can get around God's will when he intently wants to make it happen. As Catholics, we believe we should leave our life all up to God's will. ""Your will be done, not mine."" Therefore, when personal religious beliefs come in, a film like this can go beyond shallow entertainment. I enjoyed watching ""The Adjustment Bureau"" as a suspenseful love story, although I may not necessarily subscribe to its inherent philosophical premise.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

I Just Felt My Brain-Cells Move . . .,"and for that I am grateful. So many movies are just plain stupid that when I get a chance to see a sci-fi/fantasy with moral underpinnings, engaging performers, and enough actual thought to allow me to forgive the flabby third reel, I say thank you, Hollywood.Even nasty, perverse, and unpatriotic Hollyweird gets it right occasionally.What I liked about The Adjustment Bureau is that its characters were interesting. I found myself rooting for the good guys and wishing the baddies to just go away. I realized that Matt Damon is really good at what he does, that the chemistry between his character and that of Emily Blunt worked (in a movie sort of way), and that the adjusters were nothing more than practitioners of a Skinnerian form of tough love.More than anything else, this was a fun movie to watch; to allow myself to suspend disbelief and let the flick envelop me was refreshing. When I was through watching it on the SyFy channel, I was glad I put up with the fragmentation grenade of advertisements.Sure, The Adjustment Bureau won't be hailed as a landmark film 20 years from now, but it will, hopefully, sit on a display shelf for future viewers to sample.I found it worth both my time and my investment of emotion and intellect (all seven brain cells), not something I can often say.",,Anonymous,Romance

The romantic angle somehow overshadowed the Sci-fi part, which was downplayed.But then again maybe if it was not it would have been a very different movie with a different ending. The climax was great but then again it led to a dopey ending.

In the Hollywood version, it has some trite metaphysics to distract from the banality of the romance. The script and the sight gags display enough wit to further mask the fact that this is ultimately a very unsatisfying ""toying"" with the mind.

The Chairman's Door,"Greetings again from the darkness. Philip K Dick was one of the more prolific sci-fi writers and his works include Blade Runner, Minority Report and Total Recall. He also wrote The Adjustment Team, the short story upon which this film is based. The premise is fascinating: the ""bureau"" is a team who influence/adjust the timing of events so as to lead mankind toward a predetermined future.Matt Damon plays David Norris, the rising young star in New York politics ... that is until a college prank is revealed and scandal ensues. On election night, prior to his concession speech, he meets Elise (Emily Blunt), the girl of his dreams in the men's room. I was struck with just how few times a man meets his dream woman in the men's restroom. Their charming banter and immediate connection lead Norris to make a heartfelt speech that thrusts him right back into the hearts of the voters.When David and Elise meet by chance on a bus, a mysterious force begins to reveal itself. David is exposed to The Adjustment Bureau and told to stay away from Elise, lest he ruin both his dreams and hers. Of course, this isn't really a sci-fi thriller in the traditional sense. It's much more a love story ... a love story for two people who seem pre-destined to be together. And that's the conflict.The story is really a debate between fate and free will. Does destiny lead us down the path or do we make our own way? The Chairman of the Bureau is clearly a reference to a God-like power, but his ""angels"" have powers limited to shortcut door portals, slight adjustments to thinking patterns, and looking good in hats.While writer/director George Nolfi creates a pretty interesting to look at cityscape and an usually smart romantic film, it actually falls a bit short on overall effectiveness when it devotes so much running time to the explanation of how the bureau works. I would have much preferred more debate and examples of how adjustments affect free will and maintain the path to destiny. Instead we get a crash course on the inner-workings of this odd team. That said, there aren't very many better faces and voices than that of Terence Stamp, who plays The Hammer for the bureau. He is a fixer who uses less than forthright tactics in his moments of influencing David.I am probably being a bit harsh on this one considering that it is quite a bit more clever than the average studio release, but I can't help but believe it was capable of so much more.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Another example of why science fiction and romance rarely mix,"Forgive me if this sounds hopelessly derivative: a rising politician named David Norris (Matt Damon) meets up with a ballerina named Elise (Emily Blunt) by chance on the night of a major election. They part ways, but David cannot seem to get her out of his head. By chance they meet again, and David remains smitten with this mysterious woman. When he enters his office, he finds an odd group of individuals who call themselves the titular Adjustment Bureau. Apparently they are a group who ensure people act according to a plan that is predetermined for them. And a relationship between David and Elise is not part of the plan.Going into The Adjustment Bureau, I only knew of the short story by revered sci-fi icon Philip K. Dick. But going by the track record of successes, failures and cult classics based on his work, I assumed this film would at the very least be worth a look just because of the legacy of films his writings have created. Sadly, going by the plot synopsis I described above, I am certain you can guess which category this film falls into fairly quickly.When The Adjustment Bureau is focusing on the concept of people's lives being pre-determined and how free choice adds to the mix, it delivers in near remarkable fashion. Seeing how the ""Adjustment Team"", who are referred to mainly by their last names, works and how omnipresent they are in people's lives is downright thought-provoking on the same level as Blade Runner, Total Recall and Minority Report, and just as intriguing. This is the kind of material science fiction has always worked best on, and some of the things that happen are just as fun and unique as you can imagine. I would have loved to learn more about the notebooks these team members read like gospel, and would have greatly enjoyed significantly more emphasis on these elements.What also impressed me was the lack of obvious special effects used throughout the film. There are a few scenes which looked blatantly enhanced by CGI, but the majority looks practical in nature. This can be chalked up to the fact that the film is not one that needs to be drenched in effects (unlike so many other science fiction pieces), but the simplicity and nuances of opening doors to other places and the use of real sets was something I felt worthy enough to be mentioned on its own. If only more films could follow the production examples set by this one, we would have more natural looking big-budget films.Sadly, it is the romance that wins and drowns out almost every instance of science fiction-esque explanation (minus the initial reason for why the Bureau exists in the first place). It seems like writer/director George Nolfi was merely intrigued by Dick's story, and decided to build an against-all-odds romance around it. But it feels stale in comparison to the ideas surrounding it, almost like an afterthought. The familiar and clichéd romantic beats are all here, but Nolfi never takes them anywhere exceptional – they merely stay grounded in the ordinary of whatever freakish form of reality the film takes place in. There is more than enough room for development in some scenes, and others could have become instantly more exciting if there really was something more to it.I would be a little less harsh on the romance, except it leads to one of the most ridiculously uninventive endings of the last decade. The film takes on its own liberties in the quest between David and Elise for ultimate happiness and free will, and forsakes and ruins anything intriguing and worthwhile within the plot (namely the explanations on how the Bureau acts and reacts to situations). The film's release was delayed and I think the final act may have been what was tinkered with the most in the ensuing wait. It feels choppy, weak and just not all there, like there was something more to it, something that helped make all of the romance easier to swallow by the time the credits roll.But sadly, as one moment passes into the next, each more outrageous and near farcical than the next, the horrible ending unfolds. I want to say it is the kind of movie that would benefit from ending ten-twenty minutes sooner, but even that would not help make it any less preposterous than it quickly becomes. There is a scene stuffed in here between Damon and one of the ""adjusters"" played by Anthony Mackie, where Mackie looks delirious and incredibly baffled by the words he is saying to Damon. I am fairly certain I had the same look on my face trying to comprehend the inane and downright silly turn the story takes at that exact same moment.Much like he always does, Damon delivers the best performance he can with what he is given. He is never one to back down from a challenge, and he makes David a compelling character at all times. You really do feel for him, even when so much is going wrong around him. Blunt has the unfortunate task of being the beautiful background character, one that gets very little to do outside of eliciting a reaction from Damon. She looks great while doing it, but does not offer all that much here. Mackie is great when the film wants to use him, and Terrence Stamp is so deadly serious that he feels like he belongs somewhere else. But did they really need to completely undercut and make John Slattery be so useless?The Adjustment Bureau is greatly enjoyable in parts, but is never able to maintain the right focus. It is worth a look, just to see what it easily could have become, before squandering it away on melodramatic romance.6/10.(This review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Pretty good except for the Idiot Plot problem,"""The Adjustment Bureau"" is nothing new, so its success depends on how well it's done. The butterfly-effect genre, of which this film is an example, is based on a concept in chaos theory that relates the sensitivity of outcomes and recurrences to initial conditions. There are of course 3 movies with that name, but the genre predates the development of chaos theory; it goes all the way back to It's A Wonderful Life. Other examples include Sliding Doors, the TV show Sliders, possibly The Asphalt Jungle, and countless time-travel pieces including Timecrimes and Back to the Future. Ray Bradbury's classic short story A Sound of Thunder, based on (literally) the butterfly effect, was made into a film in which the original story is almost unrecognizable. The Adjustment Bureau conflates this with the conspiracy-theory hidden-forces-at-work nobody-really-knows-what's-going-on genre, which was the explicit motif of Men in Black and is also a theme (major or minor) of The X-Files, Rubicon, Area 51 and Roswell and most UFO stuff, the Alien films, Fringe, The Prisoner, Independence Day and on and on.The Adjustment Bureau has the advantages of a big budget and major actors. It's set in New York City rather than Toronto doubling for Chicago/Boston/Seattle, etc. (although I don't know, these days you can do practically anything with CGI). The supporting actors are competent, especially John Slattery as Richardson. Matt Damon is almost but not quite convincing as Brooklyn-born New York politician David Norris, and Emily Blunt is captivating and irresistible as aspiring ballerina Elise Sellas. Blunt is 13 years younger than Damon, but there's a lot of that in movies and on TV, and their chemistry is undeniable. David runs for the U.S. Senate and at the moment of his defeat, he encounters Elise. He accidentally witnesses the activities of The Adjustment Bureau, which is a shadowy organization of seemingly superhuman operatives run by The Chairman (you're supposed to infer that The Chairman is God). He learns that there is a Plan that includes literally everyone and everything, that he and everyone else have their assigned roles in the Plan, and that sorry, according to the Plan, he and Elise are not meant to be together. If he doesn't like that, well, it's just too bad. If one's free will conflicts with the Plan, the Plan wins. Oh, and if he tells anyone, he'll be ""reset,"" meaning brain-wiped. The rest of the film is about his attempts to find Elise and to keep the Bureau from separating them again, all the while working on his political comeback. The story is generally well told, although the narrative is a bit jerky and uneven in places.However, The Adjustment Bureau, for all its great qualities, suffers from a fatal Idiot-Plot flaw: If you were David, and a woman just sort of materializes and Kismet whacks you across the face like a 2x4, wouldn't you ask her name? And then later on, when you meet her on a bus and she tells you her name, what kind of idiot NYC resident wouldn't ask her for her last name? And what kind of idiot woman wouldn't give it? Yes, I have lived in big cities all my life and I know about women who are reluctant to give out their last names to people they've just met, but good grief, she gave him her phone number. You watch this film and you scream, either mentally or out loud, ""For heaven's sake, ask her her last name!"" and ""For heaven's sake, tell him your last name!"" but to no avail. Also, the deus ex machina ending (literally, not figuratively) is a bit too neat.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Time travelling with a twist...,"Matt Damon's new movie outing is a science fiction romance telling the tale of a young charismatic and slightly unorthodox congressman David Norris (Damon) who is running for the United States Senate. During his campaign he meets Elise (Blunt) a beautiful contemporary dancer who bestows great honesty and wisdom upon him in the men's toilets (it's where all the pearls of wisdom are discovered) before their obvious attraction boils over, resulting in them locking lips with each other....how romantic. Thank goodness their tryst is interrupted by Norris' best friend and campaign manager and it seems without a name they are destined never to meet again. Later, however Norris is on his way to his new job working with his best friend Charlie the campaign manager he happens to sit next to the delightful Elise again and the attraction is still very much apparent. But alas this meeting was not destined to take place, a lone suited man in the park was to spill coffee on Mr Norris ensuring that he would need to return home and change his shirt thus meaning he would not see Elise again. Soon after arriving at his new employers he bears witness to an unexplained event, strangely dressed men in Charlie's office seem to be performing odd things to his uncharacteristically still friend and when he is seen he is chased and promptly caught. He awakens in another realm (masquerading as a warehouse) and discovers that the real world, his world is influenced and manipulated by the shadowy figures in the background. Life's a stage and they are the stage managers, prop guys and theatre directors. Norris is introduced to the Adjustment Bureau a group of celestial like beings who guided by the Chairman (you never see him....hint hint) help keep the human race from descending into anarchy and chaos. What ensues is a battle of wills of epic proportions as Norris fights to be with the woman he loves even if fate seems to have another design for him. This is an intriguing notion for a movie and you won't be surprised to learn (actually you might be) that the original was penned by the master of future visionary Phillip K Dick the writer of the original story behind 'Blade Runner'. This adaptation is clever as it infers that there are forces at work that ultimately determine what we do and were our lives will lead us and free will has nothing to do with it. Ironically Norris complains to Elise about having his life controlled, from everything he says, to the clothes and shoes he wears which is itself some measure of control. It is when she inspires him, during their first encounter, to be honest and true that he is set on a new path. However a path is already pre-ordained for him, but his love and no doubt rebellious temperament will not allow him to conform and he fights to stay with Elise despite the predictions of impending disaster from the Bureau members if he chooses to stay with her. This is a clever and well thought out script from the writer of the 'The Bourne Ultimatum' and it is directed with confidence and conviction. The leads exude an effervescent chemistry which draws you in and makes you care for their predicament. The members of the bureau are excellent with Anthony Mackie ('The Hurt Locker') performing his role with a quiet but awesome wisdom beyond his years. It was genius for George Nolfi to construct the story around a politician who rebels from one level of control only to be subjected to another. The religious undertones are ambiguous but at the same time clear. Are the Adjustment Bureau agents in fact angels and the Chairman in fact God...that fact is deliberately left unclear and it is for you to decide this conundrum for yourself. Life is not entirely in your hands, there are just too many variables, surely there has to be some supreme being controlling your life from behind the curtain doesn't there?? You either embrace that undeniable fact or try your damnedest to change your destiny....will love conquer all??? Check out this mesmerising romantic thriller and judge for yourself.

Cute enough little movie.,"Can't really call this movie an impressive or spectacular one in any way but it sure remains a good and enough movie, if you know what to expect from it.It's not a movie that is being mostly about its thriller or science-fiction aspects but more one that leans more toward its romance. You could be fooled perhaps and expect a totally different movie from watching the trailer and other advertisements by the movie but really, this is what the movie mostly evolves around. You could even say that the movie is being more concerned about coming across realistic, rather than simply trying to be tense or mysterious. And yes, that is sort of the downfall and disappointing aspect about this movie.Of course nothing wrong with movie taking a romantic approach but in this case that approach probably wasn't the best or most interesting and effective one to pick. So here we have a concept of a so called 'adjustment bureau', who are there to ensure that everything keeps going according to the 'big plan', by controlling and if needed, interfering with people's faiths. There are plenty of directions you could take with such a subject but all this movie its main premise is Matt Damon and Emily Blunt falling in love with each other, while this was never supposed to happen according the adjustment bureau's book (and literally, they have a book with the people's planned out future in it) and they do everything (well, not really but that's a whole other problem I'll soon get to) to set things right and try to prevent them from ever seeing each other again. Sounds romantic, that despite all things the two of them wanting to be together but it just doesn't make the movie always a very interesting or exciting watch.I'll admit, I still was really into the movie at first but the whole premise starts to get a bit tiresome after a while, especially since there really isn't that much happening in this movie action-wise, or any other stuff that tries to prevent from these two failing in love with each other. It's because of the concept of the movie, that is heavily flawed. Really, the adjustment bureau has so much control and power over humanity and all of their their actions and can alter- and do so many 'magical' things but yet they have a hard time keeping an eye on two individuals and besides don't do an awful lot to try to set things straight. I mean, they apparently can even alter thoughts and completely reset human brains, why not do any of that with the Damon character? It's not like Damon was a powerful character that could take on a bunch of guys and he also wasn't armed at any time throughout this movie. There is never really any sense of danger in this movie because of that. It's just a sort of soft and light type of science-fiction thriller, that is lacking much excitement and other aspects among those lines, to make this movie an interesting and compelling watch throughout, while all of the potential was really there up for the grabs.So the movie instead mostly builds on the romance between Matt Damon and Emily Blunt and while they have good chemistry together, that just isn't enough. It just doesn't feel like these are two people who are madly in love with and are made for each other, even though the movie tries to imply that. Their chemistry together is more like a very strong flirtasious one, like they are two people who could have a very hot romance for a couple of weeks but then soon start to realize they have far too little in common for a serious relationship to work out between them two. It also doesn't make it very convincing that the Matt Damon character is trying to be with Emily Blunt, no matter how much stuff gets thrown his way and gets made apparent that they just aren't meant to be together. You just want to say to him; move on after all those years and forget about her! It's too much trouble for one girl and a man in his position could had found new love within an instant. But of course that isn't the romanticized message that the movie wants to send out. And this very same approach at the same time also still ensures that this remains a cute and harmless movie.Still a good and original enough movie with its genre, that just isn't the most exciting or interesting movie around to watch.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Thinking up the title is the only merit of this film!,"The film deals with two very important philosophical matters (forces that control the destiny of all men and use of free will) in a very frivolous way.This is very curious for a movie that cost over 50.000.000 dollars.The script doesn't have major plot twists.The characters are one-dimensional,which is a huge drawback for a thriller with almost no action.There is no emotional stimulation for the spectators.There isn't even the slightest passion between the two lovers,so the film doesn't have an impact as a love story either.Matt Damon is efficient as always,but the rest of the actors and actresses offer very unmemorable performances.The direction is uninspired.There isn't any visual satisfaction either,although the film belongs in a genre with opulent visual delights.If you want to see a powerful love story in the form of a thriller,""The next three days"" is a must.You won't regret it...The film was on the shelves for quite some time before its release.I think that this fact means a lot...

"Good Concept, Imperfect Execution","The affair between a politician (Matt Damon) and a ballerina (Emily Blunt) is affected by mysterious forces keeping the lovers apart.I liked how this film reminded me of ""Dark City"", though not nearly as dark and menacing, with the theme of manipulation behind the scenes of reality. Many have noticed the similarity between the beings here and what could be seen as angels and their work for God. Was this intentional? Probably.Roger Ebert called it ""a smart and good movie that could have been a great one, if it had been a little more daring. I suspect the filmmakers were reluctant to follow its implications too far."" Not only that, but the film relies heavily on a cheesy romance plot. Who cares if these two get together or if it defies what ""should"" be?",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Emily Blunt & Matt Damon's electrifying chemistry makes you forget the happy-yet-disappointing dopey ending.,"THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU – CATCH IT ( B ) The Adjustment Bureau is a difficult & different. It's not a usual sci-fi movie with lots of special effects and action, its Romantic sci-fi where the hero is fighting with the time/faith to get the girl he loves. It won't be wrong to say that the studio & director has tried their best to make the movie as simple as they can, because even in first 20mints when the bureau appears you understands their method about keeping people on their path so they can be a great help to the world. Matt Damon and Emily Blunt share electrifying on screen chemistry. I've never been Matt Damon's fan though I've always admired his work since ""Good Will hunting"" to ""Ocean Eleven"" & ""Jason Bourne"" franchises to recent note worth roles in The Informant & True Grit. Even with all those big and noteworthy movies, I can never imagine Matt Damon as romantic lead but he still did impress me. Emily Blunt is gorgeous & very talented. Emily Blunt's unlikely pairing with Matt Damon and somehow it work wonders here. Their first meeting in the gent's bathroom is brief but their chemistry just electrify the screen and you can believe why he fight so hard for her. The only thing heavily disappoint in the movie is perfect ending. The ending came off dopey & made the whole experience sort of disappointing. Well they say sometimes the happy Ending ruins everything. Overall, just before last 5mintes the whole movie is immensely enjoyable.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Adjustment Bureau - Essential Viewing!!,"The Adjustment Bureau - A hard film to stick in a particular genre. It's a Romantic Science Fiction film that deals focuses on fate and idea that a power out with our human control is manipulating events and deciding our destiny. Essentially this film is a love story between a hot shot politician (Matt Damon) and a up and coming ballet dancer (Emily Blunt) both on their way to greatness. This film works so well due to chemistry that Damon and Blunt have on screen. Dealing with such controversial concepts such as God and Fate is challenging to convey to an audience, but George Nolfi's seems to have managed to present these themes in a smart and digestible way. So far this is my favorite film of the year and I would give it a (B+) - Highly Recommended!!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Humans and dancers,"An ambitious NY politician, David Norris (Matt Damon) has two chance encounters with a beautiful dancer (Emily Blunt) who inspires him to continue with his faltering campaign. But he rapidly discovers a group of men who are intent on manipulating this love affair, to their own ends. They are the Adjustment Bureau. David learns that his destiny is not with the woman, even though he is certain she belongs to him. The men of the Bureau are nothing less than manipulators of humanity. They possess superpowers, using special interactive maps to pursue & intercept their subjects. They instruct David that any attempt to meet her again could have calamitous consequences for both. However, David has resources of his own, and is determined to find her, though he only knows her first name - Elise. So begins a cat-and-mouse game between David and the Bureau. The agent detailed to follow David, Harry (Anthony Mackie) seems to have mixed feelings about his task, and is far more sympathetic than Agent Richardson (John Slattery). We eventually discover why. But when things get serious, an altogether more sinister senior officer, Thompson (Terence Stamp) is called in to put an end to the affair once and for all.At the heart of this intriguing sci-fi thriller is a bittersweet love story, played out with great delicacy and panache by Matt Damon and his co-star Emily Blunt. I would go so far as to say that the mounting intensity of the scenes between them, is what makes this movie a cut above the ordinary. Damon is always watchable, but Blunt is a real revelation. Will they, won't they? A good romance, and a good thriller, always keep us guessing right to the end.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Some Reflections On Free Will & Predeterminism,"""The Adjustment Bureau"" has some interesting reflections on the idea of human free will, couched in a quasi-religious atmosphere, and it is at times thought-provoking if not, in my opinion, all that deep an exploration of the subject. Essentially the first question is whether there are limits to free will and, if so, what the limits are. The answer is that of course there are limits to free will. The fact that I have free will is somewhat limited by your free will. I may be able to make choices, but to some extent my choices are going to be dependent on your choices. Our free wills both complement and challenge one another's. So, there are obvious limits to free will. From the movie's perspective the question is of both free will and ""predeterminism"" (the idea that all things are planned; that there are no coincidences.) The movie doesn't go that far. It acknowledges that there are small matters over which we do have free will (such as what kind of toothpaste we use) but it also makes clear that our lives are part of a larger plan, and that adjustments will be made to our actions in order to ensure that the plan gets carried out.There's the obvious religious overtone to this. Who's in control of the plan? In the movie it's ""The Chairman"" - assisted by secret agent, ""Men in Black"" looking types (represented primarily by Anthony Mackie and Terence Stamp.) The question is ""who's The Chairman?"" The obvious answer might be God, with the ""agents"" then being angels whose job is to ensure that whatever the cosmic plan is gets fulfilled. I wondered, however, from a fairly early point whether this was some sort of computer simulation game, with the Chairman being the programmer and the agents being a sort of anti-virus component that repairs the program is it gets messed up. The movie never really makes clear what's going on in that respect.That decision to leave a lot of things up in the air is probably the movie's biggest weakness. What was going on was never really resolved. Overall, though, I liked the movie. It wasn't particularly fast-paced, but Matt Damon and Emily Blunt were likable leads who worked pretty well together. I would think of this movie as a diversion far more than a masterpiece. (6/10)",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

More of a chick flick than a mindbender,"I was expecting something along the lines of Inception, or the Source Code, or the Matrix..the concept is brilliant, but the love story pervades, and it washes away any other interesting avenues they should've explored.I would compare the feel of this movie to something like Stranger Than Fiction, only it doesn't tie everything together at the end.

My rating: 7,"I took deep breath and with exhale begin to write. From a long time I divide movies to new (bad) and old (good). This is rather good maybe because it goes more to the old movies.We used to watch Matt Damon in a bloody actions with shootouts and chases. This time it was love action with persecution but no shooting. Ideas were also present. Such as floating one on the surface to bottom fishes. This is why we throw the hook for bottom fish.The movie was a criticism of careerism, human irresponsibility and failure of liberalism and democracy. Fate - one of my favorite topics. The angels of destiny steer the course of history because people do not do well with this task. Well yes, but the chance prevented even the angels and love (of course) wins at the end. Here is the place for a light criticism of the female part in the film with its simplicity and ultimate romance. I can not miss to mention the striking resemblance between the bride fugitive's maid of honor and my acquaintance! Generally quickly showed us everything but successful and interesting. Watchable romantic action in which love wins over fate and even angels of destiny. It looked like a sigh this mine talk.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Christian Adjustment,"Before I state my points about the Adjustment Bureau, I want to state that I enjoyed watching the movie for its entertainment sake. My purpose here is to compare the movie to Christian theology. This movie makes no pretense at being a Christian film, so I am not faulting the film-makers. Rather, I wish to alert Christians in the audience viewing the film how this movie strays from the reality of Jesus Christ.Christian reviews of movies are usually trivial which focus almost solely on nudity, violence, foul language. They never really address the world view expressed in the film. The closest comment on the world view I found from Christian movie critic, Ted Baehr, said: ""there is one slightly ambiguous, theologically false ""Joan of Arcadia"" comment toward the end about God appearing in different, personal ways to individuals that can lead people away from Jesus Christ,"" - a thought that crossed my mind, as well.Jewish critic, Michael Medved, had nothing but praise for the film. His review is fine for me, but I know that many Christians listen to conservative talk shows without considering the host's world view, blithely assuming it is Christian, too.Here then, are my concerns. We are led to believe that the Adjustment Bureau are angels working for God in assuring that the lives of people follow the plan of God. At one point, David Norris (played by Matt Damon) is told that he and Elise (played by Emily Blunt) have to be separated because he is supposed to become president someday, and she a great ballerina and choreographer. This won't happen if they are together. It is true that God has a plan for our lives. And for some, it is to be in positions of worldly authority. But the plan of God is for us to know Him through His Son, Jesus Christ, first. Such worldly goals are on the bottom of His list. Discipleship means dying to self, not pursue worldly acclaim.Ted Baehr points out the main premise of the film is whether or not we actually have free will. The film leaves that answer ambiguously. There are Christians who believe that we do not. They are Calvinists. So for Calvinists this film will be agreeable to their world view. But, the ambiguous answer of the film, is a little close to the truth. We have free wills. God does not plan our sins. But the divine will works with our choices according to Romans 8:26 - ""all things work for good for those who love God and are called according to His purpose."" The problem I have with the Adjustment Bureau is that their actions are more characteristic of demons than holy angels. The chairman is implied to be God, but, in my viewing was more easily identified with Satan. It is Satan who offers us power and prestige in this world, not God. God seeks to humble us so we may follow His way, not the world. These cold-hearted agents of the bureau cause accidents to redirect our paths - spilling coffee on us, causing auto-wrecks, interrupting us with phone calls, and so forth - these are actions of demons, not angels.

"Surprisingly meaningful Sci -Fi, love story","I was expecting The Adjustment Bureau to be dark and sinister, instead it turned out to be a meaningful cross – genre, uplifting love story which wasn't very sinister at all; which leads us to question the choices we make and events of chance or fate that adjust our 'plan' every day.The part Sci-Fi, part love story between Senator elect Norris and contemporary dancer Elise starts with a chance meeting in a men's room; not so curious when we find the free-spirited gal is gate-crashing a party. The chemistry of this first encounter and the following charming, witty and convincing chance encounters immediately elevate our belief in the romance and allows us to invest care in our would be lovers from the start. This makes The Adjustment Bureau work best as a love story; Matt Damon and Emily Blunt are great together as the beautiful, but thankfully unpolished and believable love-birds.Further events of chance, fate and intervention by ""the people who make sure things go according to plan"" conspire to pull apart and push our lovers together.The inevitable head scratching and guesswork starts when we cross genres and first meet 'Mad men's' John Slattery and Anthony Mackie as the initially one dimensional chase-giving men from the bureau; tasked to ""nudge"" Norris back in the right direction. The later entrance of the superb Terrence stamp as the quite ruthless 'Thompson' brings some overdue peril and even grander revelations about ""the appearance of free will"".It is here where this hybrid could have gone very wrong, but first time director Nolfi manages to succeed in the mixing of Sci-fi and love story as he ultimately does both very well; binding the two with important thought provoking themes, engaging and often charming screenplay and strong characterisation; in particular Mackies' portrayal as the ""case officer"" with a heart.Comedy is provided curiously and possibly unintentionally at times by the suits of The Bureau. Often haphazard, often just negligent in their supposed really important roles, they are one minute virtually superhuman, the next quite inept. Either way, their human like frailties makes for some genuinely funny moments and also leads us to care for them too, when they too question their own sense of right and wrong and the choices they make.Director and screenwriter George Nolfi sets a solid pace throughout and keeps our attention with some well-timed, but slightly predictable reveals and solid direction, with some beautifully framed shots. The neat score compliments the on screen action well.Fate, chance and the question of how much free will we are truly afforded run through 'The Adjustment Bureau' and it is these themes that really give meaning to our protagonists struggle to evade the supposed plan. Every choice has always been and always will be of consequence, every act has repercussions and events can often be fateful. Even random chance events have great resonance, chance seemingly being far more influential than any supposed predetermined plan. The film and the mixed genre experiment works because of these themes as we too begin to question for ourselves and not just follow what transpires on screen. Everything we do causes a ""ripple"" and you will be left with one big question – ""24 hours in a day, 24 beers in a case – coincidence?""I WAS expecting The Adjustment Bureau to be dark. I am glad to say that the lighter, uplifting and meaningful film I got, rather than the expected sinister one (suggested by menacingly toned pre-release posters and trailers) was in the end; welcome. This perhaps made for a more enjoyable ride than a more formulaic, dark figured men in raincoats (been done before) chase movie. Not to say The Adjustment Bureau sometimes didn't follow a well-trodden formula and isn't without flaws; It was executed well and just balances slightly better as a charming meaningful love story; smartly tied together by the things that matter to us all.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Fate can be fought,"As a guy goes through his routine life something rather extra-ordinary happens: he has a literal run in with fate. From there on he's met with many choices - most of them biased around accepting his fate, or running away from it.The story of the film isn't entirely new - more films have been made with the same premise. The way it is worked out isn't altogether fresh either - this film reminds me a great lot of Dark City for instance (even though that one doesn't necessarily deal with fate). But it is worked out pleasant enough - the start is a wee bit slow but it picks up in the second half and the ending isn't too bad.The characters are played out good enough - they fit the parts they need to be and come across believable enough to keep up with the film. The tension field between the two main characters is OK enough, one would be able to believe the two of them to be in love.All in all, OK enough but nothing more than that.6 out of 10 fates escaped",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
I think i'm gonna get  myself a hat,"i love it. it's that simple. but actually it's not. philosophy, metaphysics, existentialism: are we free agents, making independent choices, or are we managed and controlled by a higher power, the ""chairman"" and his pawns in the movie, who let us move through our lives, and ""adjusts"" us as needed to make sure we follow the plan. David Norris AKA Matt Damon sees something he is not suppose to see, and nothing is ever the same. he'd seen how his friend is getting ""recalibrated"" and found out that men with hats can make things happen, according to a plan that dismisses his free will and choices as caprices of a child.after chasing his identity through 3 movies, Damon isn't giving up on his identity and free will, limited as it may have been, for the chairman's plan.it's a love story, a sci-fi of sorts, it's a spin-off of the Matrix, it's a well-done unusual chase/escape/love story. and for a change, the super power compassionate guy, while still black, is not Morgan Freeman.one jump out of my seat, few very predictable sequences of acts, and at the end i left the theater with the same happy-silly smile that i associate with watching the princess bride and a firm belief in the power of true love. but don't get me wrong. this is NOT A CHICK FLICK!!!

Unexpectedly well done,"This film surprised me. I was expecting something completely different, but it was a good surprise. The thing I instantly noticed was the truly remarkable photography. The film was beautifully shot, the amazing John Toll did a superb job. He is a great cinematographer and absolutely deserved his two previous Oscar's and needs to win another if not more. The editing and the music also stood out.The story was very interesting, and I liked the way it was done too. I haven't read the original short story, but I think the script was rather good. The actors also did a good job, I especially liked Terence Stamp. Oh, and Anthony Mackie surprised me with his appearance, I didn't expect to see him. Matt Damon was good too, but Emily Blunt played him off I think.The story is not the of the simple kind which I am used to when watching American movies nowadays. A troubled, but popular New York state representative, David Norris (Matt Damon) meets the woman of his dreams, Elise (Emily Blunt) in the men's room. Their ways depart, and David doesn't even know her name. A few months later they meet on a bus. Elise gives David her phone number.

Very good acting and a good concept of travel. (the door method),"The Adjustment Bureau, The question is can you change fate? Matt Damon and Emily Blunt both give a great performance which i thought made the movie all the more engaging. their feelings between them is the focal point for the majority of the movie, as their relationship is truly tested. the Bureau is willing to do anything to keep them both on the 'plan' as they watch almost every move they make.A slow beginning turns into a wild chase of another dimension, which ultimately ends with a choice that will change their fate forever. the Adjustment Bureau is a well designed and created concept that pushes the boundaries of what is actually guiding us all on our paths day after day. the acting between Damon and Blunt is amazing. there is definitely great chemistry between them that makes for a very believable story.visually the movie is great, with the effects being subtle and very convincing. as the plot thickens, you start to discover what the Bureau is and why they do what they do, and how they do it. although you tend to guess the ending soon into the film, you find yourself engaged in the visuals and the methods behind the Bureau, and waiting to see just how they find their way through.Overall, i thought this movie deserved a 7/10. it was good thrill ride and i loved the chemistry between Emily bunt and Matt Damon. the chase ends with a decision and a ending which you can see coming a mile away, but nonetheless, you find yourself watching to the end.Luke.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Why you should and shouldn't see The Adjustment Bureau,"What I Think Nolfi uses Philip K. Dick's clever premise to its best advantage, with an effective script, directed well. The principal roles couldn't have been better cast, the suit and hat attire of the Bureau members is just right, and the effects, such as the doors that open into random locations across the city, are seamlessly executed.It's possible that some viewers, depending upon their religious views, might take offense at The Adjustment Bureau, because its conflict could be interpreted as not only fate versus free will, but faith versus free will. Sometimes a little offense is a good thing, though, because it can lead to thinking.Putting myself in David's place (as a moviegoer should), I wanted to ask Richardson and his cohorts more questions, and more pointed ones, sooner than the protagonist did. You've asked me to trust you, now tell me why I should. You might want to start by telling me exactly who and what you are. Has anyone even tried to come up with a plan that gets us from A to Z without (bad thing)? If you want my cooperation, you'll explain why there's no other way. Come on, sell me on it, walk me through it. I have a right to that much. It's a compliment to the filmmakers, I think, that I cared enough to want answers before they were provided.I don't find the film's treatment of Fate as a mystical force to be quite as profound as it's probably intended to be, probably because I'm not big on mystical forces. However as an action-adventure, an intricate romantic fantasy and even as a diverting philosophical exercise, The Adjustment Bureau succeeds.Why you should see it: You like it when Matt Damon runs around and Emily Blunt has emotions at people. You enjoy mislabeling fantasy as science fiction. You can pretend this is a sequel to The Devil Wears Prada, in which Blunt's character has given up the fashion world for ballet and magically teleports onto the field at Yankee Stadium with Jason Bourne, Senate candidate.Why you shouldn't see it: You're afraid you'll accidentally use the word ""Chairman"" in church.--from my review at www.1man365movies.com",,Anonymous,Romance
Recommend it,"My rating: 7.5/10I have never been the biggest Matt Damon fan. His acting seems the same in any role he plays. The best actors are the ones that can be the most diverse, and I don't believe Matt Damon to be among them, but that does not mean the actor has limits.This film has something that newer movies seem to lack, an original and interesting plot. Its good to see a movie with some intelligence hitting theaters. Why do you think Inception was so popular? People like to have their minds blown. It's hard to watch this film without stopping to ponder on what just happened. I don't think I will ever look at a person in one of those hats the same way again.The chemistry of the two main characters was quick but definite. The sparks were flying from the start, which I still cannot decide if that was good or not. Although, from the aspect of the story, it does seem to fit well. It never seems hard to make a character likable, so it seems difficult to give credit for that. Nonetheless, I can't say I wasn't rooting for them all the way.The ending was VERY predictable. With just watching a few trailers, you're sure to figure it out. But, It's not always the predictability of the ending that is important but how you get there. We've all seen movies that happen to be a bore, but with that certain twist at the end, it may have bumped it from a 2 to a 4 in our rankings. There are some interesting things in this movie but nothing very twist-like. To make another Inception reference, the ending left you wondering. It had one of those epic twists. But, there is nothing like that here to bump it up a notch. That saddens me.As I said, it's not always the predictability but the path you take to get there. All in all I actually really enjoyed it. I like movies with some intelligence and originality and I think this movie really has it. I would recommend it to any of my friends, and probably will.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Interrupted by his campaign manager they part ways but later down the road they were reunited on a bus. A ride that was never suppose to happen.

Romance or sci-fi thriller ? You be the judge!!,OK i'll start this review by saying that if this film doesn't get your wheels turning i don't know what will. It's hard to review a flick of this stature without ruining or giving away the outcome. However its pretty good for plot twists and turns that's one thing i don't mind giving away at all. Romance/ sci-fi is what i would categorize this kinda reminded me of a twilight zone episode i had seen before but cant quite recall what it was entitled. Could you quite possibly foresee that all human's have a pre directed path they are supposed to follow during their lives? And if they fall off of this designated path their is someone or some unseen force guiding them back on path as you cannot cheat destiny or can u?

About half way through I had lost the will to live and although I didn't walk out before the end ( it was touch and go though ) I suffered terribly until the credits came up at the end and I was able to make a swift exit. I generally like Matt Damon but he has plumbed new depths with this offering.

Oddly Demanding for a Romance,"Netflix is reaching deep into the archives to fill its shelves thanks to the ongoing strikes. This one is moderately successful--I would have hated to pay for a theater ticket, but will watch online.---The Adjustment Bureau is a rather pedantic story about free will versus predestination, although it eschews religion so that no one will be offended or concerned.Matt Damon and Emily Blunt lead the cast and do their best to add some lightness and chemistry to the mix. They play two people who undeniably should fall in love but weren't ""meant"" to in the predetermined way of things.---They and the entire cast work are excellent, really.

Interesting premise with a good blend of sci-fi and romance,"I really didn't have high expectations for this movie when I saw the trailer, but after seeing it I can now say it really did beat my expectations. It's a clever sci-fi romance/thriller that is crafted very well and intrigued me throughout the whole movie. It sort of reminded me of movies like ""The Butterfly Effect"" and ""Inception"" a bit, but I personally liked this movie a bit more than ""The Butterfly Effect"". The movie is about trying to outrun fate or predestination and also makes you think more about freewill and also has elements of love and has a perfect blend of sci-fi and romance. The vibe and style has been done before especially in other sci-fi movies, but the direction of it all makes it worth while. The lighthearted aspect of this movie is done right for a serious tone movie and I didn't really like Matt Damon as a actor all that much but I enjoyed his performance in this. His character was very likable and a ideal politician in this movie. There is few parts that doesn't make sense, but overall the premise is mostly cleverly done. Now I never read ""Adjustment Team"" by Philip K. Dick this movie is adapted from, but judging by the film itself I really enjoyed it and seemed like a very good adaptation. There is some parts that seem to drag on sometimes and a bit slow. But overall almost everything in this movie works and has a perfect blend of two main elements. If your looking for tension you might be disappointed, because the Adjustment Bureau isn't very intimidating in this and you will see why. Despite some flaws, it's still a intriguing movie done right and to anyone who is looking for a good date movie, this one is worth checking out there is something for everyone.8.3/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Composite Movie,"I am a movie nut. All things weird and unusual that play on the idea of true love and the required personal sacrifices to ensure the feeling is not lust is not easily conveyed in a movie. Having said that, this movie, in my opinion, was a composite of themes from ""City of Angels"" - library and angels, ""The Matrix"" - the agents and entry doors, a little bit of the ""The Butterfly Effect"" - personal sacrifice, and ""The Wizard of Oz"" - nothing scary behind the curtain!The implied sex was tasteful in an old fashioned romance way that did not come across as gratuitous as say in ""Blue Valentine"". Perhaps, having been married for 21 years has created an intimate buffer zone that rejects voyeristic sex. In other words, sexually adjusted people - married or not - do not need to see other people having sex.This was a movie that could be watched with a 16 year old child and discussed afterward without the awkward in-the-face sex seemingly thrown into so many movies these days.I enjoyed the effort Damon's character exerted to have the woman of his dreams - the soul mate - the best friend - the true kiss, and the ability of Elise to trust him and herself to go through the doors.For the 50 year old set, hard-core sex does not intimate-sensuality make, and more movies should provide the essence of innocence in 'the first time' experience, even if it is the 30th first time - sex should not be depicted as a handshake - but must always be forever the mystery of 'other-worldly possibilities' !",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""Stretching Suspension""","The movie starts off pretty well. There is an acceptable introduction of characters, each and every of them. You can easily feel the roles and the motions and feelings coming through. The lines have been written thoughtfully.However, there are obvious non-matching parts about the story. This movie is showing David Norris in a serious campaign for the senate, when he suddenly meets Elise and falls in love. And this is exactly the very questionable part of the script. As a viewer, you reserve yourself the right to wonder that why and how such an ambitious person could give up his speeches and interviews just to give excuses to the woman of her dreams. It is understandable that George Nolfi meant to picture how mighty love can stand against anything, even desire to walk into the office, yet he might have neglected that there needs to be a tangible balance between these two to uphold the credibility and acceptability of the plot for the watcher.Moreover, there are parts that Harry or Richardson start talking about David's brother, father, and mother, while there is no extra information and you may keep wondering who they were exactly and why the adjustment bureau should need to worry about them; and this ambiguity is deteriorated once there are occasional references to the family, such as ""Your father used to say that!"" or ""What your brother told you before he overdosed!""And about acting, it is enough to say that ""Matt Damon"" is just typical him, as well as Emily Blunt's performance which could have been carried off by any other female actor, which both are, to be fair, mainly a script problem for being too worried about keeping two totally different lines together.All in all, you may watch The Adjustment Bureau if you only mean to spend time watching a movie, regardless of story details, as it has scenes to take you along.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

They are cosmic humanoids with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder who like to micro manage the fine details of human lives without them finding out about it who think of themselves as angels. Rather than evil, they are more like meddling aunts. The plot is reminiscent of Men In Black though not quite so silly. David Norris never figures anything out on his own. Everything is tediously explained to him by the aliens.In the opening scenes David Norris runs for office. They use real-life political commentators like Jon Stewart, Wolf Blitzer and James Carville in a completely realistic way.The movie can be interpreted in an religious way. Is there a religious hierarchy meddling with our lives, including deliberately creating death and massive heartache? The aliens have a set of wormhole doors that let them jump from one part of the city to another. The special effect is extremely easy to film, and the director used the technique over and over and over.The movie feels as if it has a lot of padding, e.g. that skyline is pretty, but it does nothing to develop the plot or character. To work, it needs a massive rewrite of the book to tighten up the pace and to make the villains a bit more ominous.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

The sci-fi factor of the movie is bit confusing and dragging in the second half. The movie has real surprising moments and at the same time very saggy moments also...

Needs some minor adjustments,"David Norris is a rather arrogant fellow. As well he might be as he is a Congressman who is expected to coast to victory in his upcoming Senate race. The sky is the limit for young David Norris...but then the sky comes crashing down on him. He loses that Senate race and, humbled, makes a candid concession speech which goes over so well he immediately becomes the favorite to win the next Senate race a few years down the line. In this speech, by laying himself bare and talking from the heart, David really connects with people. He'd really like to thank the person who inspired the speech. That would be Elise who is...a woman he just met in the men's bathroom? This intriguing woman might change David's destiny. And that is a problem. David and Elise were never supposed to meet. Says who? Some mysterious men in fedoras.David and Elise have their restroom moment and then she's gone. David would very much like to find her. The men in hats would very much prefer he not do so. And they have strange powers which enable them to keep David and Elise apart. But then one of the men in hats screws up, David bumps into Elise and things start to get really, really weird. The men in hats are from the Adjustment Bureau. David catches them in the act of doing some adjusting on people in his life. They can change people's thoughts, ensuring that everything unfolds according to The Plan. What plan? The Chairman's plan. Who's the Chairman? David would surely like to know but the Adjustment Bureau is not going to be forthcoming with any such information. All they need David to know is that if he reveals their existence to anyone he will be ""reset"" which is a cute way of saying lobotomized. And he is not to see Elise ever again.So of course David becomes more determined than ever to see Elise. The Adjustment Bureau throws obstacles in his path, David overcomes them. Eventually the Bureau has to call in the big gun, Thompson, the scariest dude in their arsenal. Thompson provides a little insight into the Bureau. He provides a little insight into why David is so important. And he makes it perfectly clear that he will have no qualms about crushing Elise to make sure David sticks to The Plan. Can love overcome? This is all very intriguing but as the movie plays out it is not quite as exciting as one might hope. Things get rather muddled, bogged down. For much of the film's running time there is not much energy to it. Matt Damon gives a good performance as David, a character who is initially unlikable who we very quickly start identifying with and pulling for. Emily Blunt is also quite good as Elise, creating a character who is instantly intriguing and always interesting. Easy to see why David would fall for Elise. Damon and Blunt have good chemistry but, seeing as the whole point of the movie is their two characters being kept apart, they are not ever really together long enough for that chemistry to pay great dividends. The Adjustment Bureau is of course shrouded in mystery. That mystery doesn't pay itself off as well as you might hope, instead of a big finish things sort of fizzle out. Questions are raised about humanity's free will but those questions are not really answered satisfactorily. In the end it doesn't quite all tie together. There's some good intrigue here, some good romance too. Damon and Blunt do very well, drawing you in and making you really invest in this relationship which, for reasons unknown, is not allowed to be. It's an intelligent film, one which makes you think. So there's a lot the film has going for it. There is the nagging sense though that the film falls just a little bit short of the greatness which seemed to be within its grasp. Maybe a slight adjustment here or there...",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Rare genre well explored,"Its unusual to see a Sci-fiction romantic movie without a twisted ending. I loved the story line which stayed on point.

Highly Entertaining,"The Adjustment Bureau exists to make sure everything happens according to Plan explains Richardson (Slattery). David Norris (Damon) sees these people making adjustments on fellow workers, runs, is chased and captured. They explain to David what will happen to him if he tells anyone what he saw. They also tell him that he cannot be with Elise (Blunt), the woman he just met. It's not part of the Plan. What to do? What to do?So now I get it. I now know why the girl I asked to marry me did not, could not, would not. It all makes sense now. Also, I know the reason I do not, can not and will not ever win a big money lottery. Yes, it is all very sad, but also very clear. Now I get it. There are people out there helping us make the right decisions. Wait a minute, that can't be right. We have free will. Right! Don't we? Tough Room!This is a highly entertaining and engaging story. I especially like the honest dialogue from all parties. The pacing was just right. The cinematography was outstanding. Could have used a little more humor. There was some, but more wouldn't have hurt. The men of the Adjustment Bureau were like the Men In Black, except they were notable for their hats. The hats are very important.The music near the end when David is running was exceptional. I was toe tapping to beat the band and I never do that.This was a very creative effort. I mean this story is big, bigger than inventing or reinventing the wheel. See? Really big. That is, if you believe. Until the day we die, we may and will ask ourselves: predestination or free will. What do we have? Huh?The acting was perfect due to the actors, of course, but mostly, it was the dialogue that made everything seamless. I was also most impressed by Anthony Mitchell who played Harry (one of them) who tries to help David from time to time. I liked the way he knew what his job was, yet you could see in his eyes that he had reservations. Very good. And, Terrance Stamp as Thompson, one of the chiefs of that Bureau, what can I say? He is perfect under any circumstances. Emily Blunt: was that her really doing those dance moves like she had no bones in her body? Outstanding. And, when John Slattery talks, I believe every word he utters. As for Matt Damon, he is finally getting his due other than the Jason Bourne roles, although I wouldn't mind another.Anyway, now I know. It all makes sense to me now.They are out there making sure..Violence: Not really. OK, a car accident only. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes, one F-bomb was heard late in the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Enjoyable nonsense,"As I watched this I couldn't help but feel that I've seen it all before. Taking elements of The Matrix, The City of Angels and every 90s romance movie, throw in a little comic book magic and you have The Adjustment Bureau. In spite of this, this is an enjoyable romp with a great cast including both Emily Blunt and Anthony Mackie.My main issue is that the film is so predictable, if you've seen any film with a romantic plot you know how The Adjustment Bureau will end. It should also be mentioned that Matt Damon's performance comes across as a little bland and one dimensional, it's a good job he can run.Having said all this, the movie is fun and if there is nothing better on will be worth watching.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Different, but oddly lightweight","THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU is a modern-day sci-fi thriller based on a short story by one of Hollywood's favoured genre writers, Philip K. Dick. It shows plenty of potential and promise in a plot that's novel and fresh-feeling, but come the end you get the impression it's entirely lightweight and curiously insubstantial.Writer/director George Nolfi crafts a story with undertones of the excellent DARK CITY in look and style as aspiring politician Matt Damon discovers mysterious forces governing his world. Unfortunately, despite the hugely extensive back story behind this fare, what it boils down to is a simple will they/won't they love story between Damon and the alluring Emily Blunt.This development makes the repeated attempts at danger and suspense feel faintly ridiculous. I mean, would all the antagonistic characters - John Slattery, Terence Stamp, et al - really go to this level of trouble for something so, well, unimportant in the scheme of things? When the stakes are so low, the viewer just doesn't care.There are good things in this: a solid turn (again) from Damon as a likable everyman hero for a change, well-handled direction and a lovely turn from the absolutely ravishing Blunt, but the attempts to meld old-fashioned thriller aspects with the romantic storyline just doesn't sit very well with me.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

This crud had none. My husband actually liked it better than I did. Well, at least he had the ever lovely Emily Blunt to look at. She's always good in things. I don't fault any performers here.

one of those that was worth watching,"""Adjustment Bureau"" is a 2011 drama starring Matt Damon as David Norris, a campaigner for U.S. Senator of New York. After coming out with a wide lead, he runs into Elise (Emily Blunt) and falls in love with her. However, a team makes sure he doesn't have any contact with her from that day forward, or all his and her dreams will be destroyed. David races against time to get ahead of the team and be with Elise.It's one of those films that is enjoyable to watch and Damon puts on a solid performance. The film moves slow at times but does provide a spark and it's one that is worth watching. I really enjoyed the ending too although I thought the start was going to be a lot better than it was.

Not as much of a Thriller as I Hoped,"I had deliberately not read any reviews for this film, hoping to watch it with fresh eyes and be given a chance not to know any spoilers. All I knew was that this film had a twist on the time travel theme. For some reason, I was expecting a thriller movie, instead I discovered it was a romance movie. I had not read the original short story by Philip K. Dick, so I don't know the original plot. In this case, a man is not given a choice between a career in politics or stay with the love of his life. He wants to stay with his soul mate, but the powers that be try to steer him toward becoming President. It reminded me of another romance with a little science fiction thrown in, ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"". ""Eternal"" had a similar premise where a device is used to keep apart two people who seemed destined for each other. ""Adjustment"" could have worked as an intriguing thriller, with the ""plan makers"" having a more darker influence on the main character's life. The only element of danger is a threat to our protagonist that his memory will be wiped if he doesn't accept the career path chosen for him. For the most part, however, it seems the filmmakers needed to keep the tone much lighter, with virtually no violence and mostly non-threatening action sequences. This tone is reflected in the music by Thomas Newman, which contains the familiar feel-good light arrangements, queuing the audience that everything will be just fine and our main character is not in any dire predicament. I kind of wish more jeopardy was prevalent in this story, than just be about the power of love. This lack of jeopardy made the third act much less compelling, and resolution all but certain.The adjustment bureau's premise is still interesting, and it is engaging to learn the ""rules"", of how the ""agents"" operate. There are some smart moments where the agents discuss among themselves the meaning of it all. The screenplay also does a good job of keeping just enough of the greater plan a mystery so we the audience aren't being dumbed down with a lot of textbook exposition. Indeed, a lot of exposition is still necessary in order to connect the dots, but the story rolls along with a decent pace. What keeps this film from being mechanical is the good chemistry between Matt Damon and Emily Blunt, with sparkling dialogue that almost seems improvised. The filmmakers knew that this chemistry was critical in order for the audience to invest their time and emotion into film's plot. Our desire as the audience to see these two people together made us willing to invest our own emotions into the story. So the screenplay, acting, and editing are to be acknowledged in what makes this film succeed. It is only the intended lightness of the story that keeps the third act from having any real gravitas. The potential to have more thrilling elements could have improved the story without losing the romantic core of the plot.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Incredible Original Soundtrack,"After watching this movie for the fourth time on Blu-ray, I checked a lot of user reviews on Metacritic and here, and none of the ones I read even mentioned the incredible soundtrack by Thomas Newman. If you do like this soundtrack, there is another soundtrack that Newman has done in the same style: ""Jarhead"". If you like ""James Bond"" soundtracks, Newman has done the last two: ""Skyfall"" and ""Spectre"". ""The Adjustment Bureau"" is in my top three movie soundtracks along with the 2002 soundtrack to ""Solaris"" by Cliff Martinez and the 1981 soundtrack to ""Thief"" by Tangerine Dream. ""The Adjustment Bureau"" the movie, is also one of my favorites. The romance aspect is very sophisticated and the cinematography of New York City is very well done.

One of my favs!,Not into romances much but for this I will make an exception. Damon plays a politician trying to run for the senate while Blunt is a wild child contemporary dancer. They meet one evening and just click as soul mates.

NY Love letter,"I'm happy to write about The Adjustment today.Even though there's a clear crisis going on deep in the cinema industry, we still get jewels for generations to come. And this is one. Why? In part because is written by Philip K. Dick, who also wrote Blade Runner, Total Recall and Minority Report and died in 1982 (just to hold in mind). Simple, artistic, light hearted, clear, and hallelujah with no guns or murderers! With some ingredients resembling Dark City, I find the story very accessible and uplifting, with a nice and tight script (loving its clever dialogs). The casting is great and they all look just right.The only downside is the ambiguous power the Bureau holds and Matt expressions in some short parts... that may have been directed better (Matt and Emily make a refined match though!).This is a love story with a kick in the glass of reality, with cool music and perfect pace. The deleted scenes are kind of worth deleting and the bonus parts are not that important except for Emily's hard work on becoming a dancer. I congratulate George Nolfi (big fan since Ocean's 12) for the screenplay and fully recommend this movie, definitely to watch and own.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Do we leave things to fate, or are we part of some big plan?","Are we in control of our lives, do we leave things to fate, do our choices determine the course of our lives, or are we a miniscule part of some unfathomable plan? Though found in bits and pieces, this movie is an astounding answer to at least one of these questions.New York Congressman David Norris (Matt Damon) is a serious contender as the youngest politician in a campaign vying for a seat in the US Senate. As a charismatic crowd pleaser, he is loved by the media and the masses alike. His greatest strength is the high level of transparency he is known for. Needles to say, transparency and politics have never gone hand-in-hand but this is why he is loved as a politician. On the flip side, David's tendency to react on an impulse also gets him to the front pages, but with diminished fervour. After one such incident and a chance encounter, David meets Elise (Emily Blunt), instantly igniting a spark that draws them together. Unknown to them, there are forces at work, arduously preventing a further union. When David questions their authority, he is faced with alarming consequences that could jeopardise his relationship with Elise. As a result, David is left with a choice where he must never see Elise again or risk destroying his and her aspirations in life; this includes his rise to power and her becoming a famous ballet dancer.Written for the screen and directed by George Nolfi, this directional debut is affluent in creativity and intelligent story telling. Prior to trying his hand at directing, Nolfi wrote the scripts for ""Ocean's Twelve"" and ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" (both starring Matt Damon). It is no surprise then, why this works for Nolfi. The concept alone is thought proving enough to engage the viewer from start to finish. If you have ever wondered why things don't go according to plan or why life sometimes throws a nasty curve ball, it is because a shadow organisation is ensuring we (as humans) do not deviate from a pre-existent, albeit, almighty plan. Conceptually, this is the film's profound message and is plausible in the way the plot unfolds. As the title indicates, agents from the Adjustment Bureau personify Heaven's angels or ""Case Officers"" as one agent calls himself. All case officers enforce instructions or 'adjustments' as written by ""The Chairman"". Playing some of these agents are Anthony Mackie, John Slattery and Terence Stamp, in order of hierarchy. While Mackie's character tries to help David, Stamp's Thompson is an ominous force to deal with.Although this is a plot driven film, what really makes this a 2011 standout is having Matt Damon and Emily Blunt as love truck leads. More than just a love story, the concept here relies on bitter-sweet romance compounded by mystery and uncertainty. What makes this a must watch is the cheer chemistry between Damon and Blunt. While David tries to stand in the way of an omnipresent force, his screen time with Elise is few and short. This adds to the overwhelming feeling of wanting them to be together. If you are hopeless romantic, a box of Kleenex should help suppress those tears.Coming back to Nolfi, and since this is his first film as a director, I am left with nothing but praises for his attempt at putting together an off-beat romantic thriller. While I can place the film somewhere between ""City of Angels"" and ""The Butterfly Effect"", The Adjustment Bureau holds its ground in creative thinking. Yes, there are a couple of plot holes towards the end, while the build up of suspense and mystery is rewarded by a low-key climax. But considering everything else this film has to offer, Nolfi can be given the benefit of doubt with as much as an applaud for his efforts in producing what will be considered unforgettable and unconventional.Come Oscar season 2012, I won't be surprised if this film is nominated for an Academy Award.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Pleasantly refreshing,"For all of you who are tired of thoughtless mindless action thrillers that are pouring out in plenty in Hollywood these days, ""The Adjustment Bureau"" promises to be pleasantly refreshing. Of a genre that can be classified as romantic thriller meeting science fiction, this movie entertains and intrigues you at the same time.Matt Demon plays David, a New York Congressman with an aspiring political career, who after a couple of chance encounters with Elise(played by Emily Blunt) is convinced that he has met the girl of his dreams and is determined to be with her. But enters into the scene, a bureau,the Adjustment Bureau, as mysterious as it can be, who is hell bent on keeping them apart.The story is gripping and has the right balance of intrigue and suspense mixed with a correct proportion of give-away of the story without laying it out absolutely. It also gives plenty of food for thought and throws questions which mystify you and you have to go beyond the realms of rationality and shake the very foundation of your existence in order to find the answers.Only thing is that there could have been a little subtlety and the climax could have been dealt with a bit more intelligence only to make it better.But having said that the movie notches up high points for being unique and spontaneous.

Unexplainable!,"Unfortunately I can't precisely explain why I loved this movie so much.I usually find it hard to suspend disbelief in fantasy type films. But the Adjustment Bureau is simply phenomenal. It has such a uniquely novel and immensely interesting plot. It is definitely something not seen before. I love the originality of the film and although it does rely on an aspect of surrealism I was extremely surprised that it did not distract my viewing at all.The romance scenes between the two leads are intense! I usually hate it when one actor surrenders their love for the other, because it is so unrealistic. However, the plot of the movie and the acting of the two leads made the romance so emotional for me. I was on the verge of tears, my eyes were extremely watery, ready to cry in a pool of sadness.The Adjustment Bureau can be deemed a ""romantic thriller.""

I walked into this film with no expectations and was extremely happy I spent my time on this magnificent piece of cinema.The premise of the film is similar to such films like Inception and Matrix, but is understood in a much simpler sense, tied up in the end without too much complexity.I would imagine this film to have a wide range of audience to please. It's got romance, it's got thrills, it's got action and it doesn't contain content inappropriate for the younger audience.The Adjustment Bureau is able to reel you in quickly to a very interesting, but questionable premise, but by the end of the movie you realise it was so enjoyable to watch that you didn't even take notice of the ""outside"" factors in the film.

One of the most beautiful and true to life films ever...,"From the many years of watching films and a generous list of favourites it is surprising even to myself that this is probably the first review I'm submitting to IMDb, which I think tells a lot about the quality of this film.I won't go into spoilers or dissect the film for you as this is something to experience yourself but if you're looking for that 'feel good' movie to watch with people you care about, if you're after a film that raises your spirits and makes you go that extra mile for your dreams or if you believe in free will then this is definitely for you.A well executed project with good, natural performances from the actors; Matt is already an established 'jack of all roles' considering his characters from Bourne to Will Hunting and Emily Blunt comes across as a veteran as well.On the other hand I do see people here saying the end was abrupt and predictive but hey that's just how it is for 90% of the films out there. Afterall we usually watch films to enjoy ourselves not to solve puzzles. This film should be taken and viewed exactly as it was meant to be; a good romantic drama which is quite true and applicable to the life we live on earth.Personally in the years that I've lived I have come across moments (and so would have others) where you do feel restrained by superior powers; it's what we do then that counts.

Further, there are the rules that Damon's character is not to break, but when he does so anyway, his punishments are about as harsh as those Hogan received from Colonel Klink.Meanwhile, the love story is weak (just as the actors' chemistry).

Overall, it delivers itself fine.The acting was fine as well.The bureau concept, however, has some minor... misconceptions that those quite aware of ""historical"" facts or transcripts might not overlook; but that's just pet peeve of mine.Overall, this movie is fine and deserves some attention.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"2011 starts on a solid note, with plenty of thrills and intellect to go around.","Last year, I started 2010 with Martin Scorsese's fantastic Shutter Island. Now 2011 has come, and I'm starting the cinematic year off with The Adjustment Bureau. While I don't think it's a perfect movie, I will say this much: It is a rock solid movie with thrills and intellect to spare.Matt Damon stars as David Norris, a New York congressman running for senate. After a huge loss, he has a chance encounter with a mysterious woman (Played by Emily Blunt), a woman who after another chance meeting is revealed to be named Elise. But unbeknownst to David, he was only supposed to meet her once, as part of a grand plan by an entity of black suited overseers. But David decides to challenge his destiny by pursuing Elise, but doing so is an action that could not only destroy his personal ambitions, but Elise's as well.The screenplay by first time director George Nolfi is an interesting one, and delivers serious food for thought on the concept of challenging fate, and the consequences of one's actions and deviations. Nolfi proves he has talent as a director, as he not only keeps a firm grasp on characterization, stages the action sequences well, or knows when to let the cinematography by John Toll, or musical score by Thomas Newman do the storytelling, but he also never strays far from proper structure, tone, and pace.The movie moves quickly, the conversations are interesting, and the ensemble cast, specifically that of Matt Damon and Emily Blunt's perfect chemistry, is terrific. It is worth noting that certain elements of the film can get confusing, and the ending is a bit anticlimactic, but I'd be lying to myself if I said I wasn't enthralled by those 100 minutes. Plus, I have to give praise to Kasia Walicka-Maimone for the film's inventive costumes.It may not be perfect, but I'm very satisfied to have kicked off 2011 with The Adjustment Bureau.I give it *** out of ****",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
One small struggle against The Machine,"David Norris(Matt Damon) a young promising New York politician falls for a ballet dancer Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt). Norris finds fate standing in the way their developing love in the form of a strange gang of trilby-wearing men called the Adjustment Bureau who are working according to a plan that certainly does not include Norris falling in love with Sellas.The film screamed of so many things taken from other films. The Adjustment Bureau agents were very similar in function and design to the Agents of the Matrix and the Strangers in Dark City. The chase through the doors was like the scene with the key-maker from The Matrix Reloaded and Thomson's (Terence Stamp) rant about humans was very similar to Agent Smith's misanthropic rant in The Matrix.The main difference with this film is that Norris is purely driven his love for Sellas and this film is mainly a love story. There really is very little suggest any global significance of Norris's personal battle to change his own fate. There also some very heavy hints about the identity of mysterious unseen Chairman, the author of the plan though that would be exactly what Agents of The Matrix would want people to think since it would be useful belief for enforcing control.The film was entertaining despite constantly reminding me of better films. The love story element was fairly believable as long as you kept with Norris's perspective.Rating 7/10 I'm all right Jack",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Adjustment Bureau is a thriller that gets you thinking,"What if free will is just a myth; an idea that keeps us happy? What if everything in our lives was planned out for us, from the people we meet to whether we achieve greatness or not? These question race through your mind as you view The Adjustment Bureau. Based upon the short story ""Adjustment Team"" by Philip K. Dick, George Nolfi has written and directed one of the most thought provoking, imaginative and thrilling films of all time. The story follows politician David Norris (Matt Damon) whose life plan isn't adjusted at a small moment in time, leading to him discovering the truth behind everyone's ""fate"" and giving him a glimpse of his own future, a future he doesn't want. Pursued by the hatted agents of the Bureau, David must do everything he can to outrun and outsmart them to alter his plan and be with Elise (Emily Blunt), the woman he loves; the woman the Bureau is conspiring to keep him from being with. With a great cast that includes the likes of charismatic Matt Damon and delightful Emily Blunt leading the way, as well as Michael Kelly, Anthony Mackie, John Slattery and Terence Stamp, you have an assortment of believable characters. The chemistry between Damon and Blunt worked very well and you truly believed that these characters were meant to be in love with one another. I think that Nolfi definitely has delivered one of the more unique pieces of cinema in recent memory, but at times the pacing was a bit too slow and a lot of it built up to a climax that wasn't so well, climatic. Overall, though, it was a good film that takes you on a thrilling ride and leaves you thinking.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very Surprised,"I went to and Advanced Screening of this film just a while back and was pleasantly surprised by the outcome. I've always been a fan of Matt Damon and Emily Blunt was great in Wolfman (even though I didn't like the movie one bit). Matt Damon had hit somewhat of a cold streak for me lately (I haven't yet gotten around to seeing True Grit...I know, I know) but his last few have been kind of mild and tiresome...this was very refreshing.I was highly caught of guard by the spiritual tenacity of the story...something I did not expect at all. The movie was, overall, quite original and groundbreaking. I hope this type of storytelling catches on for the mainstream audiences.This movie has a bit of something for everyone. You could tell how great this movie was by the general response from the audience. The theater that I was at was crowded (NO ONE LEFT DURING THE FILM). Also, the audience applauded very enthusiastically at the end...not something I can see being done at many of todays very unoriginal movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"What if your life was running according to plan, just not your own?","A sci-fi movie with Matt Damon and Emily Blunt that also features an epic love story? Who could not like something like that? Add John Slattery and Terence Stamp for good measure and you have a pretty good movie.The plot is adapted after a short by Philip K. Dick and you can feel that immediately in the film when Damon's character finds out people's lives are being controlled by a corporate like entity run by a chairman who writes the plan of what everybody should do. An adjustment team comes in whenever we mess with the master plan.There is not much I can add without spoiling it for you, but the ending kind of ruined it for me. You know when something spectacular happens in a hero movie and that's why he's the hero? Because other 99 people have tried the same thing and died like dumbasses at the start of the story? This film is kind of the same. Any smart person would feel the odds are ridiculously tilted in the other guy's direction and that the ending, however happy it might seem, is just a drop in a sea of sorrow.Other than that, a nice movie, but easily forgettable. Damon's Paycheck, perhaps, to bring out a parallel with his former friend Ben Affleck.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
I wouldn't classify it as sci-fi,"The Adjustment Bureau works behind the scenes arranging people's fate. But David Norriss wants to control his own fate. He manages to catch the Bureau in the act of ""adjusting"" his fate and is threatened to never speak of it and to stay away from a woman he has just met. The Bureau attempts to enforce this separation but Norriss avoids them and foils their varied efforts.I was expecting a sci-fi thriller, but instead found romantic and religious mush. Was it a stab at the Greek gods, God, a debate personified, or the visual musings of the existence of any supreme being. It really wasn't worth my time or money.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A  movie who wanted much, but settled for less","I guess casting is for the viewer like naming a new baby for the persons who meet the baby: one cant's compare what it sees to what might have been. The movie it is what it is with these here actors. But this movie just gave me the feeling of bad casting. The actors are too sturdy, too... something for their parts. Maybe it's the subject's fault, all that talking about adjustment made me wonder how would it have been if someone would have adjusted the cast.Besides this sensation, the idea is interesting, yet it fails to create an atmosphere, an universe. Matrix had that, for example. There are no important buildings, places, landscapes that would fix the cornerstones of such an universe. It's a miss.I also resented the sharing of human history in slices, out of which some were watched by these agents, others not. Sounded too manipulative, why assume again that the humans by themselves are bad and only guided by mysterious others can be better? Why not the other way, since it's fiction? The bad humans idea is so used that it's all worn out...I cannot compare it with the written story(never read it), so I will not judge the book from 1954, but the movie from 2011. And for this age, the ending is also a fail: announcing the winners like in a game show, talking about fighting for the free will, it's all so old and corny.We have the ""fabric of our universe"" idea, the ""guardians"" or ""watchers"" idea, the multiple choice destiny idea, not many of them logically explained, even in a fictional way.And what's with the hats? We have them at René Magritte, we have them in Fringe..now here. Anybody care to explain more about the hats obsession or symbolism?These being said, I had the impression of a movie who wanted much, but settled for less.",,Anonymous,Romance

"Tedius in parts, Great in others.","I saw this in the cinema when it came out in 2011, and 2018 I watch it for the second time. This I found it a little tedious, maybe it came across better in the cinema. Blunt/Damon chemistry was fabulous, Terence Stamp and John Slattery along with Anthony Mackie were the stand out actors. The story was not really that good, it was interesting toward the end with the hat and the doors etc. Maybe Blunt and Damon could have gone on the run a little earlier in the movie. I wouldn't want to see it again. That's enough now. Still decent movie but story lacking somewhat.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Lost In The Matrix Of Love,"""The Adjustment Bureau"" theorizes that the Earth is being controlled by a race of superhuman middle-aged men in magic fedoras. This premise could be absurd or frightening, but the movie plays without a trace of whimsy or horror. Instead, ""The Adjustment Bureau"" is like ""City of Angels"" and ""Ghost Town,"" a romantic fantasy about benign supernatural forces interacting with humans in New York (I'll let someone else make the facile pop-psychology analysis). The cosmology of the film is explained in a couple of quick expository scenes, and therefore not that interesting, and the special effects are pretty mundane -- the producers seem to have budgeted more for high-profile cameos (John Stewart keeps showing up, and Michael Bloomberg drops in for a montage) than CGI. And the acting is competent but for the most part unspectacular. Still, ""The Adjustment Bureau"" has its charms.Matt Damon plays a young New York congressman with no apparent party affiliation who discovers the Adjustment Bureau, an omnipotent but generally benevolent supernatural bureaucracy which guides human affairs -- kind of like a less malevolent CIA or more intrusive Google. How does Matt respond to this staggering metaphysical revelation? By obsessing over the fact that he's being kept from the girl of his dreams. And in fairness, that girl is pretty damn adorable -- Emily Blunt, as a charmingly impudent ballet dancer with a knock for short skirts and sharp quips. The hyper-romanticism of the plot makes it difficult to take ""The Adjustment Bureau"" all that seriously, and the epic scenes of men in suits and hats running through downtown Manhattan get a little boring after awhile. But Damon makes for a watchable if slightly inert man on a mission, like a less annoying Tom Cruise or slightly more animated Harrison Ford, and Blunt is outstanding as the unattainable object of desire. A bit more Blunt and ""The Adjustment Bureau"" could have been mesmerizing, but as is it's an okay movie that's worth adding to your Netflix queue if you like romance.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Awesome movie,"I was extremely enthralled with this movie. I went into it thinking I was settling down for a nice action movie. Boy was I surprised! It is a clever sci-fi movie. The acting was incredible and the script engaging. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a good story. It's not visually stunning and if your looking for some good explosions and fights scenes you will have to go some where else. That is what makes this movie great though. The don't relay on CGI to keep you interested. Don't get me wrong. The movie is well filmed. It isn't some cheesy B-rated movie. The value of this film lies in the script that is cleverly and skillfully executed by the amazing cast. It is well written, well acted, and just an overall good film.

fate free will......,"I expected nothing about this movie; I was sick, headache, and feels like my whole bone structure was falling apart You know, psychically ill. Well in such a day, go out for a movie probably could make me feel better. Ada chose the movie; I didn't even read through the introduction. The poster is kinda lame; a couple is running from something. And here comes the story, which is not really new at all; yet wears a quite new cloth. So, fun.Fate, do you believe it? Most people I know do believe. The fate brings people together, the destination leads our way; and what meant to be will comes to you eventually, if it isn't happen yet, it's just not the right moment yet How about free will? Well don't you think free will could be part of the fate as well? Well The emotion drives you to someone or to some dream; and the desire toward them, exactly, could be our fate.""The Adjustment Bureau"" is a new version of God and his Angles. Put it in an easy-understanding way: God (Chairman in the movie) planed our fate, for people who is important on the earth; and Angle (Officials who wear the hat) make certain adjustments in these VIP's daily life, to make sure their behaviors follow the plan; the old-school plot, you know, spill coffee to make you late from work, or in worse case, change your mind or the wost, reset your brain.The story is of course about free will, which suppose to against the fate. The guy who meant to be the Present of United States fall in love with a girl, who'd make him feel satisfied and no longer needs to be powerful or ambitious. They can't be together cause that would ruin the greater good for both of them.Well the guy discovers the Bureau and decides not to follow the plan, cause he really loves the girl and that is all he needs. (Wooo nice guy haa?) And the even more 0ld-school ending After all the risks they took, the Chairman decides to let them go, to change their plan, to fulfill their free will. And the whole thing is more like a test, to see if they could take every difficulties to be together. In another words, they are meant to be together, the God just need to be sure how strong the will is. Beauties walk on street with smile and happiness; END.Like I said, old-school plot Name few talk about the same thing Er, INK? Yeah bad guys who bring bad impressions and good guys bring the good staff, to make the hero change or keep go down to hell Blabla.. What else? Well, there are a lot, aren't they? = =~~ (Shamecan't remember any) Okay, no way I could think through the fate vs. free will thing These are words around us all the time: fate, destination, soul mate, plan for life, desire, emotion Oh C'mon, what is it? Do I have a destiny? Who is my soul-mate? Can it be like that, I randomly meet a person and I will easily spend the rest of my life with him? How can such thing happens from no where? Love is a long journey. It comes with compromise.It's a good thing though. If it comes, the Present of United States couldn't mean nothing. I believe that. : ) I don't care how much percent of this love is planed and how much is lead by my free will.http://luluning.wordpress.com",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Nothing better than meaningful sci-fi with gorgeous Matt Damon in it!,"I have not read the book but it apparently has had the best idea for a sci-fi movie that I have ever come across. I could not be more positively surprised! Matt Damon always works wonders with his acting but this movie is not only good because of his acting but also the storyline being written so creatively and the idea being executed so wonderfully. It exceeded my expectations in terms of the action/adventure side of it and the meaning it carries.There is not a single scene that is boring in this movie. The actors, the storyline, the visuals, everything is wonderful. The love shared between the characters feel so real as it should be, and the ending shakes your core and makes you question your life. A sci-fi could not be more meaningful than this. It deserves a much better rating than all those nonsense shows. Perhaps there are not enough people to see the message this movie is giving clearly and how important it is.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Cinematography/Editing Problem,"The movie is moderately exciting, and the acting is well done, but almost from the beginning. I was distracted by the scenes where the microphone was in shot. There were at least six scenes (possibly more - I quit counting) where the mike was visible, and not just a small piece of it.The number of occurrences of the mike in the shot increased to the point where I was watching the top of the frame more than the scene itself.This was obviously a fairly large budget movie, and there was really no excuse to have it drop to a Grade B because of the repetition of the same amateurish and easily correctable mistake.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Better than I expected,"I confess I liked this movie more than I expected to. While not being exactly profound, it is at least thoughtful. That is, while there are chase scenes and all, it never devolves into a mindless action flick, there's still a story going on and some actual ideas involved. And if it employs a ridiculously simplistic vision of history, at least it employs a vision of history. And I can never be too unhappy with a movie that comes down on the side of the Enlightenment!But I confess that what I really liked was the romance. Chemistry is a funny thing, I guess, and I've seen reviews here which claimed that the two leads didn't have it. But that was not my experience. I definitely felt the two protagonists belonging together and was pulling for the romance throughout. Since I left the theater I keep thinking about sharing this film with my overseas girlfriend, so I guess that's pretty romantic. :)A masterpiece? Maybe not. But I definitely felt it was two hours well spent, which is rare enough these days.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
good but.......,"I am still kind of unsure about this movie. I saw i last night and I liked it. Good suspense, good acting, interesting plot. However... There are a lot of weird things in the movie that then never really explain. Like the hats...What was up with that, seems stupid, why use a hat to control these beings(?) Why not something that they cant just take of, and why not something that that doesn't make them look like members of a bad boyband. Same with the water, they don't explain that either, just that it makes them not function fully.And the religious undertones where just to much. And that is something that i personally kills a movie. And the question ""Are you angels?"" just came out of nowhere and changed the entire movie. Up until that point i really liked the movie, after that question I could not think about anything but the religious undertones.I just had to get that of my chest, sorry.Good movie with some mumbo jumbo bullshit packed into it.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Damon and Blunt have amazing chemistry and the supporting cast is fantastic. Mackie, Slattery and Stamp bring wonderfully- written three-dimensional characters to life. Also, I loved the fact that it's a sci-fi movie without a bunch of gadgets - just hats!

Amazing!,"The Adjustment Bureau: Incredible movie showing you about how the free choice we have is relative when you are in a mission, when you have a purpose, and how everything is orchestrated for us in the Universe. This is not science fiction. This movie is really a documentary. The movie shows you how everything is planned and some things are not coincidences at all. It is interesting the fact that the story (originally written by Philip K. Dick) was first published on 1954. That's a proof that many years ago people were already wondering about the influence of the Universe in our lives. I truly recommend it to all my students",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Goodish,"I say this with just about every actor, but I love Matt Damon! I wouldn't consider myself an Emily Blunt ""fan"" but I have nothing against her. Matt Damon is a politician that sees the ""Adjustment Bureau"" and falls in love with Emily Blunt, but is never supposed to ever see her again I went into this movie thinking it would be a high action,edge of your seat, thriller. I was wrong. I would say the movie is 75% romance and 25% action/thriller, so I think that kind of disappointed me. I have nothing against romance movies, but I was just a bit let down by this one. Another problem I had with The Adjustment Bureau was that a lot of the dialogue was cheesy , for example, ""I need you to trust me."" Although, I wasn't too big of a fan of The Adjustment Bureau the acting was great from every actor and the effects were very well done. If you did not know 2011 set the record for the most sequels ever, with 27 sequels, so it was great to see an original storyline . Final Summary: A romantic thriller that could use some work. I went into this movie with very high expectations and was unfortunately let down . The Adjustment Bureau is not bad, but unfortunately not too good either.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A film for romance enthusiasts,"Some may be mistaken, but The Adjustment Bureau is more a romantic thriller than a science fiction picture. In that respect, that is, when judged as a romance film, the film succeeds well. It does so on the back of two convincing performances from Emily Blunt and Matt Damon. The passion, the intensity, and the chemistry the two share on screen is palpable. As two young people with promising futures ahead of them, they act well. Their reactions always appropriate, and their bond immensely persuasive. The effectiveness of their portrayal is also helped by a script that is sharper and wittier than usual. But perhaps the films great flaw is that its science fiction elements are overly nebulous and not well defined enough. It has a story which plays with themes like fate and destiny but it never fully fleshes out these themes. The story also has contradictions in its sci-fi world, probably an inescapable flaw whenever a film tries to play with such complex philosophical ideas. The films ending is also unnecessarily abrupt and its mid section a tad sluggish. One's enjoyment of this film can hence be predicted according to the genre of film they enjoy. People who enjoy picking apart at science fiction films, those who like the world building and the mechanics of the science fiction devices contained in such stories- they would be disappointed at The Adjustment bureau. But I have never liked sci-fi films, and could never really care for its complicated elements. So, if like me, you enjoy a good, passionate romance story, and you just want to be taken for a ride, then The Adjustment Bureau is an excellent film which would hold your attention well.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
More intelligent than you would expect,"I've been holding out on watching this movie simply because i thought it was clichéd. And I've had my fill of Hollywood making such abysmal movies these days (or is it for years) that I've been sticking to watching European and Korean films, they've got much more grit. But this Hollywood installment is actually very good and a thought provoking ending makes it that much better.Production: In early drafts, the character Norris was changed from a real estate salesman, as in the short story, to an up-and-coming politician.[9] Media Rights Capital funded the film and then auctioned it to distributors, with Universal Studios putting in the winning bid for $62 million.[4][10] Variety reported Damon's involvement on February 24, 2009,[3] and Blunt's on July 14, 2009.[4] The film was released on March 4, 2011.[11] Nolfi worked with John Toll as his cinematographer. Shots were planned in advance with storyboards but changed often during shooting to fit the conditions of the day. The visual plan for the film was to keep the camera-work smooth using a dolly or crane and have controlled formal shots when the Adjustment Bureau was in full control, with things becoming more loose and using hand-held cameras when the story becomes less controlled.[12] The final scene (on the rooftop of the GE Building in Rockefeller Center (""Top of the Rock"") was filmed four months after the rest of the film had completed shooting and has a different ending than the original.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Adjustment Bureau (2011),"Directed by George Nolfi. Starring Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Anthony Mackie, Michael Kelly, John Slattery, Terence Stamp, Donnie Keshawarz, Anthony Ruivivar. (PG-13)New York politician Damon has a ""meet cute"" with winsome dancer Blunt and an infatuation sets in; however, the powers that be (in this case, a mysterious, otherworldly group called the Adjustment Bureau) cannot allow him to pursue a romance, and will do whatever it takes to keep them apart. Intriguing setup, with a well-matched pair of likable performers in Damon and Blunt, though the script often glosses over the most stimulating aspects of its existential premise to get back to more conventional storytelling devices--metaphysical implications be damned so long as two attractive people fall in love. Despite some nifty camera tricks and special effects allowing Damon to get from Yankee Stadium to the Statue of Liberty in seconds, the climactic chase lacks the visceral excitement and/or the colossal weight of free will decision it ought to have tried achieving. Liberally adapted from the Philip K. Dick tunnel-under-the-world short story ""Adjustment Team.""

"A unconventional love story that is thought-provoking, well acted, and extremely entertaining.","The Adjustment Bureau stars Matt Damon, as David Norris, an up and coming congressman of New York, and Emily Blunt, as Elise Sellas, a rising professional dancer. The story follows David, who is in the middle of campaigning for a Senator seat for New York, and on the night of the election he finds that he has lost and must deliver his concession speech. When he stops into the bathroom he unexpectedly runs into Elise, who is hiding from security because she was caught crashing a wedding in the same hotel, they immediately feel something strong for each other. We are also introduced to the mysterious group of men that are always watching behind the scenes, with notebooks, business clothes from the 60s, and most importantly a fedora. Without going into too much detail about who they are and what they do, because that would really ruin a pretty fun and intriguing part of the whole story, they essentially make sure that everything goes as planned (Every person has a certain path, and their job is to make sure everyone stays on course. There are strong religious themes here however the film does a pretty good job I think of addressing those themes). However because of a mistake from one of their own, David is shown their world and was never suppose to see Elise after the night of his concession speech thus creating the motivating drive of the film.George Nolfi has shown that he can both write and direct, mostly direct, an intriguing, well made film with power house stars like Damon and Blunt. His direction of New York City is very well done, and he really excels with the many on-foot chase sequences throughout the film. Where he really shows his strengths however is in the dialogue between Damon and Blunt. It's extremely witty and humorous, with a touch of romance and his words are brought to life brilliantly by his two lead actors. All the while he intertwines the love story with the science fiction aspect of the Adjustment Bureau and the mystery surrounding this powerful, all seeing, all controlling group.The cast is excellent and I can't picture anyone else in the roles of David Norris or Elise Sellas. The simple dialogue scenes between these two are just as entertaining, if not better, than the suspenseful and/or action packed scenes throughout the film. Damon is great, but no real surprise there. And Blunt was right up there with him, now if that's because I'm in awe of her sheer beauty with an accent to top it off, I cant really say, but I thought she was great none the less.Overall it's a very good film and one of the better stories that have come along since Inception (unfortunately Nolfi can't be credited for an original story here because he based it on Philip K. Dick's short story). My only real problem with the film that I didn't like was the ending, which is pretty unfortunate because up until that point it was almost flawless. It's a bit anti climatic, however I can't see how you would end it any other way and have it still work with the overall story. Bottom line though, the film really makes you think about the idea of fate versus choice and if we really have a say in our future. Whether you believe in a higher power or not, these ideas are prevalent and will always be an important topic to discuss and the film does a pretty good job of asking questions and giving some answers while also leaving enough open for discussion. All in all it's the perfect film for all audience's, both male and female, young or old and one that relies more on it's acting and story than it's special effects like most film now a days, and that in itself is something worth seeing.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"An odd romantic story, with some mystery/sciencefiction elements. Watchable because of the wonderful actors, good direction and a lovely romantic feel good vibe.","Story wise this movie has got a very odd combination of a sci-fi / mystery story, an action story and a romantic story. In the end it is nothing in particular and it is a bit of everything. Still a pleasurable watch though. The story? Well, Matt Damon falls in love with Emily Blunt, but a certain futuristic organisation specialised in mindcontrol wants to prevent these 2 from falling in love with each other, because it would cause a ""ripple effect"" in history. Will they become lovers anyway, despite the odds against them, or wont they?Yes, I know, this story sounds silly and it is and I had my trepidations, but this rather silly story is executed in a reasonably enjoyable fashion. And what appears to be silly or weird at the beginning, starts to make sense in the end. (Cant reveal any spoilers). I guess this movie was marketed at a younger audience, because of the lovely romantic story AND because of the lack of any violence or swearing.End conclusion: mixed bag. Certainly not bad, yet nothing terrific either. It toddles along nicely, entertaining me from beginning to end. Some might find the story ridiculous and annoying.

Behind every door...,"Sic-fi isn't quite my thing and much of this movie had me thinking of the several related cinematic reference points along the way (for starters, ""A Matter of Life And Death"", ""Terminator 2"", even TV shows like ""Heroes"" and ""Sapphire And Steel"", all of which adapt the notion of circular time to re-write the future. The difference here is that, in this film, our destinies are apparently controlled by peripheral men just out of our vision, wearing hats.Trust Matt Damon's rising young senator to buck the tend by falling coincidentally for modern dancer Emily Blunt, thus rewriting the future time-line of his would-be presidential character as well as Blunt's ascent to the top of her chosen profession as a top choreographer. Their love affair isn't part of the plan you see and the film posits the age-old question ""can true love conquer all?"", although to be fair, the ending is never really in doubt.There was some stuff I liked in the film, the two leads, Damon and Blunt seem to bind together effectively, the story skips along pacify and some of the shots of modern day New York are impressive.Against this I wasn't quite sure with which story the director was happiest, the romantic drama of Damon and Blunt's burgeoning romance, the race around town at the end as Damon seeks to avoid having his mind erased of all his memories or just the trip around NewYork's major tourist attractions, entered through every different door the fleeing couple run through.Perhaps the film could could have implied the danger-factor more to give a bit more reason for all the running around - Damon must cover as much ground here as Tom Cruise did in the Firm.All in all though, the movie was an entertaining diversion, reasonably imaginative if lacking a little in tension to make it more compelling.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Big Brother is Watching,"Story of a young politician who decides to take fate into his own hands after meeting a ballet dancer.Emily Blunt & Matt Damon are electric as they fight for what they want. They each reflect something about society and how our relationships impact our lives.With danger from a supernatural force, the tension builds to create something entertaining & meaningful.

"Not too deep, but not too dull, either.","I saw this as an in-flight, and I usually don't like to review something that I can be sure was edited, but I don't think the airline version is all that different from what played in theaters.This is a good, solid film. When Damon first broke through, I thought he'd be a lightweight, but he's proving to have some gravity (not to say that he gets the Oscar for this, but he does turn in a good performance). I like Blunt more, each time I'm exposed to her work (she was great in Sunshine Cleaning, and her appearance on The Simpsons made for a good ""Lisa episode""); here, she is an appealing, bohemian sophisticate. No actor's effort steals the show, but everyone did a fine job.The various members of the Bureau themselves convey an enjoyable blend of (1) the agents of the Matrix films, (2) the angels of City of Angels, and (3) the exhausted functionaries of the MIB, or a le Carre spy novel - I thought that the screenplay did a pretty good job of preserving their mystique.The story itself was intriguing, and the sort that I always enjoy (the ""hidden reality behind reality"" films, and the ""free will vs. fated"" stuff). I would have liked to have seen more rumination on the free will vs. fated, but with that, I guess it gets boring for the masses. Also, I thought that there were minor logic lapses (but when you have the main characters in your story go through the looking glass, you get to dictate how/what they'll think/do). The end wraps up neatly. Maybe a little too neatly?All in all, it's a good one. See it.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Adjustment Bureau,"Quote what Emily Blunt's Elise Sellas rightly said in the film ""I think I'm not a romantic type"". So am I, adapted from a short story from Sci-Fi mogul Philip K. Dick, The Adjustment Bureau is a more lovey-dovey type than a Sci-Fi saga, maybe in another term, it is a straightforward romantic-chick flick camouflaging with a soft Sci-Fi shroud, (compared with it, SOURCE CODE 2011,is way more hardcore and theoretically compelling).It's kinds funny to see all the hat-men from bureau engage themselves into the break-up mission with meticulous deadpan, which against the fact that the director clearly has no intention to elaborate the so-called butterfly effect or chaos theory plan. (Thompson, Terence Stamp's character, states that the bureau has been manipulated the globe since thousands years ago, WWI and WWII are the exclusive gaps when they were experimenting on human beings to run the world themselves, what a portentous bluff! We all should thank bureau to stop the war and question what the hell is the 2012 doom then?).One merit pops up is the strong affection between two leads, despite of Matt Damon's wooden face, neither Matt nor Emily excels in playing lovebirds (cf. Matt Damon in ALL THE PRETTY HORSES 2000, with an alluring Penelope Cruz). This time, with the help of the random doors, their engagement intensifies and we are not allowed to ruminate during a spate of space travels (not so original though, cf. JUMPER 2008).As a novice in the director field, the screenplay writer of THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM (2007) George Nolfi took the thorny task to both direct the film and write the screenplay, the result could be worse, I must say, with visual swiftness and an Utopian concession to romantics, at least he has aimed right on target.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Starts well and then......,"I give this 7 because I am beginning to really like Matt Damon's work and I already love Emily Blunt. The premise of this film is superb and intriguing in the first instance and while the viewer is still trying to work out what is going on I would say it is riveting. Even when one becomes aware of the situation it still works really well. Towards the end of the movie the pace slackens and the story becomes rather hackneyed, leading to a damp squib of an ending. Maybe hanging the whole story on the romance rather than the political angle should have been switched around and it really could have gone somewhere. Overall I can say it held my interest and I enjoyed it, but it could have been so much better with tighter writing and direction and a different emphasis. Blunt and Damon were as good as they could be given the script and they had chemistry, on which the story depended.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Heartwarming Entertainment,"""The Adjustment Bureau"" is about the conflict between free will and predestination, and right there, you have the whole dilemma of life, don't you? Either it makes a difference what you choose to do, or the book had already been written, and all you can do is turn the pages.The plot develops into a cat-and-mouse game of the mind, in which David and Elise, in love and feeling as if they're destined for each other, try to outsmart or elude the men in the suits and hats. This is fun, and because Matt Damon and Emily Blunt have an easy rapport, it doesn't seem as preposterous as it is. Beneath its apparent sci-fi levels, a romantic comedy lurks here.""The Adjustment Bureau"" is a smart and good movie that could have been a great one if it had a little more daring. I suspect the filmmakers were reluctant to follow its implications too far. What David and Elise signify by their adventures, I think, is that we're all in this together, and we're all on our own. If you follow that through, the implications are treacherous to some, not all, religions. In the short term, however, the movie is a sort of heartwarming entertainment.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Entertaining for everyone,"Do we control our destiny, or do unseen forces manipulate us? Matt Damon stars in this thriller as a man who accidentally comes across what his future has planned for him and realizes he wants something else. To get it, he must pursue the only woman he's ever loved across, under and through the streets of modern-day New York. On the brink of winning a seat in the U.S. Senate, ambitious politician David Norris (Damon) meets beautiful contemporary ballet dancer Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt)-who he immediately falls in love with. But just as he realizes this, mysterious men (the adjustment bureau) work to keep the two apart for the sake of the plan. In the face of overwhelming odds, he must either let her go and accept a predetermined path I've been waiting for a movie like this to come out for years. If there really is a plan for me, why is it necessary to factor in a 15-minute period where I can't find my keys or I spill coffee on myself and I have to go home and change? What's the point of it all!?! This flick gives you a fun theory as to why; a highly improbable one, but also a thought provoking one. When I watched it, I kept asking myself, ""How did it take so long for a movie like this to come out?"" Sure, it's a little far fetched, but fun never the less! Matt Damon and Emily Blunt have great on-screen chemistry, and this truly makes the rather sloppy narrative more believable. This film's got it all—romance, mystery, drama, and even a wee bit of comedy, but I feel the romantics will love it the most. However, I was rather disappointed with its unchallenging ending. Despite God's plan, maybe, JUST MAYBE, love conquers all.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Fated to be average at best.,"I had high, high hopes for The Adjustment Bureau. Emily Blunt and Matt Damon are both among my favorite actors, and early inklings of the plot made it seem similar to Dark City in all the right ways. Two desperate lovers being kept apart by a shadowy, powerful group that seems to hold the reigns of fate, itself.Those high hopes were not realized. The Adjustment Bureau is by no means a bad movie, but it's just so ordinary and unimaginative that it comes off as a watered-down love story/thriller instead of the exciting, tense struggle it could have been. Damon and (especially) Blunt aren't really given anything substantial to do. There's an interesting sequence or two near the end, but the rest of the movie is so pedestrian that the fantastical premise is mostly wasted.See it if you are a fan of the leads, but don't expect more than a very standard thriller with little sense of tension or depth.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Better than the trailer makes it look!,"I saw the trailer to the Adjustment Bureau and thought it looked more like a romantic drama! Luckily, for the story, the romance part of it isn't the central theme and it's even necessary to the story.Matt Damon is the youngest man trying to be elected as a Senator in the American elections. Before he's due to give an important speech, he bumps into a lady (Emily Blunt) who he falls for. However, apparently he was never meant to meet her and there are sinister powers who will go to any lengths to stop them ever meeting again.The front cover of the film sums it up as 'The Boune Identify meets Inception.' Yes, I couldn't put it much better than that. It's a chase film with Matt Damon and Emily Blunt being pursued by people (albeit sci-fi baddies rather than moral government agents) and trying to sort the mess out.If you like chase films or sci-fi, give it a go. There's no Oscar winning performances here, but there is a lot of fun and , without giving away too much of the plot, it's a good overall premise which gives you enough questions to talk about after the credits have rolled.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Poor attempt,"Well I could go in to minute detail but simply this film really fails to deliver on its hype as a hybrid love child of the Bourne Films and Inception.the whole story line suggests that your life is laid out for you and basically you are on a set path with the look of free will, with chaps in hats running around by the thousand jumping through doors.what a deity needs with riot police I don't know?.put simply I looked forward to the film and watched it but in the end it really fails to cross any new boundary in film ideas, even as a romantic film the only thing it captures reasonably well was a fleeting moment between strangers that you remember for years, other than that thumbs down from me.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

Wasted opportunities,"A film that starts out well with great acting from both Damon and his love interest in the film played by Emily Blunt. With an interesting premise in which Damon uncovers a group of people running the show on Earth from an alternate dimension, the film however quickly turns for the worst with Sesame Street caliber turns of plot which are so inane one wonders if they intended to make a comedy. With a steal from The Matrix here and a pinch from The Thirteenth Floor and Man in Black there, Adjustment Bureau just becomes annoying to watch after a while. The romantic scenes with Damon and Blunt seem to drag more and more as the film progresses and fail to add to the mystery or any other aspect of the story.4/10",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
An unexpected philosophical masterpiece!,"In the beginning of The Adjustment Bureau you see, David, Matt Damon's character run for election. It's kind of a lighthearted moment. These moments come and go throughout the film adding to it's dynamics and making it more than another conspiracy thriller a la' Bourne Identity or Taken.As The Adjustment Bureau moves on it unwinds into a stunning work of art sometimes churning out cheesy moments but rarely, in exchange for romantic desire and philosophical mind bending, along with occasional action.Matt Damon and Emily Blunt perform their very best as usual. They seem destined to be together despite what seems like a whole universe keeping them apart. The array of Adjustment characters are also remarkable and are not too pretentious (though it get's close, they we're chosen wisely).Also Anthony Mackie plays his character gracefully while pushing the film above average for a great story with a wide array of good characters.

Worth the ticket $,"I live in Vietnam, and the ticket to see a movie in the cinema I went to wasn't exactly cheap, so when I say it's worth the ticket, it's WORTH the ticket. Now, onto the actual review, lol: I had been wanting to see this movie ever since I saw the trailer last year, so I had relatively high expectations. It definitely lived up to those expectations. It had everything I liked, action, thriller, sci-fi, Emily Blunt (and her English accent, obviously) and romance all into one package. The two leads had great chemistry and the whole cast performed really well.The storyline was original, and while the ending I felt was a little weak and cheesy, I was hoping it would have been kept a little more open, but that's just me. The logic and rules set up were quite well thought out though, and the the two main characters will most likely have you rooting for them.Overall, I'd definitely recommend everyone to see this movie if you like action sci-fi romance type films, or if you want a good 2 hours worth of entertainment",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A small movie feel from a big budget romance sci-fi,"I liked this one; it was a little different, with an intelligent and unique script and small movie feel despite the calibre of actors and available budget involved. Matt Damon & Emily Blunt take the leads here and have genuine chemistry together, they were a treat to watch interact.At the core this is a love story but it's also thought provoking, do we really control our own destiny? and stylish (loved the 50's vibe from the bureau men and their magic hats). I would also call it action-ish without breaking form and going all over the top with explosions and CGI. There is a fantastic, on foot chase scene towards the end. The love story was well done too, believable as was 'David's' reaction to learning of the adjustment bureau. I really liked Anthony Mackie who played the adjuster with a heart.The story follows rising politician David Norris, who learns that his life (and that of space and time in general) is and has been adjusted in order to keep him away from a beautiful dancer -the love of his life. These mysterious men have been grooming David to be the next president of the United States and will do everything in their considerable power to prevent him and Elise from being together.The movie spans several years and I will definitely watch it again some day. 5/10/15",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
This is so good I dunno where to start,"What can I say? This is how a movie should be like. The best thing with this movie is how it applies relativity to the settings. Free from moralism and exaggerated evil archetype antagonists. Another example of relativity is how the action scenes are free from exaggeration but still keeps intensity.The story is smart, irrefutable and consistent, and even though it bears a strong metaphysical tone it is open to most religious beliefs (not including atheism) unlike many movies, with this kind of genre, which usually refers to some type of Christianity.The chemistry between the main characters really does it.

To be Blunt it is just fun to experience,"Based on the short story ""Adjustment Team"" by Philip K. Dick and adjusted for the big screen by George Nolfi, this is one fun chase scene after another. If you look further into the story, you can find layers of deeper meaning which are thinly veiled from the viewer. However, the superficial story of lovers destined to be together and assisted by friends from another reality is quite enough to carry this movie.Looking closely at this film you will notice that many of the people are not actors there, actually politicians and other famous people. However, the filmmakers selected just the right actors to play the characters and the actors do not overwhelm the characters they are playing; so, you imagine yourself as part of the story and find yourself kibitzing.I missed this at the theater but did pick it up on Blu-ray and the DVD that I watched witch had a few interesting extras such as:

Damon and Blunt: like gin and vermouth,"Have you ever wondered how your life might have turned out if you had made certain decisions differently in your life, such as taking a job, moving to another town, taken the second streetcar instead of the first.

The protagonists, Matt Damon and Emily Blunt are the stars of this entertaining film and they immediately light up the screen and the storyline when they meet by chance in a New York hotel. Damon and Blunt go together like gin and vermouth, and they make this sci-fi story much better than it has a right to be. The rest of the cast is good, including Mad Men actor John Slatterly as one of the ""adjusters"". If you like comedy/drama mixed in with a love story and science fiction, this may be the movie for you. It is a movie men and women will enjoy and is a great date night movie. It doesn't hit on all cylinders for the entire movie but the times when Damon and Blunt are together make up for that. There are some interesting twists in this movie which add to the entertainment value. This movie also features most of the scenic attractions in New York City which is an added attraction. And as with any science fiction movie you need to suspend logic at the door when you walk in the theater, but nonetheless, this is a well put together story with a logical ending for a sci-fi flick.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Pseudo-religious philosophy for Tweens,"This is a try-hard The Matrix or Inception, but not nearly as good as either. Those films were good because they had intrigue, action, special effects, originality and chemistry between characters.The flaws and inadequacies in this film are too many to be noted. Damon is a solid actor but the good acting begins and ends with Damon. The premise is not enough to hold the film and is not fleshed out enough to be either believable or engaging.The thinly veiled religious tilt was more annoying than the Narnia chronicles.

Thank GOD it is 2011 and there are adult films to watch,"I am always intrigued that my favorite time of year for movies in the last few years is the brief time right after the Academy Awards when some amazing and surprising movies suddenly emerge. I skipped Black Swan, True Grit and the rest because the whole thing just bored me to tears. The award show itself was amazingly and shockingly an utter snooze. But wait- get out of the house and the studios are releasing films that got bumped by the pompous pap of award season and are actually fun, entertaining and real cinema experiences. Which brings me to The Adjustment Bureau. I saw this in a packed theater full of people hungry for a real movie, and they were not disappointed. Even though the MATRIX and some other blockbuster type sci-fi films have attempted to kill the genre completely with their bombastic special effects over kill, nothing should stop you from enjoying this little gem of a film. Shot in glorious color, the film uses NYC as a setting. This in itself is a cinematic tour de force that will keep any true movie fan glued to the screen, trying the guess the actual settings. And even though a number of elements are slightly off kilter including the chemistry between the two leads, there is a quiet and beautiful poetry to almost every scene. What it boils down to is that you have to admire the guts of a movie that can go this route in the wake of similar films with massive budgets and a lot more techno blitz. This film can take a simple scene in a parking garage and meld it to a plot line that has just enough Dickinson twists to make it all worth our time. I just have to say ""praise the lord and pass the popcorn."" One more award season is shot to hell and now the fun begins. If you miss this you miss the true ""awards"" real cinema fans live for.

There is quite a but of religious undertones, being that the movie is about how your life has a ""plan made by the Creator"", but it is in no way a religious themed movie. Much like ""Inception"" this is a dramatic/sci-fi/thriller, and it seems like this may be a new genre and type of movie that will continue to be made. I am OK with that. A great cast adds to the enjoyment of the movie and this is one that will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout. Overall I would say if you liked ""Inception"" you will love this one.

Taking a Former Sci Fi Idea and Making It Better,"6 March 2011. Sometimes an idea and a sequel that's not a sequel gets better with time and THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU does just that. With strong elements from ""A Matter of Time,"" an episode of the contemporary THE TWILIGHT ZONE (January 26, 1986), MEN IN BLACK (1997), THE TRUMAN SHOW (1998,)THE MATRIX (1999), BEING JOHN MALKOVICH (1999), and ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND (2004), the movie script adapted from the amazing mind of the late Philip K. Dick's short story (whose written work inspired - A Scanner Darkly, 2006; Paycheck, 2003; Minority Report, 2002; Total Recall, 1990; Bladerunner, 1982) brings together the often times human element that is only experienced as a supporting role but in this movie is made the central element in this movie.The beginning scenes, especially with the John Slattery's character having an uneven tone between dramatic and wry humor, seem to almost take its manipulative premise almost too well and comes across just a scripted and manipulative for the audience as the characters in the movie itself. The Wil Smith character-look-a-like also is a bit distracting and his role in the movie seems a bit too obviously interfering and distracting somehow taking a little away from the totality of the movie's suspended authenticity.Overall though, this movie quickly merges into a finely honed character-driven, emotive and compelling dramatic thriller and allows its principal characters to show the audience (us) in a fantasy in a fantasy of how we ourselves would like to see ourselves. A genuinely solid and qualitatively superior film follows in the footsteps of THE SOLOIST (2009); THE TRUMAN SHOW (1998); CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND (1977); Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004); Twelve Monkeys (1996); The Bourne Identity (2002); The Cooler (2003); Brazil (1985); Blade Runner (1982), Inception (2010), and Nomads (1986).",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Who Would have thought that the best romantic film of 2011 was a Science-Fiction Film?,"¨All I have are the choices I make, and I choose her, come what may.¨ Ever since Adam and Eve we've never liked to be told what to do, but what would happen if all our decisions were somehow manipulated by some sort of power to make us act in a certain way without us not even realizing it? In other words, we think we have free will and we believe we make our own choices, but what if someone was making small adjustments behind our backs to make sure we followed a certain path? Those are the questions The Adjustment Bureau raises in this science-fiction romantic movie. Rookie director, George Nolfi (known for writing Ocean's Twelve and adapting the screenplay for The Bourne Ultimatum), does a great job at combining two unrelated genres such as science-fiction and romance and meshing them together to create this thought provoking film. The Adjustment Bureau is without a doubt the best romantic film I've seen this year (and I never expected to be saying this after watching the trailers for this movie). The film is actually based on a short story written by Phillip K. Dick (who is better known for his other short story ¨Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? ¨ which was adapted into a movie you might have heard of: Blade Runner). The movie is not perfect, but I enjoyed every second of it thanks to the great chemistry between Matt Damon and Emily Blunt. There is just something about forbidden love that makes you root for both these characters because it somehow feels wrong that outside forces can be a factor in their lives. Any normal human being would understand that these two people were meant for each other.Matt Damon plays a young politician named David Norris, running for Senator in New York. On election night while he is preparing his defeat speech he runs into Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt) in the men's restroom. There is a strong instant chemistry between them and they share a passionate kiss together, but are suddenly interrupted by security guards who were looking for Elise because she got caught crashing a wedding in the same building. David is so inspired by the kiss that he gives one of his best and most authentic speeches ever, but he can't stop thinking of Elise. Everything isn't what it seems and there are some mysterious people behind the scenes making sure everyone is following the right path. Richardson (John Slattery) and Harry (Anthony Mackie) have been following David everywhere and seem to know what decisions he is going to make and they try to manipulate them. We later find out that they work for a mysterious agency known as the Adjustment Bureau, who make adjustments in order to keep people on track so they won't deviate from the intended plan. David and Elise are not intended to be with each other, it isn't written on the books for them so Harry is ordered to keep him away from her so he will continue on the ¨right path.¨ Something goes wrong and the two meet again, only this time the agents have to make amends and end up telling David who they really are. David isn't willing to go along with the plan because he believes in free will, so the agency has to bring out their big gun, Thompson (Terence Stamp), in order for the pair to break up. The question now is: can love conquer predestination? The movie isn't deep, but it does manage to leave you thinking quite a bit, and that is always a plus. This could be called the Inception for couples although it is a much lighter movie, but it is way better than most romantic films that have come out recently. It is original and intense. It also raises questions about free will, fate, soul mates, and predestination. We'd like to believe that all our decisions are based entirely on our free will, but even we admit that sometimes coincidences take place: for example we get on the wrong bus and run into someone we haven't seen in a long time. The Adjustment Bureau claims these ¨accidents¨ are actually planned most of the time and they serve to keep their subjects on the right path in order to fulfill their purpose. David is willing to fight this system, like any other human would because we can't accept the fact that our destinies are already predetermined. He discovers that love after all does conquer all things. The success of the movie doesn't actually rely on trying to answer the question whether or not we control our destiny or if we are manipulated by outside forces, the true success of the film relies on the chemistry between Damon and Blunt. The two of them are great together, and the film worked better for me at this romantic level than it did with all the science fiction. I absolutely recommend this movie.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Love the chemistry!,"Bruh the chemistry between Matt damon & emily blunt is through the roof. Love love love how they're portraying these characters and the emotions they're conveying is uuuuhh heart clenching.

Never thought a day would come when I would sigh thinking about Matt damon. He's such a bae in this role.Im not gonna get too far explaining the plot of this movie, its a romance mixed with science fiction, the two main characters are being kept apart because of the 'plan' and whatnot by the 'bureau/angel/mib'. I love the science fiction part and also love the romance part.But the main pull in this movie was most definitely the two lead, big props once again for Matt damon & emily blunt.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
I did not buy the romance,"Sorry but Matt is not a good choice for being a Romeo who gives up politics for his love of his life.. I don't buy it, and all the romantic scenes flaws very badly, no electric between the boy and the girl, and no any romance.. So since they do not suggest a deep love, I do not buy the rest, either. In my opinion, for example Richard Gere would suit this movie much better.. he is a better actor in terms of showing his feelings. He might make this one a deeper movie. Don't think that I don't like Matt, he is a better actor for action adventure movies. I love his spy movies, but come on, this movie, the story is built up on a deep lovers who can not reach out, and if you cant show it, then the movie collapses.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Love: Simply Fate,"Finally, an original take on the over done love story about boy meets girl, boy can't be with girl, boy does what ever it takes to be with girl. There is a twist this time around concerning an uncontrollable higher power as boy redefines the meaning of giving up everything. Writer Director George Nolfi (Writer, ""The Bourne Ultimatum"") creates another thrilling screenplay with its roots coming from a short story called the ""Adjustment Team,"" written by Philip K. Dick starring Matt Damon (""Hereafter"") and Emily Blunt (""The Young Victoria""). Damon plays a party hard young man named David Norris who grows up to become a very famous politician with a heartbreak past. Norris is destined for greatness, however, after leading the senate race for New York state he loses leading him to the one place on earth that he can relax and be alone, the bathroom. After practicing his losing speech supported by very well crafted film editing, he meets a woman named Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt). After kissing her he is inspired to give the best speech he has ever given making him the front-runner for the next election. He feels as if he is destined to be with Elise, but does not have anyway to keep in contact with her. He tries his hardest to see her again, but what he does not realize is that there is a greater force at power concerning a group known as the Adjustment Bureau. Why can't he be with Elise and how far will he go to be with her? ""The Adjustment Bureau is a supernatural, spiritual, religious thriller about mastering ones fate at any cost.Besides being very well written and original ""The Adjustment Bureau"" is just a really cool movie. It is a love story that guys have no excuse to not go to with their girlfriends, because it is much more than that. First of all Matt Damon, the king of thrillers most well known for the ""Bourne Trilogy"", stars in the film in which he is essentially on his own against fate. The ever so talented Emily Blunt is lovely to watch on screen as well with her good looks and superb acting ability, making a very well acted film. The Adjustment Bureau itself was very well depicted revealing just enough of their secrets, while leaving room for plenty of mystery. All of them also look awesome with because of their characterization and costumes (hats and overcoats). A simple yet very complicated and deep film is produced leaving you to even understand your life a little better.The shortcomings in this film can be attributed to minor details. The film does its best to be simple, but at certain points unexplainable incongruities appear that contradict other explanations. However, these shortcomings aren't big enough to hurt the film. Other complaints may stem from the films preachy religious ending that may be a let down for some audiences.""The Adjustment Bureau"" is a part of a release weekend marking the beginning of good 2011 films. It is a different kind of love story that does not necessarily have a bad guy and a good guy simply about a man and a woman who want to be with each other. Is it fate? After leaving the theater you may even think that you were meant to see the film.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
What a movie!!,"Even though of course and it could have been better or could have lasted a little bit more, i have to admit that it was breathtaking. It shows the war between freedom and control. How far should each part reach and if balance between them is the answer to a better society. Control runs through secrets and adjustments, and freedom through free will, AKA ""randomness"" maybe..
But the problem i sense with free will is that humans aren't geniuses and gods, we make mistakes in silly things, so the decisions we make in our everyday life must be based on the things and small details we interact with all the time and not in some imaginary and unknown power, that by the way we have created it's meaning. It's like believing in a god, a concept we have created and we embrace without giving an explanation.Thinking and imagining is the most amazing and ''out of this world'' thing we can do, but when it comes to making it something real without any proof, then it's just like behaving as a child, without thinking hard!
We must let our imagination free, but not force it becoming something real without any scientific proof..",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
I don't know what I really should have expected...,"So I started watching this movie thinking that it was going to be some kind of cool new Bourne Identity type flick (mostly because of the Matt Damon aspect) and ended up getting some kind of weird romance/thriller/Christian allegory instead. My girlfriend got bored and stole my phone to play bejeweled about 10 minutes in. I wish I would have had the idea first, as to not have to wade through the sea of awful corniness and cringe moments that appeared in front of me. Nothing is really explained the entire film. The time references between scenes (3 years, 11 months) make no sense and add nothing to the story. The movie isn't exactly bad, just kind of stupid. Hence the 5 star rating.

Science fiction that places humanity above high concept,"The best science fiction is often the kind that doesn't feel like science fiction at all. Almost always, the genre's most lauded stories and films earn that praise for never losing their human qualities in the face of elaborate story structure, futuristic props and set pieces and stylish action. That's why Hollywood so often returns to the work of Philip K. Dick, a master of idea-based science fiction. Screenwriter George Nolfi makes his directing debut with an adaptation of Dick's ""Adjustment Team,"" a story that possesses a true human factor that Nolfi weaves up through the concept's intricacies and to the surface.""The Adjustment Bureau"" lacks for any reason to be labeled an action movie. The ""action"" of the film entails Matt Damon running away and throwing a few punches. The only intensity comes from chase sequences. Perhaps ""romantic thriller"" would be the best way to describe the film, for at its heart, ""Adjustment Bureau"" is a love story whose obstacles have been manifest into science fiction.Damon stars as David Norris, a young up-and-coming politician who seems a shoo-in for winning one of New York's U.S. Senate seats, but loses after an impulsive practical joke is caught on camera and affects public opinion. While writing his concession speech in the bathroom of the Waldorf, he bumps into Elise (Emily Blunt), a woman who captivates him instantly. She inspires him to deliver a candid speech that puts him in position for another run in four years, but disappears that evening without a trace. Days later they run into each other on a bus and David gets her number. All seems well, except that exchange wasn't supposed to happen. In fact, David and Elise are not meant to be together period.That's according to the Adjustment Bureau, a team of men in fedoras that work for a mysterious Chairman who orchestrates the fate of all. The Chairman has agents working for him, such as Harry (Anthony Mackie) and Richardson (John Slattery) who see to it that things go according to plan. Harry, in particular, has long been assigned to ensuring David follows his path, as great things are in store for him. When Harry fails to make the one thing happen that will prevent David and Elise from reconnecting, David ends up seeing behind the curtain and learning the hard truth, one that he refuses to accept. He realizes he must find a way to outsmart the Bureau if he ever wants to be with her.The classic ""fate vs. free will"" debate manifests itself quite poignantly in this film. Although overtly so at the onset, ""The Adjustment Bureau"" confronts the concept in a more direct way thanks to the brilliance of Dick's concept. What makes this film execute it right is the ever-so-critical lead chemistry. Considering the plot revolves completely around whether David has control over his destiny with Elise, creating the viewer's desire for the success of their relationship is Nolfi's most crucial task. Luckily, Blunt and Damon light up the screen, especially Blunt, who gives Elise an attitude and a foul mouth to go along with her elegance. Only down the stretch in the film's last sequence does their relationship feel forced or overblown.As science fiction, ""The Adjustment Bureau"" manages to cover up issues of implausibility to make you understand how the Bureau itself works and functions and using what rules. They simply represent — in human form — that which we attribute to chance. They even have a fallibility to them, which adds a nice touch that few sci fi films open themselves up to, and it allows Nolfi to insert some humor to prevent the film from getting to self-serious. Some might desire to see the Bureau as a relentless and powerful group ala hard sci fi, but this film recognizes that not all science-fiction concepts can be so pristine and perhaps they can even benefit from a few scuff marks.Not only does ""The Adjustment Bureau"" never lose sight of the human factor, but it also prioritizes it, which makes the film accessible to a wider audience. The film amounts to a story of love overcoming the odds, only the odds are guys in suits who can control the flow of the universe. The merging of these genres might lead to some sacrifices on both ends, but it makes for an enjoyable film with universal appeal.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Interesting concept, unengagingly applied","David Norris, a politician, meets Elise, a dancer, and it's love at first sight. However, a mysterious, history-determining agency is determined to keep them apart. Norris is accidentally made aware of their existence and aim but through threats they convince him to not see Elise. He isn't put off for long though. Moreover, what is their reason for trying to keep them apart?A plot that held some intrigue. Being based on a Phillip K Dick (Blade Runner, Minority Report, A Scanner Darkly, Total Recall) short story it was always going to involve some interesting sci fi concept and the film doesn't disappoint in that regard.However, how the concept is applied is quite dull and disappointing. Instead of lives or civilisations at stake, it's just about a relationship. There are bigger repercussions than that but even those made me feel ""so what?"". While there is a decent chemistry between Matt Damon as Norris and Emily Blunt as Elise, it's all rather flat and unengaging.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Excellent, Convention-Challenging Science Fiction","An excellent Philip K. Dick adaptation that comes off as neither too cerebral nor too wantonly action-heavy. Matt Damon slides into the role of a brash, combustible young politician in the mold of JFK, whose chance meeting with his dream girl sets off a chain reaction that alters his perception of the world at large. Shortly afterwards he stumbles across the delegates of a shadow agency, who freeze time and bend reality to tinker with the thoughts and feelings of the population, all in the name of a precise global timeline. Damon, naturally, is immune to their tricks and bolts from the scene. As a science fiction twist on the cat and mouse game, it's a blast of fresh air with an admirable sense of restraint. In a perfect world these agents would do their jobs without being noticed at all, so their methods consist of a series of slick, downplayed visual tricks and slight tweaks to the natural order. That sensibility works for their own purposes, but also for the film's: the special effects are equally moderate, and as a result more believable. Damon and Emily Blunt click right away as a duo, so well in fact that it's no challenge at all to root for them from the get-go, and the agency itself is far from the black-and-white, good-versus-evil gang of naughty henchmen you might expect. A tense, creative adventure with perhaps a tad too much sentimentality, it's a raging, surprising, success.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very good film based on a Phillip K Dick work,"Not as close to the source material as was A Scanner Darkly, in this case the story we have here is loosely based on the short story ""The Adjustment Team"" by Phillip K Dick. Matt Damon and Emily Blunt spearhead a great cast including John Slattery and Terence Stamp, at first you don't really know what is happening here, just a hard-luck story about a guy, loses an election due to bad luck and nosy Republican media, meets a girl on Election night, but although it would seem like this is what is happening, it is not.Instead, the very Fabric of Reality is ripped... Who are these guys with the Hats... Cousins of The Watchers in ""Fringe""? What is great about this film is the connectivity between a science fiction story and a religious story, except that this film is neither, although aspects of both are present.This film joins the ranks of other reality-questioning films like The Matrix, The 13th Floor, and Dark City - Except that this is not a world-construct, it's simply the world. And so concepts that might be more suited to a science fiction or religious film are brought into the grasp of people not familiar with either genre, it is simply a film about people, and these things that are going on are not supernatural or of alien design, it is more like, ""This is how the world is constructed"".Matt Damon goes up against the masters of time and space and beats them. So rather than say, ""Foreknowledge vs Predestination/Freewill vs Determinism"" you can say ""Freewill AND Determinism"" - As Damon shows when he asks, ""What about Free Will?"". Actually the entire premise of this film is that we do actually have Free Will and Choices... Regardless of any entity which may have knowledge of future events.This is a wholly NY Movie, filmed in NY, by people in NY and as such is in my list of top NY movies. It looks good, it is acted well, it is directed very well, and a lot of my favourite Character actors are here, including Anthony Ruivivar and John Slattery - Although this is more of a breakout film for Anthony Mackie, who does his job very well here... Starting out as a minor character, his importance is made evident later.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Fantastic Movie,"I went into this movie thinking it was going to be ""ok"" simply because I didn't hear much about it when it came out. Now, looking at the average IMDb rating and the Rottentomatoes rating, I feel silly that I just saw this movie now. It was really, surprisingly good.The main premise is intriguing enough that, for the most part, you're wondering how it's all going to end and how the characters are going to deal with their situations and the consequences. I found myself invested in the characters enough to want to see how it played out. I don't know if I'd go so far as to call it ""Inception-lite"" as some have described it, but its easily better than your average thriller though it does have less action. Coming from the guy who wrote the Bourne Ultimatum screenplay, I'm actually not surprised about the quality. Without spoiling anything, my 9/10 comes from the movie not only being a solid thriller, but from having two good overall messages that you just don't see in movies any more.As a side note, this is the epitome of a perfect date movie. It mixes a great concept and thrills with a nice dose of romance that, in my opinion, didn't feel out of place one bit.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

These two performed their roles almost flawlessly.I gave The Adjustment Bureau a 9/10. The acting was superb for most of the movie.

Original plot and very intriguing,"I was surprised to see a lot of negative comments about this movie, seeing as how I thought this movie was brilliant. It had this whole playing-with-your-mind factor which kept viewers interested. But it wasn't as mind-blowing as 'Inception' was, though.I'm glad that the movie lived up to the promises of action, thrill and romance that was shown in the trailer. The people who decided what to put in the trailer should also be given props. Not much was given away, but the audience got the gist of the movie. I was surprised at many events that happened during the viewing. All trailers should be like this one, not like those overly long trailers like 'Charlie St. Cloud' where they practically reveal everything.

It's hard to understand how anyone would risk a career by participating in making it or wish to throw money away financing it. The scenes and the photography, however, are quite good. I'm amazed that a talented cinematographer would get involved in such a mess. It is in fact so bad that there is a fascination with seeing if it can get any worse as it progresses. It does. Maybe that's what it is all about. Maybe it is a bid to be the worst picture ever made and thus achieve some kind of cult following.

"Solid concept, good acting, poor writing, major plot holes","I've been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I loved the concept of it. It was reminiscent of my favorite episode of Twilight Zone, ""A Matter of Minutes"". You can read about the episode on Wikipedia. I'm not sure there is any way to see it, but it's a classic.While the concept of Adjustment Bureau started out in the right direction, the longer the movie went on the more the movie got lost with it's direction and goal. The writer had setup a world with rules that he was not able to keep the story within. Once a writer breaks the rules of the world he's constructed, the plot holes start to appear, and this one got out of control. New rules had to be added, obvious solutions had to be ignored.There were great opportunities here to discuss personal freedom versus destiny or the will of God, but the ending was completely anticlimactic. It came across as though the writer and director didn't realize they were going to end up where they did, and had no creative solution for how to handle it.It got a bit too slow and I lost interest half way through, until the story picked up the pace toward the end.In the end, I can't recommend the movie. The characters were all very likable and the acting by Emily Blunt and Matt Damon was excellent. I have a hunch many will overlook the fact that the entire movie is absurd in favor of the romance, and perhaps if you are able to do that going into it, you'll enjoy it more than I did.",,Anonymous,Romance

I Will Choose Free Will,"A mash of sci-fi, fantasy and rom-com, THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU works as a fun film, and actually works quite well as a suspend-your-disbelief narrative goes, mostly due to the believable chemistry between likable stars Matt Damon, a senator-to-be, and Emily Blunt, an NYC dancer.Writer/director George Nolfi chose not to go easy with his first-time outing and decided to adapt a Philip K. Dick story, a tale in which every event in life is mapped out – and policed by fedora-wearing caseworkers – but two lovers meet as a result of a cosmic accident and, as if a modern-day Hitchcockian duo, decide to run against fate. The resulting genre flick is a meeting of the overlord concept from DARK CITY and the rebelling-against-prophesy ideals from the MATRIX, both of which parallel the age-old ordeal of the existence of free will. Damon does it with his Boston smile, Blunt with her accent.Nolfi keeps the pace moving lightning quick, complete with a piano-heavy Thomas Newman score, and offers just enough exploration to keep the wow- factor accelerating giving neither the characters nor the viewer a chance to fully take a deep breath and put together the sense of it all. Is it truly to be believed that spilling your coffee is a planned event akin to the election of a president? However, the delivered world of the film is one of fun make-believe where impulsive choices are the best, properly-worn fedoras are still magical and Matt Damon takes the bus - daily.Another theme that helps complete THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU story is the empowering choice to write your own ending. True, Damon and Blunt's David and Elise, may have had their destiny already assured, at least by the viewer, but that classic sci-fi theme that states the future is wide open, that destiny has not already been written, needs to be affirmed for the next generation, which is who, perhaps, Dick was writing to. Nolfi has helped with that vision.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

And they are reacting accordingly with normal disappointed disgust.So fair warning-- if you are looking for an uncomplicated Bang-Bang Boom-Boom Friday-Night or Saturday Night Action Thriller, 'Adjustment Bureau' is NOT what you think it is. Matt Damon is NOT reprising the Bourne saga. Mind you-- when I say this, I'm not looking down on someone for seeking a straight-up action flick-- I was looking for the same thing! Having said that. . .If you are willing to sit back and just let the actors do their thing and tell the story, you will get a nice little puzzler about Fate, Love & the Question of Free Will. And as an extra bit of spice, you get the added dimension of another view of Religion that will touch on Heresy for the truly religious.Yes-- the Story is Predictable. There is only One End that we want to see, after all. What matters is HOW the Characters struggle against the Machineries of Fate. And Why they and we should do so.Haven't you ever wondered about God and Angels and Such-- The Bible says that Lucifer was Cast from Heaven. . .But no-one has ever told us WHY? WHAT was the Argument about? Exactly WHAT was Lucifer Rebelling AGAINST? If you Read Graphic Novels like 'Sandman' or 'Lucifer', even as a guy, you should like this movie, because those are the types of questions posed as the foundation of the entire story.If you've read even just one page of the reviews here, you already know what the plot is, so I won't add to it.But on the light Sci-Fi side of it-- The Plan Notebooks as the COOLEST THINGS in the movie, accentuated by the fact that they are purposely so ORDINARY LOOKING! 'Ordinary', until you notice that the ink is moving like an unfolding schematic. That alone accentuated the notion of Heaven as a Vast interlocking set of cold Bureaucratic Machineries that lends a special chill to anyone who thinks about it enough.This movie is in a class by itself. And it requires a level of maturity to properly enjoy it. 100% Girlfriend-Friendly and a good choice for a slow Sunday Afternoon.",,Anonymous,Romance
a really beautiful movie,"It's the love, the power of love, and the resolution to break oneself from the rot. It's really only few can achieve and when they try, even god has to rewrite the path that he he(or she) has planned for us.

The master plan is confused,"The bureau of the title is helping wretched humankind, by performing seemingly trivial adjustments in daily events, which should steer us gently towards some unidentified superior purpose. It is an intriguing premise, but unfortunately it goes pretty much nowhere.The plot could have developed by investigating further the nature of the adjustments and the ripples they create, or on what free will is actually about and why humankind is not yet capable to handle it.Instead, it develops the idea that love at first sight do exists and so does that elusive ""other half"" we need to find to feel finally whole. Both concepts are very romantic but difficult to sell to a grown-up (or just cynical) audience.Matt Damon plays David, who could have a great future and a positive influence on mankind (or at least on the US), but keeps deviating from this nobler and higher purpose because of Elise– a flirty ballerina he met in the gents room (not the most romantic location).Throughout the movie I kept thinking that Elise kept popping up at the worst possible time and considered her more as disturbance rather than the romantic interest, which is a clear sign I did not buy into the star-crossed lovers' side of the story.What I appreciated was the minimal special effects and Damon's performance, but I still consider - with regret -this movie a miss, despite the huge potential.P.S. and in real life, people who fall asleep on the job usually get fired, not promoted.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very Good - would watch it again and again.,"Matt Damon and Emily Blunt star in this contrast of a Romance/Comedy/Drama/Suspense and Fantasy/Science Fiction movie. You don't often see these genres combined, but I watched it solely because Damon has a reputation with me of high quality films (for example, the Bourne series and Good Will Hunting).This one does not disappoint. Damon and Blunt have such a chemistry on screen that their instant attraction anchors the fantasy/science fiction plot. He is placed with her for a brief encounter that will inspire him to rebound from an otherwise devastating political defeat, by someone called the adjustment bureau. They are never to see each other again, except that he is so taken with her that he spends the next couple years trying to find her.She meanwhile, calls off an engagement because of her brief but truly memorable experience with him.The bureau's ""plan"" does not call for them to be together, in fact, it specifically calls for Damon to be without her, so that his political ambitions flourish.Damon has other ideas, and he is eventually assisted by a bureau ""man in black"" with a conscience that the bureau is not used to. The rest of the movie concerns whether he is able to reunite with her.This is a very good movie, and I think you will be surprised at the outcome.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Thumbs Up,"Romance with Sci-Fi itself is quite an appealing genre for me. And with Matt Damon in it definitely makes it more ( least I knew about Emily Blunt who is quite pretty ;) ). Hats off to the concept. These kind of concepts should be appreciated. I never thought about the title and made out what was it and it will definitely surprise you. The direction of movie is quite good and I loved the Cinematography. The script as well is well written and is consistent. the romantic factor is very much appreciating as it do connects emotionally. Damon and Blunt both have done great and its surprising for Damon fans to see him in a romantic and passionate avatar and do so well. Both share a sparkling chemistry. Its imaginative, refreshing, innovative and things are explained in a decent manner. George Nolfi surely takes credit for rewriting the short story of Philip and presenting it in a quite well manner. If you are reading this till here that means you don't care what critics say and if you don't, do watch it then. Thumbs up from my side. Loved it.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Crappy trailer,"I really liked this movie, but I can't believe how disparate the tone of the trailer is vs the tone of this movie. The people who approved the trailer should be canned, because in my opinion the trailer will lose audiences who might normally like this film. The trailer makes it seem like this is a hyper suspenseful and violent action thriller, which couldn't be further from what it is - an entertaining puzzler. I wouldn't give it a 10, but it was genuinely entertaining with some fresh and interesting faces. Why everything seems to need to be sold like and action thriller these days is confusing to me. I'm sure they test market a lot of these things, but the trailer totally missed the point and I wouldn't have gone to see it had my friend really wanted to go and had I just noticed a decent review.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"An engrossing, edge-of-your-seat... love story?  ""The Adjustment Bureau""","""The Adjustment Bureau"" has been advertised as a sci-fi thriller about the mysterious behind-the-scenes machinations that may or may not guide our everyday lives as part of some Divine Plan. While it is essentially a science fiction parable about fate-vs.-free will (based on the Philip K. Dick short story ""Adjustment Team""), at its heart, really, ""The Adjustment Bureau"" is a love story, and a very gripping one, at that.Dick (who passed away in 1982), you will remember, has had several of his works adapted posthumously into big-budget science fiction classics - the novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" became ""Blade Runner"" (1982), the short story ""We Can Remember it For You Wholesale"" became ""Total Recall"" (1990), and the short story ""The Minority Report"" became ""Minority Report"" (2002). ""The Adjustment Bureau"" is the latest Dick adaptation to feature stellar performances and intelligent subtext that asks the ultimate question: Is it possible to deviate from a Divine Plan in favor of one's own personal destiny? What happens when we pit ""What could be"" against ""What will be""?These are just some of the big question facing David Norris (Matt Damon), an aspiring New York congressman running for the U.S. Senate. After a crushing defeat his first time running, he retreats into brief despair to practice his concession speech. Hope comes in the form of a chance meeting with the lovely, free-spirited ballerina Elise (Emily Blunt). The two thus hit it off immediately, but soon Fate - in the form of the fate-controlling Adjustment Bureau - intervenes and reveals to David that he has a big future ahead of him, a future that could include a bid for the White House. To David, that sounds great. The problem: his future doesn't include Elise in it. And the big theatrics in this film feature David using his Free Will to deviate from a Big Set Divine Plan to make his own destiny with the one great love of his life.""The Adjustment Bureau"" is the first truly great film of 2011 I've seen so far. After seven months so far of films that have continually failed to capture my interest, ""The Adjustment Bureau"" is finally a film that not only captured my interest, but thoroughly engrossed me in its story, characters, humor and carefully-plotted revisionist universe of a world controlled from behind-the-scenes by mysterious, dapper, fedora-wearing Men in Black Overcoats who manipulate things big and small to ensure that things stay on-track according to The Plan. And, trust me, the mysterious Adjustment Bureau pulls out all stops to ensure that the plan succeeds, and sometimes these machinations can be quite humorous. But David never ever gives up, despite the many Rube Goldberg-style stumbling blocks put forth by the Bureau to keep him on his pre-determined path in life.Perhaps more than any other Dick adaptation in the last 30 years, ""The Adjustment Bureau"" has characters and situations that are easily identifiable to everyday folks like you and me. While previous films were mostly set in dystopic futures, this film is set in the present, more or less, so there's no loss of time or space. What's more, how many of us have ever wondered if the set course we're on in life is what is truly meant to be? How many of us have ever wondered if mysterious forces are working behind-the-scenes guiding our every move? Will we ever meet ""The One""? (This latter question is especially relevant to everyday people, in my honest opinion.) If so, can it be God (or for you spiritualists, agnostics, and New Ageists out there, a Higher Power?)? Allah? Buddha? E.T.? ""The Chairman""? Who really knows?Matt Damon has never been better as the high-strung politician trying to outrun his destiny at every corner (many times, literally, as proved by this film's climatic ending foot-chase through the streets of New York). He takes his role seriously and is quite superb, as is his love interest played by Emily Blunt. The actress is equally important here not just because she's the love interest, but her heartbreak as the forces manipulating their lives trying to keep her and David apart really make you hope that they're able to overcome any pre-determined paths in life and wind up together. From the second they first meet, there's an instant burst of chemistry between them, which is something that is rarely achieved in movies these days. And what's even greater is that throughout the thick & thin of the plot, that chemistry remains intact and never folds.George Nolfi wrote and directed ""The Adjustment Bureau"" and while I'm not sure if this is his debut film and if it is, it's an impressive debut. Nolfi definitely has a future in the thriller genre if he chooses that route; what does Fate have in store for him, I wonder? I was thoroughly on the edge of my seat the entire time throughout this picture, which ultimately seems like a cross between Dick's own ""The Minority Report"" and a high-concept (is there anything else?) Hitchcockian-style thriller. I think that debt is owed to Nolfi's confident writing and directing, and the sure-fire performances of the two leads.""The Adjustment Bureau"" is very easily one of this year's best and smartest films. Its being largely ignored at the box office only baffles me.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"One of the most creative, intelligent science fiction thrillers ever made","""The Adjustment Bureau"" is highly creative and intelligent in terms of the story that is being conveyed to viewers. The concept that someone(apart from God) is trying to ""adjust"" our daily lives according to a predetermined ""plan"" is the greatest element of thrill in the story/ screenplay. It might come as a shock for some viewers. The plot moves forward at a decent pace and viewers will keep wondering what is going to happen next. Therefore, it definitely captures the interest and full attention of its viewer.The chemistry between the two main lead actors (Matt Damon and Emily Blunt)is outstanding, almost magical. Viewers can actually ""feel the love"" between Matt Damon (Norris) and Emily Blunt (Elyse). Their on-screen chemistry is one of the major attractions of ""The Adjustment Bureau"". The movie is also visually appealing and edited brilliantly.I would love to become a full-time movie critic or a story-writer for movies because movies exist in every breath I take.

Watched three times already (and counting),"It's a tough job - putting Philip K. Dick's story into a movie. Basically it's similar to Stephen King's works (Shawshank Redemption or The Green Mile). PKD's stories are diamonds in a rough, with countless layers of meaning and ideas hiding beneath the surface. Directors mostly take only his basic ideas, and try to visualize them. This movie is a very good job (as was Blade Runner, Minority Report or Screamers). Excellent casting, camera, editing, music and direction. Very entertaining, with nothing to add or discard. It radiates inspiration of the participants and it shows. There's humor, suspense, emotions and all the things that make the movie a pleasant experience, and worth watching many times. It also makes one think about everyday reality and the things we usually take for granted and ""as they are"". PKD was a genius in so many ways and I'm looking forward to the filming of all of his work. In good hands they make excellent movie, for the people who know how to appreciate a good work.

"Honestly, a waste of time","OK, I like Matt Damon, I like mystery thrillers, I like Philip K. Dick, and I like escapist cinema, and am no cineastic snob. But, this film is naff. I was hoping for an intriguing, suspenseful, conspiracy style (cf Three days of the condor, Parallax View) film, and we got something quite ridiculous, schmaltzy and so on, with NY setting and visuals being the only redeeming feature. Emily Blunt is not bad, Terence Stamp is as good as can be in a simplistic role. Matt Damon should be well advised not to do more turkeys. Marginally better than The Tourist. Inception is a masterpiece compared to this and the Bourne films are several leagues above. Strangely, there's a very 80's feel to the production and narrative - very disappointing.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

"If we work hard enough for what we want, will we succeed?",I liked the concept of fate vs free will. How acting based on our emotions can be our greatest strength or biggest downfall. Does showing resilience and fighting for what you want despite obstacles being thrown your way mean you will win? To make a 10/10 I think the movie would need an extra hour and some flaws corrected. But I enjoyed it quite a lot. I've watched it twice and would probably watch again in a few years. The chemistry was great between the actors. Looking at it from a religious view can have you thinking quite a bit about what goes on up there and if free will is just a myth. 8/10 for me.,8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"George Nolfi adapted this film from a short story Philip K Dick wrote and his vision aligned with the creator, it's intelligently written with superb direction","For a directional debut, George Nolfi did a brilliant job. Nolfi's work often touch on central themes of philosophy, the human condition or world politics and convey some form of social commentary. It aligns with Philip K. Dick's themes of similar things and also the main theme of the film, free will. The Adjustment Bureau is a fantastic adaption of Dick's short story called Adjustment Team, I have sadly not read the short story but knowing his Philip K Dick's writing style and the way he writes stories I know that it's a good adaption. Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Anthony Mackie, John Slattery and Terence Stamp stars in The Adjustment Bureau. Though the acting is far from incredible, it's good and far from what matters in the movie. It's the engaging, well written and original story that matters. The characters in that story.Do we control our destiny, or do unseen forces manipulate us? A man glimpses the future Fate has planned for him and realizes he wants something else. To get it, he must pursue across, under and through the streets of modern-day New York the only woman he's ever loved. On the brink of winning a seat in the U. S. Senate, ambitious politician David Norris (Matt Damon) meets beautiful contemporary ballet dancer Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt), a woman like none he's ever known. But just as he realizes he's falling for her, mysterious men conspire to keep the two apart. David learns he is up against the agents of Fate itself, the men of The Adjustment Bureau, who will do everything in their considerable power to prevent David and Elise from being together.John Toll served as cinematographer for The Adjustment Bureau and the work he does for this film is truly breathtaking. The visual plan for the film was to keep the camerawork smooth using a dolly or crane and have controlled formal shots when the Adjustment Bureau was in full control, with things becoming more loose and using hand-held cameras when we follow David Norris and I loved that about the film. Making us feel how chaotic his life have become after moving past ""the plan"". The visuals in the film is actually very good, mostly because of how it's shot. Phenomenal camera work. Musical score is too a highlight.The Adjustment Bureau met my expectations and I'm glad I didn't go into this film with thinking it as a romantic film as it's honestly just a side plot in this film and I wouldn't say it was the strong point, but what the strong point was is of course the themes and story about the Bureau, about free will. George Nolfi brought us a great adaption which probably Philip K Dick would have been proud of, it's a strong 8/10 from me. I found that the romantic plot took too much screen time than what I would have liked. But it was a interesting take on the romantic drama genre.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

discount viewing only,"I expected to really like this movie given the writer on whose work it's based (Philip K. Dick)and the philosophical issue explored. I am not a particular fan of Matt Damon, but was interested in seeing him and Emily Blount together. The film was saved only because it had neat New York scenes and I saw it at a discounted price. The pace was slow, too much time was spent setting up the premise, there seemed to be strained chemistry between Blount and Damon - although I must admit that in all of his movies, I never believe him as a romantic lead; he always seems uncomfortable when he is one-on-one and/or physically intimate with a woman. The Blount-Damon banter seemed exactly what it was: contrived. The philosophical conundrum of free will vs. fate is intriguing and absolutely worthy of exploration in a film.

Candidate for movie of the year,"The Adjustment Bureau is a breath of fresh air for me. Watching it was quite a different experience then watching usual today's movies. It works well both as a melodrama and as a pro sci-fi complex drama. Damon and Blunt are both very good in their roles and good old Terence Stamp delivers another pretty memorable role.The Adjustment Bureau are a sort of guardian angels of this world, except they are not really angels but more like otherworldly beings that direct and shape everything that's going on in the world. They decide a man's destiny, at least destiny of important men. And women. David Norris is one of these men and he is an ambitious but depressed young politician who is looking to find himself again after getting lost in the maze of his political career after 8 years. He's also still coping with the loss of his parents and brother. A chance meeting with Elise, a beautiful and spirited ballet dancer, makes his dream come true. He feels something again. But the Bureau will not allow this to happen to him, in order to make him continue with his career. And her with hers.This film is about love, love that can't be destroyed. Elise is the only thing that is not programmed in David's life, the only thing that really makes his life worth living. And no matter what steps the Bureau make to prevent them from meeting again, they always do. Because they are bound together, meant to be. This film really touched something in me and I think everybody feels something when they watch it, they feel hope and they feel what love is about. Love can sometimes be the only escape out of a difficult and painful situation in life and it can guide us back into light.Wonderful film with 2 very important talents Hollywood has today. Emily Blunt shows again why her career has taken off like it has. She has charm, delicate beauty, talent and above all believability. She's 100% authentic in her part and so is Damon. Terence Stamp is perfect in his role that represents FATE, the one we try to get away from. At least in this movie we succeed.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

7.1... I Feel Like I'm Taking Crazy Pills,"Summary: The premise is the worst I ever heard of, the plot is lame, and the film ended really poorly. You didn't get sucked into the world of the film, the special effects and action are not cool. There was bad acting. At this point there is nothing worth seeing about the film besides Damon acting well and a typical love story, but this was supposed to be a thriller. This movie would be a waste of drugs if you thought they could aid in making it watchable. This movie isn't romantic enough to make your girl swoon at any point. You will never say ""That was awesome"", you may laugh at the stupidity of the film or simply say ""I don't care about this $#*+""Here's why this film will disappoint you for watching it:Ending: Cop-out and includes an infuriatingly cheesy life philosophy. This ending alone would ruin even a good film.Big Bad Guy: Will not scare you. Doesn't do much.Special Effects: Doors open to different places than they should. This is the big special effect in the movie, it is not noteworthy and not a reason this film is worth seeing. Other special effects are not interesting and few and far between.Poor acting: If you weren't a main character, you got typical confident bad guy lines. These lines were delivered very flat and made the characters forgettable.Bad guy's kryptonite: Dumb enough to embarrass you for watching. I won't spoil the film, but there are two and both of them should have been left out because they never mattered. They seemed to be added as an afterthought or got bungled in production and are some artifact of a more thought out plot device.Plot Hole: Hard not to make this a spoiler....they were larger holes than are usually acceptable, not even being picky here 1.)

Is there to wonder why we are so upset with Scientology? They seem to compete with our own structure of indoctrination by offering another type of indoctrination! That is dangerous! We have so many beliefs that we acquired in our society that any threat to this beliefs system has to be handled forcefully! Of course, a love story is an easy vehicle to peddle idea which are not easy to have accepted and in that respect, I acknowledge the producers and scrip writer for using a narrative which, even if the viewer does not make the connection with the topic of indoctrination, will still deliver a powerful message that we can create the life we choose!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

The concept of people overseeing our lives, and following a script for each one of us was something that makes you think. I think they could have made the ending even better by showing a caption 5 years in the future and a secret serviceman calling Matt Damon to his seat in the Kennedy Center, saying,the first lady is about to start her performance Mr. President. Then Emily Blunt would come out on stage and start her dance. You need to see the movie to understand this premise. It would have made the movie a real feel good ending for me. See this movie.

Fight for your fate.,"On the brink of winning a seat in the U.S. Senate, ambitious politician David Norris meets beautiful contemporary ballet dancer Elise Sellas, a woman like none he's ever known. But just as he realizes he's falling for her, mysterious men conspire to keep the two apart. David learns he is up against the agents of Fate itself--the men of The Adjustment Bureau--who will do everything in their considerable power to prevent David and Elise from being together. In the face of overwhelming odds, he must either let her go and accept a predetermined path...or risk everything to defy Fate and be with her.TAB is a great example of a film with an intriguing storyline (aren't most of Philip K. Dick's material usually are?) which is executed in a mediocre way, and I stress that word to the fullest extent. While watching TAB, I felt very indifferent throughout. There were some random, decent chase scenes here and there and the film has a lot of surprisingly funny scenes, but I never really cared for the characters. I was never really involved with their situation. I just didn't care, and that made my viewing experience a bit exhausting to get through.First and foremost, the weakest thing about the film is the plot. It's so flimsy, thin, and predictable that you really don't need a feature length film to tell it. After an hour in, the film begins to spin its wheels. It goes on and on and on and the chase scenes (which seem to be added just for the hell of it) get really repetitive. From the third act on, it's just a huge mess. On top of that, the ending is lame as hell. It is probably the definition of deus ex machina. It felt really tacked on which is ironic since it seemed that the reason the film was pushed back from 2010 to a 2011 release was because they had to reshoot the ending. So much for that.The characters weren't really developed either, even though the talented Matt Damon and Emily Blunt tried their best to elevate the mediocre script. If anything, they saved the film from being a totally forgettable film than it already is. I thought John Slattery added some well needed humor throughout the film, which I didn't expect at all. I really liked his character. On a technical standpoint, it's a mixed bag. The good was the awesome scenery of New York. The bad was the camera focus itself. It felt like the cinematographer had no idea what he was doing. Doubt me? Watch the film and you can see MANY blurry scenes throughout. Talk about a rushed production.Overall, TAB had huge potential. The story was very interesting to me, although it did remind me a lot of DARK CITY (a much better and effective film, in my opinion). The actors seriously try their best but even they couldn't save the film. As a huge sci-fi fan, I was severely disappointed by it. If you're intrigued, just wait for it on DVD and rent it instead or watch DARK CITY...or even read Philip K. Dick's original short story itself.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

"""All I have are the choices that I make""","THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU revolves around a heady, far-out concept conveyed in simple everyday terms. The concepts/conflicts are all explained away to young maverick aspiring senator David Norris (Matt Damon) by the ""Adjustment Men"" who oversee the destiny of the world and everyone in it. This, of course, kills this film's potential as a think-piece that many might want but makes it accessible to a more casual audience. Somehow, it all works splendidly, mostly because of the fine acting by all and the solid human interest story of Norris's love for ballerina Elise Sella, memorably played by Emily Blunt, a relationship that goes against the plans of the mysterious ""Chairman"" who makes all the rules and plans our lives for us.This film is the most realistic sort of fantasy. . .or is it really fantasy?. . . that one can imagine. It's also good science fiction, even for people who generally hate science fiction. Finally, there is excellent social satire regarding politics, civilization in general, and all sorts of other things. While THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU takes what it has to say seriously, its mood is light-hearted and funny, without any need for serious violence or gore.As Einstein said, ""If you cannot explain it simply, you do not understand it well enough."" That being said, the creators of this film, based on a short story by the inimitable Philip K. Dick, knew exactly what they were doing.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

The Adjustment Bureau(2011),"If you've watched science fiction movies such as Blade Runner, Total Recall, Minority Report, Paycheck and A Scanner Darkly, chances are you'll know who the prolific author Philip K. Dick probably is, with Hollywood slowly but surely tapping on his rich repertoire of works for the big screen treatment. Some become hits, some don't, most boast A-listers attached to the project, from directors such as Ridley Scott, Steven Spielberg, Richard Linklater, Paul Verhoeven and John Woo even, and cast from Tom Cruise to Arnold Schwarzenegger, and almost always not every film stays faithful to the source material.George Nolfi, writer of The Bourne Ultimatum and Ocean's Twelve, adapts from Philip K. Dick's short story Adjustment Team, taking the in-principle concept and crafted quite the romance thriller that explores, like many other films that had gone before it from The Matrix to Vanilla Sky or The Truman Show even, our reality being controlled by a higher order determined to keep chaos manageable and at bay, mocking the notion of free choice, before someone wakes up and realizes that all is not what they seem, and armed with new knowledge, seek to carve a new path out to escape from what's seem to be an unfair reign over one's own life and decision making.The more thought provoking issues will be that of free will and destiny, whether everything unravels according to a set path pre-determined by someone else, that what seem to be choices turn out to be no more than what's already laid out and planned for, giving the simple illusion that one has that level of freedom to choose. Discussions in the film crank up the appeal factor, and of course introduces us to this particular sandbox of reality that all the characters have to live with and abide by. For the romantic then, if you're told to give up someone whom you've just met and who could be that soulmate you're looking for, at what price sacrifice comes the question, whether one would be willing to fight, even if it may seem futile, for that chance that you may just beat the system with odds tremendously stacked up against.Damon shines with plenty of likability factors put into his politician (which is rare considering the profession of choice!) and seriously this is one candidate I would root for and support as he struggles to find some meaning into the mess he's in. The romance between his character and Emily Blunt was believable as they engage in the type of banter couples do, and situations that will call for heartbreak after heartbreak, with the powers that be standing in their way employing tactics that is what I call emotionally cunning - that is - if you want eternal happiness for someone living her dream, don't get in her way and bog her down in a relationship. Hmm.Still, the production values are gorgeous, and art direction involving the internals of the Bureau were interesting to gawk at, and deserves a second look, as these men with fedoras move around the world tinkering with small, micro level events that have repercussions at the macro level, going along with the whims of a higher being. There is enough scope here to equate the Bureau with how things are governed here even, with issues kicked up to the higher levels of bureaucracy to solve if it exceeds one's bandwidth, or horrors, pay grade! You don't question, but you conform and comply, and for the mavericks who prove their worth through sacrifice and steely determination, hopefully could one day overcome and emerge winners in some form.

Is everything planned? Really?,"You know how it is. When someone tragically dies, you are supposed to think that it was God's will and we do not understand his plans. Or if you like, we can't understand the big picture, but there is a meaning behind all the suffering. In the Adjustment Bureau, the protagonist has the courage to ask if it is morally acceptable to make people suffer against their will, if it is your power not to do so. Shouldn't the plan be better? This is a pretty daring question in a theological context and would easily have led the questioner to lose his life in the past. Some would call it blasphemy even today. The short stories Philip K. Dick wrote back in the 1950's are a bit dated by now but they still inspire the best in American film making just as his novels of the 1960's do. The superior being who adjusts things on the ground to comply to his plans is called the Old Man in the original story, in the film the title is more bureaucratic, so it 's not clear if we are dealing with God, an AI or some other entity. It's your call. Einstein said that God does not play dice. But in the story and the film he certainly does so as his adjustment agents keep on tweaking the odds to keep his plan going. The first time around I didn't really like the film as I was having a hard time deciding if it was a sci-fi or a religious film or simply a romantic comedy with an unusual amount of action. So I decided to give it a second chance and the film began to make much more sense. Besides asking the viewer a lot of very difficult questions the film also incorporates a mighty romance. Normally I do not go for the romantic comedy genre, but Matt Damon and Emily Blunt act the parts in a Casablanca kind of manner. It's hard to define but if you have seen the film you already know what I mean. I never knew Matt Damon could be so intense. The scene where the couple accidentally meet in a men's rest room is absolutely thrilling to watch. As far as adaptations of Philip K. Dicks groundbreaking work go, the Adjustment Bureau has to be one of the most imaginative.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Fantastic adventure,"I decided to watch this film after contemplating between a couple of other no-brainer comedy titles and what a good choice it was. Adjustment Bureau is an intelligent, interesting, different and emotional film. There are similarities to Inception in the concept but it's completely different in terms of characters and content.Matt Damon was excellent as was his love interest, and it's a film that I think a lot of people connect with because we all want to believe in fate and free will's impact on it.It's not as heavy going as Inception, which I really liked. It meant I could enjoy it as a pure movie experience, but it was intelligent enough to stimulate my imagination.Excellent film with a great story. Must see.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Adjustment and a love story,"While this movie has many elements to it, sci-fi, religion, drama, chase scenes, more than anything else at its heart, it is a love story. Mat is an upcoming politician, Emily is a dancer choreographer, the premise is that by them falling in love, neither will fulfill their ambitions. Hence the continual interference by the god-like adjustment bureau to keep them apart and on track for their separate destinies. Needless to say they keep meeting up despite the bureau's best efforts. The movie has some interesting sci-fi elements and Terence Stamp is great as the head bad guy. The plot does not take itself too seriously or become preachy so an enjoyable watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Make up your mind...,"The movie started out well but quickly falls apart.

I was so disgusted after this movie that I started to ask for my money back. They were all over the place with the plot, throwing in the ludicrous and incredible just to get you to the next scene.

Truly Delightful (This review may contain spoilers!),"Being the hopeless romantic that I am, this movie seemed right up my alley: Two people so in love they will move heaven and earth to be together? Give me more! I was a little skeptical when I first started watching, because I am not a Matt Damon and I had heard some pretty terrible reviews. But I was blown away! I'll admit the plot was rather linear, followed by a seemingly pointless chase scene and a hard to believe first kiss, but I felt that the movie had so much heart and charm that the rest was easy to forgive. I loved the premise and the idea that people could be controlling our destinies, and it really made for an interesting movie. I did feel at times that Matt Damon's character was more in love with the idea that he couldn't have her, rather than that he felt some undefined, intense connection with Elise, but their scenes together were so charming that I couldn't help but giggle and grin from ear to ear. I loved their bantering and I loved their finale kiss even more.

The most beautiful film ever made... In my opinion.,"The main reason why this is such a great movie is because how far Matt Damon's character is willing to go to be with the love of his life, Emily Blunt's character. The acting in this movie is also amazing. Matt Damon and Emily Blunt's chemistry was great and needed to be great to make the film make sense. Terrence Stamp's big monologue scene was awesome and literate, making George Nolfi officially one of my favorite writers of all time (along with Aaron Sorkin and Ehren Kruger and some others). Anthony Mackie needs to be in more movies, proved his acting is great.There's also the cool thing that this movie is the most non-violent thriller film ever made! There are no guns even shown in this film! That is new! The only violent parts that I recall are two punches and one scene where Matt Damon trips violently. That's it! The rest of the movies is just big bad-ass chase sequences.It's a romance movie too that is tied in with an extremely cool and original sci-fi concept written by the greatest sci-fi author of all time in the 50's, Philip K. Dick. I plan to read the short story soon, and from all the bad comments (which amaze me!) must be completely different from this movie. Maybe there's no romance or something. I personally thought that it made the film more intriguing and it fit well. I liked it.This is the date movie of the year! (Avoid Beastly) And, it is a date movie that girls AND guys will like. That almost never happens! The last time I saw that was in The Fountain.Okay, I take back what I said in the summary. The Fountain is the most beautiful film ever made. This holds a close second, though.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! The best movie of the year so far!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

There were countless books written and movies shot about destiny and our ability to control it, but never before have I seen such a simplistic, idiot-proof, insulting to the intelligence, take on this topic.Damon delivers one of his most bland performances to date, and is not helped by a lackluster script and a boring, linear storyline. This half-hearted effort couldn't have made it as an episode of the twilight zone, let alone a feature length movie.A movie can be intelligent, interesting, involving, fun, entertaining, actually it can be almost anything...

Watch the movie!,"OK! I agree with many comments here.

It synthesizes complex cosmological teachings and crosses the aisles of partisanship dividing the religions and beliefs of this world.Symbolism is used to convey messages deeper than what they may appear on the surface. The archetypes presented in these scenes are flexible enough to be adapted to many demographics.

"Never pulls you in because It's too Shy to Take Risks,","The Adjustment Bureau is a mediocre movie with a storyline that never really goes anywhere interesting for its audience, despite a cast that do try their very best with what they are given. The chemistry between Matt Damon and Emily Blunt is undeniable, they are without a doubt the movies highlight, as their love is very believable, I would like to see them on screen together again. The biggest issue is that it's literally afraid to keep it's story moving, it's as if the writer was not sure what to do next, so he simply kept lingering till the movie was over. The film had a huge promise with this secret, very shady organisation, but it never expends on this idea that would have been exciting and intriguing for the audience. As for the main characters relationship, it's underdeveloped, like the story, it never moves forward, I did not find myself knowing more about their relationship by the end of the movie as I did at the start. While the performances are good and it has some nice moments, the Adjustment Bureau simply had too many missed opportunities to recommend.An organisation begin to keep a man away from a woman he desires.Best Performance: Matt Damon",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Are some higher beings managing our lives or not? See this movie and decide for yourself,"My dear friend in Slovakia was often in our frequent discussions bringing up and emphasizing the same theme: ""So how is that? Is someone managing everything in our lives and the society from behind the scenes, or not? Are we simply puppets in their big games?"" I was always asking him who are they and called his philosophy ""theyismus"". Also, it is fashionable now in some new age circles and speculative movements claim that we are subjects living in someone's video game. This 2011 movie, with Matt Damon and Emily Blunt, by the way quite similar to Matrix series, is giving you opportunity to think about it and also think a lot about a free will. Is the free will unlimited, limited or we do not have it at all, it may be just an illusion? Is the free will a gift from Creator or creators, as high official of The Adjustments Bureau in the movie is claiming: ""We tried the free will before, but we took it away because you did not deserve it."" So, dear reader, is any difference between the claims that God sometimes defined by fundamentalist religions as a person sitting on the cloud planning, managing and controlling everything, or Chairman in the movie leading The Adjustment Bureau, or higher being playing a video game with us as pawns?

"Totally watchable, completely enjoyable","We all have our own A' list of movies we're happy to watch over and over.
These days we can load up a movie and pretty much instantly skip to the scenes, even the exact lines, we most love.
When Matt Damon and Emily Blunt first meet is one of those scenes, for me.There's nothing unique about The Adjustment Bureau - it is after all a take on a great 60's sci-fi short by Philip K Dick.Zero body count, zero swearing, a couple of punches, and lots of men wearing very cool Trilby hats. It's entirely family-friendly (apart from those punches if that's a thing). It does question God, but in a way that's understandable.It's also superbly cast. Damon, Blunt, Stamp, Mackie and Slattery all make their parts consummately believable.But the key to it all is the chemistry between Emily Blunt and Matt Damon.
The scene where they first meet is superbly shot, despite its ridiculous setting. I've watched the whole movie maybe half a dozen times, and that scene never fails to get me. It's one of those ultra-rare moments when I think ""No, they're not really acting. They can't be. It looks too real...""So cast your critique nature aside, sit your SO down (or don't), grab a beer/glass of wine/whatever floats your boat, and just enjoy.Because TAB is a thoroughly enjoyable evening's entertainment which will leave you feeling.. yeah.

Going in Circles,"In my mind, Philip K. Dick is pretty much the greatest science fiction author ever. From his pen we've received an onslaught of works that have been spun into classic movies: Blade Runner, Total Recall, and Minority Report are just a few examples. Recently, his story of an up- and-coming Senatorial candidate who finds himself the observer of men who carefully organize mankind's existence so that it pans out in very specific ways was released on Blu-ray/DVD. It's nicely directly and features some solid performances, but the screenplay is full of holes—so many, in fact, that it bears asking whether or not the thing was even finished when it ended up in the hands of director George Nolfi.As indicated, The Adjustment Bureau is—for the most part—science fiction. One might classify it as a fantasy, though elements of both are present. More than anything, though, it's a love story. When the previously mentioned politician is prevented from carrying out a relationship with a girl he bumped to after losing his most recent election bid, he does everything he can to defy the ""powers that be."" Our protagonist feels driven (by nothing more complex than deep-seeded love) to spend his life with a girl he'd met only once, even after he's informed that his ""plan"" calls for him to assume much higher duties that don't involve said romantic interest (he is, in fact, scheduled to one day become President). Mr. Damon wants none of this, however, if he can't have the girl.And that's the plot. Damon's character darts around NYC, eluding obstacles placed along his route by the trench coat men of the enigmatic Bureau, occasionally exchanging dialogue with a rogue agent who believes the whole thing is a faulty endeavor. The philosophical and religious explorations related to free will are certainly thought-provoking, but these are never mined to their full extent. Likewise, we're never given any concrete information about what the Bureau really is (and who its members really are). Are they spiritual entities? Aliens? Trans- dimensional beings? We never know, and these questions end up being more burdensome than any grander subtext that the screenwriters tried to weave into the script.A lot of people would likely say that worrying about the origins of the Bureau is criminal, as that's not really the focus of the film. I'd respond by saying there's some truth to that, but the minimalist philosophical dabbling of the story coupled with the ""yeah, right"" factor that ultimately arises from the presence of the all-knowing men in black is too problematic to ignore.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Multi talented, he delivered on all fronts with strong acting.The plot of the movie while not very complicated, invokes thoughts and questions into life and how we are possibly watched by 'guardian angels' through life. A smart delivery of many important attributes of life packaged in a romantic storyline. Also how our little actions may change the course of our life, leading us in uncharted waters. A pursuit of what society deems is right or what are our hearts and passions tell us to do.This is a great show though perhaps not Oscar category but watch it for it's great acting, a light hearted love story and a post movie digest of one's life journey and our dilemmas.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Love story with perfect dosage of sci-fi.,"This movie inspired me so much that I decided to write my first review ever. Love in real life is so tricky and we can never tell what we risk for when we meet that one person. That one and only who really makes us feel like we don't need anything else in the world. That is perfectly shown in this movie, it shows how unpredictable we can act when we are afraid about ourselves and even more how we are afraid to hurt person who we are falling for, how sometimes we can be afraid that we can stop each others dreams from happening just by being together. But also it shows that together people can change each other's dreams of life. Change what we want and prove that love can show that there can be also other dreams, dreams that can make You forget what actually maybe other people would really were expecting from You. Instead of that You can always follow Your heart and there are tons of paths that can be completed together. Fantastic characters with good backstories. Beautiful, thrilling and positive.

Getting things straight,"This intriguing film is based upon a short story by science fiction writer Philip K. Dick entitled 'Adjustment Team', which alas I have not read. Several of Dick's tales have made it onto the screen, including BLADE RUNNER (1982), TOTAL RECALL (1990), and MINORITY REPORT (2002). He is a very cinematic author. Lest anyone get the wrong idea about his surname, it does not mean what you think, but is the German word meaning 'thick'. However, Dick was not thick either. So perhaps we had better drop that line of discourse. He must have been teased enough while he was alive, and why should he have to endure it now that he has been dead for 31 years? (He died at the age of only 53, a great loss to science fiction.) Here we have a film where the lead, Matt Damon, is allowed to do more than merely run, jump, shoot, and flee. Here he gets to do a bit of acting too, always welcome. And at his side is the sleek, alluring, and let's face it rather mysterious Emily Blunt. How and why can she be so different? Let's hope she never gets 'adjusted' and remains an elusive dryad, which is how she comes across. (I wonder if these Blunts are descended from the famous Blounts, Sir Henry being one of the great pranksters of the 17th century, and his nephew Charles stirring things up even more by publishing books about reincarnation, to drive the clergy wild with frenzy and rage, always a fun thing to do.) And those of us who are MAD MEN addicts (see my review) can only be thrilled to see one of our favourite actors, John Slattery, slatterying his way through the film with his inimitable style (I won't call him a dryad, but he too is one of those people who is different from all the others). How did Slattery perfect his droll style? An interesting subject for investigation. As for the story, well, anyone who has watched all five seasons of the amazing TV series FRINGE (see my review), will be familiar with observers in hats who come from another dimension. Of course, Emily Blunt comes from another dimension too, but that's a different kind of dimension, known as the Indescribably Fascinating Woman Dimension, which is not parallel to but is orthogonal to the Male Dimension (males and females forming two axes at right angles to each other which occasionally intersect, or so the mathematicians might try to convince us, though I myself doubt it and think that an asymptote is the best we can ever hope for.) It seems that there are these higher powers who want things amongst us humans on earth to go according to 'the Plan', and they occasionally have to make slight adjustments and intervene in our affairs. Matt Damon, scamp that he is, catches them doing this one day and they tell him that if he ever blabs, he will be toast, since humans aren't supposed to know about what goes on behind the scenes like that. Damon was supposed to be with Blunt, but then 'the Plan' changed, and she was written out of the script by the men in hats. But Damon is having none of that. (And what sane man would?) So he just won't give up and keeps pushing and pushing, insistent that he loves Blunt, or to be Blunt about it, cannot live without her. This makes life hell for the men in hats, one of whom turns renegade and assists Damon, just like the character called September in FRINGE. The film is really excellent, well done, and the silly things like the hats are accepted because the whole thing just sweeps you along, and what difference does a silly hat make when you are really concerned about Damon and Blunt, freedom, true love, and all those things we hold dear, not to mention holding Blunt and calling her 'Dear'. And aren't those amusing doors that you can open in this film and step through and enter what they call 'the Substrate', so that if you are in New York, as all these people are, you can go direct from 5th Avenue to 10th Avenue in an instant (not that any sensible person would ever want to go to 10th Avenue, much less the sub-acqueous 15th Avenue which is beneath the Hudson River and most people don't know about except those with gills) simply by stepping through a kind of wormhole. Funny how John Wheeler's wormholes have entered into public culture like that, so that even Matt Damon and Emily Blunt can pass through them as easy as you please in order to try to defy 'the Plan' and stay together. Will they succeed? How can they possibly do so with all the paranormal forces arrayed against them? Or can True Love truly conquer all? This film really is a 'good 'un'. Oh yes, and the director is George Nolfi, who also wrote the screenplay. It was his first film as director, so let's see lots more, please. Apparently his next will be about meeting a mysterious woman on Facebook. And speaking of which, I just did a Facebook name search and there he is. I propose to coin a new adjective: nolfacious, to describe a Nolfi film. Let's hope that all his films from now on will be relentlessly nolfacious, blunt, and with a matt finish, and will all have a MAD MEN star. What about Christina Hendricks next time? She's prettier than Slattery and just as droll. She can contact me on Facebook anytime, and I promise to 'friend' her without delay and reach out to her through a wormhole, defying time and space in both nolfacious and a dickian manner. (Which reminds me, one of Wheeler's collaborators on wormholes was R. H. Dicke, but he was also no thickie.) In order to appreciate movies nowadays, you must study geometrodynamics.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Diet Bulworth and Manic Pixie Dream Girl Literally Outrun Fate with a Hat,"We open as Matt Damon, a surefire candidate for senator, is familiarized to us via a pretty uninspired hodgepodge that includes the as-themselves cameos we now wait for in politically themed films, to provide what might misguidedly be referred to as realism. But he loses his lead and, rehearsing his concession speech in a hotel restroom, discovers Emily Blunt hiding from security. Instantly attracted to each other, of course, they kiss before being interrupted, of course. But, inspired by this stranger's generic advice, he makes a truly candid speech that revitalizes his ratings. But he ends up falling for that fleeting woman, becoming increasingly distracted from his career, despite mysterious men collaborating to keep them apart.Yes, they're agents of fate itself, so the lovers must either literally outrun it, or accept a predetermined path, which, ironically, the story unashamedly does almost from the get-go. And in due course, a characteristically paranoid Philip K. Dick tale about the easily broken textile of reality is reassessed as a comforting parable about true love's fortune and the correctness of the divine plan. This reassessment aspires to induce the intense visceral emotion of a high-flying romance that exceeds time, space and the natural order of things, but George Nolfi's writing is short of the crisp, relevant impact such material needs, which it isn't anyway when you already have a brilliant Dick story there's no legitimate worldly reason to substitute! And yet, the film still uses Dick's name, basically as an advertisement. Nolfi takes Dick's idea and runs, letting go of pages along the way, until he's left with only a torn title page, and a strained adjoining of two reasonably agreeable, remarkably featureless individuals that rouses none of the profound, awe-inspiring excitement essential in a storyline so deep in philosophy and metaphysics. Their rebellious romance never even moves much past the convention of the contrived encounter of two potential lovebirds in serendipitously unusual circumstances, followed by the contrived interval of mopey separation. It's but one de rigueur element of a script that grapples for a consistent shape, even resorting to Magical Negro and Retro Chic clichés, to significantly be about more than beautiful people fleeing from badass-looking bureaucrat-style villains through an expressive cityscape.After the initial disappointment in the film's resorting to manipulative schmaltz, its social implications are no surprise. Whenever Blunt and Damon are broken away, he takes for granted that, unless he can find her again, he'll never see her again. Sure, it's hard to find a woman in NYC when you know nothing more about her than her first name. It's a comparatively trouble-free achievement, however, to locate a superstar Senate nominee. But regardless of the movie's depiction of Blunt as an independent, progressive chick, she never takes any enterprise in any way to reconnect with the love of her life, nor does it ever dawn on anyone that she could. When Damon loses her number, she sulks for three years! When he's forced to forsake her in a hospital, she waits, brokenhearted, for 11 more months. This one-sidedness is made unmistakable when a divine courier praises Damon for his determination against all chances and then praises Blunt for, well, going along. This rare dud in the fight-the-system disposition of films portrays itself as a tribute to forging one's own future, provided, namely, that you happen to be a guy.But the point is that Dick's musings on celestial formalities have a mischievous, sardonic tone, and Nolfi's gratuitous revamping is less effective. The trilby hats, which grant extraordinary powers when worn by the members of the Bureau, and later the hero, are particularly difficult to take seriously! They're incapable of crossing interdimensional doorways that convey them instantaneously across Manhattan unless they're wearing, yes, their hats. But to be fair, on the whole, the script forces gullibility not with its offbeat imagination but with its dull particulars: We can't buy that security is in dogged search of this clearly harmless uninvited guest, nor, to name another plot point, are we persuaded that Damon's career would be wrecked by media hype about him mooning his college friends. If you're going to botch Dick, at least be as consistent as Dick.This movie is for those who want to have their fate both ways. The movie sustains the notion that an omnipotent ""Chairman"" has a plan for our existence, yet this plan is not so inflexible that it excludes freedom. And yet when we seem to bring that self-rule to bear, we find we're still sticking to a master plan, one so vast even the ""adjusters"" working at Earth level can't keep a handle on it. Deus ex machina performs such a key function in the way events resolve that it's challenging to leave feeling anything other than resentful, like a potential piece of brilliance has been unkindly run off with.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Some people's Complaints... Unjustified and Facts Wrong,"Warning Spoilers!!! I am not saying this is a great film. I was disappointed a bit, but this film is still good. First off, I want to set a few things straight on here. When David lost Elise's phone #. He rode the same bus day after day after they destroyed her #. One commenter said he rode the same bus 7 years to find her (claimed that was too unbelievable), then he happened to see her on the street. First off, this commenter is WRONG, it was ONLY 3 YEARS. He took the same bus the day he met her, so perhaps it was on his way to his and her work anyway????? (I've run into a few people in Manhattan on random days, I live on Long Island, so, I'm not there every single day like them). As to why they keep meeting up, it was not just ""chance"". As that poster claimed. If you paid any attention, The ""Adjustment Bureau"", ""Angels"", or even ""Aliens"" (not mentioned who they are exactly), whatever you wish to call them finally realized they ""made a plan"" several times, for them to meet MANY times in the past. In these other ""PLANS"", they were mean't to be together, until ripples from other plans, caused new plans and they were decided to finally be apart by the ""Chairman"". This is why they have a strong connection, and keep finding each other. This movie could have been a deeper. But, they made it all pretty clear. Plus the Chairman is always someone knew, so the one who helped him I believe was the chairman.... he gave Matt his hat, yet still ended up on the rooftop with closed doors. If they can change entire paths all over the world, they can help them both achieve their goals if they wanted. I believe that man who helped David, was the chairman and will help them with a new plan. But posters, please don't change the story, like him riding the bus for 7 years instead of really 3, and pay attention, like how ""they"" realized David and Elise are constantly drawn together from all the previous plans. One more thing someone mentioned the hats were corny, yet if you paid attention at the end, the guy Harry who was helping them said it changes from hats to other things, right now it's hats that opens the doors.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Solid Action/Romance with a Few Forgivable Flaws,"I must admit – I was a little intimidated with the prospect of seeing director/screenwriter George Nolfi's 'The Adjustment Bureau'. Fresh off the heels of my 'Inception' experience a few weeks ago, I was fairly well convinced I would leave the theater a quivering pile of confused brain mass, too ashamed to reach out for answers. But 'The Adjustment Bureau' did not go the way of 'Inception' in that its sole purpose was apparently not to play kickball with the viewers' sense of reality and leave you so befuddled you'd be questioning your ability to make rational judgments for weeks to come. No, 'The Adjustment Bureau' (A/B) was a kinder, gentler foray into the genre of reality-bending thrillers. Truthfully, to call The 'A/B' a thriller would be about as accurate as calling 'It's a Wonderful Life' a Christmas film. It will undoubtedly be categorized that way, mostly for the sake of categorization, but at its heart, it's an unapologetic romance. Matt Damon (David Norris) and Emily Blunt (Elise Sellas) star as two hapless souls who may or may not be destined for one another – if they could only have a moment's solitude to figure that out. They're besieged by a mysterious group of men in hats who call themselves The Adjustment Bureau, and they've been charged with keeping David and Elise apart for reasons of which they themselves aren't really sure. Loosely explained, The Adjustment Bureau functions as a kind of metaphysical CIA – they exist to ensure that the actions of human beings go according to plan. The way it's explained is that human beings have free will about the inconsequential things, but for matters of great import, well, those decisions are much too weighty to be left up to chance. When Norris reminds one of the Bureau members that the world is plenty screwed up even with their intervention, he quickly retorts, ""If we left it up to you, there would be no earth at all."" So David and Elise spend the entirety of the film attempting to shirk the influence of Fate Personified. These men in menacing dark suits and ubiquitous fedoras possess limited abilities to control the physical world, and are able to intuit the next logical action their subjects will take without having the ability to read minds. They are all in possession of little black books that chart out their subjects' life maps in real-time. Which is why it's confounding that in the first 15 minutes of the film, Matt Damon's character, innocently enough, manages to give them the slip, and stumbles upon some secret information about their organization that puts both he and Blunt's characters in peril. Suffice to say, The A/B needs better security. With so many resources, and help from 'on high', how, oh how could they be so easily foiled by someone who's not even attempting to acquire behind the scenes knowledge of their organization? I couldn't help but think that mistakes like that must happen all the time in a secret organization where employees haven't quite figured out how to lock doors. For reasons that were never explained, The A/B only seems to be concerned with the activities of those residing in New York City. Apparently, there are very few fate-altering decisions that are made outside of Manhattan proper. Go figure. There also seems to be a lack of enforcement of the Celestial Equal Opportunity Employment Act (assuming such an act exists), being that there are apparently no women who can be entrusted with guiding the decisions of mankind (or womankind, if you will). Nevertheless, The A/B has a lot going for it. For starters, its star, Matt Damon has enough charisma to carry the film from start to finish. He and Blunt work well on screen together, although I never felt truly invested in their romance. The A/B seems to suffer from the same ailment that plagues so many psychological dramas – how do you keep your audience informed about the premise of the film, while still leaving room for the human elements that cause the viewer to make an emotional investment? I'm not sure that The A/B has quite solved that conundrum. I found myself rooting for the Damon/Blunt characters, only because I knew I was supposed to – not necessarily because I 'believed' in them as a couple. Likewise, there were times where I felt as though the premise was being hastily explained to leave room for plenty of drama/romance/action. As Oprah likes to say, ""You can have it all, but you can't have it all at the same time."" That fact becomes quite evident when a film like The A/B tries to cram so much 'film' into one film. Thankfully, screenwriter Nolfi didn't resort to 'mile-a-minute' dialogue to cover more ground than he was capable of covering in the film's 1 hr, 39 min. runtime. What we're treated to is a genuinely earnest film that encourages the viewer to believe that in the end, love really does conquer all. David and Elise are repeatedly ripped apart by Fate, only to continue making an effort to find one another again. I have to admit that this sort of film is right up my alley. Scripts that play around with concepts of reality/fate/truth/the afterlife/time travel in an intelligent way tend to speak to me without having to say very much. As long as I'm not able to drive a Delorian through the potholes, I'm golden. If you're a fan of films such as Men in Black, Sliding Doors, Serendipity and even Monsters, Inc. and Wizard of Oz, you're likely to find yourself in welcome territory. Sure, the film veers off into some corny/preachy moments towards the end, but overall, I was captivated, interested and entertained.

Chick-flick Inception Matrix,"Matt Damon and Emily Blunt give good performances in this rather hollow love story sci fi movie in which the two have to face down some giant conspiracy getting in the way of their love. Considering its premise of presenting an underground cabal of guardian angels (?) steering humanity in certain directions, it feels rather low-stakes throughout. The universe of the film bends and weaves to acomodate the plot for the characters to the point where there's no tension whatsoever.There are scenes in which the film really shines, such as when Damon walks into a room he shouldn't and sees his boss getting mind-wiped, along with Terence Stamp's intriguing (albeit ethnocentric) speech on human history. However, the movie revolves more than anything on the romance between Damon and Blunt, and while the two have chemistry, it's just not believable that such a beautiful woman with no perceivable character flaws would be so eager to go back to a guy she spent only a few hours with months and years after he ditches her. The decision-making the second time around comes off as hilariously preposterous, with her resistant to cave into his persistence for all of 1 minute.While a movie with this sort of plot could easily feel bleak, dark, and violent, the makers decided to go the sunny route and keep everything brightly lit, nobody gets hurt, nobody uses dirty words, and nobody ever really seems that scared of anything. It's a film that could have invested in and created a lot of drama and thrills but instead just feels like lightweight fluff. Fast-moving and inoffensive but completely forgettable, Adjustment Bureau makes for a good date movie but not much else.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Simply Fantastic!,"Basically, I didn't' know what was going to happen in the plot, I thought it would be another one of those tiring political thrillers, but it's completely upside down, I didn't expected that it would be so different and that the next minutes of watching this film would be another great experience. This film is plain fantastic. This is an outstanding romance/sci-fi film, without being too romantic and too science fictional. It isn't perfect, there might be some plot holes, but I just got tired of finding one in this film, because it appears all my questions had disappeared right after it ended, and when I though about it again my questions were answered when I tried to investigate deeper. Just one question remains, were they that advance in technology during early times, were they using those notebooks way way back then. But that question is just for being curious. But if you find one or more plot holes, I will remind you that there isn't a perfect plot, especially if it's a complicated one, so why spend so much time finding a smudge in a plot when you can't even start up your own beautiful idea. This film reminds me of Wings of Desire and Bruce Almighty, and a little bit of Dark City. I love fantasy or science fiction films that doesn't detach itself from reality, for example Nolan's Inception, these kind of films can build up a notion in your mind that maybe it's real, it's not impossible in a world like this, yes it can be true, but no one knows, and it's more likely to be impossible but it can be possible nonetheless. Now, The Adjustment Bureau is a heart-pumping suspense thriller too, it goes so far for being an adrenaline rush without using any type of guns at all, which is unusual in action movies. But can it be called an action movie, I wouldn't call it one, but it's far more exciting than trigger-happy action movies. The running scenes are far more better than car chases. I will not elaborate the story, but it does have a religious blend. But what I like about it very much is, it didn't advertise nor did it destroy one's faith. It's just fair. It's engaging, moving, affecting, sometimes a bit hilarious, and there is a point that it's a bit depressing too, it's an edge-of-your-seat thriller, and it is insightful too, all these great things in one film. I love the story, the plotting, the writing, and directing, it's not the greatest film, but why should I not rank it among the best. I will not let any critics or friends influence me in the way I rate a film or a movie, I'm going to be honest from now on. I love this kind of work, it rejuvenates my soul, it makes me smile inside, it's a relief from a hard life, and the stress is gone for a while. I love great films. I can't, I wouldn't let anyone stop me from watching films.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

A love story wrapped in a blanket of Phillip K Dick,"Based on a short story by Philip K Dick,this movie presumes that our fate is controlled by a squad of sharply-dressed men with orders to keep the time line.David Norris (Matt Damon) is a opportune politician from a difficult background, who suffers a hitch in a New York senatorial election when pictures emerge of some youthful indiscretion. While practicing his concession speech, he comes across Elise (Emily Blunt), an impetuous dancer. The chemistry between them spurs him to make an impromptu speech which elevates his chances in the next election.Having let Elsie leave without finding out who she is, he sets out to find her only to be thwarted by the adjustment bureau who stop at nothing to keep the lovers apart.Norris's persistence at trying to find Elise provokes the interest of the upstairs brass. Spelling out their goals to help make him president and for Elsie to become a famous dancer, they confide in him about who they are. The price to be payed is for them to be kept apart at all costs. Bizarrely. Norris continues to peruse Elsie and pays little attention to the enormity of the revelations of the adjustment bureau.Hardly a flawless effort but what's intriguing here is that this is inherently a love story wrapped in a blanket of Phillip K Dick, with Damon doling out the charm and Blunt a good mix of feisty and frivolous as they deal with the gray men of the bureau.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

It starts promisingly, and to its credit, the lead performances are strong and the chemistry worked.

When Bad Execution Happens to a Decent Premise,"What could have been a nifty, high-concept premise is hampered by poor execution in this supernatural thriller starring Matt Damon and Emily Blunt.The religious angle is pushed a little too hard for my personal taste, but I could even have swallowed that if it hadn't been couched in a lame script that spends half of its time delivering plot exposition straight up to the audience. There are a thousand plot holes throughout the movie that had my wife and I rolling our eyes with exasperation, and most of them are admittedly nicely resolved by the ending. But though I liked the resolution the movie came to -- and the message about the role free will plays in the lives of men -- a good movie doesn't make its audience wait until the very last scene to convince them that it's not just a stupid and badly-written piece of disposable junk.Emily Blunt is appealing as always, but her character is terribly annoying (I would have slapped her right around the time she dunked my cell phone in a cup of coffee), and Matt Damon is serviceable but unmemorable.

Basically it is about dead-serious Men in Black, so you've got a pompous metaphysical backdrop that bogs down the entire movie (obviously since it is the premise from Philip K. Dick's short story). This is a similar mistake as the one they made with Dark City: this is not sci-fi enough or fantasy enough.Seriously who thought there was room for a movie, let alone a good one, about a police force with absolute power on the course of our lives? The moment the hero is told about this the whole story falls flat because it is a goddamn gigantic hole that they would let him know without resetting him the minute after, and even if they thought he was worth the dare it would take sloppiness over sloppiness from the AAA+ uptight Adjustment crew to let a prominent profile slip through its claws. A hero chased by some obscure force, this could make a fine noir movie, but a clear 'Hats-n-Doors' overwhelming organisation??? There simply is no story.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
This movie desperately needs an adjustment,"After watching this movie I'm unlikely to watch any other soon.What happened today is that on a summer evening I went to search for some good sci-fi movies. Confident in that it's hard to turn a good script into crappy movie, I looked for anything based on Philip Dick novels. And boy, how wrong I was! It's incredible how a decent sci-fi story got stripped off all the scientific bits and turned into a nonsensical love tale full of clichés and moronic dialogues.I find most hilarious that in the original story there's in fact a very good reason offered for the adjustment in question, whereas the movie leaves the viewer in puzzlement, never explaining how the future events would be connected.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Doesn't Stand Out In Any Way,"If you don't watch a lot of movies, ""The Adjustment Bureau"" will be an entertaining ride. If, like me, you've ""seen 'em all"", this one does not stand out in any way, shape, or form.For a basic plot summary, ""Adjustment Bureau"" tells the story of David Norris (Matt Damon) and Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt), two lovers seemingly destined to be together. However, a mysterious group of derby-wearing men in suits (known only as the Adjustment Bureau) do all they can to prevent the coupling in order for the world to stay on ""the plan"".The main problem with this movie is that it tries to be so many different things and doesn't succeed at any of them. It's a romance, but without romantic tension. It's an action flick, but with no effects or chase scenes that stand out. It's a philosophical piece, but with little time to really dig in. It's a paranormal romp, but without any explanation in the end. Basically, it's one of those movies where the lead characters run around a lot, emote a tad, and end up with a very contrived, unappealing climax for the effort.Thus, while ""The Adjustment Bureau"" doesn't outrightly fail at anything (hence the two star rating as opposed to one), it doesn't really succeed at much, either. Unless you don't get out much, skip this effort and find something that really works.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Don't waste your time on this garbage,"What started out as a good movie, or a good idea for a movie, quickly retrograded into a Martin Luther King styled, racially charged, action movie pitting a group of White, and/or establishment angels against a black angel. If the producers of this movie are bent on making racial statements, I suggest they next champion an African Mountain Gorilla as their hero in a film. It would be cheaper to produce, and no one would waste any money on it.Some of the actors must not have much sense to volunteer for a film such as this. I agree with a previous reviewer who stated this movie is someone's idea of religious propaganda.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Big Letdown,"I went into this movie with high hopes. I usually enjoy Matt Damon's acting and the trailers made this movie out to be an exciting Sci-Fi thriller.The movie starts out well enough but it never seems to get going. The plot is separated by a few convenient flash forwards where the characters seamlessly pick up right where they left off. This gives the film a lack of flow and was probably a byproduct of lazy screen writing. The plot just never gets that interesting, even the chase scene's are short and uninteresting.The plot basically boils down to the love story between Matt Damon and Emily Blunt's characters with the interesting Sci-Fi aspect as a framework. The relationship never seems to get to deep which left me not caring whether or not they ended up with each other in the end.Matt Damon did a pretty good job considering the mediocre script. His character, however, was very flat. The dialogue is very uninteresting and the back stories are lazily pasted in in an attempt to give the characters some depth.I thought this movie would at least succeed to entertain me with slick action and a mind-bending story line. However it turned out to be just a badly written typical Hollywood love story.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Match Made - and Interrupted - in Heaven,"I know how revered Phillip K. Dick is among the sci-fi community, so I'll not offend, other than to say I wasn't taken in. Based on his short story, 'The Adjustment Team', this film follows other film adaptations of his books, notably 'Blade Runner' and 'Minority Report'.Prior to going on stage, David Norris (Matt Damon) encounters Elise (Emily Blunt) in the gents. She's an unauthorised guest at his campaign rally (he's running for Senate) and is hiding there. The pair hit it off immediately. Minus a parting kiss, their interaction is non-physical, but deliciously seductive. Beguiled by Elise's sweet- nothings, Norris ignores his carefully rehearsed, meticulously researched speech and speaks from the heart. And it's a cinematic sucker-punch.Thing is, they weren't supposed to meet. That's where the sci-fi kicks in. The Adjustment Bureau are God's angels, although they are coy about saying so. They busy themselves ensuring that every person's plan – that's their life plan – goes according to plan. They intervene whenever it seems someone is going off plan by making 'adjustments'.For servants of the Messiah, the Bureau's powers are dubiously limited and conditional. They're a bunch of Inspector Clouseaus. They don't even have good dialogue ('It doesn't matter how you feel', one Bureau member says to Norris, 'What matters is what's in black and white'). Good Lord!AB members live 'a little longer than humans', can't exact too many adjustments, can't exact any adjustments near water and can't even answer Norris when he asks (many times to allow them to confer and get back to him) why they are so interested in his plan. When AB head Terrence Stamp finally answers, we're so unconcerned that we want there to be an adjustment to end the film.Beneath all the bull, like the ramblings on free will, there's tenderness. Damon never stops searching for Elise, never stops overcoming the hurdles the Bureau put in front of him. He's like Indiana Jones whizzing around New York via special doors, accessible by wearing a Bureau fedora. Damon's chemistry with Blunt recalls the chemistry he had with Vera Farminga in 'The Departed', but with a higher bonding of electrons and neutrons.If 'The Adjustment Bureau' is sure it's a sci-fi film, it should be taken with salt. Watch it as a rom-com instead - that's where the real fantasy lies.www.scottishreview.net",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Sometimes an idea is not enough,"Especially in Science Fiction, to have a great idea is not enough. You have to build a story around that idea, cause if you don't, then the whole picture feels like it's out of place. I think this move was originally a great idea that didn't work just because they didn't find a good story to tell around it. As a result, when I watched it I felt it was too unreal. When you are in front of a good sci-fi movie, you really don't stop to think if it could be true, but you think yourself ¨what an amazing story¨. That doesn't happen here. Here, the guys with hats, the doors, and the whole fantastic environment around a real city feels like out of place. Feels like if in Driving Miss Daisy suddenly the car flies away. Good crazy ideas with great stories: Matrix, Inception, Stranger than Fiction, Cold Souls, The 13th Floor and Dark City (among others). The Adjustment Bureau is not in that group.

I have not read the reviews but judging from the rating I think people loved this empty sorry excuse for a movie. If it was a book It would not sell.

Creative mediocrity involving time-travelling c*ck-blockers.,"There were so many things going for The Adjustment Bureau that I wracked my brains to work out why I just didn't think much of it.I finally decided upon a two word descriptor: creative mediocrity.The leads Matt Damon and Emily Blunt are both likable and attractive, the cast solid and effective and the plot is clever but not so much that you lose track or interest. But as the credits rolled I thought that as an entertainment experience The Adjustment Bureau existed more than it thrived, and given that the film had some pretty direct similarities and parallels to the superior Source Code, Déjà vu and of course The Matrix this can't be deemed a good thing.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^It turns out that the Powers that be have loosely scripted existence so that for the most part things run a certain way. Of course with any rough draft there are a million things that could happen to prevent Person A arriving at Destination B. An unexpected illness or accident. An inopportune red light. Locusts. A spilt cup of coffee So Destinations C, D, E etc are marked just in case. Call them contingency plans. As long as Person A arrives at one of these things will turn out the way they planned When this doesn't happen they call upon a group of nattily dressed men wearing 40s era hats to perform the necessary adjustments, to make sure things remain on track.David Norris (Matt Damon) is a maverick young political aspirant seemingly destined for bigger things yet hamstring by a checkered past involving one too many alcohol related follies, one of which cost him a vital election.It is while he is preparing his concession speech that he runs into Elise (Emily Blunt) – in a men's restroom no less – and the resulting impromptu meeting leaves quite an impression on them both. David is inspired enough to scrap his tailored speech and give a painfully honest and decidedly non-political version to his waiting crowd, the feedback from the ad-libbed concession is almost universally favourable and garners him more attention.But all David can think about is meeting Elise again After another chance meeting is interrupted by an 'accidental' coffee spill, thus separating he and Elise once again. After which David meets with the strange well groomed men who have performed this unwelcome sci-fi c*ck-block, and he learns much to his horror that he and Elise are not destined to be together.Not only must David refrain from seeing and pursuing this woman, and attempt to do so will result in 'severe consequences'.Now it doesn't take a genius to gather that David won't accept his fate gladly, and the hour or so that follows moves along at a nice pace without ever really blowing your skirt up. There is a lot of running, some breathless plot exposition, and a guy named Harry shows up as David's 'case officer' to help move things along a couple of times.I wanted to like The Adjustment Bureau. I really did. I even started typing this paragraph with the ""I liked parts of"", before realising I really didn't. I took nothing away from this film aside from the fact that all the films I mentioned earlier in this review were far superior to it, and that there was a lot of running while holding hands. And the fact that both Blunt and Damon are likable doesn't change that I'm afraid.Final Rating – 5 / 10. Maybe next time with a few adjustments this film might turn out better. Where are those guys with the nice hats when you need them?",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very Disappointing,"This is the most disappointing movie I have seen in a long time. I knew very little about it before watching it. I purchased it because it was on sale, and it was a sci-fi, thriller, romance with Emily Blunt and Matt Damon with 7.1 stars on IMDb. I figured it had to be good. This movie is more theology than sci-fi, and I assume the message is as offensive to the faithful as to those who do not subscribe to any faith:""Selfishly follow your heart at all costs and everything will work out in the end even if it requires God to change His/Her master plan. Angels are nothing more than old, tired, bumbling idiots with magic hats easily overpowered by smart humans. Angels cannot prevent accidents, but can create circumstances that force the impulsive, brainless idiots who inhabit this planet to make adjustments in their lives.""To the faithful, such notions of God and angels should be offensive. To those who do not subscribe to any faith, the message seems to be, ""We do not have freewill. There are masters of our fate. The only way to gain freewill is to ignore logic and act on impulse."" This message seems equally offensive.Unlike a well done science fiction story, the movie was never able to suspend my disbelief. Each plot twist was so far fetched and unrealistic that it just irritated me more. The resolution increased rather than absolved that irritation.Everything else about the movie was first rate: the acting, editing, special effects, etc. Therefore, I felt compelled to give it more than a single star. However, all the audio visual candy in the world cannot make a poor story worth watching.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

What A Bore!,"The acting in this movie is terrible, the characters are like talking puppets. Matt Damon plays the same guy from Good Will Hunting, the intelligent guy with a pitiable background. Emilly Blunts character is just as stereotypical, playing the struggling artist with a bad girl complex. The bowler hat guys are the worst because they have nothing of interest to say, in fact they all behave the same way, It's like they are there to make you think something is happening, when nothing really is. I don't see the romance between the two main characters, if anything the intimate moments between the two made me cringe. The dialogue between all these characters are not memorable or interesting, obviously the script lets it down.

Could have been better - too confusing - great beginning,"I struggled to get a handle on this sci-fi romance. Is it the meeting of Damon & Blunt's cleft chins? Perhaps, in a reversal of the postmodern revisiting of the 1960s in Mad Men this is Roger Sterling (John Slattery)'s tinkering with the future? No, really, it's just another tepid Philip K Dick adaptation. At its time of release (this week) it's fashionable to say its Bourne (the Damon bit) meets Inception (the magic realism bit). However it bears resemblance to others too - Vanilla Sky (noumenal New York), Minority Report (more Dick), The Thomas Crown Affair (hats), The Matrix (predetermination) and even Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind (sci- fi romance) to name a few (oh, go on then - Orson Welles' The Trial is also in there).Like many mongrel films it ends up being less than the sum of its parts. Though Damon has charisma and John Slattery injects some realist ennui into his deus in machina role, damp, compliant phone-ins from Emily Blunt and Terence Stamp shackle the show. The shortcomings of the cast are entirely of a part with the production - the film doesn't know what it wants to be. It tries to be all of the above, jumping from a scene of *fun* through a door marked *thrills* and then on to another door marked *romance* without backing itself up.

The Vidiot Reviews...,"The Adjustment BureauThe best thing about a secret agency controlling the destiny of humans is that it allows us more time to focus on ""planking"".However, to the political candidate in this sci-fi feature, freewill is paramount.Practicing his speech in a washroom, congressman Norris (Matt Damon) is cornered by a strange woman, Elise (Emily Blunt), who insists he be more candid with the electorate.On her recommendation, Norris finds himself propelled into the senate race.But when he inadvertently encounters a cluster of suspicious looking characters readjusting his friend's brain, he is made privy to a plan by a clandestine company to keep him and Elise from meeting.Adapted from a Philip K. Dick story, The Adjustment Bureau offers interesting exposition on the origins of providence; however, its goofy acting and retro costuming are a misstep.Besides, no one controls humanity's fateexcept for those 3 crones with the spinning wheel.

How many times have they done that?? I'm waiting for an ADULT script to come out from that Hollywood factory. Why is it that practically all their pictures are directed to the fourteen year old crowd?And is a pity, because the film is excellent in all levels, photography, lighting, action, editing, acting..., but the script fails miserably.Entertaining, specially the first half of it, and downwards from then on (precipitously).The following could be interpreted as a *Spoiler*, so (although I hope it isn't, I don't want to be accused of anything) stay away from these following lines if you consider it risky to read them: This movie could have redeemed itself if at least they ended it when he says to her that everything will be all right and ""I'll go to make a telephone call"", not there exactly, but the next scene to this one.

This movie had a lot more of a romance flair to it which ended up working very well between Damon and Blunt. The first half of the movie was written very well and set a great stage only to fall a bit flat during the last half.The direction seemed to lose its sharpness in some of the silly details revealed in the later parts.

An interesting love story with the unnecessary distraction of unrealistic plot elements,"I saw the trailer for this movie and was interested to understand how a plot as implausible as a global, all knowing, and eternal adjustment bureau could possibly be rendered in a believable manner. Further to that, the mechanics of the bureau are played out via a love story, taking place between Matt Damon and Emily Blunt, that threatens to derail the bureau's predestined plan.In watching the movie, I honestly battled with the believability of the plot line and found that rather than adding to the overall script, it detracted from it due to its sheer lack of plausibility, which for me at times bordered on the ridiculous.It is not the first time an all knowing agency has been used as a plot element on the big screen, other notables include Dark City, and the Matrix, however, what those movies are able to do is to create a whole world independent in its laws and physics wherein the characters are developed in such a way as to be believable within those confines.I must admit that the only reason I watched the entire movie was because of the chemistry between Damon and Blunt's characters, and the hope in the back of my mind that the director would eventually succeed in making me understand and believe the bureau's role in the overall plot. Alas, while for some parts of the movie I was able to suspend my belief, ultimately the film did not do enough to convince me.In the end, it felt like the writer was looking to make a love story which asked pertinent questions regarding the balance between life, love, and career but couldn't think of a clever way to do that so they just threw in the adjustment bureau bit.I feel like The Adjustment Bureau would have been a better love story had they only focused on the the relationship between Matt Damon and Emily Blunt.
