Watched 2024 - blown away,"I never saw it in 06, Only just watched it. I am not going to go on about it much. But its relevance to todays world is astounding.The action is impeccably done. The battle scenes are mind numbingly realistic. I still can't believe it was made in 05/06. Characters are so real. The atmosphere the attention to detail in scenes are incredible. Things happening in the background out of focus etc is just another layer of a real world that's been created. A huge epic movie with a hero who doesn't ever shoot a gun.I will give it a week or so and watch it again. The director should've one an academy award.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Highlights of the movie,"OK, I only got through the first 3 pages of comments but let me add my own.1) Fantastic cinematography. Some like hand-held, some don't. It certainly worked very well here.2) Related to (1), very long shots. There is one scene where the camera lens has blood splats on it for quite a few minutes. Hollywood would get rid of it, but for this movie it adds amazingly to the atmosphere that is being created.3) Like ""Code46"" the technology is in the background. Just the way it should be, allowing us to focus on the story.4) Theo as the central character NEVER picks up a gun, despite them being all over the place and easily available. As a viewer you are almost willing him to do so, to manage some of his challenges - but very deliberately the character does not.5) I've read separately that yes this is a comment on current society. Being an Australian, with our controversial immigration laws and practices, that rings true.6) Similar to (5), using the term ""Homeland Security"" in the movie is an obvious reference.7) The revolutionaries/terrorists/fishes are shown to be just as political and militant as the government they oppose.There are more, but that is enough. Overall a wonderful movie which leaves me thinking for a long time, which is all I ask.Cheers!Anton.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""The future's a thing of the past."" Tremendous from start to finish.","The apocalypse arrives on film once again in a plot so simple it's horrifyingly believable. It's 2027 and the world is close to annihilation because no child has been born in 18 years. London office worker Theo (Clive Owen) is offered cash by a radical ex-girlfriend to escort a refugee (Claire-Hope Ashitey) to safety. Their lives are soon at risk from both government and revolutionaries.Although the camera work and cinematography is nothing short of stunning the focus always with our protagonist, ensuring we're kept in the middle of the action throughout. It is also undoubtedly one of Owen's finest performances to date. Theo is never far from danger yet he struggles on with convincing dignity. Occasionally baffled but far from stupid - Theo is essentially a reckless, underplayed action hero that doesn't jump at every opportunity to arm himself with a gun. This works well with the international ensemble of incredible talent: Michael Caine's charming pot dealing hippie, feisty Julianne Moore, key role Claire-Hope Ashitey, the wonderful Pam Ferris, the increasingly busy, excellent Chiwetel Ejiofor, Danny Huston and writer/director/producer Peter Cullen (gloriously sadistic Syd) to name a few... This is surely a casting coup to be jealous of.The episodic nature of the story makes Children of Men difficult to place into one genre alone. Briefly glimpsed futuristic sci-fi technology is grounded in reality and looks entirely achievable while grey, graffiti ridden concrete locations provide an excellent backdrop for the near satirical look of our current social and political climate. There's poignant drama interspersed amongst exhilarating action and yet enough twists to call it a thriller.This is not to say it's flawless. Some exposition is handled better in places than others for instance. However Alfonso Cuarón has achieved a completely remarkable experience. Arguably the film could have been longer given how strong most of it is. The only really hard pill to swallow is the comedy juxtaposed with some stark imagery that looks all too familiar to anyone who has ever seen the News from the past few decades. Nice to see a Pink Floyd reference though (pigs might fly!), and someone finally found a use for Battersea Power Station.Ideally an audience should see this film with no preconceptions and know as little about the plot as possible. This will be unlikely though due to a staggered box-office release schedule, word of mouth and a plethora of reviews and trailers that are eager to give much of the game away. Ironic then perhaps that it must be said - Children of Men is a cinematic milestone. Great special effects and an effective soundtrack accompany this heartfelt, moving and thought-provoking film. Easily one of the best films in recent memory.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A gut-wrenching look at an all too possible future - but also an immensely entertaining thrill ride featuring some of the best cinematography you'll ever see,"I first saw 'Children of Men' when it came out, 10 years ago, and while I liked it a lot, I kind of forgot about it soon. At the time, it failed to resonate with me on a deeper level - which in hindsight I find astounding.Last month, a decade later almost to the day, I suddenly felt the urge to revisit the film (because it was mentioned in an article about ""long takes""), and upon re-watching it, it just blew my mind. This film is so, so, good!It not only manages in many aspects to be the most prophetic - and most shockingly realistic - sci-fi film I have ever seen: it achieves that feat with a level of style and through such an abundance of fantastic creative choices and innovative camera techniques that I was simply left in awe.I was forced to conclude that this film was a visionary piece of art (and how that fact had eluded me the first time around I couldn't - and still can't - explain). It's a cinéphile's dream come true; it's a masterpiece in the true sense of the word.'Children of Men' is a gut-wrenching look at an all too possible future, but it also works as a heart-stopping, adrenaline-rush-inducing piece of entertainment featuring some of the most breathtaking camera work you'll ever see.The performances are flawless. The artwork, the production design, the music; I could go on and on: this is one of those few real masterworks where everything just comes together right. And I believe the final 30 minutes of the film rank among the finest achievements in the history of Cinema.

Utterly transfixed,"I went to see this movie without catching any reviews, expecting something rather depressing and underfunded.Let me stop there and start again.This movie is a revelation from start to finish. A convincing future world, deftly conveyed with so many subtle signals that I'm sure it will benefit from further viewings. A completely ""other"" England which I was amazed to see realised in such detail. Clive Owen FINALLY has the heroic role we have been waiting for and is brilliant in it. Julianne Moore simply glows and I've never enjoyed Sir Michael Caine so much before. The soundtrack is beautifully eclectic. Aside from some excellent classical choices, there's an evocative and alternative Spanish take on ""Ruby Tuesday"" which is a signature on the film. Wait during the end titles to enjoy an excremental song from Jarvis Cocker.The movie grabbed my attention right from the start, and never let go. Initially, it's the differences of this future world that intrigue. Then, when the action starts, what I found really surprising was the freshness of direction that made me react to bullets and violence as if I'd never seen them in a movie before. If the script wasn't so wonderfully leavened with wit, it would be a grim and scary movie at times.Finally, the whole thing is lit brilliantly, from the authentic dim English days to the atmospheric ending.One to watch alongside ""The Handmaid's Tale"" some time....",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Restored my faith in the art of cinema,"I've had a particularly bad film year, especially after having seen one particular over-hyped vacuous mess earlier in the year which all but killed my desire to see any films, no matter how interesting they looked or what the critics said about them. So, it was with a little trepidation that I went to see this, especially given that it starred Clive Owen (IMHO, the George Lazenby of British acting).Well, I loved it and I'm not ashamed. It's unremittingly bleak and violent, but so beautifully filmed and realised that, at one point, I damn nearly burst into tears that someone could have created something so fresh and so moving, so provocative, so disturbing and so grimly beautiful. I thought it brought a real sense of imagination to the screen and that it was possessed of a fantastic visual flair. I felt that it ended on a note of hope, however uncertain and unclear, and certainly a note of redemption for the hero. I'll admit that Owen, while he still hasn't convinced me that he's a great actor, pulls off this role with a hangdog...um, doggedness that I found believable and often even moving.I left the cinema strangely elated, relieved that cinema still has the power to move.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Exemplary direction lifts an offbeat futuristic thriller,"This futuristic thriller disposes of much of the sci-fi jargon we've come to expect from Hollywood films. There are no outlandish gadgets or chases through CGI-created landscapes; CHILDREN OF MEN, based on a novel by P. D. James, is a realistic thriller through and through. It's set in a recognisable dystopia (full of violence, poverty, disease, segregation and warfare) and the story follows a strict 'journey' template, following a group of characters as they travel through myriad locales, suffering death, defeat and adventure along the way. So far, so predictable. However, this film works because it's literate, it's intelligent and the focus is on storytelling over flashy special effects or action nonsense.Mexican director Alfonso Cuaron (HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN) is a force to watch out for on the strength of his work here: this is the best direction I've seen in a long while and the film is chock-full of great tracking shots which really emphasise the excitement and danger around every corner. The view of a future UK is nightmarish and believable and the backgrounds and locations are as much a character as the protagonists themselves.I also enjoyed the fact that the film remains as unconventional as possible as it moves along. Clive Owen, the heroic protagonist, never fires a gun and is definitely an everyman character rather than a hero: he's utterly believable and this is the best role I've seen the actor in yet. Supporting actors are good, but it's the older heavyweights who give the best turns: Julianne Moore, as likable as she's ever been, as a terrorist leader; Pam Ferris as an ally; Michael Caine as an aged John Lennon-type. Chiwetel Ejiofor is also very strong in a minor role. The film does have action, including a ferocious fire fight at the climax, but it's never an action film per se. It's just a great movie that avoids pigeon-holing and never left me bored or underwhelmed once.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not Deserving of its Present Rating,"After reading various reviews and seeing the previews, I was quite excited to see ""Children of Men"". Upon viewing the movie, however, I was unable to see why users were rating it so highly. I believe there is a predilection to highly rate any Futuristic Dystopia, as they graphically transport us to a time that we are ever so interested in -- our not-too-distant future. ""Children of Men"" does this better than most, since -- with the exception of the infertility theme -- it does not highly disconnect us from what our future is likely to be.Other than that, however, the movie lacks what it was claimed to be; it is not ""Bladerunner"" Redux -- not even close. The movie does not operate on multiple philosophical levels, and those attempting to dissect it are having difficulty not because it is especially deep, but because it lacks much beyond its initial layer. As a futuristic thriller (and very graphically violent, at that) it works marginally well, as there were a couple of moments when I felt my heart pitter-patter in that movie-theater way. Outside of that, there is not much going on here, besides the obvious: the world is going to hell and there are too many guns. Get on with it.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Amazing Film. Truly fantastic! Mindblowing...,"I've seen this film and let me tell everyone that it was one of the most pleasurable surprises I've ever had with a film. I hadn't heard about it before and it totally took me by surprise. It blew me away and left me speechless. The acting is excellent by most of the actors, but Michael Caine deserves to receive a special mention for his amazing portrait of the old hippie Jasper. His performance is fantastic and he totally stole the show in the scenes he was in. Claire Hope is also fantastic in the role of Kee. Her performance is quite impressive, especially considering this is one of her first films. Clive Owen is also great as the reluctant hero who sees his life turned upside down and is given a huge responsibility. I've seen him in some other films and he's at his best here. A very good performance, you could feel what he was going through. In the technical aspects the film was brilliant, particularly Alfonso Cuarón's strong and consistent direction that is one of the best things in the film, and contributes a lot to its quality. Also director of photography Emmanuel Lubezki does wonders with images and there are some extremely beautiful shots all done in a naturalistic way, natural lighting, etc. It's an extremely well crafted film that makes you go through the emotional struggle the characters go through and makes you feel that you're in the middle of it all. Besides, it's also an extremely touching story that certainly touched my heart. One of the best films I've ever seen without any doubt.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It Had Potential to be More About Ideas,"The year is 2027 and no one has had a kid since 2009. Consequently, the human race is doomed. Emotions are running high and everywhere the world is falling apart. Conflict, despair, chaos and decay are everywhere. The premise is introduced very well as everywhere people are mourning the death of the world's youngest person - watching the future disappear before their eyes.This film does convey the look and feel of the above quite well through credible character exchanges and technical work. However, the film's potential is hampered by the story - Theo (Clive Owen) trying to secretly transport a miraculously pregnant woman to the shadowy 'The Human Project,' who they have to trust have her best interests at heart as opposed to the openly brutal and corrupt government. Because all of this has to be hidden from the public's eye, the film's potential to explore this extraordinary development is limited to speculation by the small band of people who come to know that the girl is pregnant. So while the decaying world is continually depicted credibly, the film can't really grow and thematically build on its premise.So the film mainly becomes a chase film - trying to transport the girl somewhere while avoiding detection from all sides. This takes away from the uniqueness of the premise and makes the film seem more routine than it should have been. I have to say, though, that the last 30 minutes is quite thrilling as the stakes have been raised so much. The camera following the progress of Theo through the torn-up streets as bullets fly everywhere is a gripping. But for those who want to see this film with the purpose of having grand philosophical discussions afterwards, you'll probably come out disappointed. The film does have things to say, but could have been more.Finally, a couple of things deserve a special mention. The cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki is just outstanding as he throws everything in the book at you - constantly inventive camera work, smoke, light, shade, saturation - so that many of the scenes you just want to frame on your wall. Also, a recurring musical theme from John Tavener's 'Fragments of a Prayer' is also very memorable and fits well.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Fast food sci-fi dressed as gourmet fare but more TV dinner than fresh steak,"Children of Men starts off looking like it'll be a rarity, a good Clive Owen film. It's not that he's suddenly learned to act, just that he's cast as a lifeless drone and that's about within his range. The premise is a bit been there, done that, with another future Britain that's sunk into the twin evils of repressive right wing xenophobia and terrorism, with infertility added into the mix as the raison d'etre. The lack of originality doesn't matter so much since like all ""serious"" sci-fi it's meant to be a mirror into our own times. What does matter is that the film becomes so predictable around the halfway point. Yes, it's another journey through a not-quite-post-apocalyptic landscape hitting every cliché from the Lazy Screenwriter's Book of Plot Points. Look, here's the ex-girlfriend to remind us of the hero's old idealism. Look, here's the aging hippy to show us how much things have changed. Look, here's the mad army officer to provide some threat. It feels too much like it's ordered from a menu and relies too much on the production design and fake documentary camera-work to sell a TV dinner as a fresh steak.The film really falls apart in the end because no matter how right Owen is at the start of the film he's every bit as lifeless by the end because displaying emotions or growth just isn't what he does. You don't care about his character, the few amusing star turns get killed off early and you're just left with a big series of explosions and riots and shootings to wake up the audience who've switched off their emotions by then. And that end looks weirdly like a setup for Owen's next movie where he once again plays bodyguard to a baby people want to kill. At least that one looks like it knows what it wants to be, which Children of Men never quite does. Okay, but you've already seen it.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
This movie remains relevant to this day.,"This is probably one of my favorite movies of all time. I have watched it countless times, and throughout the years, I am constantly reminded of it by current events. From the war in the middle east, to syrian refugee crisis, border camps in the us, and now covid, this film just continues to be relevant to this day.It is masterfully shot and directed. The cinematography is amazing, and the viewer is immersed in an incredibly realistic depiction of the best and worst humanity has to offer when faced with hardship\. Everything is spot on, and I expect this movie to continue to be relevant and we will be reminded of it again in future events to come.If you have not seen it yet, I highly recommend that you do. It is a story about hope and despair, faith and chance, humanity and inhumanity, with incredible ambient world-building and it somehow manages to to be timeless.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A thinking person's thriller,"Alfonso Cuaron has given us a very clever rendering of a very English dystopian novel. P D James, the ""Baroness of Bad"" is famous for her well-written and absorbing police procedural novels (""Inspector Dalgliesh"") but in the early 90s she produced a vision of a world only 20 years into the future in which for unspecified reasons all the women on earth have become infertile and no babies have been born for the last 18 years.The rest of the world has lapsed into chaos but the British, stoically, have put the remainder of their civil liberties into the fire and have settled down under an oppressive dictatorship to ward off foreign boarders and await inevitable extinction, though there are some violent dissidents called the fish.Theo (Clive Owen), a journalist with connections to the top, is ""persuaded"" by his ex-wife and fish member Julian (Julianne Moore) to obtain some exit papers for Kee (Claire Hope Ashity) a young black woman, who, it turns out, is pregnant. Theo is swept up in Kee's escape across a grim decaying landscape. Not only are there the security forces to contend with, but some equally ruthless insurgents. Cuaron builds the tension exquisitely, interspersing the adrenaline fueled bits with quieter bits.Kee' projected saviors are a mysterious group called the Human Project who conveniently sail their well-maintained Greenpeace style ex-North Sea fishing trawler past offshore light buoys in the hope of rescuing the human race. But the improbability of this doesn't matter much because by the end of the movie Cuaron has effectively demonstrated what the world would be like if humankind suddenly stopped reproducing. Having children is our way of cheating death, without them there is nothing but death, and in this future there are none about but the living dead.The casting is pretty well perfect. Clive Owen as Theo puts his haunted good looks to good use as he turns from cynical reporter to a hunted enemy of the state. The motley characters he meets along the way  his ex-wife, the fish rebels, the refugees who help him, the ""fascist pig"" border guard and above all Michael Caine's aging hippie are all wonderfully realized.It has been suggested that Cuaron has really made a film about today, not 20 years into the future. The rampaging security forces we see might as well be in Bosnia or Iraq, or even Northern Ireland. In an age of terrorism, order without law very quickly becomes tyranny, which has never been the answer to terrorism. What he and PD James do demonstrate is just how fragile our civil society is.As a film this is a very fine piece of work. The sets exude grimy Britain, the battles are hair-raising, the quieter moments intense. Cuaron would do a great James Bond movie. He has turned a rather rarefied novel into an exiting and engrossing thriller without obscuring the original message. He is a very versatile and enterprising film-maker and I'm sure he's going to do lots more good stuff.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Electrifying thriller may be best of 2006,"Of all the visions of the future movie audiences have been treated to over the past few years, the world of Children of Men may be the most frightening and allegorically effective yet.Directed by Alfonso Cauron (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban), and set in 2027 London, the film takes place at a time when the planet is in the grip of an infertility crisis. Societies worldwide have collapsed after no children have been born in almost two decades, and the survivors of the ensuing wars, atrocities and civil breakdowns flee to Britain, which still functions under a harsh regime.Clive Owen (Closer, Sin City) plays Theo, a former activist now working as a paper-pusher in the Ministry of Energy and downing a large amount of Scotch to get him through the day. He walks to work past terrorist bombings, cages filled with illegal immigrants rounded up by riot police, and piles of garbage littering the London streets. When an old flame and revolutionary, played by Julianne Moore, appears with a request that he use his governmental connections to help her move a refugee girl across the country, he agrees on the basis he be compensated. When he discovers that the girl (Kee, played by Claire-Hope Ashitey) is pregnant, his mission takes on new dimensions.Cauron and his team of production designers have created what is, perhaps, the most believable vision of the future seen in quite some time. Advanced technology exists side by side with squalor, and is never allowed to steal the audiences attention away from the proceedings for too long. As far as being a realistic portrayal of Britain in twenty years time, the film is light years ahead of last year's disappointing V for Vendetta, which stripped away British iconography and culture and essentially kept London as a rather two-dimensional metaphor for the United States.As a thriller, the film is blisteringly intense and incredibly effective. From the bomb blast that caps off the opening credits to the frenzied urban warfare sequences that dominate the film's closing thirty minutes, Cauron never lets the film lag. Though it slows down enough to deal with character development and exposition, the film maintains a running intensity as Theo and Kee try to stay one step ahead of terrorists, the police, the army and random opportunists. Several action scenes are shot in continuous takes, and make for compelling and electrifying viewing.However, the film works as a socio-political drama as well. Though Cauron's two central messages (that immigrants enrich, rather than threaten, Western society, and that the outlook for human survival is dim when operatives on all sides let ideology displace compassion and good judgment) are strongly put, he is never so heavy-handed that they dominate or displace the actual storyline. Similarly, while the film makes numerous metaphorical references to present-day events, they are never so contrived as to derail the narrative.The film features solid performances from Clive Owen, who is at his rugged, rumpled best, and Julianne Moore. Supporting players also do well: Michael Caine is terrific as Theo's pot-growing hippie friend, the versatile Chiwitel Ejiofor is again in fine form as a revolutionary cell leader, and Pam Ferris is also good as another of Kee's protectors. It is, however, Claire-Hope Ashitey who stands out as the illegal immigrant who may well be humanity's hope for the future.Children of Men is packed with explosive action, incendiary social commentary and some white-hot performances. As a result, it may well be the best film of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
We don't deserve Alfonso Cuaron.,"Children of Men's premise grabbed my attention the moment I read the synopsis.

This is a flawless masterpiece, which is something I rarely just throw out, but wow, this might have just entered my top five favorite films of all time.

Embedded,"I finished the year is despair, because though I've seen many good films this year, I've seen very few actually released in 2006. What a surprise to discover some late in the game.This is one, and it really surprised me. That's because though I generally regard Hispanic filmmakers as the vanguard, he hasn't really impressed  not as a major talent. My how he impresses now. This isn't just an effective film, its effective in ways that show he really understands some of the theoretical mechanics.Here's what I mean. I was greatly impressed by the opening scene of ""Casino Royale."" But if you look at it closely, you'll see that someone could have produced it by mere extrapolation. All they have to do is look at examples of things that are exciting in current movies and do the same, except a little more intensively.But what Cuaron has done is go back to first principles. He knows how Welles redefined space. He knows how Tarkovsky created a whole new sort of eye by making the camera drift. He knows how Kirosawa invented the notion of layered planes. He's synthesized these in a new way, it seems to me. It isn't radical enough to not be readily digestible to a modern film-goer. But it also isn't much like what we had before, which I may typify with Ridly Scott's ""Blackhawk Down."" There's a scene toward the end which I imagine was where he started to imagine this project. Our escaping couple are detailed on the street by those who have been chasing them. This group is ambiguously evil, perhaps even the good guys. They prepare to kill Owen's character and perhaps do. From that point until near the end that seems to be one continuous shot. It isn't, but it seems to be, ""Rope"" -like.He runs down the street and around a corner, being shot at. He runs into a bus and out. Then across the street in the middle of heavy combat where a building is under attack. All this is hand-held using a partially-stabilized camera, halfway between a documentarian's camera (at this point blood is spattered on the lens), and the other way toward stylized distance that surveys the planes of the spaces while they are animated with bullet hits.We then follow him into the building, up several flights and down hallways to retrieve his ""family,"" then on out again. At this point he becomes ""seen"" by those around him. Before, he was more like us, there but disembodied, in a die hard sense. Now he becomes part of the texture and we later discover, wounded.So on down and out of the building to be adored, as Joseph the partner of the Maddona and then a tank explodes and we are back into the space, leading to a tunnel, an expanse of water, and then something else.Its so wonderfully choreographed, the camera, the narrator's stance, the dancing walls, the object that appear and vaporize, the shifting types of engagement among us, characters and place...We know we are being set up. This is no Terry Gilliam who basically intuits. Before this scene we see all the bits from the other masters presented separately. The Tarkovsky bits were perhaps less meditative that I would have liked. One was a visit to an abandoned school where we see our mother outside through a hole in the window, and encounters happen that ""break emotional walls."" The other is the presence of a profoundly senile old woman, and how she is included.You walk through other basic film vocabularies elsewhere until they all combine in this last sequence. A Kurosawa episode on a bus when the midwife is taken to meet her fate.Quite apart from the visual vocabulary, he's done well with complementary notions of story. Its science fiction but without tedious explanations. The world just is. There's brutality as in the future of ""Vendetta,"" but one can see it isn't religious wars or jingoism that fuels it, but a far deeper existential concern. Julianne's character is the grand motivator, though wonderfully (in terms of story mechanics) she disappears early, effectively launching the real story: our hero is a storymaker.Noir. Regular readers know I define noir a bit different than ordinarily. It has to do with ordinary folks thrust into extraordinary situations as if the existence of the viewer motivates a capricious fate that weaves and frames a story for our eye. What we have here is ambiguous noir, and the first real action noir. Quite an achievement. Quite an experience.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Carefully crafted piece of work,"This year I attended for the first time the Venice Film Festival in Italy. I was of course quite excited and bought tickets to some screenings of a few different films I found interesting. Initially Children of Men wasn't in my plans but I was convinced by a friend who was very enthusiastic about it. Now I say I'm glad I bought the tickets! What an amazing film this is. The science fiction genre is just a coat to project into the future the horrors and problems of our current days and many films attempt that ending up, in most cases, failing. This one however succeeds. Succeeds indeed but not only in this... The film blew away nearly everyone in the audience as one of the best action movies we have seen lately, with extremely exciting and brutal chases, gun fights, etc. Don't be put off by this though, the film is as good as it is not because of the action sequences but its amazingly emotional and touching story. The performances of the cast is impressive especially Clive Owen and the newcomer Claire Hope Ashitey who throughout the film develop the relationship between their characters and it's such a joy to see the development. I'm not very good at writing reviews so I think I'll stop know, but I had at least to transmit something to everyone who might be interested in watching this film. Don't pass this one, you won't regret it. In my view one of the few excellent films released this year.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Overrated,"I've read so much hype and positive comments on this film before watching, and regretfully, it did not live up to the expectations.The film starts with an interesting, original basic story point: a future where the human race has become sterile. This opening point has so much potential, but unfortunately doesn't take off anywhere from there.The plot itself is pretty monotonic: Our 2 heroes running off together from one place to another. It's not always clear who they're running from or where they are going. The chase itself is not so action-packed, and directed rather slowly. The other characters in the movie are thin cardboard cutouts - no background, no reasonable motives. There's not much of a punchline or point to the story once it ends either.The movie does present a convincing, depressing but realistic future reality, down to little details. It does have a strong political saying, warning and moral. But these are the only strongpoints. In all other aspects, the film is not bad - but just mediocre. From a storytelling perspective, the movie presents a thin story, loosely tied scenes, and not enough character development. It lacks momentum and is just not entertaining enough.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Among my top 10 of the decade,"I will be very honest, I wouldn't have said that about Children of Men four years ago. When I saw it for the very first time, I didn't like it very much, while I loved the cinematography, direction and soundtrack I found it rather dull and confusing. On rewatch some time ago, I was dumbfounded at how wrong I was initially, and since again it has very quickly become a favourite of mine.I do agree that there is the occasional surfeit of plot exposition and that it is slow. However, the story with its wonderful concept left me transfixed throughout. As for it being slow, I got the impression it was meant to be slow to add to its haunting atmosphere. Also Children of Men is one of those movies I think that you need to see more than once to truly appreciate it.The soundtrack is very well chosen and beautifully incorporated into the story. The two John Tavener songs were very beautiful and haunting, and brilliantly performed. Jarvis Cocker's Running the World was okay, while the Shostakovich was a real treat. Same with Ruby Tuesday. My favourite was Mahler's amazing Kindertotenleider, sublimely sung by the king of Leider(for me anyway) Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau.The acting is very good. Clive Owen is really quite excellent in the lead, with a brooding and charismatic presence this is the best I have seen him act. Julianne Moore is lovely and very believable. Michael Caine is the real star of the cast though, his turn here is simply glorious.The best assets of Children of Men are the visuals and direction. Children of Men is a triumph when it comes to visuals. The decision for the use of hand-held camera was a risk but it worked so well with the dark and affecting atmosphere. The scenery is also miraculous and the colours are wonderful. But for me, this is Alfonso Cuaron's movie, a very underrated film-maker Cuaron's direction is absolutely superb.Overall, maybe not completely flawless but amazing. I also disagree with the naysayers that it is overrated, in my opinion it is the other way around. This film is very well made, has a great soundtrack, an interesting concept and story, exhilarating action sequences, fine acting and I seriously think Cuaron should have more credit for his direction here. Maybe not for everyone, but I loved it, something that I almost definitely wouldn't have said four years ago. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Overrated: Great camera-work, but simplistic plot and weak acting","It's a paper napkin idea fleshed out just enough to make a decent action movie. Though the director makes little use of his actors' talents, he puts together some fantastic action sequences. The first 10-15 minutes are filled with painful explanatory dialog, just to make sure every moron and his jumbo Diet Pepsi gets what's going on. Yes, we get it, all women have become infertile and the world is f^cked.After the oddly abrupt ending, I walked away disappointed that this movie was the same one that so many reviewers have raved about. The rendering of our potential future dystopia is deeply disturbing, and if you're inclined to get depressed about our world going down the toilet, you might want to stay away.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Waiting for a story which is just not there,"Watching Children of Men was a really odd experience. Expecting at least something above average, all I got was something almost amateuristic.I don't know, but I like my movies with something of a story or plot to it. Especially when a premise as in Children of Men provides an abundance of opportunity to do just that. What they did with it, came off slightly B-movie-ish and so did much of the cinematography with that nauseating homevideo-style cameramatics and bits of the acting as well. Why this movie is adored by so many people I cannot begin to fathom. Was the polling rigged in some way?The movie is basically a chase-flick in which a woman and her baby are escorted to a safe-haven while everyone helping her get offed during the travel. The whole premise of a barren world was completely wasted when the movie sloppily turns into this chase-vehicle, leaving its original dystopian backstory being merely an afterthought. The way they tried to pull it back in during the chase-sequences (e.g. the abandoned classroom scene) was clumsily forced, as were all the 'references' to: the immigration issue, Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo, The Bush Empire and what have you more. If you have something to say about these issues then say it, a movie is a great format for that. But surely they deserve much more than just a lazy nod in their general direction in some underdeveloped chase-movie.What I truly don't understand is why they didn't make the characters more likable. After all, we as onlookers are following their plight and should be concerned with it. When I watched this movie I had no sympathy or empathy for any of the characters or their predicament. This simply because they were either not very well portrayed (The sketchy part of Jullianne Moore), unlikable (Theo, Kee, the 'Fish') or Simpsons-like cartoon-figures (Sid, Jasper, that gypsy woman).I am a sucker for chase movies and that was the only reason I sat through the entirety of this mess. But even the chase plot didn't work for me at all. So many improbabilities* in the shovel-fed storyline and the pacing was just so off, rendering it ultra boring. A patronizing script making sure that every imbecile and his five brain cells got what was going on and the jarring soundtrack suitably missed the mark completely while multi-featuring the worst Stones-cover to date. Which was rather annoying.*I mean if Tom Hanks can build a raft from FedEx wrapping paper, I'm sure they could have built something seaworthy from the abundant piles of trash scattered throughout the sets.. did they really have to go to that refugee camp being exposed to all that violence with a baby? I thought they were trying to save it, not getting it killed...A complete mishap as far as I'm concerned with a most embarrassing 'ending' when almost out of nothing ""Children of men"" is blazon upon the screen in bold print.

A modern masterpiece,"There's not much wrong with this movie. Cinematography and the camera direction is on point making one of the best directed films ever made, being made up of a bunch of long one take scenes, some of them lasting even over 5 minutes, and some making me wonder how to it was possible to achieve them. Another thing that stands out is of course the story. It's a very interesting premise, being executed very well, with a potential being reached almost to the maximum, presenting a dark post-apocalyptic world, built very well, with an end that you can somewhat predict, but you can't know how the story will unfold until that moment, being surprised of some interesting twists, incredibly choreographed action and a very well crafted script. Children of Men is not only a modern classic, but also an almost perfect movie making it one of the best of the century, but arguably one of the best movies ever made and I would recommend anyone to watch it.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Well made...there's no doubt about it. But you might want to think twice before watching it.,"The story begins in 2027. The human race is completely screwed, as fertility has completely disappeared and the last child was born over 18 years ago. Why this is the case, no one seems to know. There also was a worldwide flu pandemic in 2008 that apparently killed millions. As a result of all this, people react as they often do...with panic, confusion and self-destruction. The planet is now a mess...with widespread terrorism, reactionary governments and fear. Nuclear detonations, terror bombings and depression are the norm. As for the UK where the film is set, it's better off than most of the world...and so there's been a huge influx of illegal aliens AND the government has responded with draconian measures.The main character in this story is Theo (Clive Owen), a bureaucrat whose wife, Julian (Julianne Moore) left him long ago following the death of their son in the pandemic. She has taken up with a domestic terrorist organization and he hasn't seen her for many years. Out of the blue, she approaches him asking for his help sneaking someone out of the country. Who this is and why...you can learn this when you see the film. Just understand...what happens are some things you just won't expect!Before I talk about whether or not I liked the movie, it's VERY important to talk about how depressing the story is. Considering the recent COVID outbreak, the panic and chaos in the story seem even more terrifying. If you are depressed or scared about COVID, this is probably a film you best see another time or not at all. Again, I am NOT saying it's a bad film...it's just one that might be tough now for some viewers. With all the death, suicide and the like, this is NOT an upbeat film despite there being some hope as the film progresses.The story is depressing and interesting at the same time. The standout in this film, however, is the cinematography and the long composite shots. And, even if the story is off-putting to many, you can't deny it took a lot of skill to make the movie. Worth seeing and a one-of-a-kind story from start to finish, it's hard to rate this one as the film clearly is not for everyone. If you want to be entertained or left happy, this sure ain't a film for you! I certainly DON'T want to see more films like it! But if you can take the overall tone of the movie and want something original, then it's clearly a film to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Enthralling, haunting addition to the apocalypse genre","Worthy addition to a very British literary, televisual and cinematic tradition of dystopian and apocalyptic narratives. H.G Wells, John Wyndham, SURVIVORS, 28 DAYS LATER.These texts are revealing of the times in which they were made. Rather than looking forwards,they re often, at heart, deeply conservative. They frequently express a desire for a world where the centralised, industrial society has broken down entirely, replaced by an agrarian based model comprising small, rural communities. These narratives coincided with the rise in 'alternative ' lifestyles, interest in self sufficiency, organic farming, low technology and a different relationship with the Earth. Nostalgia for a pre Industrial past is more prominent than hope and anticipation of a glorious new future when civilisations been destroyed for a new, better world to emerge.The grand narratives which we once imagined were going to change and improve the world no longer seem credible. Following the collapse of communism, there's a distrust of ideologies, especially those of the left. Arguably, the left has collapsed in the Western World. Thats the context this film arrives in, one where there seems no meaningfully effective counterbalance to the continued dominance of global capitalism, media saturation and environmental meltdown.Arguably this film offers some hope but my overall impression is of something a lot bleaker than other apocalypse narratives. Without children there is, literally, no future left. Although emerging from a different context, this film shares with its predecessors a thoroughly revealing indication of the concerns preoccupying the time in which it was made.Two scenes haunted me. The man in Battersea, isolated with his art collection and the set pieces of the illegal immigrants, rounded up and caged.The Battersea scene uses its location and choice of Picasso's Gernika painting in the background to make a searing comment on a civilisation which, despite its pretensions to Art and Culture, has managed to engineer its own extinction. A civilisation whose intellectual and cultural elites, instead of challenging the prevailing discourse, isolate themselves, collusive in a form of collective denial.The illegals scene is composed in such a way as to recreate images from the War on Terror, images which are now iconic. Both scenes link together through use of the painting which is an inspired device. This is definitely a movie to watch and work at. I was also intrigued by the recurring animals, and reminded of Tarkovsky, whose work is consistently loaded with symbolism. The scene at the empty, abandoned school was very reminiscent of the Russian director. Also praiseworthy is the astonishing use of sound, particularly in one of the key scenes when dogs can be heard barking in the distance.Another haunting image is that of the flowers and wreaths laid very early on, after the youngest person on earth has died. Reminiscent of the mawkishness, sentimentality and mass hysteria of those laying floral tributes to murder victims they never knew, the so called 'Diana effect'. Again, a clear reference to todays world.This is an outstanding piece of film making, I agree totally with previous reviewers comments, especially regarding the battle scenes, which have an immediacy, bringing to mind COME AND SEE or APOCALYPSE NOW. I ll give the last word to Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian newspapers film critic who called this 'a thinking persons action movie.'",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One of the Most Overlooked Masterpieces of the Mid 2000's.,"Children of Men explores a certain darkness of humanity that equally matches that of its civility and hope that resides in the soul. Bleak landscapes of faithless survivors cling at any attempt to exist in a world where inevitable extinction lingers in the distance.Alfonso Cuaron and Chivo's (Emmanuel Lubezki)'s camera work is nearly unparalleled in their explorative use of long-take steady cam scenes. The level of extraordinary effort it must have taken to coordinate such complex shoots.All of these large scale complex scenes are complemented by some of the best intimate interactions between both Clive Owen and Julianne Moore where again, Cuaron and Chivos mastery come to light in perfect harmony.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Engaging and exciting sci-fi that is interesting and technically impressive in its delivery,"It is the year 2027. For some reason mankind has gradually ceased being able to reproduce, with the last human born being ""baby"" Diego in 2009. When he is murdered in a brutal attack it stuns the world, only further sapping the hope in a world where the aging population has given up, economies have collapsed, terrorism is rife and Governments are focused on control rather than improving anything for anyone. In the middle of this former activist Theo is approached to help transport a woman across checkpoints to the coast where the mysterious ""human project"" is working to save mankind.Interesting to look back on some groups of films and see what they tell us about the times they were made in. The sci-fi's of the 1950's point to an external threat that is different from us and must be feared an conquered for example. It will be interesting to look back on Children of Men and other recent sci-fis such as V for Vendetta because already they seem so attuned with the world we now live in. Children of Men jumps just into the future to a world crumbling with no real hope for anyone other than those clinging to what little privilege power offers them. This is the strength of the film as it builds a futuristic world that is so palatable  remote from our own but yet so easy to believe. There are problems with the narrative in regards pitching it to a mass audience though. Many (including myself at times) will struggle with not understanding and knowing everything about this world.This did bother me at times but mostly the central story was exciting and interesting enough to engage  so what if the story doesn't fill in the whole history of where we are now, or if the film finishes where it does rather than giving us a firm conclusion? That is not the nature of the story and it is part of the telling. For something so downbeat and with these open aspects, the film does a great job of gripping. The background detail of this future makes for a strong foundation for Theo and Kee to move through, producing some interesting plot points but also a surprising amount of action. The ambush on Julian's car is exciting but it doesn't compare to the final scenes where Theo attempts to rescue Kee; not only is that scene gripping but it is technically very impressive as it is delivered in long, complex takes where you feel you get no respite. The script is not perfect though and some of it is clunky and not as intelligent as it thinks it is (lest we forget that this is script that calls the character holding the future of mankind ""Kee"") but mostly it is very strong.Owen holds the film together with a central character that is hardly off the screen but yet we never tire of him. There are a lot of stars alongside him but he owns the film by far. Moore has a small turn that is effective albeit more because of her surprise fate rather than her amazing turn. Caine is amusing but is wisely kept to the sidelines while Ejiofor, Mullan, Huston and others all fill in the smaller characters. Ashitey is OK but not as strong as I would have liked; she didn't convince me in her skin and it was too easy to see her character as a plot device rather than a character. As director, Cuarón delivers the goods with an impressive group effort that makes this future so convincing and gritty. The sets are well done and London etc locations are subverted just in the right way to keep them real as well as different. Lubezki's cinematography is impressive throughout and personally, having seen both now, I think he should have had the Oscar that instead went to Pan's Labyrinth.Overall an intelligent and interest sci-fi that says a lot about the times we live now in how it views the future. Despite some issues with the script and total pot, the film is engaging and exciting, producing a credible and depressing future-view but also being a technically impressive film in regards the design and delivery.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I am very glad I did not pay to see this movie!,"To its credit, Children of Men offers an unparalleled amount of chaos from the first minute to the very end. The explosions and violence is bound to keep you on your toes as a pseudo guerrilla force battles the British government for power, providing a barrage of cross-fire in which this story is set.Admittedly, while I found this setting both impulsive and entertaining, my view of the story over all is that the violence provided a form of subterfuge, behind which a paper thin plot with underdeveloped characters offer up a semi-complete story with very little substance. My feeling was that the summary provided by ""On Demand"" constituted most of the story, with each point separated by various large and enjoyable action packed scenes.I gave this a six, which in my view was generous. If I was rating the substance with respect to plot line, it would have been a 2 or 3, although I do think the idea to be very intriguing.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

No comic relief, no cartoon character bravery, only human behavior in it's best and most horrible way. This realistic overtone makes the main characters very engaging and moving. CLive owen (whose i have always disliked) is excellent as the man drowned into an adventure too big for him (sorry for my bad English)It's the same kind of film than V for vendetta (both taking place in a futuristic fascist British society) different from the usual mainstrean studio teenager pleaser crapGO see it! help intelligent cinema",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Disappointing,"I think that your opinion of this film is going to greatly depend on your expectations beforehand. It seems that a lot of people went to see this film not expecting much and were pleasantly surprised by its intelligence and non-derivative execution.However, having seen that this film was in the IMDb top 250 I came to it with somewhat higher hopes and came away slightly let down.The plot is fine in so far as it goes and there are some nicely done set pieces - the giant shoot out among the street ruins is particularly impressive and realistic - but really the only outstanding performance is from Michael Caine. I don't remember a great deal about what the main characters motivations were and that doesn't say much for the strength of either the plot or the cast.For me the most enjoyable section of the movie was in Jaspar's (Michael Caine's) house - there was some strong acting here and some humorous and effective scenes. But beyond that, I think that people who rate this film highly are doing it because they are impressed by the director's bleak and believable presentation of an anarchic future for mankind.I concede that it is well done - but I don't believe that the plot or the acting match the strength of the visuals.I don't think that this is a film I would watch again and that tells me that it is not deserving of its current ranking as a classic. I would rate it as above average - an interesting concept, nicely brought to the screen but with not enough depth to really draw me in.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Intense from Start to Finish,"I forgot how intense this movie is. Cuarón did an unbelievable job progressing the story while also making every scene flow towards more anxiety. Owen did a great job playing the lead and I'm sad to not see him in more movies because he's very talented. I label this one a masterpiece because of the range of emotions I go through. A particular scene near the end gets me choked up and it's impressive how Cuarón was able to diffuse the tension and portray something so beautiful. Every action scene was so well shot, and some scenes had styles that felt like one-takes making it a very unique way to approach how it's portrayed. I also wish Cuarón did more films because he's extremely talented as well. 5/5 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I love it!,"Once again, the apocalypse unfolds on screen, presenting a plot so starkly simple it chills with its plausibility. Set in 2027, a world teetering on the brink of annihilation, devoid of new life for 18 years. Enter Theo (played by Clive Owen), a London office worker, who finds himself entangled in a perilous mission: escorting a refugee (portrayed by Claire-Hope Ashitey) to safety, lured by cash from a radical ex-girlfriend. Their journey exposes them to threats from both government forces and revolutionaries.While the camera captures stunning visuals and the cinematography mesmerizes, the focus remains steadfastly on Theo, keeping viewers entrenched in the heart of the chaos. Clive Owen delivers a stellar performance, portraying Theo with a convincing blend of vulnerability and resilience. He navigates perilous situations with dignity, embodying an unconventional action hero who doesn't reflexively reach for a gun. The ensemble cast, including the likes of Michael Caine, Julianne Moore, and Chiwetel Ejiofor, enriches the narrative with their talent, each character adding depth to the dystopian world.Children of Men defies categorization, its episodic narrative transcending genre boundaries. Futuristic elements are rendered with a gritty realism, juxtaposed against bleak urban landscapes that reflect the societal and political turbulence of the present day. Amidst pulse pounding action sequences, moments of poignant drama punctuate the film, keeping audiences on edge while offering thought-provoking commentary.While not without its flaws, particularly in handling exposition, Alfonso Cuarón crafts an unforgettable cinematic experience. The film's only misstep lies in its occasional jarring shifts between dark humor and stark imagery reminiscent of contemporary news broadcasts. Ideally, viewers should approach Children of Men with fresh eyes, allowing themselves to be enveloped by its immersive storytelling.Children of Men stands as a cinematic masterpiece, propelled by remarkable visual effects and an evocative soundtrack. It's a film that resonates deeply, stirring the emotions and prompting reflection long after the credits roll.

There's no reverence for life. I thought it was a bit scary to find white supremacists directly in charge of caged immigrants. Or crazed evangelicals loaded down with assault weapons. No wonder the society broke down. Those people rendered the government troops mostly ineffective. When a country can no longer provide security and basic services, the stage is set for anarchy.

Children of Men: A movie that aged phenomenally well in the most terrible of ways.,"From the utopian worlds of Star Trek to the cold brutalism in Dredd (2012), good world-building immerses the audience into the media without the audience even realizing it. And certainly, the cast and crew of Children of Men immerse the audience incredibly well.Filmed in a documentary-adjacent style, Children of Men portrays characters moving through a dystopian world in which women can no longer become pregnant due to an unknown malady. Moving through the world, the viewer is introduced to an immense class divide, a protracted war, pollution, jingoism, and in all of that, people just trying to get by.What makes Children of Men so poignant is how the characters interact with the world and each other. There are moments of love and brutality that, even as I write this, months after seeing the film, make me tear up.The true sadness of Children of Men is that the world it conveyed in 2006 feels far more familiar in 2021. The director, Alfonso Cuarón mentioned that he wanted to create a film that felt like a near future documentary, and unfortunately he might be right.If I could give this movie a rating higher than a 10, I would.

Interesting but Overcooked Speculative Drama,"Alfonso Cuaron (most well known for directing the overrated and raunchy coming-of-age story ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" and the third--and the best--of the ""Harry Potter"" series) does a nice job of setting the mood with his gritty and eclectic take on a dystopian future where women have become infertile and Britian is a volatile police state where the biggest crime is being an illegal immigrant. This central conceit is mildly interesting, but the screenwriters populate the allegorical fiction with stock characters: people and ideas painted with broad strokes and little development, and peppered with quirky side-stories and characters who are often more interesting than the overly symbolic main plot line.What emerges is quasi-entertaining movie bubbling over with overcooked details and a few good scenes. Though dropping the ball in the intimate interludes that are supposed to add dramatic weight (the screaming match on the bus between Clive Owen and Julianne Moore about grief seemed especially staged and unreal), Cuaron directs the suspense and action scenes with appropriate zeal. Sadly, everyone in the film constantly looks tired (Owen taking a nap in a car and Moore actually yawning in one pivotal scene), so between the good stuff I often felt the same.There are three really well constructed sequences that on their own are very thrilling: a reverse vehicular escape from a an angry mob that ends tragically, another vehicular escape at dawn down a dirt farm road where the car just doesn't want to start, and one of the closing scenes of a lonely rowboat in a choppy bay surrounded by fog.The rest is haphazard filler that had me distracted most of the time. ""Children of Men"" eventually became of movie of frustrating details. For instance, the title makes no sense when you think about it. Unless sprung from immaculate conception, we are currently all children of men, so this would only be an appropriate title if all the women in the world were dead and men started having babies. The movie cost over $80 million dollars to make (and it looks great) but why couldn't they fork out the extra cash to pay for the real Rolling Stones' version of ""Ruby Tuesday"" instead of a lousy cover? The song plays a crucial part yet becomes aggravating to hear. Finally, instead of caring about what happens to the two lead characters during the excellently filmed siege of the refugee camp, I cared more about what was going to happen to some poor gypsy woman and her little dog.Though it has plenty of interesting minutae to keep things entertaining, the film never coalesces as a whole. Despite three really good scenes, ""Children of Men"" unfortunately solidifies Cuaron's status as the best director yet to make a great film.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Message still applicable to today's society even after 17 years,"I just bursted out crying out of nowhere, so random. 'Children of Men' insists it is 'dystopian action thriller' film, but it is not at all despairing, destructive or stressful. It actually gives hope when you least expect it and when surrounded by debris, ruins, and blood. People feel similar emotion and have same instinct, but we rather focuses on what's different. Watching 'Children of Men' 17 years later of its release is such unique experience because of its relativity and reality. First, refugee problem you see in the movie does not feel too far from what we are going through today. It is so relatable to see immigrants' struggle and government's so-called management grow everyday. I'm guessing maybe 17 years later, the reality will look more like scenes in the movie. Second, its reality and vividness coming from single-shot sequence. This gives war footage and documentary vibes; movement is so physical and legitimate, the blood stain on camera transfers me through time and place right next to Theo and Kee. I can never believe it came out in 2006.Soundtrack is masterwork. Julian's quote - Y'know that ringing in your ears? That 'eeeeeeeeee'? That's the sound of the ear cells dying, like their swan song. Once it's gone you'll never hear that frequency again. Enjoy it while it lasts - perfectly captures the essence of music in the film.

Animals in Children of Men,"All the important points about this film have been well covered by other reviewers, so I would like instead to draw your attention to a smaller sub text that is well worth keeping an eye on within the film's wider themes:Animals are utilized in incredibly effective ways in this film, from the horror of watching piles of burning cattle carcasses in the countryside (drawing our attention to environmental / food disasters) to Theo's surreal encounter with a startled deer within a long abandoned school (reminding us we now exist in a world where the teaching of the next generation is no longer an issue). And of course domestic animals such as cats and dogs are shown everywhere, their presence as pets providing comfort for the children missing from everyone's lives.Watching animals respond to Theo is something else again. I am sure I missed many of these small interactions because they often occurred during important scenes when my attention was focused on wider issues. But do watch for how pets react to him and follow him, often wanting to get as close to him as possible - for example, he invariably has a cat asleep behind him on the couch at Jasper's, and watch for the tiny kitten with sharp claws that determinedly climbs his trouser leg during a political meeting.These interactions are never elaborated upon, nor can I recall if they featured in the original P D James' book. They can easily be missed as one gets caught up in the drama of the story. But I found they provided an excellent devise for moments of unexpected humour as well as insight into Theo's character, and most importantly revealed yet another example of the director's extraordinary attention to detail in this very impressive, and very moving, film.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
a very mixed bag,"A frustratingly uneven film, with a perplexing mixture of strengths and weaknesses, reflected in its very divergent ratings here. As an exercise in visualising the near future it is compelling and convincing. It is easy to believe that grotty, disintegrating world it shows is just how it will be, and the few futuristic gadgets around are all the more convincing because of the otherwise mundane and grungy setting. Despite the dismal greyness of this world, the film still has a strange sort of visual beauty, and there is an energy and fluidity in the images that are presented.However when it comes to small details like, acting, dialogue and narrative, everything falls apart. The script is cringe-makingly bad in places - hard to believe it was written by an native English-speaker. Acting is fairly wooden - although there is some warmth and interest in the central relationship between ""Theo"" and ""Kee"". The way the story develops is one-dimensional, with the ending laughably predictable.Worth seeing for its visual and political imagination, but not a great film by any means.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Entertaining but ultimately a let down and very thin.,"This is my kind of genre and I love Owen and many of the other actors in this movie, so to watch them read poor dialogue like this and act un-actable scenes was painful. It's really that distracting.Fortunately a bleak and interesting future makes for some face saving action scenes that are very tense. It must be warned however what passes for the future here is a mishmash of current affairs issues taken to the extreme. There is no insight, no real imagination here either, it's all as if they grabbed someone of the street and asked them what they thought the future would be like.If you can get past the hammy acting, dialogue and concentrate on the more interesting scary aspects of this future world, I'd like to say you'll find a great story. But you won't. I don't ask for messages in my films, but there was no insight into anything here. Not the characters, not the idea behind it, no story metaphor (although plenty of heavy handed visual metaphor).As for a thinking persons action movie, sort of an insult to thinking people really. I know a lot of popcorn movie goers who'd be just as happy to see this, though it is a fair bit more interesting than your average Saturday night flick.To sum up, it should have been a thinking persons movie, and if the dialogue was better it would help. Even so, the story is so flawed, it's like you know something good is there but, it's been in such a horrendous car wreck you barely make it out. What a real pity, but thank god for the cinematographer!",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Children of Men is immersive and exceptionally well shot and written,"Children of Men makes you feel the setting of the movie as well as any I've seen. It is filled to the brim with details that show the level of dystopia present in London, where things are supposedly ""best"". Rather than focusing on the premise, Cuaron drops you right into the world and emphasizes how people live in this world and the consequences. The visuals of the world and how Cuaron gives the viewer information via details in the shots rather than exposition is excellent. The cinematography is among the best I've ever seen, with several edge of your seat action sequences shot without cuts. The ambiguity and the focus on people rather than the scientific solutions and reasoning makes it a more powerful film showcasing the extreme dystopia. Bleak and intense, but its technical aspects elevate Children of Men to be a great movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A criminally underrated masterpiece - One of the best movies ever made.,"Children of Men is one of those movies that stand out in every sense, is one of those few movies with the special quality of leaving us a great mark after watching them. They move our feelings, alter our ideas and show us terrifyingly close or future probabilities, feasible realities that constantly haunt us, this work is responsible not only to present us with a constant and top quality, but is also a work that will make us feel every beat of the heart.It's criminal to know that this movie didn't have the critical or box-office acceptance when it was released, I honestly can't understand why, but thanks to the power of the internet, in recent years it has been slowly but surely recovering its location as a master cult movie.Each scene of the film is an artistic work, each moment is a fantastic inspection of cinematic art. The cinematography is totally beautiful, full of incredible moments, tense and realistic, that make us feel the pressure in our throat. I have to highlight the end of the film, which is probably one of the most fantastic, surreal and impressive camera works in the history of cinema.The performances are of the highest quality, full of emotion and realism, during the development of the film we are shown a great contrast between the different people who appear in this world, the spectrum between the fortunate and the unfortunate, different secondary characters who speak different languages and belong to a variety of cultures, this only helps pleasantly to give a realistic life to this film.The script, the story, the structure and the narrative shown in the film are incredible, without seconds wasted and without unnecessary exposure, each part of each scene is designed to convey an idea or a feeling and succeeds completely, a film as realistic as it is magical, that shows a terrifying chemistry between humans, with explosive reactions as well as wonderful reactions.It is undoubtedly a masterpiece, I consider it one of the best movies in the history of cinema and one of my favorite movies of life. Extremely moving, tense, realistic, fantastic, brutal, reflective, entertaining and unique. An emotional journey presented through images of extreme quality and sublime narration. I really hope that this film will have the respect it deserves, because it is not a simple action movie, it is a work of art designed from head to toe with every detail made to perfection to present a fantastic, realistic and exciting story. A sublime, masterful film. A work that we should all see at least once in our lives.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
BEST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN (really),"I can't begin to describe how much I enjoyed this movie. The scenes are so incredibly realistic that you'd swear you are seeing real life. It is the small details, such as a woman who has to keep the door open as she is leaving to let her dog go through. The battle scenes are also incredibly detailed, with tanks shooting and in miliseconds a building blows up. The acting is also very good (and I don't like the main actor), especially by Michael Caine. The story is very intriguing, as it basically says the source of all our hopes are children. In a world where people increasingly see children as a nuisance, this is a slap in the face.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Average and Unsuccessful Film Becomes IMDb's #147!,"CHILDREN OF MEN is a fairly good futuristic drama --- with holes in its story a mile wide --- most of the premise unexplained and unresolved --- relatively unsuccessful at the box office; yet it becomes one of IMDb's All Time 250 --- and with a number of votes out-of-proportion to the number of people who have seen the picture.When I rented the DVD last night, they had over 20 copies of this film whereas most other new releases were all checked out.Results on IMDb will always be biased, as are the box office figures that reflect huge success of recent films with their $10 admissions mixed in with older films when admissions were 50 cents or less --- with no adjustment to constant dollars. But I suspect that Universal Pictures might have corrupted the vote on this picture and several other of their recent ""hits"". Universal is now just a shadow of the huge success they were in the 1970's and 1980's.We enjoyed CHILDREN OF MEN, a good film but nothing special.

You could tell it was a British film because of the times the f word was uttered...I counted 20 times in about 5 minutes at one point, this is just sloppy,lazy directing and for me detracted from the story.

Can an infant's voice hold back a world at war with itself?,"Bottom-line at the top: If you are an ultra-right wing retrogressive this film will probably anger you. Avoid it, and don't bother reading my review.Set in mid-21st-century London, Children of Men is a cyber-punk dystopian nightmare which extrapolates from the worst of contemporary political trends to a bleak future where people have stopped procreating and totalitarian militaristic governments have obliterated civil society, closed national borders, and branded everybody expressing dissatisfaction 'terrorist'. And the 'terrorists' themselves are no better.Theo Faron (Clive Owen) is a disheartened ex-activist and the love of his life - Julian (Julianne Moore) - has just resurfaced asking him for a very big favor. Julian is the leader of a quasi-terrorist organization which wants to reopen Great Britain's borders, and they are trying to help an illegal immigrant who is about to give birth to the first infant the earth has seen in about twenty years to escape to a safe location. Or so it appears at first.Owen gives the best performance I have seen out of him. Michael Caine lends excellent support (and is particularly well cast in his role). Moore, always good, meets her own very high standards with ease. This is my first film experience with Claire-Hope Ashitey - who is as much the star of this film as Owen. All I can say about Miss Ashitey is ""bravo!"" - spectacular job with a tough role.Contrary to many of the comments I have read concerning Children of Men, the film is definitely not low-budget. Seventy-two million dollars is no shoe-string budget, and one does not hire Clive Owen, Julianne Moore and Michael Caine without a decent budget. What's remarkable about allocation of financial resources for this film, however, is how invisible the budget is (besides the expensive cast). The special effects are so well done that they achieve subtlety and are almost unnoticeable - very rare in contemporary sci-fi.Cuaron's direction is equally invisible, and flawless. Without resorting to shaky-cam clichés and intentionally degraded cinematography, he achieves a documentary feel - but only when he needs it. The sets are perfect, as is the lighting and camera-work. The cinematography creates more than just mood - it embellishes a completely immersive and quite disturbing context for the entire film. Dark, dirty and degraded, Cuaron creates a world where hope survives only despite life itself, and only in a few. Whether you interpret human infertility as a wake-up call from God or a natural evolutionary process is your own muddle - don't bother spreading it, the result is much the same.This is a heavy film, but does not present its subject in a heavy-handed manner. What is disturbing about it is how easy it is, given the state of the world's politics and the expert craftsmanship of the film, to believe. The connection between the world of today and that of the film is made particularly clear by the set shots in Jasper Palmer's (Michael Caine) house. Palmer, a former journalist who has exiled himself from 'civilization', has newspaper clippings all over his walls which decry the invasion of Iraq and several yet-to-happen humanitarian catastrophes. Sure, none of what this movie predicts is likely to happen but what's frightening is how possible it actually seems.Highly recommended for open-minded, thinking people.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One of the finest dystopian films of the 21st century,"""Poor 'fugees, after escaping the worst atrocities and finally making it to England, our government hunts them down like they're cockroaches""A relentlessly grim yet hopeful film, it's amazing how prescient Children of Men was, and continues to be with every passing year.Due to the collapse of society following infertility around the world, Britain has become a fascist police state. Armed police and soldiers are stationed at train stations and propaganda pieces are constantly being shown on screens in streets and public transport encouraging the public to report potential illegal immigrants in order to ""keep Britain strong"". Asylum seekers and illegal immigrants are hunted down and rounded up and put in cages and ghetto camps before either being deported (if they're lucky), or exterminated.The shocking thing is, this incarnation of reality presented to us here is really not too unbelievable. With the rise of overt nationalism in the country and the general public seemingly willing to stumble into an authoritarian state just to deny asylum seekers their basic human rights, this is an entirely possible 2027 (minus the infertility part). Seeing the Union Flags plastered all over the place in the film leaves a sour taste in your mouth, especially following recent developments in the UK.This film was robbed of the Best Cinematography Oscar for the absolutely stunning unbroken takes that put you right in the centre of the action.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Strawberries, Bazooka and King Crimson","Greetings again from the darkness. Based on P.D. James' novel, stud-director Alfonso Cuaron (Y tu mama tambien, last Harry Potter movie) delivers a stunningly bleak and intense version of the future and the human fight for survival.If you have seen the preview or read the book, you know the premise. Claire-Hope Ashitey plays Kee, the first woman to get pregnant in almost two decades. With non-stop warring between multiple factions (that we never quite understand), a smaller though equally intense battle is on to save and control Kee's new baby. Getting involved with the mission are Julianne Moore, Clive Owen, Michael Caine and Chiwetel Ejiofor. Owen and Moore are former spouses who lost their kid and Ejiofor has ulterior motives.Caine is a hoot as Owen's friend and guru and Owen himself probably offers up his best film performance to date. Make no mistake, this is a bleak and extremely intense chase movie. Mother-to-be Kee is a bit ""wicked"", but we can't help but root for her to make it through to the good guys ... the mysterious ""Human Project"". Yes, I know all of this sounds a bit ridiculous, but it is such a well crafted movie and story that it somehow not only works, but sucks you in.

Witty and moving drama,"Papers of transit? A city under the jackboot and a furtive underground? A man who sticks his neck out for nobody but has an idealistic past? Well, Clive Owen, here's looking at you, kid. The man has aged like fine wine. I don't share the negatives about him doing the rounds on these boards. He is a gorgeous man with a charm that while not Bogey, is certainly winning. And you get two leading ladies for the price of one.I do wish the trailer had not given away the shock opening. It made me jump anyway. Those expecting a bleak drama from said trailer will be surprised by how funny the film is, although the writer often wipes the grin from your face with a wallop to the jaw. There is some grinding agitprop to get through but it is the director's eye for the little details of life that wins you over in terms of authenticity, although there is one glaring cliché when a man is about to meet his maker.'Children of Men' may not be a keeper, post-apocalyptic dramas being a dime a dozen nowadays.

"« 2027, an earthly odyssey » or  the long-waited return of realism and true craftsmanship in mainstream cinema","Visionary, honest and intelligent director at work. Celebrate.This is the most meticulous cinematic work I've seen since Polanski's « The Pianist ». In terms of production complexity, richness and attention to detail, it's up there with « 2001 » (hence the title of this review). Everything, down to the smallest details, has benefited from an incredible commitment to sheer excellency, in-your-face realism, and at no point during the movie has my attention been drawn away by some awkward compromise that are so abundant in mainstream movies (with the exception of some dialog lines that seemed out of place, but they were scarce and were not that annoying).At the purely cinematic level (dynamic staging + sets + placement of the eye + camera-work + lightning + colour + editing + effects integration), this is something that probably even De Palma couldn't have pulled off. The fluidity is so perfect and all the elements come together so seamlessly that this movie feels like first-class classical music. Actually it's technically so brilliant that it will be very difficult to outperform in the years to come. Yes, it's that good. Viewers who couldn't notice this extraordinary achievement in cinema while claiming they understand cinema, seriously need some education in what the medium really is, or should stop on the spot pretending they know what they're talking about.Among the 933 movies that I've seen up to this day, I dare say that ""Children of men"" is the greatest cinematic achievement in the mainstream movie system, with the exception, maybe, of ""2001"" and ""The Abyss"". It's not an ""aesthetically"", ""artistic"" cinematic work though, it's very far from Kar Wai Wong, Greenaway, Zang Yimou, Jeunet's ""Amélie"" or Cuaron's own ""A little princess"". It's downright realistic, in a way no movie of a similar scope has ever been. It's not art-house, yet it should please even the most picky art-house lovers out there, from the mind-blowing film-making craftsmanship.This stunning cinematic realism is strongly enhanced by several very long (up to 8 minutes!) real-time / single shot very, very complex action sequences, that are extremely powerful and must have been so tricky to pull off that the simple fact to imagine how they did pull it off gives me headaches. Even the overture sequence in ""Snake Eyes"" pales in comparison (which is a lot to say). In a modern movie world where almost everything we see is made from bits and pieces of heterogeneous scenes loosely glued together by frantic editing, this shines bright and puts to shame a couple of popular directors working with insanely high budgets with an increasingly complacent attitude (you know who I'm thinking of).I would have very much liked to comment on the substance of the movie (which is almost as excellent as the execution) both at the story and subtext level, but found it impossible to do so without giving away too much plot elements. So I'll just say that if you've been enthralled by the meta-stories from some of these: ""Le Procès"", ""1984"", ""Brazil"", ""The Pianist"", ""Blade Runner"", ""Hair"", ""Requiem for a Dream"", ""A Clockwork Orange"", ""The Devils"", ""Minority report"", ""V for Vendetta"", ""Merci la vie"", ""Full metal Jacket"", ""Andrey Rublyov"", ""Al-Massir"", you'll find in ""Children of men"" a lot to feed your thoughts and long talks with your friends.And even if you dismiss all of the subtext, it's still one hell of a ride at the basic entertainment level.

Hyped and overrated,"Whenever someone or a group of people get very excited about a movie i tend not to follow the masses but do the opposite and wait until the excitement has worn off.This was the exactly the case for 'Children of men'. A lot of friends and magazines were praising it to the stars an perhaps beyond, also trying to push as much people to go and watch the movie.It is only now that i felt the urge to see the movie, but as i thought it turned out to be hyped. Yes it has a a few new tricks a fresh story and nice imagery, but it isn't that special as far as movies go.The story evolves quickly around two people and are more or less bonded from the moment they meet. The couple more or less move from one situation to another, there's little struggle/resistance as far moving from one to the other situation. In the meanwhile a lot of action is going on and people are dying around our couple like flies. The main characters are almost zombie like, there's hardly any emotion going on.Pro's: * Very good visual atmosphere * Good camera-workCons: * weak character building, you can't sympathize with someone * Mediocre storyline * Little/no plot twists or surprises i.e story line is far too linearAll in all the movie gets a 6 because the visual aspects and fresh concept.

Children of Men by Alfonso Cuarón,"One of the most interesting themes to explore in the books, comic books, movies, television series and videogames, is about how the world would look like in the future. The two of the most popular visions about the future, are the dystopian and the utopian environment. The utopian stories explore about a future, which the society is perfect, where the people live without getting lost. The main characters would mostly live the adventures, through philosophical questions about their purpose and how they can solve some issues which were not solved yet. The dystopian stories explore about a future, which is chaotic filled with darkness, where the people are completely lost. As it seems there is no hope for the humanity, until a light comes out by showing nothing is lost yet and the main characters would do anything to bring hope. Some of the dystopian and utopian stories use realism, by giving the audience reflections, about how the main characters would move forward to get their purpose. Other stories would use horror elements, by letting the audience feel the fear of the main characters, who are facing the darkness in their roads. Some stories would end with the main characters, who survived from the danger, by then accomplish their missions. Other stories would end with the main characters dying, once they have accomplished the mission with hope. The auteur filmmaker Alfonso Cuarón seems interested, to release a dystopian movie, by adapting the book The Children of Men by P. D. James. As a story filled with reflective and poetic scenes, in every single angle shots, by making an emotional and realistic movie. In 2006 came out Children of Men by Alfonso Cuarón with Clive Owen, Julianne Moore, Clare-Hope Ashitey, Michael Caine, Pam Ferris and Chiwetel Ejiofor. The movie's plot: In the year 2027, the humanity is living in the chaotic world where the women are infertile. The people live in the sadness, as it seems there is no hope, for the humanity to find another little newborn child. Until a former activist Theo Faron (Clive Owen) gets asked, by the militant group called Fishes, to help them by accomplishing an important mission. It is about to help Kee (Clare-Hope Ashitey), an illegal refugee, to get to the sanctuary at the sea. The movie would immediately capture the audience attention, from the beginning to the end, for how the camera shots long takes to give all the emotions and the realism needed to make the scenes unforgettable and poetic. The lightenings and the shadows help as well, by letting the audience feel the emotions of the main characters. By making the story powerful in every scenes, without ruining the emotions of the movie. The sound design was particularly elaborated, by making the specific sounds unexpectedly loud, for some of the most thrilling moments of the story. By increasing the audience tension, in the most unexpected ways. The screenplay was elaborated to be clear, how the story would be told from the beginning to the end, without ruining the narration's rhythm. Especially to see how the main characters, get through the dark and chaotic roads, to bring hope for the humanity. The editing was specifically elaborated, by making the story's narration clear, about how the characters would face the danger, in the most unexpected ways. Clive Owen was excellent as Theo Faron a former activist, who has a dramatic past that makes him feel hopeless. Until Theo changes his mind about the hope, once he gets involved in the mission by the Fishes. Julianne Moore did a well done performance as Julian Taylor, former wife of Theo and the one who takes part of the Fishes. Julian would convince Theo to be part of the mission, for the trust she still has on him. Clare-Hope Ashitey was really good as Kee, an illegal refugee, who is the main reason for the mission. In the course of the story, Kee and Theo would trust each other, as he makes her understand what she should do to move forward. Michael Caine was extraordinary as Jasper Palmer, a former political cartoonist and a friend of Theo, who takes care his wife and the dog. Jasper would help Theo whenever is needed, as they know each other for a long time. Since Theo gets involved in the mission, Jasper would show Theo a way to arrive at the sanctuary. Pam Ferris did a well done performance as Miriam, a former midwife who takes care Kee. Initially Miriam would look to be an annoying character, until there would be a moment where she shows to be a much serious character. Miriam would do anything to protect Kee, she also explain Theo some important things, he needs to know in the course of the story. Chiwetel Ejiofor was really good as Luke, who is member of the Fishes. Luke would have no mercy with anybody, as he focuses on his purpose. Luke would also show some emotions, which can explain the reason of his behavior. The score of the movie makes the story powerful, in every musical notes to be breathtaking. Especially in the most emotional moments, as well as the most thrilling one, to make the story unforgettable. Children of Men is one of the greatest masterpieces of all time, also one of the best Alfonso Cuarón's movies.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Virtuoso film making from Cuarón,"OK lets get straight to the point, this is the easily the best action movie I've seen for several years - a gripping story, believable character acting combined with taught direction and thankfully sans cringe-making dialogue and Hollywood sentimentality.Whether the plot line bears any resemblance to the novel is frankly irrelevant - the screenplay successfully creates a recognisable (near) future world without relying on hover cars and camp Space 1999 type fashions.The extended scene following Clive Owens character as he battles through the immigrant compound betters in intensity and realism any movie battle scene I can think of (yep including the beach landing in Private Ryan) - it looks like its been shot in one continuous take. That being the case I'm still trying to work out how Cuarón managed to stage such a frantic, exciting and bloody scene.Sadly, the local Odeon where I watched the film had only about a dozen or so in the audience - pretty rubbish for a first night, especially considering the quality of the movie.Children of men works on several levels; as a thriller it betters recent Hollywood action flicks; as an example of virtuoso film making (stunning cinematography) and on another level it offers a damning indictment on the increasingly right wing political morality currently prevalent in UK and US government (but you don't have to read that into it to enjoy the movie).And as its sort of a British movie, you should go see it.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

At best it is an okay action movie. I went to see it because it was well received by the critics and it fit into my schedule that day.P.D. James is one of my favorite authors but I was not motivated to read her book prior to seeing the movie because I am not fond of books about the future. However, just to understand what the movie was all about, I decided to read her book. I think this movie could have been so much better if more time have been spent on character and story development and less on pyrotechnics and guns.Anyone wanting to watch this film on DVD or on television would be well served to read the book before investing two hours in this movie. I saw the film during its theater run but I will probably watch it again when it comes on television to see if it is more comprehensible to me.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A speculative fiction masterpiece,"It appears that speculative fiction, the brainy offshoot of science-fiction, has come to vogue in recent years. Intelligent ""what-if"" movies have become more frequent than ever and Children of Men stands as being amongst the best of the best. Alfonso Cuarón leaves no stone unturned and has created as vivid a vision of a dreary, decayed future as Ridley Scott's Blade Runner painted a technologically advanced future.The story of a world where all women have become infertile and civilization had decayed in the ensuing desperation is harsh enough, but Cuarón's and co-screenwriter Timothy Sexton's vision of this decayed world is so convincing that it becomes difficult to remember that it is simply a movie. Every single detail is filled in, from the stalling of technology in the face of a race coming to its extinction, to celebrity worship in a world where everyone is defined by the same dream, to the sights and sounds of a world where schools are empty and the religious feel that God has abandoned them. This film is crafted under a microscope that forgets nothing.It is most interesting to watch the well-presented attitudes of the lower class who have nothing left to lose compared to the upper class who suddenly find their wealth to be meaningless and yet realize that their continued quest for material wealth is now merely an auto-response. What is most impressive is that the film does not fall into cliché or prejudice about any group. The rich are not painted as evil and the poor are not painted as saintly; the government is not painted as completely evil and rebels are not painted as being completely faultless. In this film, the good and bad of all groups is put front and center.The view of the government is equal measures modern, Western civilization and Cold-War, Communist Germany. Showing the addiction to illusory security that many countries today are clamoring over and the attempts to quantify and control all aspects of living for the equally illusory socialist dream, this film really pulls no punches. As well, by showing how even civil rebellion can decay into corruption and that the government/army is made up of human beings who respond similarly to the same set of human circumstances, this film certainly succeeds in what all good science-fiction/speculative fiction should do: make us think of who we are and what are relationship is to the world around us.Alfonso Cuarón has crafted what is a crowning achievement in his career with this film. It stands out amongst all the films that I have seen this year and is a must-see for those who crave intelligent, honest and blunt storytelling with visuals that do not leave your mind long after the film has finished.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A new peak in the cinematic craft,"Children of Men is a new peak in the cinematic craft. I honestly don't know where to begin to describe just how staggeringly, remarkably mind-blowing this film is.First, allow me to express my emotional response to the film. Depression. Elation. Shock. Levity. There are so many emotions I can't even begin to think of how to express in words that I experienced during the film. I was bawling throughout a majority of the length  which makes Children of Men the latest addition to the VERY limited list of films that made me cry. After the film, I sat in my car and just cried my eyes out for 20 minutes before I could even start the engine. It is one of the most emotionally incredible films I've ever seen. I cried from horror, hopelessness, disgust, depression hope, levity, exhilaration, beauty. All these emotions are experienced in their utmost extremes during the film.While they seem so trivial considering just what an emotional impact the boarder picture has, it would still be a crime not to mention the technical wonders of the film. First, the conceptual ones. Nothing can even begin to compare to the level of detail, credibility, logic, and altogether brilliance of the dystopian future portrayed in Children of Men. While it is a popular theory that the human race will eventually be wiped out during an all-out nuclear war, Children of Men portrays an alternate, equally logic and brilliantly ironic end to the human race  we will die out simply from natural causes. The growth in human population has just become such a burden on nature, or God, or whatever forces you wish, and through a mysterious natural phenomenon, the entire human race becomes infertile. But the movie takes this concept and pushes it to such a depressingly horrible extreme, one can't help but admire and marvel the logic while realize the fearful truth  that we're already well on the way to this tragic future the film portrays. In an attempt to find a scapegoat, the gates of Western countries are closed and an ambitious but terrible, horrible governmental campaign sets out to rid these countries of any external influences  foreigners and immigrants are round up, put in refugee camps and eventually deported  if they're lucky. Naturally, subversive resistance groups form and use the only logical tool with which to fight governments  terrorism. It's a bleak vision but one that is far from implausible. The film's crew also meticulously creates all the little details, such as leisure activities, what the outside and the street would look like 20 years in the future, clothes, cars, trinkets, little items, newsreels, mundane routines, and just about anything else you can imagine would look like, be like and work like. It's truly nothing short of remarkable.Another thing that is remarkable is the mind-blowing perfection of the cinematographic craft that materializes in the film. Cuaron creates a combination of down-to-earth hyper-realistic documentary-style film-making, utilizing completely hand-held cameras and long takes in order to simply allow all the details of the world and the setting exist without having to be emphasized; with an extremely self-aware use of colour tone (mainly pale blues and lots of greys) and absolutely gorgeous naturalistic lighting.The actors and director Alfonso Cuaron did a flawless, amazing effort. Clive Owen is intense and absolutely incredible as the protagonist. As with pretty much all of his roles, it is not a showy performances and doesn't feature any of the theatrics many famous lead roles feature  it's a very minimalist ad extremely naturalistic performance, but that's not to say that it isn't intense or emotional  it is abundant in both. With this film, Owen really seals his authority as one of the most credible actors working today.In all, Children of Men is a spectacle to behold. As an entity that exists within the cinematic craft, it's totally incomparable, with some of the best film-making I've seen in any movie, coupled with extremely remarkable direction and an even more remarkable depiction and portrayal of its setting. As a science fiction thriller, it delivers on an indescribable scale: Its concept and the mechanics of its futuristic setting are amazingly well thought-out, and their portrayal is bleak, depressing, shocking and one hundred percent credible and believable. When the film gets tense  and it is extremely tense throughout most of its runtime  it really keeps you right on the edge of your seat, clutching the handle tightly, and has you holding your breath. In the much broader sense, the film is a bleak mirror, or perhaps continuation of the already downward-spiraling current reality in the world today. Parallels between the dynamics of the world throughout its history and the setting of the film are dire and prominent. But all this is just the ribbon that ties the real package  an emotional core, a punch in the stomach so powerful; it is extremely difficult to remain oblivious.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Watch it and learn something from it,"""Children of men"" is easily movie of the year. Of course, it won't get any Oscar, but did ""Blade Runner"" got anything?First thing that you will notice about this movie is that violence really looks brutal. If you think that there is something romantic and nice about war, please watch this movie. Also, it is SF, but for me - this is probably most realistic SF that I ever see, and future described in it doesn't look that far.Story itself is very symbolic. It is not important why humans can't have children any more; important is what kind of world we are leaving to them anyway. Main character in this movie never takes gun, even if sometimes that looks like best choice. Choices he made are choices of common sense - there is nothing on this world more important than life of human being, no matter if it is just another man or last baby on earth. If there is some idea that claims to be more important than human life, then there is something wrong with idea. How human life is valuable, can be understand in world without kids - then life of one kid seems more important than world itself.Also, this movie put one big equation sign between people. In refugee town, first we see Arab demonstration, but after few seconds - we see French refugees. In cage, woman speaks on Serbian asking for water (Balkan wars), but couple meters after it, German is asking for food also. In bus, we have Italian crying. To average western viewer scene when he sees Arab demonstration or Bosnian refugee are not life changing - he saw that before, on evening news. How horrible this really is, he can find out when he sees that same thing can happen to anyone. There is nothing cool about dying; there are no long speeches, blue sky, and long shots. People die in a second, when not expected, and their deaths look absurd, because they are. Death is impersonal and fabricated, because when there is 100 death people of bomb in one second, you forget to realize how horrible death of one human being is. This movie will remind you on that fact.Already famous long shot is one of the most impressive long shots ever. I find acting in this movie brilliant - it is never exaggerated, it is never 'I want to win Oscar tonight, look how hyperemotional I am"". We have great actors (Clive Owen, Michael Caine and Julianne Moore, among others), that are willingly part of movie, never becoming greater then story.What to say at the end: watch this movie more then once. No matter if you will focus on story, acting, directing or music - you will enjoy every time. This is by far best movie released this year, with strong message that everyday world, soaked in meaningless blockbusters, keep to forget.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
very bad movie,"whoever thought this movie was nice must be out of his mind. first of all the story is very disturbing , it may be original but very disturbing. second the ending is pointless!!! if Kee gets pregnant so what?!?!? does that mean all women can get pregnant now? or does she become like an ant queen and keeps giving birth every 9 months to the world's babies?!?!? they don't show you.. it's pointless. and Clive owen is tooooo dead and dull in the movie. i mean bombs are flying and machine guns everywhere, and he just walks on by as if nothing happened. and why didn't julian duck when they were going to shoot at her? she saw the man pointing the gun in her face.. that was pretty stupid.. the music is amazing though , i can give u that for sure..",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Strawberries! 🍓,"It's 2027. No woman has born a child in 18 yrs, which has led to a complete break down of society. Only Britain has managed to maintain some semblance of order, which has led many people to seek refuge there.

A good movie that could have been great.,"My biggest beef with ""Children of Men"" is that it strays so wildly from P.D. James' book - not even necessarily in plot line or character qualities (though it does do that) but thematically and morally. The book is quite explicitly (and implicitly) Christian in its narrative arc and in the protagonist's crisis of conscience and evolution. The creators of the film appear to have deliberately omitted this crucial underpinning of the novel, only making a shallow nod to it in the midwife's loopy pastiche of new-age spirituality. I found the midwife incredibly irritating in the movie, incidentally, whereas I didn't in the book. Luke is a completely different character in the movie than he is in the book - and I mean COMPLETELY different. Unrecognizable. I know, it's an adaption of the book, and a facsimile shouldn't be expected... but I resent the almost complete excoriation of what I believe to be the author's intent in telling a redemptive story based in Christianity. To me, this is not really an adaptation of the book but an entirely different story with a similar premise. Stylistically, it is incredibly well done, the acting is fabulous, Clive Owen is brilliant, and there are some beautiful scenes (Theo escorting Kee out of the crumbling building comes to mind). But, having read the book, the film rang shallow overall to me.Also, a mild peeve: I get that bad guys use rough language. That's realistic. But the f-word as noun, verb and adjective in the same sentence, over and over and over? Incredibly annoying.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
'Children of Men'- avoiding the Hollywood cliques,"When I read the book by PD James on which this film is based about 15 years ago I thought it was a terrifying concept, a world without future. No more Christmas, no schools, a death of everything that determines the future of man. It put me in touch with how much we, as humans, are driven innately by the knowledge that there is a future beyond our own existence. As it is in most cases the film was not as powerful as the book but I was impressed by the depiction of futuristic London and the glimmer of hope amongst the war zone into which humanity had descended. Michael Caine shines as the eccentric hippie who lovingly attends to his disabled wife and Clive Owen extends himself as the chain smoking hero who doesn't need a cache of firearms to justify this mantle. 'Children of Men' did not descend into 'Hollywoods empty servings' of a film with a neat, predictable platform for the 'major' actors, and instead made the viewer experience the sense of a world that has lost its direction and predictability in deploying the Hollywood formula.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Terror has never been depicted more realistically,"""Children Of Men"" might go down in history as the movie that did for the depiction of terror what ""Saving Private Ryan"" did to battle scenes. It's gruesome, it's brutal, it's real. The whole movie is like a kick in the guts. Although the story is set in the future, it draws a lot of parallels to what is happening today with some references to the prosecution of Hitler's regime and the biblical story of the birth of Jesus Christ as one precious life is being protected in the midst of chaos and mass murder.With the shaky camera-work this movie sometimes feels like watching the news, which is not to say that ""Children Of Men"" hasn't got any storytelling offer. This is an exciting and thrilling movie. Every time you think that the movie is starting to get slow another plot point is made and keeps you interested.The story itself sometimes seems a bit holey. We never really know who exactly is fighting who and for what reason. The main characters' moves sometimes aren't comprehensible and some details and developments seem a bit implausible.However, Alfonso Cuarón more than makes up for these flaws with his fantastic direction and the bleak atmosphere he creatrs. There are three moments in particular that I found totally amazing. The first is a scene where the main characters are being attacked by terrorists in the woods. The second is a car chase with cars that have to be pushed. It's like the reverse of a high speed chase but it's twice as thrilling. The third key moment is a sequence near the end of the movie where all hell breaks loose in a ghetto. In an amazingly long and well executed tracking shot we are shown absolute mayhem. There's blood sprinkled at the camera, it's as if we were right there with the main character. This is the sequence that I was talking about when I said terror has never been depicted more realistically and it is this scene that will stick in your mind after you have left the cinema.This is a very unusual film, comparable maybe to ""12 Monkeys"" or its predecessor ""La jetée"". This one has got a message that comes through in its pictures more than in the actual story. Alfonso Cuarón and Alejandro González Iñárritu are still fighting for the title ""Best Contemporary Mexican Director"". I haven't seen ""Babel"", yet, but to top ""Children Of Men"" it must be really good.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I hope it will open a few more eyes to the future we are creating,"I liked this movie very much, I hope it will act as an eye opener for people to see what kind of future we could be creating for ourselves if we aren't careful and do something about it before it's too late.This vision of the future is very scary for the fact we can see a lot of this happening now. Much of the imagery is taken directly from what can already be seen in the news.All we need is some kind of catalyst.

refreshingly NOT filled with icons of America,"This is the best filmed ""end of mankind"" movie I've ever seen. Usually these set-in-the-future, apocalyptic kind of films end up being clichéd and filled with overused crumbling Manhattan landmarks like they're the only buildings in the world that matter. And then invariably some nobody at the end has to (successfully) by ""fluke"" dodge 10,000 rounds of ammunition and rise to a challenge of running up the colors in true American heroism that ruins so many could-have-been good movies. I loved how this film had NONE of that. It was set in Britain in 2027 but it definitely took some political stabs at the whole ""Homeland Security"" stuff going on in the US right now. All that aside however, it was a film that took you right into the action. Many times it was all hand held, 1st person perspective filming like Saving Private Ryan meets The Bourne Identity kind of thing. I had seen the previews and I wasn't thrilled about seeing it but some friends dragged me along last night. I surprised even myself as I came out immediately raving about it.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A brilliant apocalyptic masterpiece,"Yes, I watched Children of Men. To my surprise this movie premiered here in Mexico very early and I was one of the lucky ones to watch this fantastic apocalyptic film. With an amazing direction by Alfonso Cuarón, Children of Men is a science fiction film set in the future where the whole world is in chaos and humanity is at the board of extinction because every woman in the planet has become unfertil, and the youngest person on the planet has just died. Then when all hopes seem lost, a girl gets pregnant, holding the key to salvation.Children of Men is one of those movies that make you sad, because yes, there are lots of scenes were your heart just breaks, but also (and this is what makes the movie fantastic), when you think everything is lost, a light of hope and joy emerges from the darkest time. Alfonso Cuarón achieves this in the most incredible way with marvellous visuals and special effects and with an amazing script, that never fails to shock and succeed.To Cuarón's amazing direction, joins Clive Owen's perfect performance. Owen is more than excellent in the male leading role, demonstrating that he indeed deserved that Oscar nomination in 2004 for Closer. This is definitely his best work, and he is also my personal pick for Best Actor of 2006. Joining the cast is also Juliane Moore and Michael Caine (who brings a very charming and funny character to the film), also one of the best actors of the year. And last, but not least, we have newcomer Claire-Hope Ashitey, who gives a very powerful performance.Children of Men is not only the best drama picture we've seen this year, but also one of the best movies of our time. It leaves us a message that we'll never forget, and teaches us that there's always hope, no matter how bad things can look. This is a film that won't be ignored, and that deserves a look from each and everyone of you.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Vile propaganda,"I thought this film was grossly offensive. It presents a completely hysterical, one dimensional view. The movie is a full on anti western propaganda screed, intent on presenting a very one sided, one dimensional view of certain issues. As such, it is nothing more than a nasty polemic which does not attempt in any way to present a balanced view, or a balanced projection of the future. It is loaded with anti-west, anti-establishment clichés. The greater hypocrisy is that this message is intended as ""free speech"" - the same freedom they deny to anyone who disagrees with them.I feel this film is contemptible in every way, nothing more than agit prop to push the same tired old barrows that have actually caused the current fouled up situation in the UK.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Amazing cinema, let down by poor story.","Children of Men (COM, as I will now refer to it as) is not a movie you recommend to your friends. Yes, it's violent but who doesn't enjoy a good dose of violence. What COM lacks is substance and without it, the film feels slightly weak.Alfonso Cauron set out to accomplish something other than entertain his audiences with COM. You could argue that he is making a point about present day issues regarding racial profiling and fear mongering. But then, what film these days isn't trying to deliver a message.After viewing COM I have a lot of respect for Mr. Caurons eye as a director but I feel that the message he was trying to express have ultimately been sullied by the films lack of back story and information. Not to give away any of the plot it's suffice to say this movie lacks the padding it needed to make it truly acceptable to audiences expecting 'more'.This however should not deter people who can look past such misdemeanors and go and see a film that is incredibly engaging and extremely well shot. Even without the information you so dearly crave as the credits roll any lover of cinema will be able to sit back and appreciate the creative prowess so apparent in this film. Not since Kubrick have I been so stunned by such rock steady camera work.The opinions expressed in this film can be interpreted as many different things, depending on your own opinions about standard of living and racial acceptance. The closing 45 minutes of COM illustrate a world we so often view many miles away through the lens of a CNN or FOX camera, devoid of any true emotion. COM makes you walk the path of the deprived and forces you to accept what you see.Whilst not a moving picture in my opinion, Children of Men is an important film due solely to the fact that Mr. Cauron set out to shoot the film HE wanted to shoot. It is reassuring to know that there still remain film makers daring enough to pursue their own ends and not bow down to others.Perhaps the scariest idea to take away with you after viewing is that often in this world the truest face of evil in this world is the most familiar.A sterling effort by Clive Owen, who I believe held the film together with his down but not out performance of a man fighting to make a difference. Michael Caine injected some much needed comic relief which helped keep the film fresh in the viewer's heads.I want to give COM an 8, but due to the many questions left unanswered it slides to 7.5 out of 10. Once again, this films main attraction is its simply amazing cinematography, the best in recent films.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Premise better than the movie,"The Premise of this movie was excellent, the fact that there had been no births in the world for 18 years. The movie starts out encouragingly enough with news that the worlds youngest person, Diego who was a celebrity at 18, is dead.****SPOLIER**** The plot falls away from there. There was no tension or deliberation when Theo decides to help Julian, which he knows will alter his life dramatically. Heck, he doesn't even know Kee is pregnant at that point. The movie seemed to gloss over that point.The second thing that bothered me was the locking up of illegal aliens. OK, no babies born for 18 years, and the ""big"" focus of the government is keeping people out of the UK? First, don't you think that they would be focused on bigger things....like REPRODUCING! Also, if the population is dwindling, wouldn't you want as many people as possible in your country, considering that in 50 years no one will be left! It just didn't make sense.****SPOILER**** Third, there was no clear reason as to why Luke and his gang wanted to kill Theo. I know it was necessary for the story to go forward, but they could have given a plausible reason for it.Most importantly, the fact that no baby has been born in 18 years is so interesting, so chilling, that it should have been used more in the script...almost like a character unto itself. What happened to all the school teachers? What was society's plans for the next 50 years...when we would become extinct? What would happen to armies and sports teams in 20 years? Run by 50 year-old's? Even Theo's ""London 2012"" Olympic shirt could have been used by saying organizers of the Olympic games say 2040 is the last year of the games. Also, the reason why there was this mass infertility could have and should have been explored more. Miriam's character did touch on it in the school room, and it was reverting, but it left me with a feeling of wanting more.****SPOILER**** Finally, this movie did have its moments, one dramatic one is the baby crying as all fighting stops. Soldiers fall to their knees as the sight of the first baby in 18 years. But as pleasing as that scene was, the end of the scene was as bizarre. How do hundreds of soldiers witness an infant for the first time in 18 years and then COMPLETELY IGNORE her when the fighting starts back up, leading to the final escape? All in all, the premise almost carries this movie...but I would be hard pressed to give it a thumbs up?",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Horrible film, a travesty to the book","This film is appalling. I simply cannot believe the reviews I have read in the press and the incredibly inflated polling numbers on this website. Seriously, it makes me wonder about the veracity of the postings. Is it possible that film studios flood these sites. Please note the very very low ratings that have come out most recently since the release in the U.S.In sequence: No, this is not a good action film.Worse yet, it completely distorts the wonderful work of P.D.James whose original is profoundly religious, not a violent action thriller. There is little to no dialogue, no acting except everyone walks around looking depressed for ninety brief minutes, a lot of chasing and shooting, and a muddled action and sequence to the film. There is no humor or poignancy or relief to the dreary action of cinematography. What was the director thinking? What are the reviewers thinking who voted this as a good film? The film is relentlessly dark, unimaginative, and depressing, but without a point.Why did the director change the sterility of men in the book, to women being unable to have children in the film? The title is, after all, Children of Men. There are many other gratuitous changes and distortions of the original that don't bear noting. But even standing on its own, the film is simply unbearable. ANd incomprehensible.I heard no positive comments in the packed theater where I saw it tonight. And many many complaints, along the lines of ""I will never again believe a movie reviewer.""And by the way, since the sequence and plot are rushed and over-edited, why such a short film for the eleven bucks I paid per ticket tonight.

One of the most existentially important films of all time,"With near perfect pacing and cinematography, this film encapsulates almost if not all of the essential aspects of the social-political problems that face us as human beings currently whilst also ruminating about how much worse they could possibly be. Through the lens of well crafted filmmaking it provides a dystopia that is as believable as it is palpable. I can hardly find anything criticizable about the well thought out and philosophically realized world presented. I consider this film to be definitively a modern masterpiece that elicits every possible emotional response it sets out to without losing the sense of hope we all cling on to with our own existence. It is very hard to consider this anything more than a modern masterpiece and at the very least the highlight of alfonso cuaron's career.

This movie is hype!,"First off, let me say that this movie has a top proved top notch director and some top notch actors. The premise is intriguing and I was looking forward to seeing this film.There has been a lot of hype that this is the next Blade Runner.This movie makes Code46 look like a masterpiece.It's all hype and people trying to make you think you should like this. Forget all the rave reviews and judge the movie on it's own merit.I am not going to throw in any specific spoilers here. I knew the movie would be very dark and not have an optimistic tone which is fine by me. However, the characters are throw away. There is zero sympathy built for any of the characters and I didn't care what happened to them. In fact, I didn't care what happened to the world in this obnoxiously filmed movie overusing hand cams and making the future look the present.The ending of the movie is so anti-climatic and ridiculously inane that it makes you wonder how this movie got the green light.For the life of me I cannot figure out where the $80 million was spent. It looks like 2 million was spent on the movie and $78 million was handed over to critics to say how great the movie is.There are better episodes of the Outer Limits and a similar episode exploring the same themes done much better.I gave the movie a 5 out of ten which is generous only because of what the movie tried to accomplish. Unfortunately, it falls way short of being anything great.If by any chance you are watching it because of the references to Blade Runner then skip this one and watch Blade Runner again which was a dark toned movie about the future done right.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The future is here,"Alfonso Cuarón has many virtues as a director and they are all in evidence in this powerful, spectacular movie. My favorite virtue of his, which was much in evidence in the great Y tu mamá también, is his ability to weave many different moods and tones into a coherent emotional whole. Just as in Y tu mamá también he achieved a lovely melancholy undertone to the picaresque adventures of the two main characters, here he melds an urgent, moving emotional core to what is essentially an action movie. Or perhaps it's the other way around. His refreshing lack of sentimentality is what makes this possible: his movies are emotionally complex. Cuarón seems allergic to melodrama and to sentimentality, and I hope he is never cured. That is what I love about his films, the playfulness and sense of humor, the complexity, not of storytelling but of human emotion, the truthfulness of feeling. A couple of small details, like angelic choral music in a redemptive scene or the name of a ship at the end are as much as he is willing to concede to sentimentality; not much, considering that the fate of mankind is at stake. Children of Men is an apocalyptic movie about a future that is too close to home. It is apocalyptic, yet not futuristic. That is, the immediate future looks less like the Jetsons and more like a nightmare out of Hyeronimus Bosch. It takes place in 2027, which is just around the corner, and it's not a happy sight. In this world torn apart by conflict and self-destruction, the discourse that we hear today from the likes of Bush and Donald Rumsfeld has come to pass. Illegal immigrants are put in cages and deported, they are sent to detention camps closely reminiscent of Guantánamo and Abu Ghraib, the environment is almost all toxic waste. The premise that the entire world suffers from collective infertility doesn't seem at all far-fetched. What makes the movie harrowing is how close we are to being in such a state. It's almost as if the filmmakers are saying ""wipe the self-satisfied grin off your face and don't get too comfortable, for we are already there"". This is a movie where there is no detachment. The camera follows the hero like a shadow and it feels as if you are there with him, right next to the explosions, shockingly close to the violence, with the point of view of the naked eye, not of the language of the camera. Yet amidst the incredible chase scenes and the beautifully exploding mayhem, Cuarón and Lubezki are capable of achieving quiet, luminous moments of grace. I was frantically looking in the credits for whoever was responsible for the production design, which, with the entire art department, deserves a standing ovation and an Oscar (imdb says it's Jim Clay and the great Geoffrey Kirkland). I don't think I remember (except for High and Low by Kurosawa) a film that is more crammed with visual information. Because of the wide angles, the frame is full of details, and it takes a few moments to get used to so much coming from the screen. The context is as much in the foreground as the characters. I heard Cuarón say in an interview that this was his and the great cinematographer Emanuel Lubezki's approach in Y tu mamá también and they use it here as well, albeit on a much grander scale. There are not a lot, if any, traditional set ups of close up, medium shot, and reverse takes in Children of Men. The camera is fully engaged in the world around the characters. As you may have already heard, there are several extended shots in this film that are absolutely mindboggling. The piece de resistance is a climactic nine minute (or so) extended tracking shot without a single cut. However, to their credit, Lubezki and Cuarón so immerse you in the dramatic narrative that you barely notice there is a tour de force in progress. It is a thing of breathtaking power and beauty. In Clive Owen (long live his mother, as they say in Spain, praise the Lord for making him, a bona fide movie star with tons of talent), Cuarón has found a perfectly reluctant hero and one of the main reasons why the movie works at an emotional level. Owen plays Theo, a jaded ex-activist, embittered and hurt by the loss of his son and who has grown inured to the horrors around him. I will not give you the entire plot of the movie, as Anthony Lane did in his review, because you must see for yourself. But Owen gives a sharp, moving performance of a despondent human being who is slowly wakened from his apathy by having to perform a heroic deed almost against his will. As the world collapses around him, what Theo has that many others don't is basic human decency. It's as simple as that. It is not grandiloquent outrage or a self-righteous belief in freedom and democracy or none of that crap that gets bandied about by the bad guys nowadays as an excuse for their self-interested mayhem. Theo drinks, he smokes, he winces at the grief of others and he wears his task quite uncomfortably on his sleeve. Harrison Ford, Bruce Willis or any of those simplistic, grandiose fools, he ain't. In the end, what I most admire about Children of Men, besides it's undeniable artistry, and despite some of its commercial inclinations, is its commitment to protest. Cuarón does not shy away from shocking violence, but it is not much different from what you see on CNN any given day: people's limbs torn out by bombs, ethnic strife, a generalized disregard for human life. The movie has a strong, quietly indignant point of view about the state of affairs today, and that is what makes it so relevant, so powerful and so disturbing.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Visually stunning, emotionally sterile","One of the arguments (in my mind, anyway) against ""A.I."" was that the project, long-gestating with Stanley Kubrick prior to his death, and taken over by Steven Spielberg after, was at odds with the former's emotionally sterile obsession with style, and the latter's fixation with sentimentality and family values. And in a sense, that film-making dichotomy is just as much on display in ""Children of Men,"" only instead of Spielbergian emotion, director Alfonso Cuaron opts for the frustrating detachment of Kubrick, to the point where no matter what fantastic visual is being displayed on-screen, it's hard to care all that much because the characters--no matter how well-played--are little more than genre ciphers. The film forgoes whatever literary quality P.D. James' source material possessed, instead going for gritty, in-the-moment documentary realism; and while Cuaron shows impressive skill with long, complex takes and CGI, the film feels shallow (and sometimes shrill) in its overall narrative. What we have is essentially the tale of mankind's death knell due to women becoming infertile (it's none-too-subtly implied that this is the source of terrorism, death, and destruction the world over), until an immigrant girl (running afoul of some eco-terrorist types) turns up pregnant, resulting in an unbroken chase to get her to the ""Human Project,"" a fabled safe haven that may not exist. The performances are excellent if not truly transcendent--Clive Owen as the reluctant protector; Julianne Moore as his radical ex-wife; and Michael Caine as the cerebral, aging hippie who clings to hope--perhaps because the characters don't get the faithful fleshing-out they deserve (some only get a few minutes of screen time before making their exit--is this a comment on the film's own ""time is fleeting"" theme?), leading to an experience that kept me at a distance. Don't get me wrong--""Children of Men"" is a well-done film, albeit sometimes a bit thick with its philosophy, but a step away from Kubrick would have been a step in the right direction.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A disgrace to the author's vision,"I read the book several years before Children of Men came to screen and was haunted by the tale that P.D James unraveled. When I heard there was to be made I looked forward to see how it was portrayed. This film was one of the greatest disappointments of books turned into film. The major plot points were completely disregarded and the story torn to pieces. Even looking at the film from a non-biased point of view, the story got lost in ridiculous gun battles and was not pieced well together. It lacked flow that makes a film watchable. I've told everyone I know that this film will disappoint them and those that did eventually see it hated it as well.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Cinema at its very best,"Wow what can i say about this amazing film, just when i was starting to get bored of all the clichéd movies of the average todays cinema, and then it comes this movie with such an interesting story, and the best of all, the way it was done, technically perfect, amazing cinematography, brilliant performances, especially from Clive Owen and Michael Caine, great effects, and also the long shots were impressive.This is a slow paced kind of chasing movie, with very stressful moments and tense music, and its developed in a way that can be sometimes a little confusing, because the story starts an no one explains nothing at first, you have to put a lot of attention on some parts that doesn't look to be so important but they are, anyway at the end its still one of the best movies of the year.Definitely we have to keep an eye on Alfonso Cuaron next movies because he has demonstrated to be one of the best directors of this times.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
a plausible attack on the senses,"Children of men. Going in ""blind"" to see this I was expecting a happy sci-fi yarn. what I got was a fantastically gritty thriller, set 20 years into the future,and once you have got past the premise that every women on the planet is infertile, you can enjoy this film. The immigrant issue is a visually disturbing possible future truth, it has an attention to detail that impressed as does the whole film. The violence also has the power to shock in a way you don't get,even with most shoot em up films. Michael Caine as chirpy as ever, lightens the frankly heavy storyline, Clive Owen is no ""action Jackson"", however is very credible as a reluctant hero. This film stands its ground and maybe needs a second viewing as some scenes are run at a fast pace.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A grim and gritty masterpiece,"The basic premise of 'Children of Men' is so wonderfully simple, it's almost mythic. The women of the world have been infertile for 18 years; hope has vanished from humanity; then... we meet a lone, pregnant girl, and her survival becomes the epitome of mankind's struggle.All political and religious subtext aside (and there's a fair bit), this apocalyptic tale really grips through that central idea. A disillusioned man (Clive Owen) is tasked to lead the young mother through nightmarish southern England, to freedom and the 'Human Project', a secret organisation that may or may not exist. What happens on the way is riveting and often shocking. This is a vision of the future both gritty and disturbing, and director Alfonso Cuaron has a fantastic ability to evoke setting.Owen's character arc is traditional for this type of reluctant hero, but he's highly effective here. I don't think I've ever seen him overplay a scene. Michael Caine is good as an eccentric old hippie with it all figured out. What impressed me most about 'Children of Men' though, was how real everything seemed. Set in 2027, it could've been tomorrow but for a few clever touches here and there to show where we might be headed.I was very impressed with the choices made by the filmmakers, and I expect you will be too.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Action packed and boring?  I'm afraid so.,"I'll credit Alfonso Cuaron for his fine direction. I certainly believed the reality of the future presented, and the action sequences looked very real. The problem is that the characterizations, besides Michael Caine's, are flat. I doubt you'll shed a tear for anyone in this film. Maybe it's a ""read the book first"" kind of movie, because I honestly don't understand how it was rated so highly. It's currently ranked higher than Gone With the Wind, for goodness sake!It's a shame, because Children of Men has a great premise worthy of a more global exploration. Maybe it will be remade into something better a few decades from now.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I wasn't expecting the film to affect me so much,"I usually do not respond intensely to films of future dystopia, so I was not expecting much when I went to Children of Men. But my heart was racing while watching this movie, and my mind is still reeling with its images and depictions of Britain as a war zone of refugee camps, random violence, omnipresent police, religious sects and the disillusion of humans who for a generation haven't heard a newborn baby's cry. I'm sure my strong reaction to the film comes in part from the breathtaking camera-work, including several exceptionally long takes during action sequences which must have been incredibly difficult to shoot. Yes, there are plenty of explosions, stray bullets and blood, but the technical effects entailed are not what draws one's attention.To avoid being a spoiler, I can't share all the various images and features of the action that add up to one of the most unsettling, apocalyptic visions I've ever seen. But I will say that part of their effectiveness comes from these being presented as a given, not something to be laboriously explained. Clive Owen gives an excellent, understated performance as a once-idealistic bureaucrat propelled into a battle. This film would be pretty awful if some sort of hammy Hollywood actor like Tom Cruise were in the lead. But such an actor was not chosen because this film has far more intelligence in the making than most.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Very odd, what happens in a world without children's voicesChildren of Men","Although I have been waiting months to see the film based on its trailer, I couldn't help but be disappointed by how much that tease gave away. I remember that no matter how engrossing the visuals and music were in that two-minute clip, I could not shake the feeling I had just seen the entire film condensed. Thankfully, after finally seeing it (hopefully it will make it to Buffalo soon so I can catch the amazing cinematography on the big screen), I can say that the trailer really just shows the tip of the iceberg for what will happen. Not only does it deceive in a good way, it hides the real emotional journey that the movie takes.In twenty years our world will be on a steady road to manmade Armageddon. For the last eighteen years, women have been unable to conceive a child and this horror has allowed countries to go on a rampage to try and preserve their own ideals, as every day is a day closer to extinction. Wars are raging everywhere and it seems only Britain has been able to fortify itself to try and sustain what life is left for the small hope of survival. Refugees from all around the globe have tried to seek asylum in England, but are turned away or housed in detention camps until they can be disposed of. A group of insurgents, the Fishes, are trying to combat with the government's harsh policies of immigration, however, their war just begins a more rapid extermination of humanity as bombs and bullets fly throughout the streets. Maybe the bombs are acts of terrorism by the rebels, maybe they are set by the government to instill fear in the against the insurgents, either way the world has been shattered behind recognition.Clive Owen plays a former activist named Theo who has lost faith in the causes he used to live to defend. He works a menial job and longs for the visits to the countryside with an old friend Jasper, (played wonderfully out-of-character by Michael Caine), to hold onto a small sliver of what life used to be. When kidnapped by the Fishes, led by his ex-wife (the stalwart Julianne Moore) whose own faith in the cause has multiplied since the same event which dissolved Owen's, he becomes a part of what could be the miracle that will save the world. His involvement in this mission doesn't as much reinvigorate his belief in doing what he thinks is right as instead shake him from the meaningless life he's lived these past years, awakening him from his debilitating self-loathing. He is able to see first-hand the atrocities being committed and decides to put his life at risk for this young woman who's miraculous pregnancy could save the world. Theo doesn't do it for mankind, he keeps his goals closer to home. In saving this woman's life, so her baby can live, he might be able to forgive himself for the life chance has created.Owen is superb and he needs to be. Theo is in practically every scene as Cuarón has decided on using a cinema verite style staying close by in a fly-on-the-wall capacity. As an audience, we are thrust into the action as it happens all around our hero and ourselves. The singular vision Cuarón has successfully attempted here is unfathomable. There are multiple instances where we are treated to long takes lasting from five to ten minutes at a time. (I read an article that these shots are in fact digital composites bridged together to appear seamless; even so, the accomplishment is astonishing) One sequence towards the middle of the film has us inside a car with four characters. We spin 360 degrees around the interior in order to stay up on the conversation throughout and once the car comes under attack by savages, the view still doesn't break until after the car finally stops and the camera gets out to view the roadside. Whether you end up liking the movie or not, you must appreciate the technical achievement that went into it.Along with the fantastic visual flair and top-notch performances is the simple yet profound story structure. Like Cuarón did with Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, (having almost everything from the novel somewhere in the background), he gives the audience the benefit of the doubt. He understands that the medium of film is not the same as a book. With film we can see the descriptions and events occurring as though we are a part of the action; there is nothing more I hate then a character explaining something to someone that already knows for the sake of us, the viewers, being totally aware in case we missed extrapolating it for ourselves in the scene before. Does it matter where the troops are coming from? Does it matter what scientists are doing to find a cure? Why are babies no longer able to be born? None of these questions need to be systematically answered as the true story is of a man finding a reason to live again and his quest to save his young friend and her child. Less is definitely more and Cuarón truly understands how to mold cinema into giving us the answers we need without spoon-feeding. The brilliant performances by Chiwetel Ejiofor and Claire- Hope Ashitey are enhanced by the fact we know little of their past. We know just as much as Theo and therefore can relate to his actions rather than second-guessing everyone's motives because we know more than the protagonist. We experience it all along with the characters on screen. Cuarón is not telling a story that has happened, but instead allowing us to be a part of what's happening right now.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Bad as in awful,"Normally my genre, but this film made me wish for the words ""The End"" after no more then 45 minutes. There is no way to connect to the characters since you won't get to know them enough. The scenario has huge holes, I mean huge. And the playing of Clive Owen is as if his mind is with the next appointment of the day and not with the work he's doing for the film. In general the acting isn't that convincing, only the scenes with Michael Caine are very enjoyable to watch. Yes it's some sort of Film Noir and yes, the future isn't bright. But please, at least make a watchable and some sort of believable movie about it.1 out of 10. I haven't seen worse in ages.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The Department of Homeland Security has ordered a militarised Police Force to detain all illegal immigrants and hold them in a fortified and barb-wired compound . A former activist and peacemaker (Clive Owen as Theo, in fact , he does not use or even touch a gun at any point throughout the entire movie) agrees to help transport a miraculously pregnant woman to a sanctuary at sea .

Children of Men follows and restore faith for a future beyond those presently on Earth . Meantime , a rebel outfit of militia (Chiwetel Ejiofor , Charlie Hunnam) refugees known as The Fish loom threateningly in the background , battling for the rights of the illegals and determined to cause major unrest . There no children , no future , no hope.Exciting rendition that picks up every mote of bleak despair P.D. James's novel of a totalitarian future society in which a man whose daily work is rewriting history tries to help a pregnant young ; though in the movie, the infertility crisis is the result of all women being infertile and in the original novel , it's the result of all men producing no sperm . This interesting retelling describes an eerie future in frenetic Cinema Vérite' style , pointed ideological concerns and gripping familiarity . A hard , explosive , paranoid time when England is the only surviving nation and fertility crisis means no babies have been born for 18 years old , being well set in and around a dystopian London fractious with violence and warring nationalistic sects .

Thought-provoking and thoughtful script by Paul Chart who wrote the first version but it was re-written a few times by other screenwriters including Mark Fergus, Hawk Ostby, Timothy J. Sexton and director Alfonso Cuarón himself ; finally the final version was written by David Arata, Cuarón and Sexton . Clive Owen's insights greatly impressed Cuarón and he contributed a great deal of uncredited work to the final script . ""Children of men"" is a workmanlike rendition of notorious novel that captures the desolation and misery found within those pages , though some liberties have been taken with the script . Nice acting by Clive Owen as a man man who holds the unexpected discovery of a lone pregnant woman and the desperate journey to deliver her to safety . Very good support cast such as Michael Caine , Pam Ferris , Chiwetel Ejiofor , Charlie Hunnam , Danny Huston , Julianne Moore and cameo by P.D.

Cuaron said in one interview that he wanted to shoot this film like La Battle of Argiels (1966) rather than Blade Runner (1982), almost like a documentary about something that happened back in 2027 .

Entertaining but superficial,"Make a movie about a subject everyone has an opinion, especially one that's in current news, and some will be blown away purely by relevance and others will gawk at it's ignorance of the depth of the matter.Make no mistake, this is an entertainment flick that has little depth and merely uses bad news as the background, this is the spectacle everyone seems to be praising as insight. This is hardly the case however.The movie at times has some poor acting, in your face explanation of what the audience should know (exposition) and half baked ideas about the premise. On the positive side the cinematography is great, and there's some electric action.Don't mistake this movie as intelligent or insightful, it has the ring of a load of mates down the pub going what if this and what if that.

"Brilliant, though-provoking film ...","I went to see this with my A2 class today, as it has some similarities with 'The Handmaid's Tale' by Margaret Atwood, so our teacher took us to see it and I was blown away.This year so far I haven't seen a film that's as good as this - realistic, very good acting, cinematography, directing etc.Basically, women are infertile in this near-future, and Clive Owen's character helps the only pregnant woman to safety.It is quite a bleak, serious film, but that's the point! Everything is shot in a way that makes it seem so real, it's actually freaky. Gritty, violent and though-provoking, with a solid story and characters we care about.

Betrayal of Men,"This film seems to have received incredible high praise and is currently listed in the Top250 of this website. I hate to fly in the face of such adoration, but this film left me completely indifferent and rather irritated if not highly annoyed. Sure, there are a few nice setpieces, but it's all set against a hack-handed background rendering them only a mild distraction from the otherwise continuous amazement at the film's triteness and mindboggling illogical plotpoints. The film is poorly structured and almost entirely if not completely un-engaging with the most lame and sappy ending I have ever seen to a film.This film is supposed to be full of big ideas on Britain's dystopian future and the reactions of the public to an infertility plagued society. Angry youth throwing rocks at trains, the rails to Auschwitz have been reopened and are deporting the fugees (not the band) back to where they came from (hell) and even the spectrum of light is somehow compromised*. With this kind of background, you'd expect the movie to actually focus on any of it, something which this movie is acclaimed for. But apart from the main characters being in a bad mood for 90 brief minutes, there is surprisingly little this movie reflects on. The exposition on these theme's was simply replaced by endless shots of people being deported Nazi-style, the English countryside and mind-numbing dialog that was doing little else than driving the weary plot onward. The whole infertility and the world-gone-to-hell themes could just as well have been left out entirely and it wouldn't have made any difference to the actual storyline of two people on the run.*Truly Amazing that someone would spent enormous amounts of money on expensive filming equipment only to make the actual picture look like it was shot by my Uncle Fred (who has Parkinson's) who just got his Handicam yesterday for Christmas and is still working his way through the manual which is written in Chinese and which apparently only describes how to deprive the picture of colour.In Children of men subtlety was not allowed. Everything is as bad as bad comes and even good is apparently bad. The sets look over the top sleazy, our main characters are anything but likable, a pasture of grazing cows has been replaced by a smouldering pile of meat and bones, the rebels simply kill their leader over a dispute or kill policemen when they turn up at the wrong place at the wrong time. The overemphasized way of portraying such a dull and drab doomsday landscape as was done in Children of Men, surely would bother anyone who is not into cartoonistic film-making but in stead likes some subtlety on any subject matter if indeed this is presented in a serious movie. Maybe I misunderstood, but I believed that's what this movie was.Meanwhile in the film, the script is pretty awful. Caine certainly tries his utmost with it, but his lines are one-note and much too viewer-informative only to result in a feeling of 'we get it already, move on please.."". Owen is his usual wooden self and thus type-casted perfectly in the role of Theo Faron, a morose lower government official who couldn't give a fart about anything. Although I really liked his performance, his character is screenplayed terribly and I couldn't give an equal fart about his fate in the movie. Next up a utterly forgettable cameo by Julianne Moore, some B-actors to play the bad guys lead by Chiwetel Ejiofor who since his performance in Serenity for me lost all credibility as an actor. And newcomer Claire Hope Ashity as the Black Virgin Mary who does little more than swear a lot, which by modern standards, is apparently good enough for a 'solid performance' in the books of the critics. Frankly, her performance wouldn't even cut it on Eastenders.The story in Children of Men is practically non-existent and covered not much more than an action packed chase from the old peril to the land of deliverance. But this was done on purpose to not loose focus on the sublime messages it miserably failed to communicate because they forgot to include them. As a result many of the scenes drag relentlessly while jarring opera music and a hate-crime of a muzak cover-version of 'Ruby Tuesday' plundered that what was left of the viewer's will to live. Indeed, it's really all that bleak and pointless. But intentionally so! The end result of all this is an aesthetic crime against the art-loving moviegoer or the one with more than 2 brain cells to rub together.The end result is also one that is critically acclaimed by nothing less than the entire society of professional movie critics minus one or two who probably didn't receive the letter which stated they would get a nice percentage of the movie's revenues when their review would be kind. Seriously, you'd think all these glowing reviews and those on this website, were written by people who had somehow managed to miss the entirety of Western cinema.The gourmet-fare that is Children of men is actually a night out at the McDonald's of film-making where the second bite of your food is already spoiling the experience of the first. Let us all gather in prayer and hope that there won't be a sequel. Unless the sequel was already made when they created 'Shoot Em Up'. Another highly creative movie in which mr. Owen is once again protecting a baby that people are trying to kill.Evy",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Brilliant film,"I recently watched this film and I have to say it blew me away. I'm not usually a fan of Clive Owen, but I think his role in this film was spot on. Micheal Kane plays a successful futuristic type of hippie, again a spot on performance. The Director didn't stick to standard camera views and managed to keep the audience on the edge of their seats throughout the whole film.The story itself is intriguing, although could possibly do with a bit more explaining, and it shows quite a vivid future for the united Kingdom. Director uses some powerful images to emphasize the scene and the story, but still manages to keep it within a reasonable limit. The message is quite subtle throughout the film and I believe it shows a unique view of what the future holds for us.Absolutely worth a watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The main actors is some of my personal favorites, and they sure did a good Job, the feeling i had during the movie was sadness, its cause its so common with uprisings and violence around the globe, feel kinda i had seen this on the news earlier today and thats a good thing, that the producers can make me feel it that way, so i do want to check out other stuff that comes from this producer, of coz i watched Harry potter movie, but this is so different, way to go!!!!!",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Good, not great for lack of a more elaborate storyline","Children of Men is a directorial achievement, no question about it. Alfonso Cuaron made the choice of a documentary-like approach, and this is extremely well done. Sequence shots with the camera moving with the characters, and with lots of action and extras all around: kudos.Now if you set aside how it's done, and how good the cast is, you have a pretty flimsy storyline. The main character (Clive Owen) is only reacting to events, he is only a reluctant hired activist. Too much depth for this character is sprinkled here and there without leaving us time to empathise and eventually root for him.OK the dystopian reality is nicely done, but it's only a very grim background and action is reduced to characters running in front of this very background over and over again. Science fiction, social commentary are not just about finding a nice historical and sociological backdrop. Here is the big flaw in the script: the action, and the hope it is supposed to foster, feels very episodic. Just think of it: the best scenes are those with 2 characters given a real dimension by talented actors. Julianne Moore has something to display in front of the passive Clive Owen character, then it's Michael Caine and it is a real pleasure (and relief) to get to enjoy him again later.All the ""apocalyptic"" end is very well done but the movie is stalled from the start in the same way the car is in a very funny scene (was it really intentional? Could not be actual relief for the characters in the middle of action + depressing times). Actually the movie goes nowhere and never picks up speed. Director Cuaron succeeded in his technical endeavour but the rest feels empty because he confused visually gripping context and compelling story-line.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Transporting!,"I felt like I was living alongside the main characters. I even cried tears of joy for the first time in a very long time! The plot is very solid. The only reason I rated it 9 instead of 10 is because some details that I would have liked to have been explained were (purposefully) left up to the imagination. I strongly suggest that anyone who is even moderately interested in the plot sees this movie: I doubt that you will be disappointed. Julianne Moore's character is present for too brief of a time, but the time she does appear is one of her best, most realistic appearances to date. And even though many parts of the movie are shocking and sad, there is a great deal of humor in it.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
what a film.,"Set in the not too distant future in Britain, Cuarón's 'Children of Men' is a bleak look at the planet after a virus has wiped out fertility. The film starts with the death of the worlds youngest person an 18 year old boy and quickly goes on to establish a picture of the world as a pretty messed up place. Terrorists, street violence, splinter groups, homeless, armed police, immigration at an uncontrollable level, towns turned into detention centres etc its not a nice place to be. Theo gets by being either drunk or hung-over or both. He hates his job and is haunted by memories of his past and spends his days skiving off and smoking weed with jasper (a nice little turn from Michael Caine). It is only when Theo, the former activist, is contacted by his ex, the head of a terror group called the 'fishes', that his life is turned upside down. They have in their possession the miracle the world has been waiting for, a pregnant woman called Kee, and everyone has different designs on how they should use her baby to help mankind. Julian the fishes ultra cool leader knows that the only person she can really trust is her old flame Theo and so entrusts him to deliver Kee to a group of scientists who may be able to find out how in the world she managed to get pregnant and thus potentially saving mankind. From the start of this amazing film with its washed out hues and run down streets your right in there, in amongst the muck and riots, graffiti and crime, it's a skin crawling feeling. It is acted superbly and has a script that contains bursts of black humour within its dark underbelly. It is littered with clever references to life today and is even satirical at points. But the real treat for any film fan is the direction, it is at all times interesting but particularly in two tracking shots it is breathtaking. The first involving a car chase that is a nine minute long take with such a complex set up you almost sense it an impossibility. The last being an even longer tracking/set piece (that apparently has two hidden cuts) but is still a visual treat that really makes the films ending something to behold. As I think a lot of people have said already this really is the thinking mans action movie. At last a big film with something to say and what a way to say it.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A solid sci-fi adventure, but not the greatest  7/10","If I rated movies based only on visuals and technical achievements, Children of Men would be one of the greatest movies ever. The single take action sequences are flawless in execution and near-future Britain looks amazing. Everything from the cars to the bombed-out buildings, to the beautiful locales is great. Also, the concept of an infertile human race is intriguing and original.However, i failed to make a connection with any of the characters, making it harder to really care what happens to them. I haven't put my finger on why i didn't care for the characters. I think it's because they didn't seem real enough to me. They seemed very written. Clive Owen did a fine job in the leading role and i actually did care a bit about him, and Michael Caine was kinda fun, but other than that, the characters seemed like they didn't even care that they found a key to to saving humanity.Perhaps on a second viewing, which i am totally not against, i'll see something i missed and make a more emotional investment in the film.

"A good film, amazing action sequences but the story lets me down a little in the end.","I was looking forward to this film. Firstly because I'm a big fan of Alfonso Cuaron, (especially ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"") and secondly since it's been a while since I last saw a good serious British S-F film, and this looked like it.Due to the infertility of women, no new babies have been born in some 16 years. Within one hundred years there will not be a human left alive on the face of the Earth. The world has responded by falling into chaos, for without children what is there to look to? There is no future. On the verge of collapse, itself, Britain regresses into an almost fascist state, where immigrants (called fuge's (fugitive) are persecuted and removed from the cities to fenced in immigration (read concentration?) zones.The director gives us a believable and beautifully (as in starkly) realised representation for this story to occur. I think the main plus of this film is how well the reality in which this occurs has been defined, obviously this is vitally important to accept this films central premise. Another plus I found were the lead actors, who all performed brilliantly. Some insane escape/fight scenes which truly leave you on the edge of your seat up the ante and ""make"" the film for me.There are however some negatives; Some of the acting from the supporting cast is pretty abysmal, at times I felt like I was watching a play put on by amateurs at my local pub. While the story makes sense throughout I did find the end wanting a little. I felt that we are left with too many questions unresolved. I understand that this is adapted from a book, which I have not yet read, but I must assume that the ending is left intact. So my main problem may not be with the film, but rather the story, which I felt would have appeased me more with more exposition about the organisation that the lead characters are primarily concerned with.So a good film, amazing action sequences but the story letting me down a little in the end.Overall I'd give it a 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Disappointed,"I was looking forward to watching this film, as its reviews were so positive. The characterisation was undeveloped and missed much of the thrust of the original story. There was a sense of annoying vision of the future with sites of London mashed together- the Tate Modern and Battersea Power Station became one! For those of us who know London, it was poor and shattered the narrative. The details of the future were also poor they made me think that production designer popped out to Camberwell to buy second hand fruit machines and a fiat multipla. The plot felt disjointed jumping the characters in unknown places to exactly where they were supposed to be, and the refugees spoke German. All in all the film was a bit of a poor experience and only benefited from good costumes, flip-flops and Michael Cane of course. The birth scene was so unrealistic and filmed from the other side of the room! How did this get awards?",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A solemn thrilling fable. 8.2.,"This film created an intelligent surpassing theory in a future that felt like a mocking sordid sketch of our world today.
For 2006 this movie is definitely ahead of its time in regards to the amount of detail and realism the continuous shots capture, more especially the IMPRESSIVE choreography within the cinematography & acting- Or to put it simpler, the camera and acting were synced to a suspenseful perfection.
The follow scenes through the refugee camp were horrific and captured a real/true disaster that goes on in our world today.
Plus, Clive Owens' own acting was VERY GENUINE (Hugs and kisses to him).
That said I wouldn't watch this movie again because it just wasn't a classic.
As a whole, it felt like there was a layer of neutralizing gloom over it.

To me this sent the message that, despite societal restrains and conditions, everyone is still human. The soldiers, their guns cocked and ready, pointed at the next random person that they had planned to kill, still showed hope for the future. The baby, which stood for that hope, made them all stop and stare in awe. But just as the message had been beautiful, it ended with the soldiers turning away from their hope and resuming fire: Society imposes so many chains but, despite that, the chains can only bind. they cannot remove the human underneath the layers of bone, flesh and skin. But despite this glimmer of hope, the chains of society still hold fast.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Careful choreography & camera-work bring this 2-dimensional story to life,"The strength of this film is not in its plot but in its presentation. The story is pretty basic: in a dismal future where humans are infertile and hopeless, an unlikely hero fights to survive & protect one small hope of humanity. The plot is set in the beginning and remains pretty linear, but pay attention to the excellent camera work which sets this film apart from your regular dismal future action flick.In particular, the director uses long fluid takes. Like up to 5 minutes without a cut (in actuality there are some cuts but they're digitally blended together seamlessly so the effect remains continuous. In the commentary, the director says he did this to give the audience a sense of real time. And yes, it's very effective, as if you're there in the middle of the action watching things unfold second-by-second.To achieve this, the director had to go through extraordinary efforts. For example, in order to film a car chase with simultaneous dialogue from 5 people inside the car, he had to build a special car with a hole in the roof & camera crew on top so the camera could pan, twist & move through every angle necessary. Meanwhile the action of dozens of extras outside (not to mention fire & explosives) had to be carefully timed & choreographed to fit with the dialogue.In another memorable scene, again seemingly consisting of one continuous take with no cuts, the action begins in the street under intense gunfire, the camera follows our hero running down several side streets, into a bus, into a building, up a flight of stairs, down the hall, up another flight of stairs and through a bunch of rooms, all the while with scores of extras running around and shooting hundreds of bullets--all in one fluid camera take.Folks this is no ordinary action flick. It's a complex work of movie-making excellence. If you enjoy the sort of technical stuff I've been babbling about, you'll really enjoy the presentation. I haven't seen such meticulous camera work in an action flick since ""The International"" and ""Run Lola Run"" directed by German genius Tom Tykwer.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Beware! Overrated!,"Besides some amazing cinematography, and other technical merits, this movie has little to offer. Poor character development, painful exposition. This movie consists of a beginning and a middle, no proper ending anywhere to be found. As it is an adaptation of a novel, it is hard to fault them for staying true to the source material, but this movie has the same problems translating to the screen as The Da Vinci Code. The audience is expected to care about characters who are given less than 5 minutes of screen time before they are thrown into peril. Supporting characters are given annoying catch phrases or quirks in lieu of proper personalities. Look elsewhere for the next big thing in sci-fi. This is clearly out of the Stephen Spielberg school of film-making.

Little too over the top!,"The movie was a bit too over the top for me.**Spoilers below**Was Clive Owens character invisible to others except when he wanted to be seen?? He seemed to be able to sneak around without ever being seen by the ""terrorists"". He could open car doors and slam them at will with nobody hearing? He could run threw the streets without getting shot while everybody else around was getting hit.And Michael Caine's house...what's up with that? The government has taken over but his big house just off the road is never found. His driveway is covered by some tree branches and that does it?The ""mother"" can run around town pregnant and nobody notices even though there hasn't been a pregnant women in 18 years? They can even talk about the pregnancy and the baby while on the bus and people 3 feet away never turn to look in awe?And is Clive Owen Superman? He can push a car in the mud with two guys 100 feet away and they don't hear him? Also when he stops at the top of the hill and watches Jasper get shot. He then yells at the woman, ""don't touch me, don't ever touch me"" and then gets in the car, slams the door and starts the engine and drives off. But none of the ""terrorists"" could hear ANY of that even though they were only a few hundred feet away and all by themselves in a quiet forest area? Loved how he pushed the car uphill in the mud at the end of the driveway too and got it up to 10 mph in like 2 seconds with the ""terrorists"" running after him.Then lastly, there is the gypsy woman near the end.

Just ranks with any shooter action game,"How utterly bizarre to see a movie like this getting so much credits. I tried to understand it from the reviewers point of view here on this site and found nothing comprehensible.Realistic plot. Where? If it's likely that women will stop giving birth all of a sudden, then we can toss aside everything we know about biological science. 'The convincing future world' which results from the premise as being a totally chaotic world, almost reads as wishful thinking on the part of the reviewer. 18 years go by with no women getting pregnant and without any known cause, one suddenly gets pregnant? And this obvious fluke is supposed to be interesting enough to carry a whole movie and provide a feeling of hope in such a desperate world? And besides, surely any type of future world with this kind of scenario going on, has got some more interesting to tell than what is shown in this movie. And surely Great Britain wouldn't be the only country to be able to sustain that premise. Rubbish, fairytalestuff, unmitigated Hollywood bull-crap.Excellent acting. Where? Owen certainly didn't impress, hes just doing his zombie-thing once again. The support cast and especially Ashity (Kee) made me laugh and being annoyed at the same time throughout the entire film. This movie certainly did not impress acting-wise, surely for everyone to see. Caine's cameo was the odd one out and made me feel like watching a completely different movie every time he's making an appearance.Good story/complex story. Excuse me? It's just a plodding chase-story with zero depth, nothing realistic and about as complex as the basis of your average video game. One doesn't bring a child to a war-zone just because some drugged out old fart suggests that, especially when it's presumably the only one alive in the world. What made the story 'complex' was that nothing was explained about any of it (writers cramp?). Yet, this is considered one of the film's best traits!Great cinematography. The natural look of the film, the documentary style if u will, was ultimately not what made the feel of this movie a positive or convincing one. It made me feel distracted from the events that were displayed and made me be aware of camera's and actors. They should have used that in portions of the film, but not in the whole of it. All the chase sequences seemed overpractised and what was up with the 'run after the car and get smashed by the door'-gimmick?Comment on the world we live in today. Well, this movie didn't point out anything that can't be seen in any Newsprogram or documentary on the subject. Most of the theme's we saw, like the Islam-protest, seemed hopelessly and needlessly dragged in.Dramatic ending. Yeah sure, if you consider vapid and cliché open endings which didn't give the film some sort of closure it desperately needed a dramatic ending, then by all means people...The movie seems to want us to see a possible world future, and that's all fine.

I don't expect this to be our immediate future, though like with Covid, who knows, but it is in many ways a film way ahead of its time. Women can no longer conceive with the last birth being 18 years prior to the start of this film. However, a young black woman becomes pregnant and since she is now the future of mankind's existence, she is of upmost importance, to put it mildly. The world doesn't know about her and she is being hidden and protected by a rebel group led by Julianne Moore who recruits her ex-husband, Clive Owen to help transport this girl to safety which he does until all is up to him. Owen is on screen nearly every moment and he is our worn out hero and he plays it perfectly. Moore's role is smaller, but she is as good as she always is being among the premier actors of her time.

A technically proficient post-apocalyptic dystopia,"NOTE: Rather than pointing out things already described in triplicate by other movie reviews, I opted to mention elements of the film that were not exhaustively discussed, yet made the movie better. Also, my review would not make much sense without giving context to the back story. As such, I will try my best not to reveal any actual plot or spoilers. This section will be enclosed within -----'sAlfonso Cuarón's Children of Men ties elements of sci-fi, war, and human drama very cohesively. To that end, the film evokes the same moods as films like 1984, Schindler's List, and Saving Private Ryan while still feeling totally refreshing.----- Based (very) loosely upon a 1992 novel by P.D. James, Children of Men takes place in 2027 in a world torn apart by global terrorism and pollution. Most of the major cities around the world have been ravaged for some reason or another (mostly nuclear), causing ""foogies"" to flee to Great Britain. Britain is one of the only countries that hasn't collapsed under the strain of the world and maintains its position by maintaining a very hostile disposition towards outsiders. Worsening the matters is an unexplainable infertility pandemic that has crippled the human race for 18 years. -----One of the first things I noticed about the movie is, despite being 20 years later, the movie had a very present feel to it. Unlike other films that take place in the near future, this movie feels that time has progressed in a very deliberate pace. The streets of London feel like they would now, save for a few subtle technological advances. Technology advancement has always been a prominent element in conveying the theme and I thank Cuarón for not beating a dead horse. Several of today's topics in the world today are also integrated into the film. Terrorism (there's more than one type), the Iraq War, environmental degradation are all prevalent and their effects on the world in the future. In the end, the film has a certain plausibility to it versus the more abstract and detached settings in most Science Fiction film.Another element that stuck out in my mind is the use of non-verbal exposition incorporated into the film. Much of the back story and overall mood is filled in by showing news clippings, TV news reports, capture and internment of refugees along the London streets, etc. While most films of this scope require direct explanation, Children of Men does an excellent job at wiring these things directly into the movie.Cuarón also filmed extended takes for the movie. There are two very prominent scenes in the movie, one taking place inside a car and another on foot amidst a large battle, that were executed beautifully. The car scene employed a camera system inside the car that could swivel around and even traverse through the front windshield. This scene was also filmed in one uncut shot. The other employed a hand cam system that followed Clive Owen's character through city streets, through an apartment building, and back out using only 5-6 cuts. Did I neglect to mention that both of them were choreographically rich and employed approximately 20 and 50 actors respectively? Scenes of this magnitude are never technically sound without the use of major cutting, so I again congratulate Cuarón for his virtuosity.While most of my praises were for the technical aspects of the film, the movie, as a whole, was excellent. The plot was very conventional, but enriched by the diverse cast of characters. Michael Caine as a strawberry pot smoking neo-hippie will always stand out in my mind. Peter Mullan as Syd brings a cheeky sense of humor as a corrupt internment camp officer. Clive Owen did a good job mixing dramatic and thriller/action acting, which he can probably chalk up to his roles in Closer, Sin City and even possibly BMW Films' The Hire (although I'm probably reaching out here).In the end, I was very satisfied with the movie. It felt similar while still being completely new. To that end, I'm really interested in what Cuarón has to offer next.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Stop the madness..,"It is hard to believe that the movie we saw tonight is the same as the one praised here on this website. Where is the intrigue? Where is the view of a world that is tormented with the knowledge of being barren? Where are the deep insights into a 'very possible future'? All I saw was a simple chase movie that was obviously done differently compared to what we are usually dished by the likes of Hollywood but also one that not for second convinced me. Worse yet, I can't remember the last time I saw a movie this fake and contrived.Apart from the fact that no reasonable explanation is given for the whole ordeal of getting the child through the violence to a ghostlike organization other than that it provided some sort of subterfuge for shooting the battle-scenes, no credible reasons are ever given for Anything that happened on the screen. The same goes for the motivations of most of the characters in the movie.Sure, most mainstream productions hit us over the head with exposition making such productions not very challenging to watch, but to simply reverse it and unaffectedly explain nothing is just the opposite side of the coin and equally insipid even if it was shot from a first person perspective. The fact that the audience has to dig with shovels to find a plausible story somewhere is what makes this a masterpiece? By God, I think not.I think I speak for the four of us who saw this movie tonight that we were all totally underwhelmed considering the acclaim and current ranking of Children of Men. The acting felt labored, especially by Caine whom we adore, the script embarrassingly poor in places, nothing really profound or philosophical to sink your teeth in and the ending, if one could call it that, was unimaginative and completely devoid of any intelligence to it.

"Alfonso creates a stand out, brilliant film once again!","Stunning, artsy, moving, well done, and disturbing are the words that come to mind when I think back on this film. Director Alfonso Cuaron - ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban""- has created a dark, dreary, and bleak vision of the future, that brings to mind Ridley Scott's classic sci-fi, ""Blade Runner"". It is 2027, and women have become infertile, there are wars everywhere, and immigrants are rounded up and killed. The future looks bad until Theo (Clive Owen) agrees to help the last pregnant women get to a sanctuary named The Human Project. With the baby, the scientists might be able to save the future of mankind.I'll start my praise with the actors: Clive Owen is absolutely phenomenal. He definitely deserves an Best Actor nomination, if not win it. He draws you into his character, Theo is the hero, but at the same time, a regular joe. Newcomer Claire-Hope Ashitey as Kee, the last pregnant women, is amazing as well. I can already tell her future in film will be very bright indeed. Michael Caine as hippie/mentor Jasper is great as always. He is the kind of actor that the audience will never tire of, and will always welcome his warm, grandfatherly face. The cinematography is another huge factor. The tone, lighting, and coloring of the film is marvelously done. The grainy and dark look makes an already intense film all that more intense. You feel as if you are right there with Kee and Theo as they try and survive, because of that, I believe a Best Cinematography award is already in the bag.As good as it it though, this movie is not for everyone. It is very violent, and depressing in its' portrayal of the future. The government goes through cities blowing everything, and anything away for no apparent reason at all. It is quite disturbing, because many of the themes portrayed in ""Children of Men"" are not far off from real life. One thing that bothered me was that many things were not explained, like why women where infertile, or why the government had turned on everyone. I'm assuming, in the case of an artsy film like this, that the director wants to leave it up to the viewer to decide some things for himself. One thing that really stood out in this film is that it shows what the world would be like without children, and it wouldn't be good.""Children of Men"" is an amazing achievement in film-making, that is thought-provoking, and even has pro-life themes. If I had made my top ten movie list after seeing this, ""Children of Men"" would most defiantly be in the top five. Superb on every level. I give it 10 out of 10. Rated R for strong violence, language, some drug use, and brief nudity.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Hits You Deep Down,"After watching CHILDREN OF MEN, a very strange thing happened to me in the twenty-four hours since seeing it: I'm actually growing to appreciate the film more and more every minute. That's a distinct strength of this film over others that are trying to crowd it out for your almighty box-office buck. There's no instant gratification, no sex/nudity just for their own sake, no violence for the sake of violence (although there's plenty in here, it's just threaded into the story exceptionally well).Based on P.D. James' novel by the same name, Children of Men focuses on the death of birth in the year 2027. That is, the sudden and unexplained infertility of all women (and possibly men). Birth rates rapidly hit the zero mark, playgrounds fall into ruin, and mankind decides that war is the only answer. This is an interesting paradox as the premise is on the fact that men will fight over anything, including the death of life. Some sort of inherent gene is sparked in mankind whenever a perceived loss is fixated upon (democracy, oil, land, etc.), and when children disappear from that equation, it's time to pull out the gun. This isn't stated specifically in the film, per se, except for once when Theo (Clive Owen, the main character) and Miriam (Pam Ferris, a nurse) are looking out at a defunct swing-set and Miriam comments on how much the world misses the sound of children. ""We never knew how much we'd miss that sound,"" she says. And so the loss is given mention just this once, but is ""felt"" throughout the movie.But all is not gloom and doom. Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey) is the only pregnant woman on the planet and is hidden away by an underground network of freedom fighters who's main goal is to try and gain rights for illegal aliens in Great Britain (many nations have closed their borders in order to prevent the spread of any possible infection that might be causing the infertility). Julian (Julianne Moore) is the leader of these fighters and approaches Theo in order to obtain traveling papers for Kee (Theo having family that can access to such things). Initially Theo refuses, but money enters into it as does Theo's own curiosity toward Julian (they were once married and had a child who'd died during a flu pandemic). Initially Theo is unaware of Kee's pregnancy, too, and once he learns of it you can see on his face the sense of importance that this new life might bring to mankind. Theo plods on through war-torn streets, pulling Kee along with him in an attempt to make it to ""The Human Project."" This project is never fully explained but enough clues are dropped to infer that this is the one place where babies might be born. Kee and Theo must make it to a ship off the coast of Britain in order to secures Kee's safe passage. But death lurks around every corner for Theo, Kee, and her baby. Everyone who comes into contact with this trio eventually dies off, denoting the need for death in order for new life to spring forth. From Michael Cain's pot-smoking persona as Theo's oldest friend, to Julianne Moore's forced martyrdom, no one seems able to escape the clutches of death that surround Kee and this unborn child. Maybe even Theo, our main character.The biggest strength of the film is the screenplay. It seems to have been very well thought out, letting the audience run through the film with the characters rather than forcibly monologuing information to us. The acting is good and the stark city streets are achingly morbid in appearance (shot using lots of gray color), giving the viewer the ability to see and feel humanity's decline.As stated earlier, this isn't your instant gratification-style flick that'll have you applauding at the end. It hits the watcher deep down on a visceral and subconscious level, an appreciative ember that'll grow the further away one gets from the theater.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A warning, not a prayer. And a frightfully grand piece of art","I thought this movie was fantastic. I got the Jesus stuff way late and as I'm typing I'm connecting that to the animal piece as a sort of manger symbol this movie is crazy I see you Cuarón. Children of Men is one of the best I've seen, definitely in terms of being palpably directed like I regressed to my eight year old self and literally caught myself biting my nails during the more anxiety inducing scenes.I think the allegory about immigration was really strong, definitely could have fallen flat in the wrong hands but the world building was fully believable frankly because it's only a few shades off from our current geopolitical truth. So many times I was blown away by how high the stakes felt, and Cuarón definitely delivered with a violent and deservedly ambiguous yet nevertheless satisfying ending. Which also reminds me of how funny this movie could be at times, I thought this was gonna be bleak and hopeless but the scene with the rich collector cousin and Michael Caine's entire character were as funny as they were depressing.I really think the movie was paced to perfection with its shirt runtime it really doesn't use it all to gimmick the audience into feeling any unearned momentum because it's rushed, things just happen and I think Julianne Moore and Theo do a great job.Lots to unpack here. Particularly in how predictive it is (or maybe is a mirror of? This is 2006 we're talking about) how specifically Britain and the rest of Europe are nationalist to their bones honestly in ways more manifest than the U. S., the careless disregard for outsiders and all through the funnel of the cool sci-fi concept of what if there was no kids. Cuarón is familiar with this world and so I felt like this was in good hands and honestly is an even more important movie nowadays to blare the alarm for the pandemics and refugee crisae that are now ubiquitous. A seminal work I think people should use as an example of how to mix drama with mic drop real world commentary also without being too preahy but rather letting the narrative speak for itself. There are real humanitarian crises happening now I'm angry for this world and for our future and for our art and for our history and for our present. But yea I love it though.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
its a new world with one new life,"i had high expectations of this film before watching it and i have also heard from some friends details about the plot.eventually this turned out to be a disadvantage just as it mostly does.i believe its the best to watch a film without knowing anything about it besides knowing if it is considered to be goo or bad.i liked Children Of Men, it will be very hard for you not to like it after witnessing the outstanding cinematography it contains in it.there are also two very good acting performances i would like to point out.first Michael Caine, after loving his performance in 'The Prestige' it was hard for me to believe my eyes when seeing him giving out a much better one in Children Of Men as Jasper, the old Hippy.Clive Owen's performance is the second performance i would like to point out.there is no doubt about how much talent and how much quality Clive Owen has as an actor.in the past few years he stared and co-stared in outstanding films as 'Sin City', 'Closer' and 'Inside Man'.his performance in Children Of Men is different, i would say better but I'm still not sure about it.all around this film is better then most others, offering a refreshing story about what will this world were living in look like in two decades from now.one more thing i can say about it is that it has no plot holes and has a pretty good ending in my opinion.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Superb - You MUST See this.,"I'll keep this short and spoiler free. I cannot find a thing wrong with this film - it is an absolutely stunning piece of work. The attention to detail in realising a near future world - the richness of it rendered without a single line of obvious exposition. Brilliant performances from all concerned. The long takes and the stunning set pieces are just beautiful - echoes of Brazil crossed with Channel 4 news. It makes it's political and social points cleanly and succinctly. The best British film since 28 Days Later - and it took a Mexican director to do it - I liked his take on Harry Potter, but this portends so much more, I will be keeping a close eye on any future films directed by Cuaron. Simply brilliant.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Disappointing,"Warning: May contain traces of a spoilerFirst of all, I am very much into movies where the future goes wrong in some way, but I think the 8 points are way overrated. I mean hello, reality check, this means that this movies is as good as 12 Monkeys (which it isn't). The story is flat, not convincing and leaves me wondering in how far humankind might be saved just because one woman manages to get pregnant. Also I did not like the obvious comparison to the Jesus story (one guy is the Savior, couple on the run etc.). Also kind of a shame to make a movie that plays at around 2030 and then go ahead and take cars like the Renault Avantime (or Fiat Multipla?) and put some cardboard around it to fake a ""futuristic"" car. Come on.Tip: Watch 12 Monkeys, Equilibrium or GATTACA instead if you haven't seen those.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A glint of hope in the dark abyss of the future.,"This film has created much controversy and is in the camp of you either hate it with a passion or love it to bits.Off the bat, I'm in the latter camp. This is a movie for grownups, no standard plot two by fours are issued at the door, no endless explications of the obvious.I've also read the book and would agree with Alfonso Cuarón in his decision to remove a lot of the Christian hype of the book but would disagree with his decision to make this development the infertility of women and not the zero-sperm production of the men of the future. (PD James based the novel in part on this startling new development in the male population in some countries of Europe).This is the bleak and hopeless world in England of 2027. The visuals are stunning and the mind is kept busy trying to process all the signs of a world gone mad with police and their guns and dogs on every corner. The tension is relentless down to the last bleak frame. Old signage and photographs point to the lead up to these forbidding times and omnipresent ads in buses and streets encourages one to to turn in neighbours to internment camps (""homeland security"" reverberates a lot throughout) and also offers pills readily accessible to terminate one's own life if one wishes.The themes are many and as I'd pondered the book, I'll also be reflecting on this movie. For instance in a world where life is becoming extinct, life is not valued at all, cages of humans dominate every railroad station, identity cards are demanded at every turn. In one brief moment in the film (and it is the culmination of a long continuous shot which must go right up there as one of the best movie moments of all time)the warring stops for a fraction of time to honour the miracle of a child being born and then everyone continues the killing rampage, the baby forgotten.I loved the insertion of humour into the darkest of circumstances, the alcohol and pot ingested to lighten the load, the caring and sacrifice in the most vicious of times.Outstanding performances by a stellar cast, Clive Owen, Julianne Moore, Michael Caine,Pam Ferris and Claire-Hope Ashitey, who must have worked so hard to convey the realism of a world gone mad. Cinematography superb, down to the tiniest of details and the above mentioned 'long shot'.10 out of 10. Not to everyone's taste obviously, there is no middle ground on this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Visionary! A remarkable technical achievement.,"This brilliant and understated sci-fi thriller, is a truly revolutionary movie. As a technical achievement this ranks as one of cinema's, important achievements. Technically yes, it's superb, but equally the film has meaning too, and challenges. The dystopic future sub-genre is one that often can be overdone, overblown and overwrought, but not so here. Under the guidance of most other directors doing this sort of film nowadays, this would have been laden with CGI, and without the meaning underneath the visual sheen. Here director Alfonso Cuaron puts the audience in a world that's believable and within possibility. This is not a future staring at oblivion to come in a flash, it's a future that has long been slowly crawling to the end of humanity.The human race has been slowly dying out for 18 years, since women have become infertile. Clive Owen plays a man watching in quiet, dismal contemplation at the hopelessness around him, until he's contacted by his ex-wife, played by Julianne Moore. She's part of a group called the human project, part rebel, part terrorist, who oppose the fascist government that is running, and ruining what's left of Britain. Refugees, immigrants are illegal, no longer welcome, and the rest of the world isn't in much better shape. Julian (Moore) wants Theo (Owen) to transport a girl down south, from London. The importance of this girl becomes paramount when it's revealed she's pregnant. The first pregnancy in 18 years. Different factions would no doubt want to use this to their own ends, and Owen takes it upon himself to take her to hope, or to the human fund. Of course there are many obstacles in the way. The premise is dark, and similarly frightening. Amongst it all, Cuaron ensures the dialogue, the actors feel natural.The film is of a genre done before, yet feels fresh, from the scripting, to the look of the film. Indeed Cuaron's earthy, un-showy look, using a dreary, almost dead colour palette and a lot of handled work, evoke a sense of reality. As does his tendency for lots of extended single shot takes. It would be interesting to count the amount of cuts in this film, but it would be a hell of a lot lower than the average Hollywood movie. Indeed this is a daring, and engrossing move from Cuaron. The extended takes, keep the audience right in the action, engaging, pulling you in. None more so than during the exhilarating action scenes with some of the most technically astounding sequences, all in one long take, one shot, and you can't help but be amazed. It's not some overly showy, hollow and cold CGI exhibition, it's down to meticulous planning, timing and execution. We've seen things such as Superman, Star Wars in the last couple of years thanks to the glory of CGI, but the action scenes in this are far more exciting and far superior in concept and execution. The simple fact that the actors are put in a situation whereby they must be in perfect sync with the stunt guys, the cameraman, and remember their cues, their positions etc, it's a miraculous technical and artistic achievement. The first action scene, as well as the finale (which is an insanely long single shot) are awe inspiring.The cast too are brilliant. Clive Owen continues to fly the flag for Britain, and make a good name for himself. Julianne Moore, Michael Caine, Chiwetal Ejiofor, and Pam Ferris are all superb in support, while the young Claire-Hope Ashitay is also impressive as Kee. All under the expert and visionary direction of Alfonso Cuaron, who surely is one of the next big names, and perhaps in the new wave of excellence in genre films, once taken up by the likes of Spielberg, Cameron, Scott. Children Of Men is surely a landmark in cinema, and will certainly gain in reputation as the years go by. This will be a revisionist film. *****",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One of the best directed films of all time.,"I'm an American traveling through Europe, and I saw this film in the U.K. I'd been looking forward to it ever since the trailer blew me away, and, I'm happy to say, it was even better than I expected. Cuaron directed the hell out of this film! The script is pretty decent (interesting but reasonably standard sci-fi), but Cuaron elevates it so much higher. It brings you to such emotional highs and lows, all while looking completely believable. I don't want to give anything away, but this movie affected me deeply; I felt honestly shaken after leaving the theater. Technically, the film will floor you. It contains some of the most impressive set pieces in movie history, some of them shown as a continuous shot, with no cuts. You'll never forget the experience.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One Man's Story,"A very realistic vision of the future, that is not as disconnected from the present as many other films portray the future to be. It paints a bleak picture, while maintaining connections to the current conditions of humanity and political climate.The plight of the refugees in this movie can easily be viewed as a mirror image of the plight of many refugees in the world today.Although it is a story about humanity the movie itself is a story of one man's journey (Clive Owen) to come to terms with his past, the bleak present that he is living in and to re-ignite his hope for the future that he once had in his younger days.The film moved a bit faster at times then preferred which is why I didn't give it a 10, however the acting and cinematography was brilliant and the story was compelling.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A beautifully crafted story about despair and hope,"This is a film for the ages. It is a very unpleasant film, very bleak. But once it draws you in, it leaves a lasting mark. You can't help but think about it and its message...I have now seen it twice. And while it gets more interesting with each viewing, it also gets more bleak, and you start to think about the chaotic world portrayed in the movie in such great detail. Cuaron's world of the near future may be dystopian but certain aspects of it ring true with where we, in our own real world, may be headed towards. So I guess this is a very political film too. People will either agree with it or completely disagree with it. There is no middle path.As a filmmaker and a student of film, this is a film which stands out for me in 2006. It is a fantastic example of thoughtful film-making. There are some problems with continuity and whatnot, but overall this is one that demands repeated viewing. I loved Michael Caine in this film. This guy is getting better with age :). Clive Owen should get a nod for an Oscar for this, but considering how political this film is, it may not happen. The Academy is just a bunch of old, cowardly sissies in any case, so who gives a hoot whether it is nominated or not for an Oscar.All in all, an enthusiastic 8 out of 10 for this really good piece of film-making by Alfonso Cuaron! 2nd best film of the year, after Severance :) .",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Lot's of death with a sprinkling of comic relief,"To say the film paints a dark portrait of the future is an understatement. Suicide kits and anti-depressants are handed out like candy in a world where people can't even take care of themselves, but crave children and pregnancy.Life is disposable, but the potential for life is revered.Children of Men is more like a war or chase flick than a sci-fi story. The only similarity I see to Blade Runner is that it takes place in the future. Comparing Blade Runner to Children of Men is like comparing filet mignon to chicken mcnuggets.If you like action movies, you'll probably love this. It's not a character driven film. There's a lot of bombing, explosions and violence, with a few comedic scenes with Michael Caine to break up the tension. There's also some over-the-top angelic music whenever there's a sign of hope.So if you like seeing very sad films about a future being overtaken by disease, despair, death and destruction, go see Children of Men. It's perfect for the pessimist.I have to agree with the other reviewers who said that it's more like sci-fi fast food with editing like The Prisoner. It felt like I was watching war footage from Iraq spliced into a rescue story.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
well- a very haunting piece of work,"well,I did like the film, especially the role of Michael Caine(I just like the guy)-good acting almost throughout actually,good camera-work too and great sites really. It is a very interesting piece of film,really,challenging- there's just one thing missing :The correlation of the whole story.If you've read the book may be then you might have the overview and see the connections. But if you didn't -you're pretty much thrown into the scenery not really getting the idea of a bigger interrelation .But may be you just go home and imagine it by yourself-somehow one just has to,it's such an arousing round dance of little sceneries that demand it, they're much to lovable to just let them stand alone,unlinked. The only thing one really knows for sure is that it is about that girl that has to be brought away(why?) and later it's her baby. But why all the rest is taking place is just not cutted out properly enough and there's a whole lot more going on here.- After all the film is much to haunting not to be enthralled by it.But still it remains -I am upset they didn't work the overall correlation a little more out- that's the only aggravation.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Futuristic Thriller; a couple of Loose Ends,"This was a startlingly possible look at the not-too-distant future, in an apocalyptic, violent world. The British setting was not bothersome to me, although I know the British accent seems to be a problem for some. The overall miasma of gloom, misery, and defeatedness was difficult to tolerate, but necessary for the buildup of the story.I enjoyed the movie and it's many messages. I was disappointed by what I felt were two or three crucial points that were never made clear in the end. I know that if you have seen the movie, you know what I mean. I don't want to blow the experience for others; maybe the deliberate ""leave you guessing"" feeling was the whole point.

A film that blew me away,"It has been a long that a film like this has so pleasantly surprised me. Anyway, the plot is quite straightforward: It is the year 2027 and the world is in deep trouble. For around 18 years or so, no woman has given birth to a baby and nobody knows what is the cause of this infertility. The story takes place in a semi-totalitarian Britain where Clive Owen plays a reluctant hero who by his ex-wife (Julianne Moore), the leader of a resistance group known as The Fishes, is caught up in the events surrounding the rescue of a young immigrant woman who happens to be pregnant. I mentioned immigrant woman for in the British society in this film, all illegal immigrants are being hunted down and put into camps. Michael Cain also has a somewhat small role as a hippie who is a friend of Owen's character.I have nothing more to say than wow when talking about this film. The concept is great and it is well executed. Cain, Owen, Moore and the few other main characters all put on top notch performances. They are believable and Cain I fond to be a big delight. Although the film takes place about 20 years in the future, everything doesn't seem all that futuristic. That however doesn't bother at all since the production designer went for a more rugged and broken down look which works excellently and adds to the mood of the film.The direction, done by Alfonso Cuaron, is what I found to be the strongest aspect of this film. Together with cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki they go for a very shock and awe approach. Everything feels fresh and shocking, a trait that is amplified even further when viewing this in a movie theater. You never know when somebody might get shot and when that person does, it happens then and there, blowing you away. The cinematography is beautiful. It is mostly long hand-held shots but fortunately those are quite stable hand-held shots. Never is there a sense of confusion that sometimes happens with other films where you can't tell what is going on. I especially adored the scenes of a battle between the resistance group and the army in the middle of which Owen is trying to escort the pregnant woman to safety. That was quite possibly one of the best battle scenes I've ever seen. The soundtrack relies a lot on characters in the film listening to music and not so much on music accompanying the action.All I have to say is that I recommend this at all costs. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Political Hideaway,"2006 has been a good year for politically minded films: we've seen George Clooney's Good Night, and Good Luck.; the not-as-anarchist-as-the-comic-but-still-pretty-good V For Vendetta; and the emotionally charged United 93. This month, Alfonso Cuarón's Children of Men joins these thought-provoking films, and quite rightly, too.The year is 2027 and, one generation from now, the entire female population of the planet is infertile. The youngest person in the world has just died at 18, and most of the world has been ravaged by war, turning Britain into a Daily Mail reader's paradise; the government as made outlawed immigrants, and broadcasts its neo-fascist propaganda over digital billboards in streets and buses. In the middle of all this is Theo Faron (Clive Owen), an ex-activist, now an alcoholic working in an office. After narrowly escaping a terrorist attack in a café, Theo is kidnapped by a group of ""Fishes"" (freedom fighters), headed by his activist ex Julian (Julianne Moore), and thrust into the centre of a plot to get the first pregnant woman in 18 years to the mythical Human Project.If Children of Men has one flaw, it is that it won't draw in the action crowd that made V for Vendetta a moderate success. If, however, you're looking for a politically and emotionally charged story, depicting a scarily realistic vision of what the future could be, Children of Men is highly recommended. Following in the footsteps of Fernando Meirelles and his fantastic The Constant Gardener, Alfonso Cuarón has blended a riveting story with a strong political message. Anyone who feels a knot of fear in their stomach whenever they see a Daily Mail headline will be moved by the images of immigrants locked in cages. And almost paradoxically, the climax expertly puts across the film's theme of humanity over any political agenda.Technically, the film will not disappoint students of film. In an expository scene in an abandoned school, Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey), our pregnant protagonist, is almost too-perfectly framed in a shattered window. The technical highlights, though, are the film's two main action sequences. One in a car and the other in a building under attack, both are filmed in single takes, and have a documentary feel. We, the audience, are taken right into these scenes, which make their emotional climaxes (especially in the latter) even more real and moving.If you're looking for a political hideaway from the past summer's lacklustre blockbusters, you definitely cannot go wrong with Children of Men. Cuarón has infused his work with a realism and emotional quality rare in films of this type, and fantastic performances from the main cast, as well as smaller characters such as Michael Caine's pot-smoking hippie Jasper make it a more than enjoyable experience. Hollywood needs more films like this.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""Children of Men"" is an allegory we can only hope and pray never manifests in our lifetime.","""Children of Men"" is, in many ways, an allegory, one we can only hope and pray never manifests in our lifetime.When the film begins, everyone in Britain is mourning. Not because another beloved princess has met a senseless end, but because baby Diego, the world's youngest person at slightly over eighteen-years-old, has just died.The year is 2027 and age (or youth) is so important that it is measured down to the minute. This reverence for life, or certain people's lives, is significant because it underscores humanity's doom due to the infertility of women.Ironically, in the dystopian society that Britain has become, not every life is of equal value. The country has closed its borders. Its military forces round up Fuji's (a cheeky name for illegal immigrants), who are ""hunted down like cockroaches"" and carted off to prisons (actually ghettoes) that would make Abu Graib look like a vacation destination.But immigrants aren't the only ones who have to live in fear. The ubiquitous electronic media encourage all citizens to ""report any suspicious activity"" they might encounter, whatever that might mean. Under these circumstances, death by cop just may be a better alternative.One man who apparently tries to avoid that end is Theo Faron (Clive Owen), a dissipated, whiskey guzzling former outspoken liberal who struggles to survive by leading an ordinary life. Or at least as ordinary as he can in such an oppressive society.Unfortunately for Faron, he is recruited by Julian (Julianne Moore), his former lover, now the leader of an all-purpose radical faction that will stop at nothing to unmask government corruption. Julian's quest is to obtain papers for Kee (newcomer Claire-Hope Ashitey) so that the young woman may be safely delivered into the hands of The Human Project, an underground organization whose mission is to preserve humanity. Why this is necessary is no mystery, except perhaps to Faron, but it is such an important plot point that it would be unfair to reveal it.Whether for love or money, or perhaps to feel that old rush of adrenaline he used to get when he and Julian were young and innocent, Faron agrees. He turns to the reclusive Nigel (Danny Huston), an old friend who is holed-up among some of history's great works of art, such as Michelangelo's ""David,"" and Picasso's ""Guernica."" You have to give Nigel credit. Despite his head-in-the-sand mentality, he is committed to ending his days surrounded by things of beauty.This elaborate set up is the launching point for the rest of the plot, which carefully weaves back story into the narrative. Director Alfonso Cuarón (""Y Tú Mamá También,"" ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban""), who co-wrote the screenplay with Timothy Sexton (HBO's ""Live from Baghdad"") based on the P.D. James novel, does not overlook any opportunity to present a visual connection between today's world and the one depicted in the film. Citizen's pay homage to baby Diego in public floral displays (not unlike those in honor of Princess Diana, as seen in Stephen Frears' ""The Queen""), Muslim fundamentalists march down streets bearing arms and banners, and sluices emit sludgy liquid into rivers. All of this is taken to extremes in the film. It is a world in which everything, if not everyone, has gone mad.Missing from the script, however, is any sense of what is going on beyond this limited universe. ""The world has collapsed. Only Britain soldiers on,"" one newscaster reports, but we are never told how or why this calamity came about. Why humans cannot reproduce is never overtly stated, but it isn't unreasonable to believe that environmental pollutants and the ""flu pandemic of 2008"" are, at least in part, responsible for humanity's demise. Why, though, are other animals exempt (in one scene a kitten claws Faron's pants leg), and where are all the scientists when you need them?This apocalyptic vision of a bleak and not-too-distant future is nothing new in film or literature (""1984,"" ""Brave New World,"" and ""Blade Runner"" come to mind). But Cuarón presents his vision in such a mirthless landscape that it makes us hope we won't be alive to see if it manifests twenty years from now.Cinematography, by Emmanuel Lubezki (who provided a very different look to last year's ""The New World""), is astonishingly real, a verité style that exudes a raw, cold grittiness apropos the material. Editing (by Cuarón and Alex Rodríguez) invokes immediacy, particularly in the battle scenes of the film's climax.Performances all around are strong, with Michael Caine doing a turn as a former liberal political cartoonist turned hippie counterculturist, replete with long hair and an ample drug stash, and Chiwetel Ejiofor (""Dirty Pretty Things"") playing against his usual good guy image. But the film is carried by Owen, who proves once again that he is this generation's Richard Burton, and by Ashitey, whose lines of comic relief are delivered with the proper earnest tenor.""Children of Men"" is an effective cautionary tale, a reminder that what we do today has a direct impact on the future. As one person says, ""It's very odd what happens in the world without children's voices."" Let's hope we don't ever have to live in such joylessness.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Hands Down Best Film of the Year So Far,"""Children of Men"" opened here in Britain today, and I've just got back from seeing it this afternoon. It's easily best film I've seen at the cinema so far this year, and probably one of the best sf movies for a hell of a long time (maybe one of the best ever). Obviously I loved it - here's why: the depiction of Britain in the future is absolutely spot on - there are so many little references (Bexhill as a refugee camp is a terrific injoke for anyone who's ever been there - I live down the road) and locations shown to the point of decay that look and feel just right (it's now, just more so). The detail in the film is meticulous to the extreme, locations that I've walked around have been revamped and everything is completely realistic. There is no fake looking CGI in this film - it's like walking around the real world, and sucks you in completely. The camera-work is truly extraordinary - incredibly long hand held shots that follow Clive Owen through increasingly large and scarily real battle scenes (particularly a scene in a car getting ambushed and another run through a full scale battle zone are jawdroppingly good - outdoing anything in Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds"" or ""Saving Private Ryan"" - the only two films where I' ve seen anything that comes close to this). Alfonso Cuaron's best film so far. It's got the heavyweight message and performances of a great drama with the tension, excitement and spectacle of a big time action movie. Clive Owen is perfectly cast - it really is his film - everyone else (as good as they are) are just there for support. I've often found him a little wooden before - but his cynical, grizzled character here is one he was born to play. It's really knocked me for six, and I honestly can't recommend this enough - it's got the truth and integrity of an indie film with the sheer verve and emotion of great Hollywood cinema. A future classic.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
children of men,"Children of men is a film that is very relatable to present days and ours situation with immigrants you can basiacly say that this film was ahead of his time and that is biggest praise and plus side of a film,clive owen is for me one of most underrated actors and he showed his talent and skills in this movie again,thematic of film is sometimes hard to watch cause we can easily relate to it and who know maybe this will be real future one day but in more realistic way,but film also little suffers becase of not so good building up of their world,i wish that they explained more how world ended up in that situation or how it effected other people and other families and not just on leads,children of men is a good sci fi thriller that is a good watch with some flaws",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF APOCALYPTIC SCI-FI,"Children of Men is a grim & gritty sci-fi Thriller but it's also so much more with it's many messages & in the face look at a not to distant future & one that feels scarily familiar already!!!There's lots under the surface of this Apocalyptic sci-fi Thriller & probably tons of hidden messages about where we're heading but i enjoyed as an exciting & gripping Sci-fi Thriller that is drenched in a real grim & gritty sludge but mainly as a great piece of entertainment & sci-fi filmmaking.
This ain't no Neon-drenched BladeRunner, this is a dirty & raw scruffy future flick that has a sense of realism in it's cinematography & overall look of the future here in England.
This could easily be real, could easily happen & feels real.
The movie is relevant & shocking but also exciting too. Clive Owen gives a great intense performance as an ordinary guy protecting a pregnant lady at a time when there hasn't been a baby born in years, the world is in a panicked & depressed state with no hope. No one gets pregnant anymore & no children anywhere, there's a big mystery to all this & a real sense of loss & sadness, loneliness & desperation is the atmosphere in this Thrilling piece of science fiction.Clive Owen as Theo must get the ONLY pregnant women to a safe place amongst a devastated England that has collapsed & fallen. There's danger everywhere in the year 2027 & it's a dystopian nightmare & feels like no where is safe.
The cast is excellent with the legendary Michael Caine & Julianne Moore is excellent roles.
This is probably the best movie Clive Owen has made? It's definitely one of the greatest sci-fi movies ever made.An intense & gritty survival Thriller set in a scary world",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The details are so spectacular that they are actually hard to miss.,"It's a difficult thing, defining a masterpiece, especially when the term is thrown about all too casually. And I wouldn't want to call this film 'important' either, because I don't believe it is a word that should ever be used when defining ANY work of art. A film (or anything at all for that matter) is only as important as you're willing to make it. I sometimes wish people wouldn't be so shallow as to pour so much of their time and energy considering such superficial things as a series of moving images projected onto a large white screen, no matter its contents. Yet here I am, like many of you, spending both my time and energy typing away about this film (even if I do so implicitly). And so, I find that I am left with two possibilities; either that I am another shallow rambler wasting away in contemplation of foolish things, or Children Of Men is truly important to me. In reality, both of these are true...and in a nutshell, this is what Children Of Men is all about. It's about most us, those of us who are 'aware' yet not bothered enough to transcend their mere 'awareness' of the problem. That is, until something comes along and lights a fire under their asses. For me, it may be this mere film, Children Of Men.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Would have been a better story,"Well, Cliwe Owen got another well-played role. But the point that I didn't like the movie that much was about the evolution and the conclusion of the story. I appreciate the way that they describe the occasion valuable and dramatic. The situation that the world can involve in this case was shown realistic and satisfied. The middle east influence in the refugees life was highly expected and you can clearly see these guys are the typical poor unwanted people to use in your movie. I wouldn't tell I like it. On the other hand, cinematography of the movie was incredible and needs respect to be shown.To sum up, in my opinion, the movie deserves a perfect six. Not more not less.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One of 2006' best films.,"2006 has really surprised me with it's movies. I was honestly expecting the big budget action blockbusters to be the years best films, but most of them just flat out sucked. Little did i know, that it was the end of this year, that would bring on the good movies. 'Children Of Men' is one of those films.The film is set in London, 2027. Everything is completely messed up. Women are infertile, people have lost all hope of further future and in the beginning of the film, the youngest person on earth dies, leaving the world in complete desperation. But could all this be changed with a single breath of child? That is the question this movie is making. When all hope seems to be lost, can one single person make a difference? In terms of cinematography, Cuaron goes into a direction similar to that in 'Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind'. Grim tones, hand held camera. And in this case, it completely works. It blends perfectly with the chaotic look and feel of this film. The 2027 London is wonderfully done, and makes you think that actually the present day, but has these little hints that it is the future, such as holographic screens and stuff like that. The acting in the film is brilliant. Since Clive Oven is one of my favorite actors, i was very delighted to finally see him in a lead role. Julianne Moore gives a solid performance as well, but i was surprised to see Michael Cane in such an extraordinary role. Instead of playing himself, as usual, he plays this crazy hippie like old wacko, who seems to like the joke 'Pull my finger' quite a lot. The movie isn't all non-stop action, but when there is action, it's realistic and very originally made.One of the best films 2006 has to offer. Definitely a must see.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Must see on big screen!,"I recently saw Children of Men in SF on the big screen and I must say it totally blew me away! I had never even heard of the title since I rarely watch any television or read magazines, etc... The cinematography is absolutely BRILLIANT which might not carry the same effect if it were watched on a small TV. Same goes for the sound which is spot on and deafening at times; it really captures the imagery well. The plot line is pretty great, good dialog, outstanding visuals, and overall very well-paced. I highly recommend seeing it in a movie theater though as you will literally be sucked into some of the scenes, if not all of them. Excellent!",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Oh.My.God.,"Incredible film.brilliantly put together, and if you can ignore a few very obvious mistakes, then this might just be film of the year so far. There is a whole 15 minute section thats all one shot and it just defies belief. Its so well made. Tricky subject matter and a storyline thats nowhere near believable (because science will eventually fix everything if we can just survive long enough) but the film is so engaging and interesting that it just hooks you in and keeps you immersed in this world. I was really surprised that i liked this film so much because to be honest, everything id heard about it before just sounded like the desperate graspings of Hollywood minds. But in this case I'm well and truly proved wrong",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A future classic,"I really enjoyed this film - it works well as a piece of entertainment and something with a bit more bight. Like a lot of dystopia-future type films, it says a lot about the present, particularly the tabloid hysteria over immigration (interestingly there's quite a few Polish people in this film, something of a bugbear for the gutter press at the moment)and the footage we see everyday of Iraq. I think this film would sit nicely alongside Brazil, Dark City, or even Three Kings. Technically it's superb - it looks brilliant, and was nicely sombre and gritty, which worked fantastically with the special effects. The battle scenes were truly breathtaking, as were the sudden, almost off-hand explosions. It ends nicely as well, avoiding the temptation to 'over-tell' the story beyond its natural ending as far too many films have done recently. The actors all give good performances here, especially Clive Owen who makes a natural hero without resorting to absurd posturing, and Michael Caine is brilliant as ever, at once familiar yet completely different, even making 'pull my finger' fit into this movie somehow! All in all, this is really a film worth seeing. I just hope we can look back in 20 years and laugh at how wrong this prediction was...",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Really made me stop and think,"This is not one of my favourite movies by a long shot but it really did make me stop and think. It was powerful and unsettling, at times quite shocking. At times it was so very relevant to what is happening in our world today. You know when you can quite stop thinking about a movie, well this is how I feel. The plot is a simple one, life where there is no fertility and the oldest person is 18 and people just seem to have given up, descended into chaos and lost all humanity. The lead Owens is great as Theo, the reluctant hero. Before I started watching I thought he was going to be the action hero type but he is simply just a normal guy, depressed, grieving and just not really sure what's the point. The cinematography is outstanding. It really is just gripping without being a ten out of ten movie. It kind of gives you a bit of hope in a bleak way, that in some there is still humanity and compassion. Watch it and just pause a moment after to reflect.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Children for Men,"I just returned from watching this movie. The acting is great but the film doesn't show why people do not procreate anymore, why the world is in a bad state, and what will happen after the end of the film. This in contrast with the amount of filming time used for some people moving from one place to another. I read a lot of books of WWII and this film had some shocking parts in it to me as what the civilized (British) world is doing to other people in 2027. Like the film Waterworld, in some part you get to know why the world is all water and what will happen when they found the last peace of land. But in this film you miss out that part. The plot is great to make a good story but things don't add up. And it's beautiful when women are pregnant, but it throws the film to ranks at the bottom when it is predictable that the women has to bare child at the least convenient moment. That has worn out so many times, it doesn't work anymore.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Close to now; not quite now,"The enthusiasm of many of the reviews of this picture is entirely justified. Though it is unlikely to make anyone feel 'good', it will offer a thought provoking and chillingly plausible vision of a world sliding into despair. The pseudo-documentary camera work is slightly jarring at times, but lends further weight to the film's sense of being grounded in a realist tradition.Performances have been hailed, deservedly, as very good, but Pam Ferris deserves a special mention: we know what Caine and co. are capable of but it is refreshing to see her create a warm, believable character from what could otherwise be a flimsy 'tree-hugger' stereotype. That is one of the qualities that makes this a remarkable film. There is little of the 'throwaway' about the performances; the settings are entirely believable. Above all, the sense of the here-and-now extended 21 years hence is anchored in the presentation of a world very like 2006 but where the 'Grand Design' take on ecologically sound or penthouse living is taken to its ultimate conclusion and where a turbo-charged UKIP sets national policy.All this and King Crimson in the soundtrack!",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Precarious Balance Between Nihilism and Hope Captured with Bravado by Cuarón,"Director Alfonso Cuarón lends both scarifying grit and unexpected heart to this propulsive, rewarding 2006 screen adaptation of P.D. James' 1992 dystopian sci-fi novel about a hopeless future with no children. There have been many apocalyptic films that deal with Armageddon in many different forms, yet this one reverberates from a most plangent storyline of global collapse as Cuarón thoughtfully brings it down to a human-size scale. Set in England only twenty years hence, the film shows a relentlessly bleak landscape not too far imagined from the present. Cuarón manages to tether us to the fantastical story by making 2027 London look realistically desultory and shell-shocked with its faded double-deckers and Bangkok-style tuk-tuks. In turn, the Bexhill refugee camp later in the film has a startling resemblance to the Abu Ghraib prison and the surrounding streets a dead ringer for the shots of violent warfare we are used to seeing in Iraq on CNN.The plot centers on Theo Faron, a former political activist who has been numbed into apathy by the increasingly nihilistic state of the planet. Because its isolated island geography has ensured the success of an emerging fascist government, Great Britain has become the only nation to survive the worldwide nuclear terrorism. Foreigners are automatically labeled illegal immigrants and placed in brutalizing internment camps, and at 18, the youngest person on the planet has just been stabbed to death. The news is devastating to the masses because infertility has plagued the planet for nearly two decades with no hope for the human race to survive. Kidnapped by the Fishes, a revolutionary group supporting the foreigners' human rights, Theo finds out the dastardly act was masterminded by his ex-wife Julian, who heads the group. Her motivation becomes clear as they are holding a West African girl named Kee, who happens to be eight months pregnant. The rest of the film focuses on the clandestine effort to transport Kee to the Human Project, an offshore organization dedicated to reversing the global infertility.There are so many strong visual cues and unexpected plot turns that it is impossible to be bored by the story penned by no less than five screenwriters including Cuarón. A powerful example is the meticulous portrayal of Theo's cousin Nigel, the one official who can secure travel documents for Kee's passage, as the curator of the world's surviving masterworks (including Michelangelo's damaged David and Picasso's Guernica) in the reconverted Tate Modern. Another is the superb cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki, richly textured in establishing the bombed-out, authoritarian universe and documentary-like once the more violent aspects take over the movie. Particularly impressive is the extended scene where the Fishes attempt to escape an aggressive ambush in a speeding car, as well as the concluding battle scenes which culminate into an unexpected religious allegory.After his scene-stealing turns in ""Closer"" and ""Inside Man"", Clive Owen really owns this movie from start to finish with a richly complex portrait of a man who discovers his sense of purpose against seemingly insurmountable odds. In fact, his committed performance holds together some of the more far-fetched plot developments like Theo's too-easy escape from the safe house. Claire-Hope Ashitey provides a striking presence as the vulnerable but amazingly resilient Kee. Also making vivid impressions are the reliable Julianne Moore as Julian, Chiwetel Ejiofor as fellow revolutionary Luke, Danny Huston as Nigel, Pam Ferris as Kee's self-appointed guardian Miriam (who provides an essential back story behind the infertility), Peter Mullan as the corrupt policeman Syd, and an especially colorful Michael Caine as Theo's perpetually quixotic friend Jasper. This is nicely audacious film-making, a creative masterstroke that marks Cuarón as an important creative force in cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Amazing,"This movie blew me away. When I first saw a trailer for this film oh I don't know 6 or 7 months ago I was very very uninterested. I hadn't been sold on Clive Owen (mainly due to that garbage Arthur from a few years back) and the idea of the movie seemed a little overdone. You know future world everything is in a chaotic state, totalitarian government so on and so on. Over time and after many more trailers I was slowly being persuaded to see this film and let me tell you I am glad I did. Everything about this movie was top notch. All the actors played their role to a tee. The story was very well written and well acted and you really believed that this could happen in our lifetime. I was on the edge of my seat from beginning to end waiting to see what was next for Leo and his pregnant companion. This movie is top notch and should be on any true movie fans MUST SEE list.

"Intolerance, Chaos, Infertility, Hope","In 2027, after eighteen years of infertility in a chaotic world and the death of the youngest man on Earth, the hopeless mankind is near the extinction. In London, the civil servant Theo Faron (Clive Owen) is contacted by his ex-wife and leader of the terrorist group The Fishes, Julian (Julianne Moore), to get a permission for the travel of the young woman Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey) to a seaside town of refugees. Along their journey, Theo discloses that Kee is pregnant and tries to protect and deliver her to a peaceful group of a life project in a vessel called ""Tomorrow"" and give hope to the mankind.""Children of Men"" is an impressively pessimist view of the fate of mankind, with the growing intolerance generating chaos, anarchy and infertility. The scenes are extremely realistic and well directed and choreographed, and the unpleasant story gives a minor hope in the end. The most important certainly is the reflection that this film may cause in the viewers, disclosing a possible dark future of the world if, among other problems, peoples do not change the behavior accepting differences of other peoples. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Filhos da Esperança"" (""Children of Hope"")",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Visually stunning and thematically captivating,"This movie contains everything that a futuristic movie should have: a plot line centered around the extinction of human race, set in a politically charged situation; the struggle of a man against the greater collective forces, and ultimate redemption of human race through fate and individual heroism. The film is superbly produced, the dialogue is sharp and canny, the visuals--oh, i love the visuals, the journalistic style is so appealing. This film is much better than pop Hollywood movies where a concept is presented to you so meticulously, it's practically shoved down your throat. _Children of men_ does not do that. It gives you an image for a brief few seconds, and it's your decision whether or not to dwell on it. As a result the movie moves fast, fast, fast. Watch it twice and you'll still enjoy it. There is not a boring second of footage. I highly recommend this movie to all sci-fi fans, readers of cyberpunk novels, and just about anyone who enjoys action, fast & sharp. I'd give it a nine but oh, here's what makes this movie great: the jokes. There are moments in the film that are supercharged with tension, action, drama, and... humor. It's golden.

poorly explained concepts as excuse for shocking violence,"I will confirm that the acting is quite good and the cinematography is interesting and well done. However, a real good science fiction movie explains a bit of the underlying plot and at least some of the science, if even as cool and interesting pseudo-science that has no basis in reality, but is at least fun and intriguing to think about. This movie has none of that, but instead only the loosest futuristic concepts that serve merely as an excuse for yet another immensely violent suspense film. The initial rave reviews must be coming from the masses of young sci-fi fans that have read nothing but cheesy comic books, and studied little to no science at all. It's not an absolutely terrible movie, but given the superior acting and cinematography, it could have been fantastic had the storyline been developed at all. If you are a discriminating sci-fi fan that actually expects the writers to think, just a little, then don't bother, or wait for it on Netflix and see it on someone's large flat screen TV with decent surround sound -- if you must. It's not worth the $20 at the theater for a date, especially since you will both have to watch some comedy before sleeping to shake off the CNS shock effects of the gratuitous violence. If you are someone who likes watching hackneyed, silly time travel sci-fi over and over again, or loves idiotic violent movies, then I am sure you will give it at least 8 stars, so go ahead and continue the financing of such drivel.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I just don't get it!,Yet again the ranking in IMDb has foxed me. How on earth has this film achieved such acclaim. The premise of the story was good but got tangled up in Christian analogy and political farce. Michael Caine was totally miscast and performed as Michael Caine as he does in almost all his movies. Clive Owen looked completely lost (or perhaps he was supposed to be) and Pam Ferris - well what can I say. Yes the cinematography was OK but there are so many other better examples of 'hand held' out there.

Children of men the best movie of 2006,"well ... it's a great movie, I went to see it 3 times and i would see it again. It possess some important issues that we are starting to confront with, like world hunger, wars, disease, and even though i think these problems are a bit exaggerated, they must be considered never the less. I have't seen a movie like this for a long time, it has a good plot, a bit unrealistic but interesting, and the story is very well told. You are pinned down in your seat the whole movie and you have no idea what's about to happen until the end, and that in my opinion is what makes a movie Oscar material.

"Goodbye Ruby Tuesday, Hello Hope of Tomorrow","This cinematic version of P.D. James' bleak yet beautiful tale of an infertile future stands alone in its greatness. From the beginning scene in the coffee shop where it is announced the youngest child on earth had died at the age of 18, you are set in a world of no hope. The first part of the movies concept being, what is there to live for when there is no one living tomorrow? The second concept being, die trying so those tomorrow have at least a chance to try. Theodore Faron (Clive Owen) is the central character who has chosen to risk life and limb to bring Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey) to The Human Project. The Human Project headquarters if you will is a boat adrift at sea, that is a symbol of a new start for civilization. This movie has so much symbolism going on its mind-blowing. From Jasper (Michael Caine) to Clive Owens,'s shoes it makes you watch and examine what the meaning of the film is truly about. The meaning of the film mostly being the concept of winning the fight's over your trial and tribulations. Human survival, government oppression, racism, infertility; the idea that humans can and will outlast any problem that comes there way. I think the strongest point of this though is used through a song, ""Ruby Tuesday."" So many lines referencing the current state of things in London and throughout the world. The clearest being ""Yesterday doesn't matter if it's gone."" In other words goodbye Ruby Tuesday, hello hope of tomorrow and save the children of men.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Grey, grim, gritty and depressing, as it should be","I won't tell the story of the film as others do over and over, but I will offer a commentary.In this gritty and harsh end-of-the-world-coming film there were too many unexplained reasons for everything bad that had happened/was happening to the world for me to say this was a great movie, but it did have its very effective moments if you could look past its story holes, inconsistencies and oversights. It is true that harsh, apocalyptic films like this one are tough to watch, but are absolutely necessary for all of us to see many times from this point on, as people worldwide do not respond to subtle messages about our environment, pollution, war, and global warming so they must be hit in the face by a story like this one regularly to show what can/could happen to us if we don't wake up and stop the world-killing atrocities that we are committing against other humans and to the earth. The film story left out the causes of the horrible state of the earth and concentrated on the effects of these atrocities, which were truly horrible to witness. All of it was very shocking, as something like it really could and may happen.The story of getting a mother and child, the only one in the world, out of England to someplace secret to perhaps provide a chance for humans to start anew, was your typical chase story with all the typical suspense, pitfalls, threats, violence and mayhem along the way. Nothing too unusual or different there. The ending was the hope the filmmaker gave us. But, what would that baby girl do later to save our species even if she escaped? Any possibility for the future hinged on finding a fertile male somewhere, but no babies had been born for many years so what were the chances of that? Would they try to use frozen sperm from an earlier and fertile time? No questions like this one were ever posed or answered.The impact of the obvious ""baby Jesus"" scene near the end was very forceful, as it represented the filmmaker's idea of perhaps the only chance at a new beginning for our human-screwed-up-world in 2027, just as Jesus' birth was hoped to be 2000 years earlier. That powerful scene showed the immense reverence and amazement of even the military, which briefly ceased its vicious attack on insurgents as the mother and baby passed by. It was like a 2x4 slamming into your head as it made its point of, ""this baby is perhaps the only chance for human survival!"".I had a problem with story inaccuracies, as in its technical representations everything.....the tanks, guns, cars, clothing and even TV's showed no improvements over those around today and in many cases they were worse. No progress there, so the problems shown were obviously around for many years, perhaps since 2007? No clue, no answers. Also, if the country was in such chaos, why were the roads everywhere passable without roadblocks? Where did they get fuel? And, how did everyone eat, sleep, work, make money to live on, etc.? No good explanations were given for any of that. The film just wanted us to accept what it showed and concentrate on the devastation and human depravity. But I needed a more full and complete story of the social mess and its causes, and this wasn't one so I was left with too many unanswered questions that should have been answered.This movie has been out a week and hardly anyone was in the theater, so it probably won't make a profit.... depressing and/or apocalyptic films, even though foretelling an impossible or even somewhat hopeful future for us, usually don't make money. We just don't want to face what we have done and what may result from it so we stay away.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Engaging thriller with a weak ending,"So another movie which bothers me because of its ending. I guess the thrust was on emphasising the marginalization of minorities in Britain. I am surprised though when this movie is called the best movie of 2006. It is a good attempt but in no way is this a groundbreaking movie or anything.The story is quite intriguing. The story is set in the future in a Britain bereft of hope. In the Britain being portrayed, immigrants are treated as dangerous criminals and pushed into camps, like refugee camps. The human race is plagued by infertility for 18 years. In the midst of all this is a woman who becomes pregnant all of a sudden. The main character is a man named Theo(Clive Owen). He meets his old girlfriend Julian(Julianne Moore) who is involved with some extremist activities. From then on, his life starts taking a turn to the worse.The best thing about the movie is the portrayal of the main character. He isn't portrayed as a superhero or a guy who has multiple talents. He is a regular guy who is caught in the wrong place. The movie is from his perspective. So we see his despair and his confusion throughout the movie. The direction of Alfonso Cuaron is topnotch and is one of the things I loved about this movie. The dark feel to the whole movie is appropriate and the whole ""filming from the main character's perspective"" is effective as we get an insight into the mindset of the character at various points of the movie. The use of music is another positive aspect. There is no overdose of music and in many scenes, there is no music at all. This adds to the dark feel of the movie. The scene in the Bexhill refugee camp is especially well done. In this scene we see his confusion and terror as he wants to do his best to protect but he is caught in the crossfire. Clive Owen's performance is quite good and his character would strike a chord with the audience. Julianne Moore, unfortunately, is under utilised in this movie and we don't see much of her. Michael Caine does well in his limited role but he could have been given a larger role.The ending is a problem for me. I am generally annoyed at these open endings utilised in movies and this was no exception. The lack of a clear ending was not the only problem. The problem is that the ending was so underwhelming and lacked the kind of passion or energy that the rest of the movie had. The political angle was, IMO, a little too much for me. Sure, it is an issue relevant for me too(as I am an Indian). But the political themes in this movie are rammed into your head without any subtlety. The heavyhanded way of presenting these political themes was definitely a negative aspect. There are not many twists in this movie as I expected(but then I am a Christopher Nolan fan). The movie is straightforward from the second half onwards and it becomes a sort of adventure thriller in the vein of Bourne identity.My rating for this movie would be 7/10. This is because it is quite entertaining from an action thriller viewpoint. I did like Alfonso Cuaron's direction so I would most probably check his other movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Superb, electrifying cinema ****1/2 (out of five)","This sci-fi thriller based on a book by P.D. James is absolutely magnificent. Its premise is high-concept yet totally believable and Alfonso Cuaron (Y Tu Mama Tambien) shot the film entirely using hand-held cameras adding to the realism and grittiness of the picture.

The scene was beautifully shot as it was alarmingly moving. The actors need a special mention too. Well, probably except, Julianne Moore, most of her scenes were forgettable til when she got shot in the neck. That was as high as her scenes in the movie can get. Clive Owen delivered well. A ""confused"", ""no other choice"" hero who has to save a damsel in distress ""Kee"" who holds a miracle which sadly though is a very ""priceless commodity"" during that time period which everybody else also wants.

Rebirth?...,"In 2027 the Earth is in its final days. A pandemic of infertility has wiped out all hope of a future generation of offspring. The world has responded to this situation by tearing itself apart. England remains as the only place with a semi-functioning government, and it's a fascistic police state. All hope is gone.Or is it?CHILDREN OF MEN is one of the better apocalyptic thrillers. Clive Owen is outstanding in his rugged yet protective role. Rather than being some sort of superhero, he's human, and in danger every step of the way. The young woman in his charge is vulnerable and he can't let anything happen to her. Owen really makes this feel genuine.This is a movie about the infinitely improbable resurrection of a species. The stakes are impossibly high, and Director Cuaron gets this across with his bleak presentation. We never know in what direction things will turn or how it will end.Recommended for fans of solid dystopian cinema...",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I was quite disappointed,"After all of the hubabaloo about this movie I expected a lot more.We couldn't see it at a theatre as it was only limited release here in Ontario Canada. We have no theatre in our town of 6,000. It didn't come to any of the towns a half hour drive north, east or south of us, nor did it come to the city an hour's drive north of us. We didn't want to drive on winter highways two or more hours to see it, but were quite disappointed not to see it on the big screen.That is until we rented it days after it was released. We'd read such great reviews and heard from relatives who had seen it that it stuck with them long after they saw it. So we anxiously put it in the DVD player and then spent the entire time waiting for something awesome that never came.It was an OK movie, don't get me wrong, but there was nothing special about it. What you saw in the previews was what you got. No deep meaning, no twists - just predictability. Maybe our hopes were too high, I don't know.It's not a total waste of time, but not a fabulous movie either. Wait until it comes on the movie channel - I wish we had.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
What's left to hope for? Movies like this!,"'Children of Men' paints a disturbing picture of a not-to-distant future (the year 2027), concentrating on a world's civilization that has been dealt a very harsh reality: the human race is on the brink of extinction. Women have come to acquire an inexplicable fertility defect and can no longer procreate as they could 20 years ago. As the rest of the world has fallen to ruins, hapless souls from all over the globe attempt to immigrate to the one and only place that has managed to survive: London, England. The once prosperous and renowned city has turned into an oppressive and highly controlled environment, yet by the same token it has become the only safe haven left on Earth that's still alive and kicking.Soon we are introduced to Theo, a former activist turned bureaucrat, and his ex-wife Julian, a big name peace advocate. The two are compelled to reconcile by forces bigger than them because, as it turns out, there's a young woman by the name of Kee who is miraculously with child. A difficult but worthwhile mission thus ensues in order to safely transport and protect Kee and take her to a safe place off the coast where scientists can learn from this remarkable miracle.I must begin by saying that, even if it's only January, this is the most absorbing movie that I have seen this year. The overall concept proposed in the storyline is not entirely implausible, which makes it all the more frightening. And although we as viewers are never really given a concrete explanation as to why women have become infertile, the notion is no less worrisome. But one of the things that especially impressed me about this film was its visuals. Artistically speaking, it is masterfully shot and constructed and does nothing short of take your breath away. I was absolutely blown away by the incredibly long and action-packed single takes that were interspersed throughout. That sort of approach successfully aids in giving the film a gritty and guerilla-like tinge to it. It puts you on the edge of your seat and makes you feel like you're down in the trenches right along with the characters; extremely effective and transfixing.And with a cast like this, it comes as no surprise that the film was chock-full of excellent performances across the board. Clive Owen is certainly continuing to prove himself as a hot commodity, even if success didn't greet him with open arms until he was well into his 40's. His classically handsome look paired with his undeniable talent make him nothing short of luminous when projected on screen. As usual, Julianne Moore is excellent, though a bit understated here. Her role is not a very large one, despite what the trailers and previews on TV lead you to believe. And Michael Caine, who never disappoints, turns in a cheeky and chuckle-inducing performance as a former political-cartoonist turned reformed hippie.All in all, this film is definitely worth checking out and hopefully you can appreciate it for not only being a thrilling science fiction piece, but also a deeply moving drama with hints of light comedy to break the tension every so often. I hear a lot of people label it as being the 'Blade Runner' of the new millenniumI'm not entirely sure I agree with that because they are two entirely different movies, advocating completely different ideas. Nor do I believe this film will have as much of a culturally significant impact as 'Blade Runner' did, but that's just my opinion. I do urge you, however, to check out 'Children of Men' so you can judge for yourself!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Without out a doubt the best movie of 2006!,"When I went to see this film I had an idea of what it would be like, a typical action film, and I have to confess that I was totally wrong about ""Children of Men"". My expectations were destroyed as it broke all the archetypal stereotypes that are present in an action film. The action in the film (which there are many scenes) has some point to it and it does literally have you on the edge of your seat. However what I found far more mesmerising was the emotional journey that the characters go on, none more so that Clive Owen. He was the reluctant hero that I found most appealing. I saw this film with every intent of taking my younger brother with me even though he is not 15 (which is the certificate the film was given in the UK) as we are pretty lax at what he sees. However having seen this film, I am glad we didn't because it had a brutality of it that I had never quite seen before. I suppose that it affected me so much, because I had been to many of the places shown in the film; it looked more like the Middle East than England. For two hours this film hypnotises you. It is one of the rare films that afterwards you kind of wish you never saw it, just because you can watch it again for the first time with no idea of what will happen. I recommend everyone to see this film as you will not be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"The energy level is intriguing, but you have to turn you mind off to enjoy","Now, to be fair, this movie deserves a 6, but I feel I have to downgrade to 3 to offset the 85% of the viewers who don't seem to realize it only deserves a 6 or less, not a 7.9. Yes, the visuals and action and scariness are not bad, and the movie could easily be a 9 based on that if it had a plot. But the plot fails so spectacularly that is is painful, yes painful, to even reflect on it in any detail. It just makes no sense, cannot withstand even the teensiest probing. Nothing any character does follows from anything. Nothing about the society holds together. The only thing that lets me get to sleep at night is the comforting thought that the screenwriters didn't care whether any element of the story made any sense, they were only looking for visual appeal.

"Perhaps not as good as the hype, but still a major highlight of 2006","After reading all the reviews and praise for Children of Men, I can't exactly say I was blown away by the resulting film - but it's certainly a very good movie in that it manages to make you care for the characters and makes you think; something that can't be said for many movies released recently. The film is based on a novel by P.D. James, which I haven't read. The story takes place in the future, although it's not the futuristic world seen in most other films set in the future. Rather, the landscape of the film is a lot like the present world, and if anything seems even less technologically advanced. The basic plot revolves around the idea of women, for some reason, becoming infertile. No child has been born for over eighteen years and the only hope of saving the human race is a rumoured organisation known as 'The Human Project'. However, there seems to be hope from elsewhere as after being dragged into a plot by his ex-wife, Theo Faron discovers a pregnant woman and agrees to help her get the baby to safety.Director Alfonso Cuarón has managed to walk a thin line between style and substance, and he's done it well. The film features a handful of star names who all deliver good performances, but these are never at the centre of the film and the director always makes sure that the story remains at the forefront. The film is not exactly a visual feast, but the downtrodden locations have a sort of eerie beauty to them, and the special effects, when used, are dazzling. The build up to the climax, the sequence that sees an army firing at a dishevelled building was a particular highlight in that respect. Clive Owen takes the lead role, and while he's still his usual one-note self; his role here really suits his on-screen persona. He receives good support from experienced performers Michael Caine and Julianne Moore, while lesser known actors such as Pam Ferris and Claire-Hope Ashitey perform well alongside the bigger names. I'm not a big fan of the way the film ended, although I can see the reason for cutting the story off where they did. Overall, Children of Men is an excellent film and I can certainly recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Bleak but powerful,"This takes place in Britain in 2027. The world has been hit by a plague or something (we never find out) that makes women unable to give birth. Society begins to crumble. Theo (Clive Owen) is a bureaucrat who distances himself from it all--but he was once an activist. He's drawn back into it all by a former lover (the always great Julianne Moore). There is one pregnant woman (Clare-Hope Ashitey) who they have to smuggle out of Britain and Theo gets involved.The story is somewhat vague and I'm still not sure what all these characters were about (I'm STILL at a loss to figure out what Michael Caine was doing here) but I was fascinated from start to finish. It is bleak and depressing with no humor or lightness to help you along. There are bloody gunfights and a nonstop air of depression surrounding everything. Still it's not THAT grim. I was able to distance myself from it--I was always aware I was watching a movie. Some people may not be able to do that (a few people were crying when I went).The acting is superb--Moore is never bad and Owen has never been better. His acting anchors the whole movie. You see his character go from unfeeling and uncaring to the other extreme. Even Caine was fun (sort of).I'm not going to get into the politics of the movie--but this seems to be the kind of future President Bush would love. Big Brother is always watching you here--illegal immigrants are routinely caged and brought to camps, people have to carry identity cards and the government has total control over everything. I don't think it could ever happen but it's terrifying to think that it could.A bleak, depressing but just great movie. A 10 all the way.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Dragging,I had a lot of expectations from this movie firstly for being nominated for Oscars and secondly coz  Alfonso Cuarón has directed Prisoner of Azkaban as well. But after watching it my expectations are turned down to the ground. The concept of the movie is so attracting that one must go for it but seriously I felt that they ruined it. The movie is too stretchy and too boring in parts. There's nothing much happening for much of a time and it crawls at moments. Some moments are good but they only make it an average flick not the one to make you stand in appreciation. Most of the part I was skipping frames. Clive Owen did a nice job. Watch it if you like dragging movies over a good concept. Otherwise you'll find it an average movie.,,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A film of extreme highs and lows,"Children of Men is a film of extreme highs and lows. In places, the film is mediocre, but in other places it's excellent. In general, I'd say the first hour is mediocre, but the last 30 minutes are outstanding.The biggest problem for me is that the movie does a poor job of creating the overall setting. We're told that it's the future and that no child has been born in over 18 years, but are provided with no reasons as to why this has happened or why it's about to change. We're also told that the rest of the world has somehow gone to hell and that England is the only country left that's still functioning properly. Unfortunately, the film provides no rationale as to how or why any of this happened and provides only the briefest description of the chaos that's going on in the world at large. As a result, I had a hard time getting into this futuristic world. I couldn't really understand why our heroes were running, what the Fishes wanted, or why the Human Project equaled salvation. Consequently, I also didn't really care too much about the characters. At least, not at first.However, in the last 30 minutes, the film turned into more of a desperate chase style film and this section of the movie was simply outstanding. There were some very powerful and gripping sequences and the director perfectly captured the desperation and chaos of the situation. In particular, there is one notable shot that many others have cited: an 8 minute-long single-take sequence with our hero, Theo, navigating his way through a battlefield. This scene is one of the most brilliant and gripping sequences that I've ever seen. To me, it was right up there with the best shots in Saving Private Ryan and the movie is worth watching just for this one scene alone. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Depressing and riveting,"This movie is simultaneously depressing and entertaining. Theo is played by Clive Owen and the setting is in England in 2027. For reasons that are not explained or likely even known, no baby has been born for eighteen years. The youngest known person is a celebrity and was recently killed. England is now under a brutal martial law and there are roaming gangs of thugs that will attack anything they can. For example, when Theo takes the commuter train, it is pelted by members of a gang. There is a strong anti-immigrant sentiment in the country, people of color are being systematically rounded up and caged, ghettoed or worse.When Theo's former lover has Theo abducted, she asks him to help her escort a young black female out of the country. At first, he is not told the reason why, when he agrees and is part of a group traveling to their destination, they are attacked by a gang and his former lover is killed. Yet, they manage to reach their safe house. While there, Theo learns that the black female is pregnant, a modern miracle to say the least.The action is brutal, England is a nation in many ways at war with itself, Theo and the woman are in the thick of a battle between the British Army and the ghettoed immigrants in an event they call ""the uprising."" This film is very powerful, for in the midst of what is essentially a race war, the only current hope for the human race to continue is a black woman with a child. Another powerful scene is when Theo and his small group hide out in an abandoned elementary school. It is sad to see what should be a place of joy rotting for lack of upkeep. There is a glimmer of hope at the end, but it is only a glimmer.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not bad but I don't see what all the fuss is about,"The year is 2027 and there hasn't been a child born in 18 years. Society is crumbling and Clive Owen's character Theo is content to let it crumble around him. That is, until the discovery of a pregnant woman thrusts him into the role of reluctant hero as he strives to deliver her safely into the sanctuary of the Human Project.One of the strengths of the film is the direction by Alfonso Cuarón. The camera-work and cinematography combine to produce a gritty, realistic world not far from our own. While this is admirable I would have been more impressed if the film's futuristic world was more distinct, as in a film like ""Blade Runner"". Also, while I can respect the craft behind the film's visuals, the bleak look doesn't really appeal to my tastes.The acting is uniformly fine but unremarkable. The area that I think could use improvement is the script. I can only imagine why it took five screenwriters to bring this story to the screen. The fact that they were nominated for an Academy Award (Best Adapted Screenplay) baffles me. The action-oriented parts of the film are satisfying but the background is merely hinted at. The dystopian elements aren't as clearly defined as in ""V for Vendetta"", let alone great literary works like ""1984"" & ""Brave New World"". Perhaps the novel has more depth but this adaptation is little more than a shallow action flick.I recommend the film; just don't expect something that's in the same league as other dystopian films like ""A Clockwork Orange"", ""V for Vendetta"" and ""Blade Runner"".",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Cinema Non Pareil,"OMG This is an amazing film, an absolute masterpiece. I am absolutely mind-blown. I really like intellectual science fiction and nihilistic visions of the future collapse of western society, and this one is so plausible and palpable.Intelligent, funny, powerful, political, and quite a logical warning and rational progression from where we are today. This could happen. I don't know about the major plot point - that humans stopped reproducing, but the rest... it could happen.The cinematography is blindingly excellent. I lost all sense of sitting in a theatre watching a movie and found myself feeling thoroughly captivated - which meant that my heart was racing and I felt like I, also, was in harm's way. It is violent, but not the usual garden variety of ""There are men with guns on the screen, they are fighting."" No, this is Technicolor 3-D ""cinerama really makes it real"" violence that is presented with such clarity that you will walk away and feel a sense of relief that the street scene you will encounter as you walk outside the theatre is once again comfortably normal.The sound editing is also brilliant, I really like the way they would take a sound and transform it as the scenes changed. I can't be more specific without writing spoilers, but please trust me, this is a film to see in the best theatre you can afford because the sound design is a critical component to the experience of being in this story.Excellent soundtrack too.

Michael Caine's character is the most memorable but his relationship with Theo is never really explained. Indeed no relationships are either explained or explored. There is little or no character development and the viewer is left to fumble through the movie, avoiding sporadic and meaningless violence, without knowing why.Some elements of this movie, particularly the use of animals and an apparent footwear fetish, add nothing to the movie except further confusion. To add insult to injury, there is no outcome. At the end of 2 hours of pure bewilderment we are left with no better understanding of what we have just watched.I am dismayed by the number of positive reviews. The movie was poorly acted for the most part, gratuitously depressing throughout and failed to explain its premise. It reminds me of a TV segment I saw some time ago which illustrated the stupidity of so called art lovers who paid ridiculous sums of money for painting done by elephants.

Mankind is on the verge of extinction. Until a young woman is discovered to be miraculously pregnant, and one man becomes an unlikely saviour with the task of transporting her to safety...Anchored by Clive Owen's nuanced performance, 'Children of Men' always retains its human element.

But for the ""world-gone-to-hell"" near-future settings, there are better films. There is little character development either. I liked the animals--cats, dogs-- in the film (and there are quite a few). They seemed to embody some sort of normality.

James's novel, the film envisions a bleak future where humanity faces extinction due to mass infertility, creating a hauntingly realistic world on the brink of collapse.The story follows Theo Faron (Clive Owen), a disillusioned bureaucrat who becomes an unlikely hero when he is entrusted with protecting Kee (Clare-Hope Ashitey), a young woman who miraculously becomes pregnant-the first in 18 years. Together, they navigate a war-torn, oppressive society as they seek to deliver Kee to safety, potentially reigniting humanity's hope for survival.Clive Owen gives a nuanced and compelling performance, portraying Theo's transformation from apathetic to determined with emotional depth. Clare-Hope Ashitey brings vulnerability and strength to Kee, while the supporting cast, including Michael Caine as a rebellious hippie and Chiwetel Ejiofor as a conflicted revolutionary, adds layers of complexity to the narrative.Cuarón's direction is nothing short of visionary. The film's long, unbroken takes-particularly during action sequences-create an immersive and visceral experience, pulling viewers into the chaos and urgency of the characters' journey. Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography beautifully captures the gritty, decaying world, while the sparse use of music amplifies the film's emotional impact.What sets Children of Men apart is its relevance and resonance. The film explores themes of hope, sacrifice, and resilience, making poignant reflections on immigration, societal division, and the human spirit. Its narrative, though dark, ultimately leaves viewers with a sense of cautious optimism.In conclusion, Children of Men is a cinematic triumph that blends masterful filmmaking with an unforgettable story. It is a must-watch for anyone who appreciates films that challenge, inspire, and linger in the mind long after the credits roll.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Children of Men: One of the 2000's Most Underrated Movies.,"I remember watching this cult-classic YEARS ago on DVD with my best- friend; we were having a sleepover at his place and we watched this movie on his MacBook Pro. And this was remarkable; in every sense of the word! Children of Men looks at what would happen if humanity ceased to reproduce: but suddenly there's ONE woman in the whole of the UK who's pregnant with the first child conceived in years. It's a fantastic premise for a dystopian sci-fi movie and it delivers with the grittiness, the somber tone, and Clive Owen's remarkable lead performance. Children of Men is not your typical alien-invasion sci- fi; it's a grounded affair into what happens when society is on the brink of total collapse, and then there's the smallest yet biggest glimmer of hope: a soon-to-be-born child.Why was this a flop at the box office? I have no f###ing idea why, but it deserved a WHOLE LOT MORE than it initially grossed.Anyway: Children of Men is one of my favourite sci-fi movies!",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It's Good But Very Bleak..,"The reviews will have you reading what a masterpiece this movie is, and I disagree. It's a good movie and I liked the acting, especially Ferris and Moore, they are both great actresses. The director is very good, the camera did shake quite a bit in non combat scenes, but it was most likely intended then even though I don't know why. I enjoyed the storyline but half way through I was just waiting for it to end (and end well of course) because it's so bleak, I get what people will say, that it's supposed to be, but a bit too dark, violent and gory. I think some of the reviews, are way over the top and the bad reviews are a bit harsh. I really hope if people do watch it, I hope they like it. If not, find a movie that fits into your favorite movie category...everyone's different, but when you do find a new movie to like or love that's what we all hope for.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Alfanso cuarons masterpiece,"Alfonso cuarons masterpiece. The vision of a future, where humans are going extinct. According to me the movie tries to show how the world has forgot the importance of a life. Why do people keep fighting in the name of relegion and nationality?. The movie tries to show that we are all children of men, we are all the same, then why fight over the differences?. The making of this movie is truly exeptional. The set design is just marvelous. The detailing in each scene is so precise. The way they show future London is just awsome. The action sequences are amazing, especially the climax sequences. There are a lot of single take shots which increase the tension and takes us into this world. The cinematography is just top class. The performance by all the actors are awsome. Clive owen as theo faren is just awsome. My favourite is claire hope as kee, her innocence and natural performance adds so much to the movie. The music is amazing, in most of the places it's like a opera piece, gives the movie a grand feel.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Massive migration problems vs. lack of children,"I think that movie was quite good, especially first half hour of it. But then it more and more tries to convince us that there are too many people world-wide, despite the fact that there were no new kids in 18 years. If we look at the Sierra Leone for example, half of the population consists of children aged up to 14 years. We can imagine what would happen if there were no natality for so long. There were also many other activities such as discriminatory emigration policy, terrorist groups in GB, but the reasons for that were never told. They for sure cannot be consequence of lack of children and common misery because of it. Immigrants are surely not the only reason (if at all) for the world to collapse into chaos. I think that many important themes were too much simplified in order to present one problem. However, violence, riots and civil disobedience which led to unrest were shown very well and realistic, but reasons for them were not defined.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The power of the baby!!!!,"Children of Men is a true cinema masterpiece.You will be sitting at the edge of your seat throughout the whole movie, as it is a very action packed movie, but not in the same way as your typical big budget movies. The incredible cinematography gives it an amazing and profound way of making it feel like your, as a watcher, actually, is in the movie and a part of the nail biting journey.The acting is also fantastic. Both Clive Owen and Clare-Hope Ashitey delivers amazing performances that make the movie feel real and authentic.I am strongly recommending this movie, as it is a flawless movie. The only reason I didn't give it a 10 is because, this is the million time an apocalypse arrives on film, and the overdose of this genre is quite frustrating.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""The Pianist"" set in the future","My score: 7 out of 10 I expected this to be yet another set-slightly-in-the-future, run-from-the-fascist-government, your-friends-drop-off-one-by-one survival movie, urban-warfare movie. I suppose I cannot honestly think of another movie that combines ALL those elements. ""Minority Report"" - a brilliant original concept - has all but the friends-dropping aspect. ""Logan's Run"" omits most of the urban-warfare. Frankly, I felt ""The Pianist"", which, of course, is set in the 1939 Warsaw ghetto, comes the closest to matching the feeling of being on the run from a omnipresent fascist government and surviving under barren war-torn conditions as in ""Children of Men"".The incredibly-long-single-continuous shots in the urban warfare scene deserve a rewind: I lost my attention span somewhere halfway and don't remember where each edit cut begins.I couldn't help but think of Clive Owen in ""Shoot 'em Up"" and every other high-octane film where he is constantly being shot at and laugh a little bit.The acting is great. I believe they got the technology ""right"" for the year 2027 - very little improvement: a few animated advertisements on the sides of buses (and weed is still illegal!).Here are the three big negatives: no where is it revealed specifically WHAT the UK government and what the Fishes want with the newborn baby. I really wanted to know that throughout the entire movie. Was one side desiring to repopulated the earth, or just one portion of it, and the other side opposing, or vice versa? What did the two major issues of infertility and an immigration problem out of control in the UK have to do with each other? For this kind of movie, I felt they really needed to be related, because, otherwise, my mind could not help think throughout the movie that a long period of worldwide infertility implies a general DECLINE in human population and, hence, a REDUCTION in immigration problems? I was SUPREMELY disappointed in the sudden ending, expecting the story to go fully into whatever the Human Project was about, even if it was to repopulate the earth. I still needed to know the details. Perhaps, that was NOT its purpose: who knows? Perhaps another twist lay in wait.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Unexpected Future Classic,"Just back from seeing the film 24/sept I can hardly recall a jot of the dialogue, but cannot get the themes, the cinematography, the action or the mood out of my head. This is a gritty film, and even the inclusion of the twee balloon (pigs might fly) outside the window in the Battersea scene and the mawkish Hollywood-esquire sentimentality of the soldiers' pause in fighting later in the film serve the purpose of enabling the director to roughly drag the viewer back to his 'reality'.Michael Caine's ageing hippie, cheerfully devoted to his invalid partner and ruthlessly executed by the self-styled liberators is in stark contrast to the pragmatically loveless society portrayed. Images recalling Guantanamo, Abu Graib, contemporary conflict between western power and Islamic determination, detention and abuse of migrants, 20th century images of the Warsaw ghetto, the Hungarian Uprising and the fragility of redemption are interwoven as Clive Owen struggles to make sense of what is going on. He becomes an unlikely hero whilst Bexhill becomes Beirut. There are no 'bad guys' or 'good guys', just a bleak expression of how ordinary people respond to extraordinary circumstances according to their own perspectives, but the innocent suffer more than the guilty,- chillingly real.A thought-provoking cinematographic experience with excellent soundtrack, brilliantly understated acting and stunning, visuals.I will certainly buy this one when the DVD is released. I also hope no-one will ever attempt a sequel, which would destroy the enigmatic impact of the film. Hollywood, keep your hands off!",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Absolutely brilliant,"Children of Men BLEW ME AWAY. Having played Half-Life 2 the world it takes place in reminded me of that game. But everything about CoM is excellent. The acting, storyline, action, music and so on. It's just a perfect movie from start to finish, and I can't wait to see it again.Clive Owen proves (yet again) that he's a brilliant actor and the same goes for Michael Caine (the rest of the cast is equally brilliant).I simply cannot recommend this movie enough. GO SEE IT. If you don't, then you are missing out on the best movie of 2006.Technically the movie is out of this world (when you see the urban war zone scenes, you will know what I mean).

"Jaw dropping, astonishing, brilliant.","Children of Men is a film set in England in the near future. The world has gone to pieces, a fascist state is in power, revolutionaries are plotting and women are infertile. Intense, bleak, harrowing stuff, and not since Blade Runner has a film captured and expressed this feeling through the sets, locations and production design so throughly. Though not exactly a ""film noir"" it's this feature of Children of Men, expressing the bleakness of this situation, through cinematic technique that is it's best asset. The plot is just as intense, characters well presented and interesting, acting is solid, script? Solid, cinematography? Phenomenal. If you can get you're head around the initial concept, (are you really going to sit there and say ""women infertile?

You can't play it without immersion in it with whole your imagination. The same thing i may tell about the movie! Old people, no hope, no pleasure, no future. Crazy dying world. It reminds me terminator 2 and the island movies. realism and action. Different characters in the movies tells you their stories: there are good people with bad purposes and bad people with good ones. it shocking sometimes.

Pull my finger,"Really a surprisingly deep movie. A relatively normal guy gets sucked into the troubling events that surround him. Can he rise to the challenge, or sink back into the rut he wants his life to be? This film has a lot of message, but it isn't terribly preachy. From what I saw, most of the Social Significance was background filler. This film is about some people doing some stuff, living life, and about some other folks that intrude on that. The really great thing is how the ordinary people survive the Great Events. Or fail to do so.I'm just impressed as hell with Michael Caine and Clive Owen. Both turn in some great performances. Caine's may be his best in years. Moore, Ejiofor, Ashitey, and the others are good too. The acting was wonderful. Real people with flaws, not cardboard cutout action heroes. I think I'd have to attribute any faults at all to writing or direction. The flow just wasn't quite there. But each individual scene was stunning.By the way, watch for the symbolism. Both classical and pop culture. Again, the background tells a story, if you know what to look for. They even worked in Revelations 13, and made it make sense.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Slow and little payoff,"It is difficult to let people know the problems I have with this movie without giving a bunch away, but let me just say that it takes a highly improbable and unexplained event (all mothers on earth somehow stop having babies at the same time), adds some vivid imagery and a few half-baked ideas, and caps it off with a set of characters that we have little or no investment with at the end. There is little sense of jeopardy here; at one point a character turns up shot, but it doesn't seem integral to the story. This is the kind of movie that would be more interesting if it was either more believable or more thrilling. Taking a far-out concept and wrapping it in a plodding mess of a plot is a recipe for disaster.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
This Movie Told The Future,"Where to begin? Clive Owen, Michael Caine, Julianna Moore, Chiwetel Ejiofor were all great. But the real incredible thing about this movie is its accuracy. I've watched it periodically starting in the early '10s and it's only become more accurate. The immigration, family separation, war-torn Eastern Europe, and most of all the effort by governments to slow down birthing rates. In 2025 the world is experiencing all of these same issues, and this movie is based in 2027. It honestly is pretty amazing. Acting is great, suttle details are there, cinematography is good, storytelling good all around.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Don't kill the messenger,"Children of men is warning. It's an opinion from someone who is fed up with the state of the world and extrapolates his vision of today's world to a not too distant future.The world today exists only out of sound bites and religious arrogance: The evil-doers, democracy, freedom, natural resources on and on and on.... Off course everyone knows God is on their side. They are right, everyone else is wrong. If THEY won't listen...lets bomb them.But what if God decides to leave mankind altogether? That means everyone is wrong. What then? That's the main point of CoM. Mankind loses it's ability to procreate. This means ALL of mankind will be gone...within the next 70 to 80 years. Anarchy rules the world with the exception of Great Britain. The rest of the world is in chaos. Asylumseekers (white and black alike) try to get into Britain, only to be handled as third class citizens. Terrorists and activists say they are there to fight for the rights of illegals, but a closer look reveals they only care about themselves. CoM is not perfect, so is its script, but it tries to find a balance between art and entertainment. In a world filled with brain dead films like Click, My Super Ex Girlfriend or National Treasure, this film is a diamond. And the courage of its makers should be cherished.Many people do not or will not like this film. That means they don't like today's world. They should be shocked when a coffeeshop is bombed - killing everyone inside, they should cringe when an activist is shot and dies. They should not like it when a supposed asylum seeker is yanked of a bus and blindfolded by armed men. But this is the world today. Why is it that we are shocked by a film (fiction) and are unaffected by news footage (real world)? To say that this filmmaker glorifies violence for entertainment, is to truly expose yourself as ignorant. Close your eyes, count to ten, change the channel and everything will be fine. Sorry, it won't. Open your eyes and take action. That's what Children of Men does.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
What an incredible realistic looking movie.,"At the beginning of the movie I was quite worried. I thought; Oh no, not another movie about a depressive, cold and ugly looking future, in which a common man grows out to be a hero. For the first 30 minutes it really felt like the movie was heading in that direction. Later the movie starts to take a positive turn when the movie becomes less plot orientated and instead turns into an almost documentary like observation of the events happening in the movie. It helps to give the movie its really realistic feeling.The strength of the movie is in how how incredible authentic it all looks and feels. It helps to make the movie make a big impact on you. The movie will probably glue you to the screen for at least its last, really impressive looking, final 30 minutes or so. Even despite its weaker more formulaic opening this movie as a whole knows to totally grab you and leave a really lasting and powerful impression. The camera always stays with the main character, which allows us to see the things as he sees them. I really liked this approach, since it made the movie feel really realistic and puts you right in the middle of everything. You really feel that you're a part of this movie while watching it. This works especially great toward the ending of the movie when the action begins and it really starts to feel like you're watching a war-documentary.The movie features many long shots that at times go on for minutes. This also works great for the movie its realism and it makes sure to grab you and put you right in the middle of things. It provides the movie with some great made and looking moments that are memorable, for sure.Also of course the visual style of the movie adds to the authentic feel of the movie. The Emmanuel Lubezki cinematography (Oscar nominated, in a great year for cinematography) is most excellent.The movie subtlety shows 'the future', so no flying cars or ray-guns in this movie. There are only small changes in the future and more subtle things such as the way we talk and society lives with its-, almost as if it has accepted, violence. I also like the way animals play a subtle role in this movie, which use can be interpreted in many different ways and some other small elements and references in the movie that have a deeper meaning in it.Yes, the future in this movie is dark, depressive and about a hopeless situation but the movie doesn't do anything to exaggerate it. Also again a reason why this movie feels so incredible realistic. I don't necessarily see ""Children of Men"" as a warning for the future but more as a persons vision of the future, if the world, environment and society goes on living and changing the way it does now. The movie thank goodness does not have a preachy undertone and it doesn't prominently tries to send out a message to its viewers.And is it me or is Clive Owen getting better with every movie? What I also love about this movie is that it has a couple of other A-list actors in in it (Julianne Moore, Michael Caine) but the movie isn't afraid to treat them like B-list actors.The movie perfectly incorporate its action into the movie. It shows that director Alfonso Cuarón is top of the game when it comes down to action. The movie has action in it many modern action movies would be jealous of but Cuarón knows to feature its action in an humble way, despite its large scale and complexity, to let the action serve in the service of the movie and its story.An absolute essential 2006 viewing and one of the year's best.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The essence of hope,"Thinking about the near future is not the best way to cheer yourself up nowadays, with depictions of social and political unrest, rampant drug use, and all of the other ""downers"" that add up to paint a bleak and dreary picture. Suddenly out of the darkness comes hope.Based on the science fiction novel by P.D. James, acclaimed director Alfonso Cuarón brings to the screen Children of Men. The story of how one man, one teenager, and one miracle can potentially bring hope to a world that is filled with fear, struggle, and war.The year is 2027. The world has been struck with a terrible phenomenon. Women across the globe cannot procreate. To add to the chaos, the world's youngest living person has just died at the age of 18. Hope is a thing of the past and panic has replaced it.A man who had hope once, Theodore Faron (Clive Owen), has just been reunited with her ex-wife Julian (Julianne Moore) but some rather drastic circumstances. He is made aware of a group of people called the Human Project whose main goal is to help better the quality of life and to somehow find a way to continue the world's population. All he is asked to do is to gain access across the isle with a girl so she can reach the Human Project.Skeptical at first, he decides to go along with it after realizing what is afoot. The girl, Kee, is pregnant. The first child in over 18 years is about to be born and only a handful of people know about it. Theodore must travel past mounting obstacles, past all of the lies and deception, and try and help this girl and her soon to be born baby to reach her destination.A very original plot for a much abused genre of film and literature. Of course, there are some aspects that are not too original like the government watching over everything and the military battling terrorists. Perhaps the most startling aspect of the story is the time in which it is taking place. There are no hover cars, no space cities, and no hologram projections. Much like Steven Spielberg's Minority Report, the world is very similar to today.Cuarón's direction is powerful and oozing with emotion. At times, the camera is a character in the film. It moves amongst the characters as if a person were there along side, ready to jump in at any moment and contribute to the action going on. The shots are carefully constructed to show not just the main characters but also the devastation that is surrounding them.Color in the film is practically missing. Clothes, buildings, environment, and people seem to blend in to this dreary and godforsaken world. A lot of earth tones and dull colors fill the screen, with the exception of those objects that are meant to be happy or important, like Jasper's home, and blood.One aspect of today's world that is very important in the film is human emotion and the power of trust and friendship. The bonds that these people have to create to keep this girl alive show true human strength. Kee must trust Theo with her life and that of her unborn child. Theo has just met this girl but is willing to do what it takes to ensure that this baby is delivered into the world without harm, not just for Kee, or even himself. He must do this in the hope that the world will wake up and end this suffering.What Cuarón has created is a perfect balance of emotions with an above average story. Children of Men is the kind of movie that sticks with you long after you leave the theatre or turn off the TV. Its power is felt not just during the film, but after, and therein lies its beauty.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Bleak yet thought-provoking,"This gem of a film might not burst the box office with the hallmarks of an autumn blockbuster but, like the excellent 'V for Vendetta', 'Children of Men' has to be seen for it is a film with a powerful storyline and hidden lessons that must be learnt. Based on the novel by PD James, whose forte is usually crime fiction, this film is set in the bleak 2027 when the planet is on the brink of social and economic collapse and worldwide infertility has meant no child has been born in eighteen years. Against the backdrop of a London divided by anarchy and a totalitarian government, jaded former peace activist Theo Faron is forced to set aside his disenchantment to help a pregnant girl named Kee across the country to deliver her to sanctuary.With a strong cast comprised of a variety of talented actors, 'Children of Men' never had to worry about delivering a good performance in that department. Clive Owen was perfectly cast as the disillusioned Theo, world-weary haunted by his past until his protective instincts are rekindled in Kee and her child. Pam Ferris and Michael Caine were excellent as always as Miriam and Jasper respectively, two likable characters who display quiet heroics and eliciting empathy from the audience for their determination and kind natures. And Claire-Hope Ashitey delivered a top performance as Kee, despite the fact she would have been barely eighteen when filming this and still so new to acting. If she had been dire in her role, this film probably would have failed but, thankfully, she proved she has acting talent in her ability to depict the determination, vulnerability and strength of her character.'Children of Men' is certainly a very chilling film that would leave even the most complacent worrying what the future holds for mankind. Watching scenes of a desolate England where refugees are herded up like cattle then transported to concentration camps as world away from the luxury enjoyed by the rich, where corpses of people and animals rot by road sides and bombings are the norm, the imagery is terrifying to the core because it could so easily happen if hope is ever lost. The film was successful in showing cruel governments can be as destructive as terrorists and the lines between justice and the unjust can blur if one forgets their convictions. There were a variety of nice touches that only strengthened the story of the film such as how pets had taken the place of children in people's lives, how heroes don't have to be gun-totting Steven Segals and the sound of an infant's cry can touch the soul of even the hardest of hearts, especially when it comes in a time where the sound of children's laughter had long fallen silent.It would have been interesting if the film had further touched upon exactly why females couldn't carry babies and reflected on how the world reacted at the time this realisation was starting to sink in. It would also have been nice to see how the rest of the UK had fared since England had obviously gone to pot, despite refugees from countries which had already crumbled seeking asylum there, and if Kee was really a sole miracle or were there other pregnant women out there offering the planet a second chance. That said, the film did not suffer an iota for not touching upon these issues.This is certainly a film for 'V for Vendetta' fans and for those who, every once in a while, like a film that leaves them pondering over the issues raised in the plot even after the end credits have rolled. 'Children of Men' is also a film that the leaders of the world should see because maybe mass infertility isn't a problem for the here and now but there are lessons to be learnt on how war, hopelessness and destruction can destroy us all.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A depressing sci-fi,"Children of Men is a dystopian sci-fi story which tells a story of future earth with elements of drama, thriller and emotions.The story was simple and a good execution made it feel heavy with the emotions. The screenplay was also good though at some portions the movie felt dragged but overall it was good. The direction was tight and the performances were also good.

One of the Most Important Films in Recent Years,"CHILDREN OF MEN is a masterpiece of cinematic artistry. Director Alfonso Cuarón, using a screenplay he co-wrote with Timothy J. Sexton, has done what few artists have been able to achieve before - create an apocalyptic experience that is almost devoid of extraneous material meant to terrify the audience and focused the worst of unthinkable events into a personal story about a few people. Oh, the global destruction and masses of dead humanity are not kept from our eyes, but instead Cuarón uses these horrid images as a background for a story about the changes than can occur in each of us when our souls and lives are challenged by extinction.The story is set in 2027 and the only country that has survived some unnamed disaster is England (importantly, the only country without a constitution, maintaining its governance on history). The landscape is bleak, twisted, filthy and holds scattered cages of fugitives (immigrants from the countries no longer in existence): it is difficult to decide which is better, being dead or living in this heinous mess of a wasted world. Society is on the brink of extinction as the people are infertile and the youngest living person has just died. We meet Theo Faron (Clive Owen), a drunken bored disillusioned detritus of a man whose early years were alive with political activism. He loathes his meaningless job and he is bitter and utterly disillusioned and emotionally numb. A group called 'Angels' is lead by Julian Taylor (Julianne Moore), Theo's former significant other with whom he had a child that died of influenza, and Luke (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and their work is the protection of immigrants as well as transporting a young black girl Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey) who happens to be pregnant(!) to a sea spot where Human Project will aid her in propagating a new society. Julian has Theo captured (he is the only man she can truly trust) to handle the safe transportation of Kee to the Human Project.Theo at first refuses to absorb this new direction but incidents occur which change his mind: he receives sound advice and encouragement from an old hippie friend Jasper (Michael Caine) and the trek begins. The bond between Kee and Theo is an increasingly strong one and as they follow directions that are in code they gradually discover the incentives of various people to follow the eventual birth of the first child to be born in eighteen years. The trip is harrowing, suspenseful, filled with psychological and philosophical implications, and the ending of this tale occurs in the foggy mists of the sea aboard a tiny boat - a place that has no roots.Clive Owen is mesmerizing in this tough role and his support from Moore, Caine, Ejiofor, Ashitey, as well as smaller roles played by such fine actors as Charlie Hunnam, Pam Ferris, Danny Huston, Peter Mullan, Oana Pellea and Jacek Koman to mention only a few is on the highest level. The cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki is miraculous, capturing a strange world that seems very real yet not absurdly over the edge. Classical composer John Tavener (with help from Mahler, Penderecki, and others) finds just the right balance between old folk songs, contemporary requiem moments and excerpts from popular music of the past to mold a fascinating musical score: it works! Some may avoid this film because of the apparent disturbing content, but for this viewer this film speaks so cogently to the matters we should all heed to help reverse some of the destruction we have done to our world that it would be hard to imagine this film not changing people's views on immigration as an example of how confused is our sense of humanity, and that is only one issue before us. CHILDREN OF MEN is an instant classic, whether we like it or not. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Surprisingly Flat Political Sci-Fi.,"After arriving on a wave of hype Children of Men had a lot to live up to. Unfortunately the result was a huge disappointment. Don't be fooled by the trailers like I was, don't expect high tension or a gripping sci-fi plot.The premise of a near future where human kind is facing extinction due to women becoming infertile (surely science could find a solution?)should be enough to craft a gripping drama. However the result is strangely flat and unmoving and lacking in tension. There is plenty to marvel at technically, from 10 minute+ tracking shots and chaotic street battles however throughout this I never felt the tension or terror that a post apocalyptic movie really should be able to evoke. This is not helped by the fact that many of the moments of 'comic relief' come during the most tense scenes.It seems young director Cuaron has perhaps taken on more than he can manage with this project. The screenplay seems to lack realism and focus, straying from the original gritty Sci-Fi setup to drama then to a thriller then to a pro immigration/unity message and never really hitting a nerve along the way. I had gone to see a Sci-Fi and ended up getting the director's (or author's) political views delivered in a confused vessel of a movie. Much of the story centred on a vision of a future Britain where immigrants are caged in the streets and then sent to Gantanamo style camps and the battle between the state and the immigrants and the freedom fighters instead of the idea of a world without children.The performances are OK on the whole, only Michael Caine is really 'on form' and Clive Owen is his usual moody self and struggles to carry the movie at times but does a decent job on the whole in a very difficult role with little material to work with.Overall Children of Men is a Sci-Fi drama that is low on the Sci-Fi and only just above average in the drama department. Most of the positives are in the marvellous technical achievements on show and a first quarter that delivered a horribly plausible future vision and a sombre atmosphere that unfortunately was not built upon. Falls short of expectations, if you are looking for a gripping vision of the future try the mini series 'The Last Train' which pulled off the terror and drama of a post apocalypse Britain with superior results.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Disappointing, but to each his own!","After seeing the trailer to the Children of men, I was at first excited to see this feature, it had looked interesting. During the months that passed, I got my hand on the Children of men novel, read it, and wasn't sure whether the movie would be good or bad. The book left me overtly disappointed.As I watched the movie, I felt, indifferent. I was not moved to tears by any of the scenes that were suppose to provide an emotional uplifting or an emotional downpour. Clive Owen although a good actor didn't really strike me as someone who I could be touched by. I did not feel a whole lot different.The movie, neither left me with any positive or anything negative. I think the positive image of hope is deplorable and it's completely cliché. Why did the girl suddenly have a child, they did not explain this and although the book itself was rather weak at the reasoning it was more or less better at trying to do so.Overall a disappointing feature and I think that the budget and the effort could have been channelled into providing something more than just entertainment, more than just an hour and a half of sitting waiting for something to happen.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Can't stop thinking about this movie,"This is not a movie that fits into the recent formula films we are seeing out of Hollywood. Nor is it the garbage that critics and award voters like but that no one can stand watching. (e.g. Babal) The less you know about this film before you see it the better. It is hard to describe; it is not a 'feel good' movie but it is a fantastic film and story. I actually found the film creepy and scary for a simple reason, it could easily happen. The film is NOT in the distant future, it does not have space ships, dinosaurs, dragons, aliens, ridiculous science, or anything remotely hard to believe. Like most good stories, especially sci-fi, the story is based on 'what if'. What if something happens, how would that something change other things? Now I loved ""Reign of Fire"" (also based in England), that movie is 'what if dragons are real and woke up'. Great movie but really, how likely is it that dragons live under London? The 'what if' in this movie is not only easy to believe it is more plausible than people would think. If you are a science type person this film will freak you out because it could so easily happen. Can't wait to see it again.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
where the world's headed,"If you thought that ""V for Vendetta"" offered a bleak look at the future, just wait until you see ""Children of Men"". It portrays England in 2027. A pandemic many years earlier has caused infertility ever since. England has become a totalitarian state seeking to eliminate all illegal immigrants, and whenever politicians are in trouble, there occurs what the government claims is a terrorist attack (but the government probably was behind them*). That's when loner Theo Faron (Clive Owen) gets kidnapped by anti-government group The Fishes, who just might have the key to the future.One of the movie's best aspects is the cinematography. There's a lot of hand-held long shots, creating a feeling of being there with the grim action. The dreary setting adds to this. As in ""VFV"", it becomes apparent that the revolutionaries might not be much different from the government which they oppose. But what's one to do in such a society? Especially one with the kind of immigration laws that would please only Tom Tancredo.Anyway, this is one movie that I definitely recommend. It seems that the world is headed in this direction. It's something that everyone should understand. Also starring Julianne Moore, Michael Caine and Chiwetel Ejiofor.*See also the Reichstag in Nazi Germany and the Kirov assassination in Stalin's USSR.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Exhilarating, visceral cinema.","It seems many critics are either getting hung up on searching for some kind of political meaning in Children of Men or endlessly theorising about the possible cause of the global sterility that is central to the plot; missing the point on both counts, in this reviewer's opinion, as both the political and science-fiction aspects of the movie are merely means' to an end - the end of crafting a breathtaking, human and incredibly visceral cinematic experience. If you'd like a sketched-out political message (let's face it - when it comes to politics, there's little room in any movie for more than a mere sketch) then, hey, the internet is your big, fat, rusty-coloured pearl vomiting oyster. Likewise, if you would like a dry and quasi-scientific or laughably mystical explanation of a highly improbable scenario that adds absolutely nothing to the story then, well, I believe The Outer Limits is available to purchase on DVD. If, however, you'd prefer a magnificently filmed, brilliantly acted and absurdly thrilling depiction of a society tearing itself to shreds in the face of the ultimate despair, and the fragile glimmer of hope struggling through the darkness at the centre, well, welcome to Children of Men.The movie plunges us into a society without children - a society, therefore, with no future, no hope. In the effort to keep some kind of order, the British government has resorted to ruthlessly hunting down and detaining all illegal immigrants/refugees. The country is riddled with terrorist factions, the most prominent of which being The Fishes, a radical group ostensibly fighting for immigrant rights. It is a country teetering on the brink of an abyss into which the rest of the world has already fallen. Amongst all of this, we follow Theo (Clive Owen); a man who, along with everyone else, has little left to look forward to. That is, until he gets involved in the increasingly desperate struggle to protect a miraculously pregnant young girl who just might hold the key to mankind's survival...It's a plot of very grandiose proportions, to be sure, but Cuaron does the sensible thing and keeps it tight on Theo; throughout the movie we never really leave his side. It's a part Owen pulls off with aplomb, a performance of wearied charm with glimpsed moments of emotional turmoil seeping through the cracks. The support cast is uniformly excellent, too, particularly Claire-Hope Ashitey as the rather-too-symbolically-named Kee.What really makes Children Of Men, though, is the dazzling technical brilliance of the film-making. The two central action pieces, filmed in extended, continuous hand-held takes, mark a triumph of carefully planned, visceral cinema over effects-laden bombast. The near-final sequence, in particular, set inside the explosive battleground of a disintegrating refugee camp, really has to be seen to believed. Reportedly a nightmare to shoot, it's worth any and all effort expended and ranks among the finest achievements in cinematic history.This is not to say that this is a movie without any flaws - in the first half, certainly, there are a few moments of rather clumsy plot exposition and, as mentioned above, some of the symbolism is a little too on-the-nose. However, these are largely minimal complaints when faced with a film as arresting and exhilarating as this. Children of Men is a brilliant study of humanity on the brink, of a society gripped by fear and despair, turning on itself, and of a man at the centre struggling to salvage some kind of hope. It is an action movie, sure, but one with a deep understanding of human weakness at its centre. Despite what some might say, it doesn't attempt to preach any kind of message, contenting itself with an investigation of our deepest fears. Some might argue that it is undeserving of an Oscar as it presents no significant political or moral message; this reviewer would argue that that is precisely why it should get one.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"When you see Michael Cain, Clive Owen and Julian Moore, you have to go see it..but..","Though this movie was very promising with a great cast including Michael Caine and of course the very handsome Clive Owen, turned out to be some kind of boring, the scenario was very '' out there ''.Why they went to all this trouble hiding the pregnant woman when at the end the same woman was the one that saved all of them when even the army has ''softened''.The directors didn't got the time for explaining to us the basics, exactly what caused the infertility and why was a war going on. Maybe if you pay attention you would find out at the end. It short of reminded me of another boring movie '' Sighs'' with Mel Gibson, where the arrival and the departure of the aliens were narrated by the actors and there was no action what so ever. I can say surely that the films had also some good features, there was action, great acting,warm leading roles, imagination, and humanity!",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Predictable, Unbelievable, Poor Production Choices.","From the start of the movie there was not much plot and what there was, was predictable and unbelievable. With a production budget of $76 million you think they could afford a steady cam. The jumpy camera shots started to make my head hurt about half way through the film. Clive Owen, Julianne Moore, and Michael Caine give solid performances though. The film in nothing more than propaganda. Very poorly presented propaganda at that. I felt no compassion for any of the main characters and therefore couldn't bring myself to feel anything for them. I found nothing new or unique in the film or it's message that hadn't already been presented in a better fashion elsewhere.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Disappointing,"I have to say that I was very disappointed in this film, though I had very high expectations. Clive Owen just doesn't do it in this one, It all just seems so phony, fake and sometimes even ridiculous. I just think this one tried a little too hard to be futuristic, but just didn't quite do it. It began really great, but it wasn't good enough to engage me for so long. However, there are a few good performances: Julianne Moore does a great job, so does legend Michael Caine, and they are really helping to raise the level of the film. I know it must be very hard to make a film that takes place in the future, but hey, War of the Worlds did it! Well, anyway, if you don't have anything better to do, you could see it.

Less than meets the eye,"I haven't read the other comments, so I apologize if others brought this up.The visual repleteness of Children of Men exceeds the viewer's capacity to take it in. I understand that most good films require more than one viewing. Still, any good film must entertain, and it's hard to be entertained by something visually so rapid and complex that you're constantly distracted from the characters and dialog. A movie is not a painting.I also had a lot of trouble understanding dialog, because of rapid speech, accents, occasionally slang, background noises, and occasional mumbles. Again, to some extent this is just current film idiom that we're all used to--movies are supposed to confuse us likereal life. But it does not add to my enjoyment to be constantly worrying whether I'm following the story correctly because I know I'm missing maybe 20% of what is said,Fortunately, however, Children of Men has an extremely simple plot, characters that don't develop, and a handful of very basic ideas, so in spite of the visual and auditory challenges, you do get the gist. My problem is that a movie has to have more than a gist, and this one doesn't.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Wow. Just Wow.,"'Children of Men' can be described as a speculative fiction thriller set in the UK 20 years in the future.I was really blown away by this movie. I wasn't quite expecting it and went into it knowing extremely little about it which is probably how it actually should be viewed. I picked up right away on the technical reasons for its specialness which I won't go into in order not to spoil anything about it. But I will say that it is perhaps the most uncompromising, haunting and compelling vision of the future I may have ever seen and that it is very rich with a lot of heavy details, many of which could have been the whole subject of a whole lesser movie in itself. I read the synopsis of the plot on Wikipedia to better understand it and I literally had to stop for a few minutes after reading each sentence and let what they were saying sink in, in light of what I had seen. It is quite often extremely intense almost to the point of making you want to look away from the screen, but they do not achieve this intensity really in any of the traditional Hollywood ways. I'd have to see it again, but I don't even think they used any music during those sequences. It has a very raw feel to it and yet is very sophisticated at the same time, but it is not totally relentless either. The makers of the movie were very clever in how they marketed it. It has been a very successful movie at least in the U.S. without really any commercial hype behind it, relying almost totally on word of mouth and it very much deserves that success. It makes V for Vendetta look like a Saturday morning cartoon. The violence in it is very very realistic and grim and disturbing, as in fact violence should be! It's not glorified or gratuitous in any way. This is not a movie to see if you don't like movies that give you a lot to think about. Quite frequently while watching it, I had to remind myself again and again that I was just watching a movie that somebody had produced. That says a lot to me because I tend to be pretty jaded and cynical when it comes to movies, I've seen so many of the moves they can make. But I got the impression that effect was a pretty typical reaction to it. No doubt one of the best movies, if not the best movie, to come out in 2006, it will give me a lot to remember and ponder about for a long time to come.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Love it or hate it, just don't miss it.","Children of Men is the sort of film that elicits strong opinions, both positive and negative. Cuaron hurls his audience into an alternate world with minimal exposition and expects us to figure out what's happening on our own. The science-fictional plot device is absurd and no effort is made to provide a scientific explanation. The narrative is propelled by unlikely developments and the occasional deus ex machina. The dystopian future of 2027 bears an unfortunate resemblance to the worst neighborhoods of our own era, and those hoping for stylish futuristic sets (a la Blade Runner) will be disappointed.But those who are drawn into Cuaron's world will be mesmerized. There is a vitality and immediacy to the cinematography and directing that has been all too rare in recent years. In the final 30 minutes of the film, viewers are dragged into the hell of a third world refugee camp and forced to experience the chaos and confusion of being innocent bystanders on a battlefield, with no guide book or interpreter. The emotional reaction is powerful and genuine, not coaxed out of us with fluttering flags and orchestral accompaniment. Despite being marketed as science fiction, the power of the movie comes from its extreme realism.This is a film that takes itself seriously, but to me it was not the least bit stuffy or ""pretentious."" The action is intense and often fast-paced, and the characters do not deliver grandiose monologues. The depth of this film lies in its truths that are unspoken, and in its attention to detail. It can be seen in the way the characters grieve for a celebrity death rather than the routine tragedy of a street bombing. It can be glimpsed through a bus window in a refugee camp. It is ultimately driven home in an allusion to the World War 1 Christmas cease-fire, one of the most bizarre, yet illuminating moments in human history. This is not a ""message movie,"" but there is more than one message here if you choose to look for it.There are many valid criticisms that can be made of Children of Men, but I strongly reject the claim that this is a work of political propaganda. The political message is powerful precisely because it is NOT propaganda. This film offers us no ideological heroes or easy answers. It simply takes the extremes of poverty, war, and hopelessness in our own world, and eliminates the distance between us and them. Cuaron isn't giving us a solution, but he's forcing us to confront the issues.If you ask me, this is the most powerful and gripping movie I have seen in years. Your mileage may vary.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The more I thought about it the more I loved Children of Men,"The more I thought about ""Children of Men"" the more I loved it. The DVD discussion by the director and others certainly helped to get a clearer understanding of the director's intent. It is a supremely Orwellian film, bleak and violent, which had much to say about the nature of man and culture. It is a film that begs for discussion. The somewhat simple story of the film cannot be divorced from the complexity of its landscape. Each would be nothing without the other and special attention should be paid to the movie's setting.The movie takes place in the not-too-distant future making technological chaos a part of its surroundings. It centers on the world's inability to generate children, its lack of ability to understand why and the consequences this has for the disintegration of population, culture, history and life itself. The bleak surroundings of decay are omnipresent. It is testament, I think, to what happens when constant war and anarchy prevail. Society deconstructs. In society's vain attempt to perpetuate and sustain itself through repressive force it does neither. Stability is always elusive. One social and political philosophy is like another and the only thing left for the state to do is to perpetuate its media driven lies in some withering attempt to maintain order through tyranny. No one has the answer even though some think they do. The less powerful, of course, succumb to the Darwinian forces of nature. It is dinosaurian. If one force doesn't kill there is always another right around the corner which will. There is no rhyme or reason to it all. Humanity is prostrate before forces no one can control and man is at the mercy of other men and fate itself.This movie poses many interrogatives. What happens to human society when biological and/or socially catastrophic events interfere with the natural orderly progression of life? How do humans adapt and survive or can they adapt at all? What happens when chaos reigns and people are in a constant state of war and anarchy? If social conflict is perpetual are human beings inclined toward constructing a totalitarian state? Who suffers and why? Is utopia a possibility ... ever? Is there hope? This film, I thought, was phenomenally relevant to the world in which we find ourselves. Perhaps, it is a film for all seasons as well. It could apply to Nazi Germany to Bosnia, to Lebanon, Darfur and most certainly to Iraq or, indeed, to any place which is prey to biological and other catastrophic events which give rise to chaos. The author perceptively places this film in Britain. I think this says it could apply to western culture as well IF we do not stop those forces which are brewing a perfect storm of biological catastrophe and social fracture. The very survival of life as we know it on our planet is at stake.This film, although it is quite starkly bleak, does offer some hope through the only woman in the world who is pregnant. Amid this primordial social ooze and against all odds she attempts, with the help of one man, to save her infant's life. One must be patient and wait to see if there is an ultimate ray of light at the end of the tunnel.

Bloody ace!,"I can't recommend this film more, it's probably the best film I've seen all year! It's one of the best sci-fi films ever made. There aren't any flaws at all. The acting is brilliant; Clive Owen gives what I think is his best performance, Michael Caine gives his funniest and most emotional, Chiwetel Ejiofor is amazing as always and Charlie Hunnam does that thing he did in Cold Mountain (but with a Geordie accent) and manages to scare the sh*t out of you. There are some genuine shocks in store. Thanks to Alfonso Cuaran's fantastic naturalistic camera-work, who should be nominated for an Oscar for this (but won't be), the violence becomes more brutal, the acting more powerful and the shocks are so realistic that you frequently feel as though you're watching real footage. Scenes such as the drive through the forest look so real that they are excruciatingly tense and absolutely terrifying to watch.Really, the thing I wanted to address about the film is THAT tracking shot. Totalling something ridiculous like seven minutes long, it is the best scene I have ever seen. It would be really good anyway because of the genius action scene going on. But considering it is a seven minute long uninterrupted tracking shot, it is so much more. So much happens in it, it must have been almost impossible to choreograph. Yet somehow, it looks so natural and fluid, it's almost like it wasn't practised prior to shooting it. I would pay the ticket price just for that scene. Well not really. Five pounds off peak to see a film? Bit steep.In conclusion, go see Children Of Men right now. It is one of the best films I've ever seen and I can't recommend it enough.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
pocket  full of clichés,"I watched this movie due to the great rating it got on IMDb, but alas, I was sadly let down....In a world of predictable circumstances( except for the infertility thing, that was actually creative) where illegal immigrants are a big problem, and where a suicide product is being sold to the public; Theo, the main character, gets thrown into the fisher gang to help a girl get out of the country. At parts, I thought that it was a great movie, but it seemed to me that it only picked up, not really in action wise, towards the end of the movie. The characters were shallow, and most of the dialogue was contrived to a point that seemed inorganic. During the movie, it looked like the story would start and stop, lagging in the forgettable parts and picking up in parts that finally portrayed a humanistic appeal. Also, the background music was mainly opera music, that, to me, gave every scene with that music in it, a cheesy feel to it.

An exciting pump of dystopia fiction.,"A 40-something man named Theo Faron(Clive Owen) is standing inside a coffee shop with a group of people, watching the news of the death of Baby Diego Ricardo, the youngest person in the world. He is 18 years, 6 Months, 28 days, 4 hours and 8 minutes old. Theo ignores the news, takes his coffee and exits the coffeshop. Here, we see London, a gloomy, dark & depressing London. Suddenly, ""BOOM!"" The coffee shop explodes by a terrorist act.Welcome to London 2027 AD. Welcome to Children of Men. Here, humans are infertile. No one can give babies anymore. Thanks to global infertility, mankind has lost all hope for the future, because they are unable to inherit their wealth, ideals and goals to future generations since there aren't any.It's been 18 years since no woman on Earth is able to give birth. Instead of having humans facing extinction like Fidel Castro dying peacefully because of a disease, mankind implodes and fast forward their extinction by causing nuclear wars in Africa, creating nuclear terrorism in New York, Tokyo & Shanghai, making our capital Kuala Lumpur looking like LA in 1992, and more devastation you could think of. The result? Waves of refugees from all over the world moved to the UK. However, since UK has become a totalitarian state, they've created isolationist and anti-refugee policies that has deported them from UK cities and sent them to concentration camps like what we've saw in Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo Bay and Auschwitz.As the story progressed, we see Theo being taken hostage by a terrorist group named The Fishes. Led by Theo's ex wife Julian(Julianne Moore), The Fishes wanted Theo to escort an African 'Fugee' named Kee(Claire Hope-Ashitey) out of the UK and straight to a NGO named ""The Human Project"" which aims to end infertility and restore procreation in humans. But why Kee? Because Kee holds a secret that no one knew: She's pregnant. And what's so special about that? Well, here's the fact: She's the first woman to get pregnant after 18 years of infertility. Now you dig?Some futuristic films like Blade Runner and The Matrix includes those cool-cyberpunk technology like flying cars, space travel and all that techno-babble, but this film? Not really. Not to say that this film doesn't have any futuristic design. It does. Some of it includes plasma-televisions, digital billboards, and cars where it has HUDs on the car's mirror. But, it still feels like London in our time, because the director Alfonso Cuaron(of Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban fame) says:""The future n the film is still the same as our present London despite it's digi-billboards and plasma-TVs. That's because that since women became infertile, humans lose hope for the future and since 2016, technology stopped"".What I loved, so very much, is how Cuarón gives lavish attention to the details of this post-apocalyptic world. Instead of trite character exposition or  God forbid  a huge opening text scroll spelling things out for us, details are what tells us of the larger story outside of Kee's flight. Newspaper clippings, headlines on billboards, TV commercials, animal carcasses on fire, little baby trinkets on people's desks these all tell their own story without those pesky spoken words.It even feels more real than a typical movie, although it doesn't quite launch into reality/documentary style. I particularly loved a moment when Theo is in the woods and the camera pans up to the incredibly tall treetops while the evening gust of wind filled the speakers. It's hard to explain, but few movies bother to connect with us in how we see the world ourselves, and the somewhat-silent moment of majesty in the woods is something I've loved in my life (Cuarón also gave some attention to the trees in HPPOA, if I recall). The violence, when it comes, is shocking and full of immediate danger  this isn't the showy gunfire of most action flicks, but the scary kind that we see on the evening news. Yet even in a dark setting, there's still a bevy of humor and bright touches to make us laugh and smile, and the ultimate tale of hope is one to root forChildren of Men is good if not, a great movie, and I felt the same tingling of excitement that I felt when I saw Star Wars or V for Vendetta for the first time.

Intense,"I wouldn't say this is the best movie I've ever seen, but it's close--I'd rate it 10 except for a few nit-picky plot points--and it is without a doubt the most intense. (Schindler's List is the only one I can recall that's even in the same league for intensity.) The director did a brilliant job of fusing action and meaning, so that the film was mesmerizingly exciting but also very rich and moving. Apocalyptic scenarios are a dime a dozen in films, but this one really worked for me, I think, because of the way it very graphically showed the toxic effects of hopelessness... something that is extremely relevant these days. It was incredibly poignant and utterly convincing at the end of the film to see the awesome power of returning hope, at the sight of something as simple as a baby. Brilliant.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A diligent perspective on humanity and infertility,"As a sci-fi film it's seminal to the genre, as a reflection on post 9/11 and political propaganda it couldn't be anymore relevant. Alfonso Cuaron's vision of the future is a bleak and intimidating one. Rarely have I seen a film represent an issue in the same context as children of men has, it's a bold and intelligent narrative that depicts it's dystopia with hatred, betrayal and hope. Clive Owen's Theo is at first sight a rather unlikeable character whose main priority seems to be bureaucratic conformity, however as his journey unfolds he abolishes his pragmatic facade and inevitably renders a moxie of vulnerability and compassion. The rest of the cast are wonderful from Michael Caine's eccentric and idealist hippie to Claire Hope Ashitey's fear induced Kee. Children of men erects it's subject matter in a graphic tone, one that may be difficult for the mainstream viewer to accept let alone comprehend. The viewers political and social preference notwithstanding you would either have to be naive or sheerly ignorant to be confused by the moral argument and message that lies within this contemporary masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Fantastic visuals, excellent story, it has a sense of realism.","This story had some striking visual scenes that remained in my mind for hours after the movie was over. I thought the plot was excellent, and that is realistically showed how people behave in very unnatural setting. This movie had some very deep and emotional moments. It seems to me that a lot of reviewers are focusing on some parts of the movie to really nit- pick, this isn't an action film, this movies point it to convey an overall feeling of being in a time and place and that is what it does very well. You can see tiny little details all over the set and references placed throughout the film that instead of being vague and confusing are enlightening or at the very least add an intensity I haven't seen in a long time. One of the few movies that made me want to cry at one point. Definitely one of the better movies so far in the 21st century. If I had a child I would want to take them to this movie. One thing I loved about this movie was that it didn't try to explain what happened like often happens in sci-fi movies, this is very plot driven, they just show you the landscape and tell you the situation and move on. I also liked that on the extremes of either side of the political landscape in this movie they where more or less the same, just on side had power and the other none. I thought that was very true about most of life, with the people in the middle just kinda caught up in it all. I highly recommend this as a beautiful piece of film, go see it with a friend or spouse or family member, even alone if you have to.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The most overlooked movie of the year,"What can I say about ""Children of Men"" to make more people go see it? How about that it's one of the best films I have ever seen in the theater.It's one of the greatest films I've ever SEEN.This is one of the few films I would give a perfect 10 for. Alfonso Cuaron, from the first scene of the movie, crafts a beautiful and all too possible future world.There are almost too many things to list that make up why this movie is so good, but I will try: The story is excellently told. The characters have unique and individual voices. From the very beginning of the film, I was completely absorbed in finding out about what was going in society of the world. The movie is cold, dark, and depressing and scarily realistic. The conflict between the native British and the so-called ""fugees,"" or refugees mirrors the immigration rumbles in the US right now perfectly.Maybe that is why I love ""Children of Men"" so much. It was in the future, and yet it was a film that, for me, challenged a lot of modern day politics.It is also one the film that made me realize something my dad had always told me. My dad always told me that the greatest films were told by pictures or images, and this is a film that certainly does it.""Children of Men"" is a film that I know I will look back on 10, 20, 30, even 40 years from now as a truly great film.To close, I think it's a crime that this movie was not nominated for either Best Picture or Best Director--and I don't think I'm alone.

"A Bleak View Of TheFuture, But A Stunning View None-The-Less","The first thing a lot of fans of this film (or the novel it was based on) will be to draw comparisons between the two. However, the film is extremely different from the novel. If you are picking up the book after seeing the film or heading to the theater expecting a revival of the book, DON'T. Look at them as separate stories from the same world of the author. They aren't comparable.That being said, after taking in both the movie and the book, I enjoyed the film much more. I watched the film with amazement and awe throughout. (The incredible cinematography and direction were stunning and should be at the top of the list for this year's, if not this decade's best) Clive Owen seemed born to play the part of Theo and Micheal Caine delivers an uncanny performance of.... well, Caine. (But it works amazingly well) The only actor that I questioned was Julianne Moore, not for her acting, but for the roll. Julian seems better played by a lesser-known. But she does a great job.The most outstanding thing in this film is the utter realism it achieves through extended shots that seem to run forever, but never lose excitement. I don't have to tell anyone the two most spectacular shots in the film that use this. If you've seen it, you know. If you haven't, you will. Simply amazing! (They've sparked some interesting discussions for the fans, just take a look in the IMDb Forums) The tale of post-apocalyptic London and the dismal future of the world is nothing new. But the depiction of the ""near-future"" in C.o.M. is so subtle and organic, it comes across surrealistically.... real. It allows the viewer to look past the time and focus on the story. (We've all seen enough films that show us the bright and shiny, flashy as Epcot Center, FUTURE) It's nice to see this done so well while still being interesting and fresh.Bottom-line, this film has heart. In a gritty war-torn scene of violence, to see the hearts of men and women so touched by the sight of a child made me tear up in the theater. (Just don't tell anyone) In the end, for all it's action and excitement, this film is about the heart of humanity. If not the survival of it.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Saving Private Foetus,"This film is set in England in the year 2027, when the human species has become infertile. There are no, or few children, and no one yet of child bearing age. The world in general has collapsed, tho it is not made clear to us if this is directly related to the infertility problem. There is an underground resistance movement which has found a pregnant girl and is trying to get her to a safe haven. That's the general gist of it.Acting? Superb. Cinematography? Astounding. Dialog? Mostly great, with a few clunkers here and there. Action? Lots of it, and Spielbergian in its quality and realism.The problem is, this is a film with no message, no insight or meaning, other than the moronic way we manage to deal with our ever more stellar technology, and the violent way we solve our problems. It mostly plays the emotion card, and people who are satisfied with that will love the film. People who love action that's well done, will love this film. Unfortunately, there's nothing else here. It's a magnificently executed depiction of destruction, violence, and despair.A lot of people are calling this film thought provoking.

ladies and gentleman - the cinema does have hope!,"I didn't really expect a masterpiece as a friend of mine and I were disappointed by all the choices of movies that were playing that night. But one of my unreliable friends told me this movie was incredible and for once, he was very much correct. The cinema has hope.You watch the first scene as everyone is crowded around watching T.V and then Clive Owen appears in the picture as the camera follows him around after he leaves the store to get his coffee. You think nothing of it then all the sudden something huge happens and from right there to the very end, I was hooked on the story from its complete originality and incredible directing.There are more than one scenes that the camera keeps on Clive Owen for more than a minute as quick edits and camera angle changes were not common in this masterpiece. There are scenes itself that already completed my thought as the best directed film of the year even (in my opinion) beating out Scorsee in The Departed (also a brilliant film). I really loved this movie as you notice glitches such as blood gets on the camera lens by mistake that could have been edited out but was kept there to give it more character. I also was intrigued by how random people would risk their lives to help Clive Owen's and Claire-Hope Ashitey's character as they took the dangerous journey to save the baby. No one is safe.Finally something so original comes out of the theater this year. Thank you.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Daring vision from Cuarón,"The world has collapsed when nobody is able to conceive any more children. It's 2027 in a dystopian London where they still try to maintain civilization in a crumbling infrastructure despite the terrorism of rebel group The Fishes. Theo Faron (Clive Owen) is drawn into intrigue when Fishes kidnaps him. Only it's his ex-wife Julian (Julianne Moore) that executed the capture. She asks for his help with someone truly special.Director Alfonso Cuarón has adapted an imaginative sci-fi premise with his personal vision of a dark apocalyptic future. The plot is dense with dreadful energy. Through it all, Clive Owen is able to maintain his persona of the everyman. He maintains believability in this semi-realistic future. There are long stretches of moody grumpy scenes of tired people. The police state can get quite dark. When the action does come, it gets very intense and very real with some very long takes of intricate action. The final scenes are as profound as anything ever on film.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A classic dystopian text!,"I would have to argue that Children of Men is great, if you like good old fashioned dystopian narratives. Children of Men is a typical dystopian film in that it is an exercise in a politically charged form of hybrid textuality. The vast majority of dystopian texts, including Children of Men, often offer detailed and pessimistic presentations of the very worst of social alternatives. The social alternative in Children of Men is the future  a future in which it is no longer possible to have children, reproduce or start a family. In enabling us to experience this alternative, Children of Men examines how certain contemporary issues and planetary governments could facilitate a social order that is relentlessly harsh, destructive, and miserable. A crucial factor of this vision is the films ability to register the impact of an unexamined social system on the everyday lives of everyday people which is, of course, set against the English backdrop of 2027. However, although this film creates a dystopian society of unseen quantities it interestingly depicts speculative forms of history that purport to describe a set of future developments traceable to present conditions. Examples of this lie in the treatment of the prisoners (Abu Ghraib), crooked authority figures and the manner in which illegal immigrants are treated as a whole is also a current issue in today's society. Yet here it is taken further, as so often the future can, to a nightmare world in which all traces of human rights are disregarded. Children of Men manages to execute this vision superbly as it allows us to feel that pain, the woe and dismay of the characters as they embark upon a journey of hope.Children of Men is ultimately about a journey, a journey of hope a hope of trying to escape a dystopian nightmare with the reward at the end of this journey being a utopian dream. To aid the telling of this story Cuaron utilises some fantastic camera techniques - the pick of the bunch being the scene inside the car. I must admit I am an extreme fan of long takes and Children of Men is by far the best I've witnessed in recent times. The use of such long takes in Children of Men help to facilitate a sense of real time (almost documentary in comparison) which in turn gives an implication of reality. It also aids in increasing the characters appeal whether it be negative or positive as we continuously become witness to many uninterrupted sequences of events. In employing such long takes Children of Men also manages to bring about notions of rolling news coverage that is reminiscent of footage that could only ever be acquired in the Reuters library. It is not just the camera-work that portrays this; the explosions are also brilliant and hark back to the stunts and pyrotechnics used in Saving Private Ryan. The sound is also fantastic, a great example of this being the early morning farmyard scene - a scene in the film in which the characters must try to remain silent. I would thoroughly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys good film-making, pictures from this genre and fine story-telling as they will not be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Great Dystopian Vision of the Future,"By 2009, the world has become infertile. Is it pollution? Nuclear fallout? The hand of God? No one knows, but as of 2027 no child has been born and the world is falling into disarray. This movie follows one man (Theo) on his journey with Kee, a woman who may be the hope for the world's future. Will humans be born again or is this the slow end? This film is so full of social commentary, but it's done in an artistic and powerful way. Maybe not a subtle way, as they prominently feature Homeland Security, immigration crackdowns and even a man with a hood over his head forced to stand with electrodes on his hands (a now iconic image of Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq). How does the government handle crises and crack down on dissidence? Maybe not to this extreme in real life, but then again some would say this is where we're headed.Clive Owen is amazing as the everyman (albeit more a hero than most would be). Michael Caine is also good, though I think he tried too hard to be John Lennon. The character of Kee is most fascinating, and people have pointed out how her name sounds like ""key"" (the key to the future of humanity) and ""chi"" (an Asian word meaning, basically, ""life force""). I have to assume this was intentional, just as Theo's name must be (meaning ""god""). What's surprising to me is how well they kept the religious aspects minimized. While they are important to the plot, they're always in the background. Compare this to ""The Mist"" where religious fanaticism takes center stage and become obnoxious (and it's not long before an obnoxious character makes a film itself obnoxious).Dystopian films tend to be well-made, and this is no exception. The director took great pains to get long shots filmed (some going over six minutes straight) and the use of the hand-held really added to the feeling of being embedded in a world of war and violence. Do not pass up on this one. If you only have time to see it once, make sure you see it once. But you may end up wanting to own it for repeated viewings.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Take Note Filmmakers, Cuaron's ""Children of Men"" is the Best Film Made in Recent History","Read This and Other Reviews at TheExpeditioner.com There are certain films whose story will be pored over, ruminated, discussed and wildly interpreted to the point of frustration. ""Children of Men,"" Alfonso Cuaron's fourth English-language film, is not and should not be one. Instead, it is a pre-apocalyptic work of art whose genius derives not from the somewhat illogical plot line but from its masterful use of vivid imagery and cinematography of the highest caliber, leaving the audience enthralled and in a state of disbelief throughout the entire film.""Children of Men,"" (a quotation from the bible: ""Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!"") is essentially a nativity story based in a decaying not-too-distant future where women have become infertile and England has become an inhospitable haven for outlawed immigrants whose influx has led the British government to outlaw them entirely. Amidst this chaos the archetypal hero (aimless, emotionally defunct, melancholic) Theodore (Clive Owen) is recruited to accompany a pregnant refugee (Claire-Hope Ashitey) to safety out of warring Britain and into the hands of a group named The Human Project, located offshore in the Azores. Why exactly she can't stay and have the baby (fear that the government won't allow it because she's an immigrant or fear that rebel groups will use her as propaganda are two somewhat implausible reasons suggested) or what The Human Project actually does (a Mediterranean Manhattan Project plotting to begin civilization over again) are two of the more glaring questions that need to be quickly discarded to truly enjoy this film.Cuaron explained in a recent interview that he was not so much interested in addressing these questions as he was in exploring the metaphors presented by a civilization unable to procreate and the hopes that one child could bring to a hopeless people. But what he fails to mention is that he is very intent on creating a cinematic experience that has never been felt before; one that is created not by the story but by the monumental work behind the camera.Never before have I seen special effects so effectively used than in Children of Men; exemplified by their almost invisibility (take note George Lucas - on second thought, please stop making movies). Whereas the standard vision of the future in film has been unfamiliar (Blade Runner, Mad Max, maybe even Waterworld), here the future is a mere twenty years off and the world is eerily similar, save for the minor technological advances such as digital billboards displayed on building facades and slightly more ergonomic cars. Filmed throughout with a bluish/grey hue, the world appears significantly more rundown but quite recognizable, as would be the case in this fictional social state, and the familiar London sites are seamlessly transformed digitally into pseudo-military checkpoints and public holding cells. Other poignant images inserted surreptitiously include scenes of caged foreigners ready for transport, an Abu-Ghraib inspired prison -- complete with attack dogs, disrobed and masked prisoners -- and a not-so-subtle visual allusion to Pink Floyd's classic album cover, ""Animals,"" with an accompanying flying pig.Even more impressive is the way that Cuaron utilizes digital effects to give the allusion that the film has been shot in a series of long tracking shots, some of which run as long as nine minutes. Most impressive of these is during the film's climax where the hand-held camera seemingly follows the action of Theo from outside a war torn building, up several flights of stairs, through a gun battle and back down outside amidst scores of extras fighting, yelling and cowering from gunshots - a shot so complex and physically impossible it is a wonder that at the time I didn't realize it was not truly a single take. What Cuaron achieves through this digital trick-of-hand (the scenes are actually several different shots digitally connected to appear as a single take) is to transport the audience directly into the midst of the action, sometimes in the first-person view, creating an exhilaratingly involving experience that has been lost with the contemporary trend of quick inserts and rapid-fire editing.The real accomplishment is that through the use of these techniques and despite the otherwise distracting plot holes, ""Children of Men"" transports the audience so entirely and convincingly into this rugged, bleak future that the simple act of childbirth creates an immense emotional impact. The result is that by the end the audience is left completely exhausted and mentally drained by the travails that Theo has gone through to deliver this small glimmer of hope into an otherwise hopeless world.As a I rode home after the film I heard a post 9/11 recorded announcement on the subway alerting passengers to be aware of suspicious packages or people; an alert not unlike the ones played throughout the film warning Londoners of the danger of foreigners. A striking similarity between a world so different from the recent past and a world portrayed so close in the future -- a similarity not lost at all on the makers of ""Children of Men.""",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
falls short of greatness due to its formulaic nature,"One of these days, some innovative filmmaker is going to make a movie set in a future where the skies are crystalline blue, governments treat their citizens with decency and respect, and people live in relative harmony with both technology and one another. But until that time we have ""Children of Men,"" yet another dystopian vision of what life might be like in the not-too-distant future - and, as usual, it ain't a pretty picture.Based on a novel by P.D. James, ""Children of Men"" takes place in the year 2027, a time in which the world has been thrown into chaos by war and disease, and the entire human race has been infertile for 18 years. Only Merry Olde England has, for some reason, been able to escape the generalized destruction (though not the infertility). In a bid to protect the nation from hostile outside elements, the government has begun to round up all its illegal aliens, locking them into cages and deporting them off the island (when it isn't slaughtering them outright).The overrated Clive Owens plays a Ministry of Energy bureaucrat who, much against his will, finds himself caught up in a plot to transport a young pregnant woman - the world's first since 2009 - to a place of safety so she can hopefully help to restart the otherwise doomed human race (although one wonders how a single child in the world will effectuate that outcome).""Children of Men"" has much to recommend it. It has a strong sense of time and place, with a look that is just right for its subject matter. Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki has drained most of the color out of the picture, and director Alfonso Cuaron has filmed the scenes with a great deal of immediacy and excitement. Cuaron certainly knows how to gin up the suspense and to make us feel like participants in the action.But the film is less successful at exploring the profound implications of its theme. James has come up with an unusually intriguing premise - just what would life be like if we knew our species was going to be extinct in less than a hundred years - but the film doesn't do anything all that interesting with it. Instead, the movie turns into a surprisingly conventional ""chase"" movie, with characters running for their lives from hostile parties amid a ceaseless hail of explosions and bullets. Just why is it that dystopian dramas - from ""Fahrenheit 451"" to ""Logan's Run"" to ""The Island"" to ""Minority Report"" to ""The Imposter"" to ""Paycheck,"" to name just a handful - all feel the need to adhere to this tired narrative formula? Every so often, the film zeroes in on its theme, yielding, by far and away, its most effective moments: people sobbing uncontrollably as they watch a news story relating the sudden death of the world's youngest person; an art collector amassing many of the world's greatest sculptures and paintings even though he knows that in less that a hundred years there will be nobody left to appreciate them; a former midwife, sitting in an abandoned schoolroom, recounting with soul-wrenching sadness the day she realized children would no longer be gracing the world with their presence; combatants momentarily stopping their gunfire to stare awestricken at a newborn babe. We yearn for more of these psychologically astute and insightful moments, but, alas, this is not to be, as Cuaron and his team of writers pour on the action scenes pretty much at the expense of everything else.Owens, Michael Caine (in the annoyingly stereotypical role of an aging eccentric hippie) and Julianne Moore are the ""name"" players in the cast, but the most powerful performances come from Claire-Hope Ashitey as the pregnant woman and Pam Ferris as the person assigned to be her midwife.""Children of Men"" is a good film that could have been a great one were it not redolent of so many likeminded movies that have come before it.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A very poignant warning,"...to stop seeing movies that critics like. I had the unfortunate experience of viewing this ""film"" one evening. A friend was in from out of town so my family decided we'd buy a movie for the evening's entertainment. I was instructed to buy this critically acclaimed movie that had just come out titled, Children of Men. I remembered the previews, such an interesting premise. Why was humanity no longer bearing children? What sort of message would the film put across? Clive Owen was supposed to have been lucky to miss out on playing Bond for this role, so I was excited.Wow, was I wrong. Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.We watched. Slowly, our suspicions that the reviewers had duped us (misery loves company as they say...) were panning out. Now, normally I dislike when I see overly negative reviews on the IMDb. ""Just don't watch it,"" I think, ""please don't drag the rating down."" But, when I saw this was in the top 150, beating out such classics as Yojimbo, Annie Hall, The Princess Bride, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, The General, and even Gone With the Wind, I couldn't take it lying down. What I will do is outline, briefly, the many problems I see with this film.1. An obvious agenda with which the makers feel they must bludgeon the audience. Michael Caine's character is a pot growing ex-reporter hippie who lives with his disabled wife (whom he helps commit suicide halfway through the film). He has various stickers in his home that are common these days, rather brainless political stickers with slogans like, ""No more Bush,"" ""War is Bad."" I'm paraphrasing, but you get the idea. Kinda funny that even though the film takes place in the year 2027, this guy would still have anti-Bush stickers. Any message you're trying to get across, producers? Also, there is a constant ""big brother"" idea running throughout the film, any democratic government is pretty darn oppressive and evil. Also, the Greenpeace... I'm sorry, I mean a boat called the Tomorrow shows up at the end of the film to save the day. The people who own the Tomorrow are part of the never defined Human Project. The audience has little clue as to the identity of the people in charge of the Human Project and the movie sure as heck isn't going to tell anybody.2. Constant uncomfortableness. In movies where the characters are running from someone, the audience needs occasional reprieves. The characters need to get to a place of safety, even if it's momentary. Otherwise, the audience begins to squirm. Children of Men, however, wants to make sure that you feel as though your television were chaffing you. This is indicative of a movie-making philosophy that is steeped in the literal rather than the metaphoric, and is indicative of lazy writing. Yes, the characters are uncomfortable, and that is necessary to portray, but once the audience is made to feel uncomfortable, the movie has lost focus. The main characters are always running, always being double crossed, always watching loved ones die, always getting in gun battles. They rarely get a chance for dialog, and when they do, it's out of place because their talking in the middle of a skirmish.3. Neverending gore, shooting, violence, and gallons upon gallons of blood. For some reason, modern filmmakers have decided that their audiences want to see what it's like when a person gets shot, stabbed, blown apart, disemboweled, etc. The reason these things weren't shown much in the films of yore was not just that they didn't have the technology to accurately replicate the human anatomy, it's that graphic violence is a cheap way to toy with the emotions of the audience. It's why people look down on slasher flicks; they're gratuitous and unnecessarily gory. It's more artistic to see the facial reaction of the person who's doing the shooting rather than seeing the blood spray from the wound of the person getting shot (see Lawrence of Arabia, this was actually a plot point). In this movie, they show anything they can. Limbs are torn off (in the first five minutes, actually), people get holes put in their heads, blood pours everywhere. In the scene where Micheal Caine gets shot, it takes about five minutes and twenty bullets for him to die. I don't want to watch that. And I question the sanity of people that do.4. Bland performance after bland performance. Everyone seems bored, high, or full of caffeine. Clive Owen's character is a typical indie film anti-hero in a movie that desperately needed a hero. I never felt a connection with him because the movie never presented a reason for me to like him. Owen's character is dissatisfied with everything, rarely showed any emotion other than squirming fear, and never makes a concrete decision that wasn't already made for him. The character of Kee, played by Claire-Hope Ashitey, never allows the audience to find anything likable about her. She smokes some pot while still pregnant with her child, she swears constantly, she admits that she has no idea who the father is, and instead of telling Clive Owen she's pregnant she decides to strip for him. I thought the ""Code"" in the 1930's, banning pretty much everything we plop into movies now regarding drugs, sexuality, and violence went too far. If the ""Code"" were still in effect, we would not have films like The Godfather, Braveheart, or The Matrix. But, I'd rather watch nothing but ""Code"" films if it means Children of Men is the crap that's going to get pushed on us.So, if you like this film, please feel free to explain why. I don't mind the discourse, really. But please, put this movie in its place. Don't rate it higher than The Conversation, It Happened One Night, The African Queen, Duck Soup, and Groundhog Day.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Good idea, solid crew, great scenes...","It's interesting when someone gets an idea of what will our not so distant future look like and puts it on screen.

If the time travel machine has been invented while I was asleep, please let me know :-) If not, let's rather concentrate on more important things.The idea itself is very intriguing. I also think that the actors played their rolls well, especially Clive Owen. I'm not a fan of Michael Cain, so I wouldn't comment on his performance.

A dystopian masterwork,"""Children of Men"" opens with a bang that echoes throughout the film's entirety. It's a loud, progressive sound that unleashes the darkness of humanity and the chaotic depths of a hellish dystopia. The year is 2027 and humanity is one the verge of extinction. Women are infertile and all hope, innocence, and civilization as we know it has plunged into despair. Only hell itself can rival the idea of this sort of future, where humans are divided, compassion and innocence is nonexistent, and the warmth of a child's heart is nothing more than a long lost dream.Alfonso Cauron has already established himself as an admirable visualist, and a versatile one at that. From the voluptuous and angelic frames of ""Great Expectations"", ""A Little Princess"" and ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"", to the grim and melancholy vision of ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"", Cauron always manages to elevate the material, good or bad, into a much deeper, profound, and personal work by utilizing in his style and through his own eyes, even to the point of adapting a Charles Dickens novel into a film whose visuals are as lyrical as the source material itself. With Children of Men, Cauron not only succeeds in providing a profoundly haunting vision of an intriguing future, but, he also succeeds in launching his capabilities as both a visionary and as a director to a whole new level, perfectly establishing the film's style and atmosphere with the use of hand-held cameras, elaborate and chaotic set pieces, and an emporium of symbolism and subtle meaning.The story has a concept that's strikingly unique, yet, told in a traditional and engrossingly symbolic fashion, perhaps almost to the point of being biblical. Theo (Clive Owen) lives his days like any other civilian to Britain's dystopian society. He knows there's no hope, no faith, and no future. He's just counting the days before humanity reaches its end. Yet, all of Theo's thoughts and regards are immediately uplifted once he is reunited with his ex lover, Julian (Julianne Moore), who is now the leader of a terrorist organization whose goal is to stress the meaning of humanity and what is left of it. First, take into consideration the fact that the presence of Julian in Theo's life is more than a breeze of fresh air. She's the last thing on Earth that he love and to have her back in her life is like having sunlight on a day that's bound to bring thunderous storms. We know that the two have a passionate past, yet, one that was destroyed by the loss of their baby child. Theo's remaining feelings for Julian are then delved deeper as he discovers a vital secret...a young woman's pregnancy.The character of Theo is depicted in a sort of biblical manner, making him the shepherd that God trusts upon in order to expand the affections of his miracles. The film itself can be considered as a deep meditation on the science of theology and the philosophy of nurture and its effect on human nature. Is the resulting chaotic society a reflection upon human nature, or is it simply the dying need for the warmth and nurture we witness every day, yet, never fully appreciate? The performances given by the cast are all astounding in their own way. Clive Owen is an actor whose always benefited from his deep voice and suave persona, like the ideal James Bond. Yet, as Theo, Owen gets a chance to explore a character with profoundly deep emotions, from the troubling grief of loosing a son to the inexplicable capacity of saving humanity's last hope. Owen delivers an all out sublime performance and carries the film beautifully. Julianne Moore, although with limited screen time, delivers a fairly fleshed out performance that enables the audience to have an overall good understanding of her character, her goals, and her feelings and intentions towards the fate of humanity and Theo. Claire-Hope Ashitey, the newcomer of the ensemble, delivers well as Owen's opposite and as playing the pinnacle role of the film, giving a performance that utilizes on her amount of realism and believability.From its opening scenes, Children of Men is a panorama of not only a brilliantly crafted, nihilist dystopia of a future, but, also of the capabilities of human compassion in the face of hellish darkness. Cauron has created his own personal masterpiece with his own personal and unique style. From his use of excessive tracking shots to the emphasis of hyperrealism, he fuels the film with both technical and emotional nuances that will stray in your mind for days. The ever-lasting message of hope is one we hear every now and then, yet, Cauron presents the moral of the story in a way audiences, and mainstream ones especially, aren't use to seeing. It's a moral that isn't afraid of being too bleak or too sober  just as honest and poignant as a newborn baby's cry.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Has some minor flaws and not the strongest storyline, but is so astoundingly created it's hard to care too much","Impressive as all Hell, at least from the standpoint of direction. There are a couple of long takes that are just about the greatest sequences I've ever seen. Cuarón is a master of putting the audience in the middle of the action. I've never felt more like I was in a war zone before. The collapse of society has never been more vividly depicted. However (and I hate to say ""however"" when there's so much to be amazed at), I didn't absolutely love the movie. It creates a frightening world, but the story that goes along with it is not equal to the creation. It's decent, but nothing fantastic. And the characters weren't especially great, either. Only Clive Owen gives a notable performance, and he was even better in Inside Man. I also thought that exposition in the film was handled clumsily. How many left to right tracking shots do we need of photographs and newspaper headlines? Every time Cuarón wants to tell us something about a new character, or explicate something that has happened in the past, that's how he does it. Okay, despite some complaints, which I guess are major but I was too impressed to care too much, this is still one of the best of the year.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Lab and artificial created items that are in everyone of the things I mentioned above are increasing the infertility/loss rate. And I'm not even talking about the Covid shot. Think about it.

Armageddon . . . again,"Imagine a few years from now, and the 'war on terror' has engulfed the whole world with Britain (haha!) as the last refuge from attacks. The economy is in tatters - possibly to pay for the almost omnipresent Homeland Security - but the really bad news is that the human race has become infertile years ago. Pregnant black woman, Kee, appears to Save the Day.Children of Men is a powerfully devised (if heavily flawed) movie. It uses a mish-mash of modern day fears, realistically projected 20yrs into the future, and a welter of populist, barely disguised religious metaphor to help audiences to identify with its miracle baby and mythical promised land themes.In 2027 the youngest person is only eighteen years old, and is killed after being asked for an autograph. Clive Owen (who is in every scene) is a disillusioned bureaucrat separated from his long-term partner Julianne Moore who now works for one of a number of resistance groups. She arranges his capture so he can help deliver Kee and her unborn baby to safety.The scenes of London mix familiarity with desolation, Homeland Security rounding up illegal immigrants into cages and shipping them through a Guantanamo-style holding centre to Bexhill, which has been turned into an enormous refugee camp. Bexhill itself looks more like war-torn Iraq, with various factions, some of them good and many of them not so good, vying for power.Owen gives a tolerably good performance even if the character looks and sounds like most of his previous roles. Moore, on the other hand, breaks away from her excellent screen personas where she expresses much without words and action, and throws herself into an excellent butt-kicking female militant character. The direction is taut throughout, maintaining tension and shocks as well as some crisply delivered laughs. The plot does meander as the group have numerous adventures to reach their goal, but the gradual and admirable escalation of violence and bloodshed shows a respect for pacing that keeps us on the edge of our seats. Michael Caine puts in a touching supporting performance as an aging hippy caring for his Alzheimer-stricken wife and the scene where Owen turns into a midwife is priceless.Given the deep issues at stake here, the odd scene suggesting Theodore Faron (Owen) does some soul searching would not have come amiss, but this is a movie crying out for a sequel: could we yet see a more mature approach to this undeniably interesting plot? Pigs do indeed fly, the pig in this episode being an inflatable one over art-enclave Battersea Power Station - Pink Floyd fans should be delighted. When George W Bush assumed power, I recall an American liberal saying they would now start a stopwatch to world war three. In the film, the British Government bomb hundreds of innocents to eliminate insurgents and we hardly notice, playing on our fears to give substance to any hope, no matter how improbable.

Not good enough,"It felt like this movie was adapted from a great book but in a rather disappointing way. Although I haven't read the book, watching the film has piqued my interest.The storyline takes unexpected turns and ultimately leads nowhere significant. The themes are touched upon but not fully explored, leaving much of the plot feeling unresolved. While there are some well-shot scenes that hint at the film's potential, the movie as a whole fails to capitalize on the richness of its world and characters. It feels like there was an opportunity for a beautiful, emotionally resonant story that never fully materializes.The pacing is, by far, the most challenging aspect. Important moments come and go so quickly that you may struggle to follow the plot, which almost forces you to look up explanations afterward.Despite its flaws, there are parts that genuinely impressed me visually and emotionally.

A poor man's dystopia action/thriller,"It's 2027 in Children of Men. Through advertisements, commercials and newscaster innuendo we learn that civilization has broken down on a global level. Only England somehow manages to 'battle on' and is suffering from large streams of illegal immigrants because of this. They the government, deal with it harshly; killing or deporting them as soon as they are rounded up and put in cages. We also learn that the entire world has become infertile; no children have been born in eighteen years. No one seems to know why and the hinted causality of growing pollution, global warming, and food manipulation as a reason for the infertility makes little to no sense.It is here where the logic in the film is starting to buckle, which is shortly after the opening credits. For the human race to fully stop being fertile all of a sudden, something more catastrophic and acute is needed. Also it would not explain why animals would be able to procreate amidst this eco disaster or why the term 'cloning' somehow seems to have vaporised from the dictionary. Obviously the existence of something acute did not fit writer/director Cuaron's agenda because it would ultimately lose the film's connection with the present world. Of course, if Cuaron had stayed true to the book, the problem would not have been so obvious. Too bad he (admittedly) never even read it.All this hardly matters because Children of Men comes off the shelf of the so-called thought-provoking movies. Which in this case means that its OK to INvoke some thought, but surely not to get too carried away with it. Judging by the way the script is handled, presenting the scarce plotpoints through ham-fisted explanatory dialog, I don't think this movie was meant to be thought provoking at all. At best it's a silly reminder of things we learn in school at age 10 and up or see in the news every time we turn the telly on.The film itself plays out like a big formulaic chase in which our protagonists, mainly Theo (Clive Owen) and a black pregnant woman, 'mysteriously' named Kee (Claire Hope Ashity), are chased down by a terrorist group named The Fishes who want the soon to be born child for themselves in order tocuddle it? Their motivations remain a complete mystery. The quest leads Kee and Theo through England's countryside, which is kind of a plod, also for the viewer. Fortunately we can listen to a jarring and bloated soundtrack that accompanies the bleak and unappealing shaky visuals the viewer is presented. The plot of the movie seems to revolve around getting Kee and her later to be born baby to another group called the Human Project that is not sure to even exist. But if they do exist, we can be sure that the human race, thanks to one little squealing baby human, will be saved.or something.Children of Men is a clumsy experiment gone terribly wrong. Director Alfonso Cuaron is know to despise too much exposition in films and if he is referring to the 'Hollywood way' of telling stories, I would somewhat agree with him. But Cuaron fails to properly compensate for the lack of exposition in the way the story is unfolding and scenes are constructed. He compensates by making the dialog throughout the entire movie so unnaturally explanatory that it is far too obvious that he is just informing the viewer. Being taken by the hand through every reason and meaning of the plotpoints like a little kid is pretty infuriating. And this doesn't just hamper the acting by otherwise capable actors, it also ruins any character development in the movie which in turn is not compensated for. Furthermore the movie is pompous and monotonous with its one-sided political overtone. It is all the same evasive when it comes to answering, or even questioning the issues it nonetheless throws up. The symbolism and churlish nods to contemporary issues is far too conspicuous and highly annoying as such (The one captured immigrant they allow to be heared, speaks German!, yeah, let's deport a former Nazi...seriously people, who writes this stuff?) And the logic of the plot that a single baby/person will be able to save the world in a movie that is supposed to have a serious message, is, to put it kindly, ludicrous, puerile and as original as a beer commercial.Although there is some fancy camera-work and editing in especially the last segment of the movie (a Kubrick homage?), I would not go as far as recommending this movie for just that bit alone as others have suggested. I think it is tragic that the talents of an artdirector like Lubezki were wasted on a bleak, rather predictable and messy film with zero likable characters, a questionable script and a too obvious political viewpoint which is shoved up the arse of the viewer over and over again. The film leaves out so much backstory and tries to compensate for this with so many minuscule silly details that even a second or third watch will not help to really put all the pieces together because too many important and interesting ones were simply left in the box.Although the attempt is somewhat admirable and despite the absurd high rating, not recommended at all.3/10",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Michael Caine as a pot dealing new age hippie and Chiwetel Ejiofor as a rival guerrilla fighter.Director Alfonso Cuaron has made a serious and darker version of the film Brazil from 1985. The futuristic setting is subtle and eschews the Blade Runner art decoration beloved by many directors when making a futuristic thriller.Cuaron has done well to craft this thriller given that so many writers are credited with the screenplay.

"The End of Times: In Children of Men, humanity confronts with its slow and absolute extinction","The most elegant and studious British crime authors, P.D. James, 86 years-old, is also the one that knows best the subject which she writes about: married to a doctor that came back schizophrenic from World War II, she felt obliged to become the supplier of the family by initiating a career as public server that would culminate, in the 70's, with a high post in the criminal division of the Interior Ministery - from which got her to deal with criminal authorities from all over the country, and to recruit criminal pathologists for the British forense medicine labs. It was one hell of an experience, and P.D. James made use of it not only in elaborated (and pessimists) thriller books but also in a story which, at first glance, is a strange body in her curriculum - the science fiction Children of Men, where the human race is predestined to disappear not in a sudden way, due to a cataclysm, but little by little, because of an eruption of infertility that has been going for years. With the romance, the writer puts in focus a commonly peripheral question of all apocalyptic fiction: how men and women would behave in the day-by-day, and what moral choices they would make, if they knew that there is nobody left to inherit their world? That is also the idea that Mexican film maker Alfonso Cuarón keeps firmly centralized in his adaptation of the book to the big screen.Before anything else, it is necessary to say that the brazillian title inverts the meaning of the path the film walks on. (I say brazillian title because that's where i came from, and where i watched the movie as well) It takes place in 2027, and since 2009 there isn't a registration of any birth on the planet. The youngest human being just has been murdered for refusing to sign an autograph - and the last ones that were born are treated like gods and act like ""assholes"", according to the definition of the bureaucrat Theodore Falon (Clive Owen). Faron lives in England, one of the few countries that still resist in some way. The rest has already turned into vinegar, and the British borders live pursued by multitudes of immigrants. When these swell, the more grows the number of policemen and the control of the State. What the movie of Cuarón transmits better is the futility of these efforts. Without a biological tomorrow, there isn't a way and neither a why to contain the material and spiritual disintegration. Here it is, then, the paradox that treats on both book and movie: it is the most primitive of all impulses - of the continuity of the specie - that lies the reason for all civilization. There goes as well the title, which paraphrases the 90th psalm: ""And the Lord said: 'Come back sons of Adam, to the dust which you left'"" (something like that). Against all his beliefs (or lack of them), however, the bureaucrat Faron gets involved with a rogue group that located something that no one imagined possible - a pregnant woman. It is a miracle so huge as any other in the Scriptures. But this new Eve, black and illegal immigrant, is a political triumph for anyone that puts their hand on her. Despite the notable nimbleness of Cuarón (also known for And Your Mother Too and the third Harry Potter) as a narrator and visual creator, Children of Men imposes a first obstacle to the viewer: it is necessary to buy its premise in one go. Surpassed this barrier, it becomes one of the most intriguing movies, that doesn't get tired of exploring an unsolved dilemma: there is nothing that the human being isn't capable of corrupting, and nothing that he isn't capable of saving as well.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Sweet Child in Time . Will You See the Light?,"Various highly acclaimed and respected sources of criticism refer to ""Children of Men"" as the absolute greatest Sci-Fi movie since ""Blade Runner"". I can't really disagree with that, since I never was a big supporter of this particular classic, but still ""Children of Men"" isn't the unhinged new masterpiece everyone claims it to be. The grim atmosphere is great, the sets are greatly depressing, some details in the script are truly extraordinary, the abrupt plot twists are shocking and the acting performances are overall stunning. Yet, somehow, the wholesome simply doesn't feel as astounding and refreshingly original as it should. It's a good film, but in case you're familiar with obscure, often low-budgeted and apocalyptic themed B-movies of the late 70's/early 80's, Alfonso Cuarón's script has surprisingly little new stuff to offer you. Several of the main story lines in ""Children of Men"", like the infertility of the human race or Britain being the last remaining place of civilization (although), are often just smaller footnotes in Sci-Fi flicks of the old days. The first 30 or so minutes of the film are the absolute greatest. Chaotic images of several of the largest and most prominent cities of the world burning down, fascist soldiers aggressively preventing immigrants from entering the UK and a  downright brilliant  sub plot about the last born human being bombarded to a media figure and he himself, 19 years old, not able to cope with the unwanted attention. The real plot kicks off when Theo Feron, a totally antipathetic loner, is requested  commanded actually  by his ex girlfriend to escort a very special girl to safety because she carries in her womb the fetus that could represent mankind's final little string of hope for survival. Their journey together is long, full of lethal obstacles and literally no one can be trusted. At least as far as I'm concerned, ""Children of Men"" is definitely a showcase of style over substance. What distinguishes this film from the rest is Cuarón's extremely raw and uncompromising filming style. The cinematography is everything but fancy, with shaky camera movements and disturbing visuals, the characters are uncanny and behave utterly nihilistic and the action is merciless. Clive Owen, definitely one of the coolest and most talented breakthrough actors since the new Millennium, gives another stellar performance.

"Curiously enough, its fans are smarter than the film","2027. In the throes of chaos and general apathy, humans have become infertile and the youngest person on the planet has died at 18 years old. A former activist (Clive Owen) agrees to help transport a miraculously pregnant woman (played by Claire-Hope Ashitey) to a human project sanctuary at sea, where her child's birth may help scientists save the future of humankind.First of all, I am amazed at how many people wrote off ""Children of Men"" as 'another bleak Orwellian sci-fi' á la the abysmal ""Equilibrum"", for to me it is clear that Alfonso Cuarón has created something refreshingly unique both in style and content here. It is a run-and-hide actioneer pumped full of adrenaline, and paralleled with an interested vision of the future. As the protagonists dart along the decaying routes of Britain in desperate hopes to save humanity, I was sort of surprised at how compelled I was at one point, from the amazing setting of crumbling buildings that look like war-torn Balkan countries to the political revolutionaries and snipers on the rooftops, the dark atmosphere is superbly breathed life into.As for acting, as a notorious Clive Owen-hater, he is nevertheless perfectly cast in the role of a lifeless, jaded corporate drone who has greatness clumsily thrust upon him. Seriously, I've recited grocery lists with more panache. Blink and you'll miss both Julianne Moore and Michael Caine, for neither inhabit leading roles in ""Children of Men"". To compensate for it, Claire-Hope Ashitey proves a likable character throughout, even offering some humour along the way, and the dire circumstances automatically elicit sympathy for out protagonist centre.Although ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a strong contender in the same category, the cinematography win should be a lock at the Academy Awards, and rightly so. Director Alfonso Cuarón coats his standard gliding tracking shots over the craggy British landscape and fallen citiea, and here it is bleakly perfect. On the other end of the spectrum, he aptly uses atmospheric shaky-cams to capture the frantic chases and escapes Theo and the girl experience on their way out of the country. Thankfully, it is not a-monkey-could-have-shot-this shaky, but appropriately moody.The crux, and there nearly always in one, is the unspeakably lazy writing of the template script, undoubtedly by Cuarón himself. If you intend to make a film largely about science, you should probably at least nod to science. In the film, no explanation is ever offered as to why people can no longer procreate, and it becomes clear that the writers have NO IDEA what they are talking about. Luckily, ""Children of Men"" is cleverly crafted in such a way that it never needs to explain what caused the infertility or the technicalities of what is wrong (""We don't know what caused it""), but as a result it is neither very interesting nor very credible. No matter how you get around it, you need a firmer scientific footing to appeal a wider audience.The film does, however, bring up important existential questions in bioethics. The implications of humanity no longer being able to procreate its species are wide-ranging and severe. In a way as humans it would not directly affect us since *we* would lead our ordinary lives to the fullest (albeit without having children). But undeniably, whatever distant genesmanship to our offspring and future generations, it would eventually provoke a kind of altruism that would lead us to act, much like Theo in protecting the pregnant girl, even if the child was not his, because in the end it would benefit the survival of our species  which is all that matters to the selfish nature of genes.""Children of Men"" has an admirably grainy and bleak tone, even though it is momentarily lifted by humour. It is a pity that its fans are doing most of the insightful thinking in the message boards, scratching their heads trying to come up with feasible scientific explanations for the infertility in the film (""carrying capacity of the population"", ""over-dependence on anti-depressants"", ""flunk of evolution"" and ""plague"" to name a few) something that the writers should already have sketched out in the writing stage.7.5 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A movie with also little to no plot (and what it had was dumbfoundingly illogical and übersimplistic), wasted performances by otherwise fine to even great actors and a political or social slant so inane, so completely sophomoric that it's hard to believe this movie was made as a serious attempt at social commentary. Alas, the extra's on the DVD leave no room for ambiguity. No spoof here, this was meant to be serious...So we have one fertile/pregnant woman amidst 3 billion who are not. We have an organisation presented to us in a lame stork-joke, which ocupies itself with getting the human race fertile again. That is, if this organisation even exists. They set out to find a raft to paddle to that phantom organisation which is said to bob somewhere around the coast of England. Why they chose to not just buy a raft but get one in one of the most violent parts of the country where bullets fly freely, tanks shoot at anything that moves and walking cameramen are trying to set records for the longest single-take ever made, all this with presumably the only infant alive in the world, is never even remotely tried to be explained.I really don't mind that pompous, vacuous films are being made under the pretext of being subtle, deep and insightful. What gets a rise out of me is that people can't see a really terribly made movie for what it is, but in stead sing praise, forgive the exuberant defects they are willing to admit this movie has and vote it a ten anyway, without breaking a sweat. Like the headline-reading buffoons or game-console addicts they are.Shame, especially to the professional moviecritics who along their careers surely must have seen movies like The Usual Suspects for plot and suspense, Full Metal Jacket for steadycam cinematography, It happened One Night for social commentary and God knows how many other quality films that have been produced over the years.No, these movies were in fact never made. Apparently the line was drawn at October 2006, conveniently forgetting that a particular scene should display some profundity if you accompany it by long and abstruse orchestral manouvres. Forgetting that movies used to have some form of plot other than something any writer for Sesame Street could come up with using nothing but a broken pen and a paper napkin. And Forgetting that overexposing, completely plotdriven and patronizing scripts don't usually help the actors to do their jobs convincingly nor challenge a moviegoer in any way.But..you've already seen this caper.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Left Me Speechless,"I'm nearly at a loss for words.""Children of Men"" took my breath away with the sheer visual audacity of its storytelling and the deep strength of feeling contained in it. Alfonso Cuaron, adding his voice to the many other directors who have made post-9/11 films about the grim state of a world governed by terror and hopelessness, has given us one of the most memorable and dramatically satisfying films I've seen in a long, long time.Much ballyhoo has greeted the trio of Mexican directors who released films this year, and people have been wetting themselves over Alejandro Gonzalez Innaritu's ""Babel"" and especially Guillermo Del Toro's ""Pan's Labyrinth."" ""Children of Men"" blows both of these films off the map. Cuaron's world view seems to be as grim as his compatriots, but unlike Innaritu and Del Toro, Cuaron seems to think that the world in which we live is worth saving and uses his movie to deliver a practical message of hope that resonates in the here and now. ""Children of Men"" is the most uplifting downer I think I've ever seen, and the long scene in which a small, crying baby temporarily halts the warfare and carnage taking place around it, for one instant uniting enemies in the wonder and glory of new life, reduced this viewer to tears (and I don't cry easily at movies).Cuaron's visual style is absolutely stunning. He creates a meticulously detailed vision of a nightmare future that is all the more horrifying for its plausibility. And there are a couple of extended set pieces (I'm thinking most notably of the one in which a car containing our hero, Clive Owen, and a group of activists/terrorists is attacked by an angry mob, the entire scene filmed in one long take by a camera that never leaves the car) that astounded me with their showmanship. And yet, for all of its directorial panache, I never felt that style overwhelmed substance -- Cuaron ably and completely welds style to subject in such a way that his approach always perfectly serves the story he's telling without drawing attention to itself.I think it's very interesting that the end of this film is inspiring so much debate, and that different people have completely opposite readings of it. Some think it's dismally depressing, lacking in any sign of hope. Others think it's optimistic, the happiest ending possible in such a dystopian work of fiction. I believe the ambiguity is intentional on Cuaron's part, and I personally came away exhilarated by the powerful message of hope, and a reinforcement of the belief that there will always be good people willing to do good things for others in the belief that the world can change for the better. Maybe I read into the ending what I wanted to read into it, but maybe that's the point. Perhaps those who think this movie has nothing to say have given up already on the state of the world, while those of us who find in it a happy ending are those who will continue to refuse to accept that a world governed by panic and fear is acceptable.""Children of Men"" makes a nice companion piece to this year's ""Little Children,"" another downer that ended up being one of the biggest feel-good movies of the year for me. It's so refreshing to find that there are directors who want to do more than simply wallow in gloominess, and actually offer solutions even as they highlight problems.Grade: A+",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"If Stanley Kubrick were alive today, and 32 years old, HE would have made this movie!","There is a strong political element to this movie. Do note, also, that the director is from a third world country (Mexico). In one sense the general vibe of the film is similar to the great, recent, 'V for Vendetta'. It is kind of a portrayal of Britishness gone completely off the charts--- although the world politics depicted here are not exclusive to the UK by any means. Whatever your personal politics, however, you absolutely must give this movie credit: it is exciting, rich, detailed, and thrilling. Certainly solid entertainment. If you get any kind of 'message' out of it, then that's your bonus.'Children of Men' is not perfect--- but it is so good that it doesn't matter. Clive Owen & Julianne Moore give believable, outstanding performances. The supporting cast was also up to the task.I was reminded as well of early Kubrick work. Thematically, that would especially be 'A Clockwork Orange'. Directorially, that would be 'Full Metal Jacket'. And such circa 1970 fare by other filmmakers such as the wrongly-forgotten 'O Lucky Man'. If Stanley Kubrick were alive today, and 32 or so years old, HE would have made this movie!

A grim future,"Children of Men portrays a grim future in a classic science fiction tale where the veneer of civilization is peeled back and raw humanity is exposed. The film is unsentimental and true to its premise. Clive Owen was especially effective in his role as an ""everyman"" caught up in events. Michael Cain played a great supporting role. And the music was a blast from the past. This being a near future context, the dates seemed a little off, appearing to place the targeted release date of the movie more at about 2003 than 2007. This is, of course, a problem for all sci-fi stories set in the near future. There were times where I thought the editing could have been tighter, but overall I think this is the next great classic sci-fi offering in movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great original piece but well short of a masterpiece,"Children of Men takes a new spin on the sci-fi disaster scenario and does it in style. The cheesy special effects are left in the closet, and the focus is on the story. While the movie is ultimately uplifting, (though it seems not for everyone as some of my movie goers can attest to), there are some deeply depressing/troubling passages, which should be left to a mature and prepared audience.The result is all in all very convincing, thanks in no small part to competent acting by Owen and a well-written script. Owen's empty whiskey-soaked stare is worth a thousand words and Cuaron seems to have understood this only too well.I highly recommend this movie, though I was bored by the prominent religious imagery and concept, and a bit annoyed that plenty of ends were left untied. This is still well worth being seen at the theater or rented on DVD. I would not waste my money on a DVD purchase though, as its re-playability is frankly limited.Clive Owen (Theodore Faron) - 9/10 - Convincing stuff, good job, hope he doesn't drink as much in real life.Julianne Moore (Julian Taylor) - 7/10 - Good, but she's frankly a short forgettable bystander in this movie.Chiwetel Ejiofor (Luke) - 8/10 - Once again, Ejiofor delivers, though it would be nice to see him play some other role beside the super-action figure all the time.Alfonso Cuarón - 8/10 - Turned a great movie from a great idea, but the religious overtones won't/can't be appreciated by all.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"I know most people like it, but...","I found the movie disturbing, not necessarily for the violence or the bleak scenery, but rather for the dismal view it gave of the capabilities of mankind.Set twenty years in the future, _Childen of Men_ gives a view of a sterile Earth, a world where no children have been born in over 18 years. Supposedly, scientists have no idea why this has happened and are powerless to stop it.The two biggest problems I have with this premise are: 1) There are three billion examples of each human gender on Earth. The scriptwriters would like us to believe that every single one of the females has suffered exactly the same fate from, one would suppose, exactly the same reason. This would have to assume that every female on earth is equally susceptible to one particular pathogen, a supposition which, scientifically, is so unlikely as to be almost impossible.2) Science is an ever changing and ever improving series of disciplines. We are in an age where we wield an almost unimaginable power over our own existence. Yet, the movie would want us to believe that scientists have essentially given up on trying to solve what is arguably the worst possible catastrophe that mankind could possibly endure. With IVF births being practically commonplace these days, we are supposed to believe that in two years, scientists will suddenly become impotent (no pun intended) to solve a fertility problem? To me, that's an almost absurd supposition.Admittedly, these are seemingly picky reasons for objecting to this movie. Still, these and other implausibilities made it impossible for me to suspend my disbelief long enough to enjoy this movie. I can toss aside belief when the premise of the movie is sheer fun (as in _Men in Black_), but in a movie which is trying to send a message, these kinds of inconsistencies serve to make the message laughable, not laudable.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Very powerful and a downer also.,"This is a hard movie, and not uplifting. But it is helped with a great cast, with Clive Owen (Theo) Julianne Moore (Julian) and Michael Caine (Jasper) and a very good supporting cast. Theo is a low level bureaucrat, and we learn that the oldest last born person has died at age 18. The real reason is not explained, but it seemed to start with miscarriages late in pregnancy, and then earlier and earlier until there were no births. Britain has walled itself off from the world, and ruthlessly hunts down and deports foreigners, known as fugees. But there is another group fighting the government, the fishes, and Julian is one of them, and asks Theo, her ex, if he can get her travel documents to get to the coast, as there is a boat from the Human Project that she needs to contact. We quickly learn there are many layers to everything, and Julian gets killed, and Theo finds out what his mission is to be. And the fishes can be as ruthless as the cops, as they have their own agenda. And that does not coincide with Theo's mission. However, Theo is determined to fulfill his mission even if no one is certain the Human Project is real. And this leads to a lot of cat and mouse games and things start to get very tense. By this time, one is an hour into the film, and things get much more harrowing and the tension really ramps up. It is edge of the seat tension.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Not great, but mildly good","This movie isnt as what people proclaim it to be. It has problems, read on the find out why.Cinematography:
Why in good grief does this movie have shaky camera shots 100% of the movie? It's such a crap shot that I wish directors would stop using.. it should only be used in POV, explosion, and fight scenes. Would of been 1000 times better if they just had a stabilizer.Special affects:
Some of the scenes where they implement CGI or just special affects with smart camera angles Is absolutely amazing. Very kingsman like but also has some scenes were if feels very inaccurate. Like they baby never crying even though there is gun shots happening. And other unrealistic things but overall it's good.Acting:
Wow, very decent acting in this. Everyone seems very believable and have the ability to make you feel what they're trying to induce.Story:
Very good plot on paper and its pretty well done. I will say the 1st 40mins of the movie I hated and felt so boring and mundane. Then it started to pick up and get pretty interesting in the end. Speaking of the end I actually liked it, it made you feel for the characters and gave a good send off to the film. I just wished they had done some scenes better because it's just not done to my liking.Summary:
Overall I would say this film is above being alright. Many things in this film I hated or didnt like I just dont have the space or time to write. However This film has a very unique story and has amazing special affects. I believe you should give it a watch, it's not great but unique enough to be a must watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A picture......... A single picture.,"'Children of Men' paints an interesting, detailed, and realistic backdrop. This should be said from the start, because in fact, the film does little else. Having created an reasonably realistic and viable starting scenario, the film contrives, in rather obvious fashion, to drag a small cast over that backdrop, permitting the camera to pick up every detail. The acting of the cast, as it poses with the backdrop, is often, if not universally superb, and if a bit of acting, and that marvelous backdrop are all that you require, the film is a great one. The problem is, that the plot is altogether lacking and incomplete. It is a rare episode in a television show or movie of any sort that does not have more story to it than this film. The lack of plot also reveals a deep and fundamental lack of meaning in the thoughts behind this movie. There is a distilled European angst, a pure and saccharine sentimentality, dribbles of ill conceived piety, and little else.Rather than using an altered environment to enhance the message, 'Children of Men' uses a novel environment to replace making a considered statement and confronting ideas directly. This puts 'Children of Men' at odds with both Science Fiction, and quality film.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Contains both the hope & destruction of man,"I thought this film was wonderful. I won a free pre-screen pass to it & thought it was going to be the typical sci-fi flick. Barron waste land of black (or red Mars-like) dirt & half burnt buildings ***or*** flying cars, cyborgs, robot servants, etc.This film was surprisingly believable. The story was told as if evolution COULD prevent fertility of humans in the very near future due to our experiments, corruptions and short-cuts to solution. Some may see the movie as political - any war/end-of-the-world movie would be. It was almost like a movie outlining the consequences of our actions due to those who trying to prolong life, create life that isn't intended to be, and alter life from its natural state. Like God's punishment to our evil. That's the basic point of many movies made but it's been a long time since I've seen one delivered quite as well as this one. It ended up being more of a war movie than a sci-fi flick. Very dramatic and even spiritual in more than one scene.I wasn't fully satisfied with the ending but it still was better than I anticipated. As my husband said, it almost made it seem as if there was going to be a sequel (I hope not though because it would probably ruin the philosophical flow of it all. Almost like what the Matrix 2nd & 3rd movies did for the first). We were left to wonder whether or not mom & baby were really going to be protected as they tried so hard to get to a safe place. BUT if it ended up happy & ""la-dee-da"" then that could have made the ending corny, which then would have ruined it all.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Film Making at its Full Potential,"Children of Men is one of my personal favorite movies thanks to superb direction from Alfonso Cuarón, Beautiful cinematography by Emanuel Lubezki, an incredible screenplay and premise and great performances from Clive Owen and the rest of the cast. Children of men has some truly jaw dropping moments of beauty and horror shown through some of the greatest long takes ever shown in cinema's history.

"Wildly compelling and thought-provoking tale of a bleak, dystopian future","Adapting from P.D. James's phenomenal literary work, Alfonso Cuaran embraces a dark, powerful vision in this examination of both a paranoid and terrifying fight for humanity's survival. From the prestigious script by Cuaron and the stellar cinematography to capture the most astonishing moments, the scariest aspect Cuaron incorporates here is not just the concept of humanity threatened by infertility or the violent nature associated with it but how incredibly believable it is. Though such a deeply bleak concept like is highly unlikely to happen, the film makes it quite difficult not to imagine the possibility of the future hitting such turmoil envisioned this story. It is eagerly thought-provoking from beginning to end, but nonetheless compelling in nearly every sense. Set in 2027 in dystopian London, one of the last stable nations alive after the world is devastated by war. All the women in the world have been left infertile, and the youngest individual alive has just died; leading humanity alarmingly close to extinction. But when London native Theo Faron (played by Clive Owen) learns from his former lover Julian (played by Julianne Moore) of an illegal immigrant Kee (played by Clara-Hope Ashitey) who happens to the first pregnant women in nearly two decades, Theo sets out to escort the women across the violent, war-ridden country to board a ship that will take her safety.Alfonso Cuaran drives this film in a direction that cites more interest in telling a powerful story of a society facing a grim downfall than explaining the reason behind the disaster that threatens the very existence of mankind, and it's not long before the plot moves in ways that render the explanation behind the mysterious phenomenon less and less important. The plot sets in the following the news of an 18-year old boy, the youngest human being alive dies, and atmosphere settles with every last living adult alive facing a seemingly inevitable doom. From that point, we are left with endure a bleak and paranoid atmosphere, with a very few moments of levity. One of which involves Michael Caine as a old pot-smoking hippie who becomes a brief aid for the lead character on his journey, and only with little screen time. Along the way, we are set on an extraordinary journey of hope and desperation, with themes of war and genocide of illegal immigrants playing out. Alfonso Cuaran portrays these elements with such gravity and authenticity, and with a deep emotional core punctuating nearly every scene; there is never a moment that feels wasted. Few of these scenes involves Clive Owen's character and the supporting characters in the midst of the mass genocide that tears their surroundings to shreds, and these scenes sparkle with breathtaking cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezski, with some long uninterrupted shots progressing as long as several minutes.The cast consisting of Clive Owen, Julianne Moore, Chiwetel Eijiofor, Michael Caine, and Clara-Hope Ashitey, falls nothing short of ambition here. Clive Owen, taking the lead role, is fantastic with his performance with great sincerity. Along his side is Chiwetel Eijifor as the leader of an immigrants' rights group who is the initial protector of the poor pregnant women Kee. He delivers a decent performance for the rather small amount of screen time he has, but definitely not one of his most memorable roles. Julianne Moore, multi- Academy Award nominee, is also given her time to shine here but like Chiwetel Eijiofor, carries a slick shortage of time on screen. Michael Caine plays an old hippie isn't really given much to do other than provide a little light-hearted relief from the grim atmosphere that pervades the film. Clara-Hope Ashitey on the other hand, is arguably the most riveting actress in the picture. Blooming with heart and humanity, Ashitey nails her role and provides a pleasant on screen presence throughout. Whether her performance soars in the Oscar caliber or not is difficult to speak of. Needless to say, she delivers all what she needs to do.Children of Men is a powerful dystopian science-fiction adventure with a thought-provoking treat from beginning to end. It is a deeply inspiring take on P.D. James's acclaimed novel, and sits a well example of an cinematic translation of literary done right, even if it spits a few liberties form the novel. The performances are powerful, the cinematography is profoundly stunning, and the script by Alfonso Cuaran succeeds on capturing a realistic feel of a futuristic society in gone to turmoil.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A Fine Journey Through the Tunnel of Dystopia,"'Children of Men' is a dystopian drama where men are fighting their biggest enemy, themselves. There are two ideals pitted against each other. An inhumane, totalitarian regime, behaving in their obscured manners, and people who rebel against the discrimination, for the honor of humanity. But in all this game of war and cease, the cries of children are lost. Women have become infertile; men only live to satisfy their hunger. But amongst this dark, glooming misery, plays with the gleaming glimpse of hope, a girl, a pregnant girl, a miracle.In his known fashion, Alfonso Cuaron delivers another delicate piece of art, filled with symbolism and sentiment. The film references many biblical symbols, as far as making the coming child, an image of Christ himself. But the visionary director makes it even more heart-touching, he reimagines the image of Christ as a girl. But also at times, some of the imageries were becoming too obvious. Which cuts down from the value of the message it's trying to convey.
It is undoubtedly beautiful in its cinematography. It follows the actions and emotions of the characters very precariously but, with much dexterity that always maintains an attachment between the audience and the film, it sets us inside the gritty and horrid paths of this dystopia.
Some of the featured songs elevate and emphasize the rhythm of the scenes and make the impact more heartfelt.
But to its criticism, the sound editing was a bit off at some scenes. And although the screenplay is not something I can complain about, it seems a bit animated at moments.
Maybe it is the execution or maybe; it's because of the slightly rushed pace of the first two-thirds of the film.
But it steals the show in its third act. One of the most heart-wrenching and intense third act, I have witnessed in this movie. A man, who tries to strand himself from the rest of the world, finds once again the means and joys of becoming or at least filling the given duties, the role a father portrays. Now, I think anything else would roll into spoilers.In the end, it is not a perfect movie. I'd even go to say that It contains a serious amount of plot-holes. But that shouldn't retract the credit this film deserves. This movie is about reminding us of what we can be at the worst of times and how we can still serve humanity justice by being humans again. To love, to teach each other to love, we can get a grasp of the peace in a relentlessly striding, crazy world.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great movie! A must see!,"Excellent movie. There are very few bad things I can say about this movie.Brief Summary on the movie.*POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD (minor if any)* Children of Men is set in a bleak post-apocalyptic world where women can no longer procreate. This movie takes place in London, which has become a sort of fascist ruled state, having a strict no immigration policy. All immigrants are treated quite harshly and given little or not rights. A terrorist group known as the Fishes (which fight for equal human rights for immigrants) are attempting to transport the pregnant woman, Kii, to the Human Project.*END (potential) SPOILERS* The casting is excellent. Clive Owen gives an outstanding performance as a former activist soon to become deeply involved in aiding the first pregnant woman in 18 years. With other supporting actresses/actors such as Julian Moore and Michael Caine, you already know that whatever you end up thinking of the movie, the acting is still top notch. Music is well done and/or well chosen, with several songs that help suit the mood. The atmosphere of this movie was extremely well done (as in my opinion, it seems quite the task to create such a bleak world, and have actors convey a convincing disillusioned state at the fact that humans can no longer procreate).Children of Men offers a high tension, high suspense thrill ride coupled with immensely engrossing and well done action scenes that could be described for lack of better words as ""meaningful"". This movie steps above the bar set by typical action movies (involving often pointless action scenes with underdeveloped characters) and keeps you wanting more. Characters are easy to attach to (or easy to hate, depending), allowing you to almost feel what they feel in a sense. A highly recommendable film, as long as you don't mind movies of a bleak nature.Also! This movie could easily be compared to the popular computer game Half-Life 2, in my opinion.Enjoy the movie!

completely missed the point,"I really don't understand the hype about this film. It was terrible - gratuitously violent and confusing - from beginning to end. I went to see it with misgivings (and got two friends to go along - they hated it as much as I did!) because I loved the book even though a review in the Chicago Tribune led me to believe some major changes were made to the story line. No kidding! The movie missed the book's point and philosophy completely. They made up half the characters and those that were actually in the book were completely different in the movie, and not changed for the better! Luke was barely recognizable (I only knew it was him because of his name), Rolf was nonexistent, and they created new characters (such as Kee - ridiculous character, racist premise) for no good reason that I could fathom.The plot bore little resemblance to the book. I would be interested to know why those who made this movie felt compelled to make these changes - the story P.D. James wrote was excellent the way it was - and what the author herself thinks of this film. The book had religious overtones, and the violence in the book is as much the fear of violence as the violence itself. Also, the characters are well-developed and believable. Theo is a character who goes through a complete transformation as he deals with the people he meets (such as Julian, whose role in the book is central to the plot and she certainly is not a terrorist, but instead the first woman to bear a child in 25 years). He is also forced to deal with the issues he has ignored up to now. His cousin, the Warden of England, is reduced in the film to one confusing scene that doesn't add anything to our understanding of the story. The only character I sort of liked and who was even remotely (I do mean remotely!)like the original was Michael Caine's character, Theo's friend Jasper.And the Quietus - what was with all the advertisements? They never tell you what it really is. In the book it is a crucial incident which leads Theo to join the rebels in the first place. In the movie, it's reduced to almost a footnote - ""suicide in a box"".I could continue with this rant, but my real disappointment and anger is that an awful movie based on a wonderful book by a great author will not attract new readers. If I had seen this movie before reading the book, I would never have read the book.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Amazing Film; Top Movie of the Year,"I must say, I had high expectations going in for Children of Men. Finally, yesterday,it was released and I could go see it (today). It certainly exceeded any expectations I had. The movie flowed very well, and I did not see a single dull moment. The pace and cinematography combined to make this a truly amazing cinematic effort. Everything from the blood on the lens to the long shot made the end sequence excellent and one of the best action sequences I've ever seen. There isn't much that I can say for the acting except that it was superb. Clive Owen was remarkable in capturing the role of Theo, but I must say Michael Caine stole the show every time he was on screen, even down to his final words. The film was very meaningful to me because it was about one man, thrust into an impossible situation, who did everything within his power to fight for this cause. Cuaron's direction leads this film to a place few have gone before. It is captivating, enthralling, and intense all at the same time. It took me through a wide range of emotions. The journey was part of the experience, and I felt like I was with Theo and Kee at many times. I thought the whole experience was one of the best cinematic experiences I've had in a long time (this coming from a die hard Departed fan). I can say that Children of Men tops The Departed for me. Children of Men is my top for 2006 if it still counts as a 2006 film. If not, it certainly will hold strong against 2007 competition I strongly believe.I recommend this film to all people who are looking for a film about believing in something. It is a great achievement and is definitely going in my Top 10 or 20 films (not quite sure yet).If you have any hesitation about this film, put it aside and prepare for a unique and amazing movie.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The greatest movie I have seen in a long time,"Not quite science-fiction as much as a hypothetical view of what the world might turn into under extreme circumstances, Alfonso Cuarón's grim, stark vision of the future is one of the most amazing and original films of its kind.The origins of ""Children of Men"" lie in P.D.

It's not the shiny future with flying cars we've seen so many times, instead being a grimier version of England today that falls somewhere between Stanley Kubrick and Terry Gilliam's ""12 Monkeys,"" humanity having given up hope on evolution or technological advances at this point.This movie gives off a eerie effect of that this is the future in store for mankind.

"Best ""End of Times"" movie ever","Fans of end-of-times movies, great news - this is the best one yet.It's the near future. Women are infertile. There are no more children, and no prospects for procreation. The youngest people on the planet are 18. Schools lay fallow in disrepair. Nations are collapsing. Britain still operates as a police state, and has closed its borders to all immigrants - only British citizens are allowed to live there. Illegals are rounded up and sent who-knows-where; they are badly treated. Radicals violently protest this injustice, and terrorism is a daily fact of life. You risk your life simply getting a cup of coffee. The end is nigh, the end is nigh!Against this backdrop, we get both a superb action plot and a high-impact human drama, that rarest of motion pictures. I shall reveal no more and leave the pleasures of the intricate story to the viewer. It's expertly directed by Alfonso Cuaron (""Harry Potter/Prisoner of Azkaban"", ""Y Tu Mama Tambien""), who also co-wrote a brilliant screenplay. The genius of the movie is in the pacing - it starts out fairly sedate with an interesting examination of the world as it exists at that time, and gradually ratchets up the tension until by the end we can hardly stand it any more. The characters are deep and memorable, the dialogue is rich and natural, and the machinations of the plot are unpredictable and pack a great payoff. The acting (Clive Owen, Julianne Moore, Michael Caine among many others) is nothing short of immersive. Our ""hero"" is no Superman, and he spends most of the movie just doing the best he can, which makes him very appealing. The effects are utterly seamless. They're so well integrated you can't even tell what's an effect and what's not. This is no Hollywood picture; there is no melodrama and the camera doesn't flinch from anything, nor does the script ever resort to cliché or convention. In fact, quite early on, it clearly signals that anything goes. The cinematography is top-notch, easily the best I've ever seen in this genre. The soundtrack is suitably downbeat and never gets in the way.Like I said, best ""world apocalypse"" movie yet. Better than ""28 Days Later"", better than ""Dawn of the Dead"", way better than ""Night of the Comet"". The whole production is triple-A, and a major artistic achievement for Cuaron and his crew. 4 stars out of 4.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Should've Been a Best Picture Nominee,"If anything, watch this film for an impressive finale.If the Oscar for visual effects is rated based on the overall effectiveness in contributing to the visual context of a film, then weirdly enough, this movie would get my vote.

Visual masterpiece,"I liked the apocalyptic feel of the world. This is a brutal film, I don't particularly love it but it's a good film. But if you're a fan of dystopian film you'll enjoy it. The atmosphere massive. You're transported into the world of the film. It is well shot. It is visually appealing. The film excel visually. The action sequences were also well staged. Anytime kee and Theo face violence and adversity, they have to go through some of the run down and brutal environment you can imagine. The way the high energy scenes are filmed it's remarkable; these long takes where things were exploding and gun fires everywhere. It impressive how the movie felt. However, despite how great and real the dystopian future felt, I often found myself detached from the movie. It was a bit less engaging. More often than not I found myself not fully invested in these characters. The acting was good of course. But I think the problem has to do with the characters. The characters weren't fully realized or developed. Overall, Children of men mostly pull it off but doesn't always pull it off. And that's slightly problematic considering it's built around only a few characters. But the film is also built around the atmosphere, the dystopian setting in which the story takes place. There are also some thought-provoking themes at play as well. The film gives you a lot to think about; it provides a fascinating commentary about human nature and survival. And also the importance of our youth and how at times help us retain our humanity. The final act is good. You feel the friendship between kee and Theo and I think it owes to the performance of the actors.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Fantastic film.,"An incredible film that grabs you from the outset and never let's go.Everything gelled with this film, the acting, the cinematography, the direction, it's pretty much a masterpiece.Not a moment of screen time is wasted and your attention is kept throughout, there are no moments of boredom at all.It surprises me that Clive Owen didn't go on to become a much bigger star off the back of this, his performance is very impressive.I've tried to think of something negative to say about the film, and quite frankly I can't think of anything, apart form the fact I wish it were longer.Having seen the film many times, I decided to try the book, but for me, this is one of those rare occasions where the film is so much better than the book, I found the book to be quite dull to be honest.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
What are people talking about? A bore.,"I saw this movie on television and gave up on it after a little more than an hour. I went over to my computer to see if anything was new in my local newspaper. What a bore! Seventy-five million dollars only got you this? For some reason the entire world is going down the tube. Who knows why? Doesn't seem to be connected to the infertility issue. Only Britain (rah, rah) is in better shape; that is, it does have terrorist bombs, the streets are a mess with garbage and graffiti, and the countryside is swarming with murderous outlaws, but at least it isn't in flames like other countries. Our hero is conscripted to escort a pregnant woman to safety. Why exactly does she need protection? Um, I dunno, she just does. Everyone in the movie seems breathless with excitement, which the producers apparently thought was enough to create excitement in the audience. There's lots of chasing, people running and shouting, and I suppose that adds up to gripping entertainment for some viewers, but I'm being generous by giving this turkey a rating of 5 stars.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Gritty, electric and eerily real","A powerful and energetic film that takes the gritty textures of 28 Days Later and the dystopian noir of Bladerunner creating a memorable and fierce movie that, is at times, spectacularly realistic.Clive Owen is slowly but surely becoming a very decent actor and in this, save for a few patchy pieces of bad dialogue where he simply swears through scenes, does a good job as the movie's protagonist. Julianne Moore is an odd choice; playing an American leader of a British terrorist movement and yet again, I feel she delivered an empty performance. I really don't know how she manages to get into so many good films.Through a severe depiction of 2027 London, Children of Men is an advertisement for what Britain could become in the future. What is most clever from this film is the gritty, long shots of action, reminiscent of Saving Private Ryan, where action unfolds before our eyes without cutting and flush with rawness, so stunningly real it'll leave you feeling you've been hiding behind Clive Owen till the very last spray of gunfire. The film is layered with intelligent, meaningful points and messages; perfectly timed for the current climate on immigration, nationalism and racism.Though the pace dips in places where exposition takes over, it's delivered by charming hippy Michael Caine, but be warned his repetitive salvation ""Amigo"" may irritate. Electric and vividly clairvoyant, you won't see a better film this year. Britain has had some dire films in it's attempt to battle Hollywood but as Children Of Men's London proclaims ""Britain soldiers on""... well after seeing this film, you'll be checking yourself for flesh wounds.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Mesmerizing -- an absolute must see, a truly original masterpiece!","Note: I have intentionally left out any commentary on specifics of the plot or message of the movie, as I would strongly recommend you see this with as little preconceived impressions as possible.It's hard to put this movie into any one category: an epic drama, an action-packed, fast-paced thriller, a character-driven 'emoticoaster', a documentary on the human and societal condition. It really is all of these wrapped neatly into a crisp, tight story that leaves no inch of film to waste. It is by far one of the most intriguing movies I have watched in some time and kept me thinking for some time after it ended.The film brings all critical elements together to lose the audience in its reality, making you believe you are almost watching a documentary of a place and society that exists in our world today. The sets served as a believable canvas on which the story was told. In numerous scenes the background of the film was as important as the immediate action, often revealing subtle, reinforcing details that provide more context to the story.I was equally aware of how unobtrusive the camera work was to the film, always putting the audience right where they needed to be to get the full scope of any scene. I often felt like I was in the movie as a passive participant because it was so engrossingly filmed. Some parts of the film were admittedly graphic, but done so in a way that added materially to the condition of the characters and their plight. I truly appreciated how in touch I felt with everything going on, and credit the camera direction with that.The soundtrack was great: lifting your spirits and dropping them low; amplifying the emotions of a moment and also cunningly removing itself at times of suspense. This was very well done.The acting by all involved was superior. Clive Owen gave mightily to Theo, revealing a character who adapted as more information was learned by him throughout the movie. Owen transformed Theo from complete apathy and despair to a hero of sorts fighting for the future of the world. Julianne Moore played a minor role, but was excellent as always. Michael Caine was truly enjoyable to watch as a post-modern hippie. He added much needed levity and humor to give the audience some rest. Claire-Hope Ashity was very convincing as the unexpected vessel of worldwide hope, balancing well her personal motherly tendencies with her obligation to the human race. There were several of other very interesting and fun characters as well, all necessary threads in the overall fabric of the film.I was not initially aware the film was based on a novel, but I was blown away by the originality of the story. It was entirely believably and thoroughly examined the implications of the twist that the human race has found itself in. Even in the most gloomy of circumstances with the fate of the human race hanging in the balance, the script did well to show that in the end, we are all just humans; with the same faults that we have in the real world -- competing interests, greed, power, a deteriorating moral value system, and so on.Add to all of that excellent direction and you have a film that is epic in scale and scope; tackles deep moral and ethical issues in society; provides some of the most suspenseful and realistic action/war fighting sequences I have ever seen; gracefully analyzes the emotional spectrum that people in a hopeless world could exhibit; and masterfully follows the story of a small group of people making their way through that world to restore hope. The movie was edited with straight-forward story telling but packed with tremendous amounts of information at every turn. In 1 hour 50 minutes, I felt the movie still could have been much longer, but was amazed how effectively it tackled all of its subject matter so succinctly. The result is a movie that is very raw, gritty, and powerful, opening your mind up to what our world could come to in any number of varying paths. A must see, and definitely near the top of my all time favorite list.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Children of men, the movie","When did movies stop looking at the future with wonderment? 2001: A Space Odyssey was perhaps the last time the infinite possibilities of years to come were depicted as inspiring and expansive. In the last four decades, dystopia has reigned supreme on the big screen, and the time focus has got shorter and shorter. Now we look forward, myopically, only a few decades at a time, and what we see is so appalling it's no wonder we desert the wider world and take refuse behind our iPods and computer screens.Director Alfonso Cuaron's just-released Children of Men (Cert 15), which is loosely based on PD James's novel, is the latest attempt to draw conclusions about the future from the mountainous problems of the present. And like so many other examples in this genre, the assumption underlying the whole story is that, in the interim, we have proved utterly powerless in the face of the chaos brought by complete social breakdown.Cuaron's film is of interest mostly because of the picture it paints of everyday life in Britain in 2027. The weak story comes a poor second. Women have been made infertile (possibly by a massive flu epidemic), no children have been born for 18 years, an authoritarian government is in charge and Britain is besieged by illegal immigrants who are kept in cages at ports and rail stations. Clive Owen plays a burnt-out, passive bureaucrat (reminiscent of Orwell's Winston Smith) who is persuaded by a terrorist gang to help the escape of a young woman (Claire-Hope Ashitey) who somehow, miraculously, is pregnant. Hunted down by competing forces, Owen's character finds himself acting heroically in the midst of gun battles despite a seeming lack of either conviction or compelling motive. It is, in effect, simply a chase movie.But the background scenario is plausible in many ways, and in its details and atmosphere is thoroughly convincingly depicted. London still has its red double-deckers, but they are covered in moving video ads, albeit far grubbier and washed-out than those in Bladerunner. Random bomb explosions rock the streets. People look roughly the same, only their expressions are even more defeated and passive than can be seen now on your average commuter journey. Disposable euthanasia kits ('Quietus - You decide When') are sold over the counter. Groups of feral kids attack trains with rocks, and passengers barely turn a hair. Everywhere, people are encouraged by disembodied voices to report illegal immigrants.However what makes all this imaginative production design finally hollow is the utter vagueness of the film's political dimensions. We're left in the dark about the political make-up of the predictably 'fascist' government; the terrorist group, maybe environmentalist, maybe anarchic, maybe simply 'humanist', seems to have little agenda. The immigration problem which features so largely is emotionlessly portrayed - we're not quite sure whether we're meant to view the obviously inhuman treatment of these arbitrarily imprisoned (and apparently mostly Eastern European) refugees as the cause of the turmoil, or the result of it. All this makes it hard to become more than merely superficially involved.And yet at the same time, it is this very vaguenes which makes the film interesting when viewed from our beleaguered present. We've become used to seeing a largely left-leaning vision of the future where the corporations are the root of all evil (as in Rollerball), or where a specifically right-wing Tory government crushes all dissent (the absurd V for Vendetta), or more weirdly still, where past liberal battles are played out paranoically as though they're still being fought (the ghastly and pointless remake of The Stepford Wives, or The Handmaid's Tale). But the ambiguity of Children of Men reflects not just the loosening of labels, and perhaps the death of genuine political debate, which characterises our own times, but the free-floating anxiety which consumes those who would still identify themselves as being of the Left and Right. Both points of view could find support for their arguments in the film's portrayal of a multi-cultural London in the midst seemingly of a slow-motion civil war, and certainly the central conceit of an infertile population could be seen as a metaphor for Europe's catastrophically plunging birth-rate. What, finally. touches a highly-exposed nerve is not just the sense that, despite the ceaseless efforts of the capital's boosters, London is recognisably already on the way to this nightmare vision, but that social and moral fragmentation has led to an overwhelmingly nothingness at the very centre of things.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Science fiction premise ends up in a mediocre thriller,"'Children of Men' presents the idea of a chaotic world due to an anomalous disaster: the complete infertility of women. In that context, Theo (an ex-activist who is now a government worker) gets involved in a risky task that turns out to be a meaningful mission for humanity. So far so good, we have an action hero story taking place in an original dystopia I personally found appealing. However, the movie didn't live up to my expectations at all.Despite creating a powerful atmosphere (thanks to a fantastic photography and the use of long-takes), the film fails to engage you because of its poor plot. It is not that there are many futuristic situations that are hard to take in, it is the fact that you continuously witness a series of inconceivable events: narrow-escapes, companions' deaths, random animal appearances, etc. They simply ruin the story! It feels as if the filmaker intended to demonstrate great skill shooting, and didn't care about telling a good story.Looking on the bright side of things, I like the notable criticism of gun violence and discrimination, and, even though it was a little clichéd, the conclusion was nice.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Blade Runner meets Schindler's List: The most unsung and underrated film of the 21st century,"I recently saw this film after seeing a very interesting trailer of it over the summer. Judging from the trailer, I was expecting this film to be pretty amazing, and with all honesty, this movie was so much better than I expected. It is shot so well, with its ever longing track shots that gives the film a eerily realistic dimension to it. It is a very graphic yet powerful film, and doesn't show the future in a nerdy cleaned up future. It shows London in 2027, and only a few not-too-overdone futuristic modifications are made.

Science fiction at its best,"I just saw this movie by myself. Now I have no one to talk to about it. So I'm writing these comments before my head explodes.I won't go into the details of the plot, the acting, or the cinematography, as other people have already done that here better than I could - I just wanted to add a few points about what the film said to me.Even though everything in the film is so damn depressing, and the world is so horrible, and we're all going to die, no really, we are all going to die, I loved the way that hope was allowed to exist - not as a blinding beacon across a battlefield, but as a subtle nudge or affectation, the winking eye of God.Think kitty getting friendly with Theo's leg, or the sheep dogs who never liked anyone else - they can see the destiny that Theo is literally soaked in (or maybe it's the whiskey?)This is very much like the story of Pandora's Box - after all the evil, scene-stealing nasties came out, there was one tiny, fragile creature left that managed to escape without anyone seeing it. Zeus could be a bit of a **** sometimes, but even he realized that hope could never be sacrificed.Cor blimey, Pan's Labyrinth last week and now Children of Men this week! Go Toro! Go Cuaron! What the hell do they put in the tequila in Mexico anyway? I've just seen two of the best movies I've ever seen in my life in as many days, and deep down I'm sad because I know it's going to be a while before I see any movies this good again...And what is it with Britain being the 'last nation standing' after an apocalypse?

Terrible movie-making around a lacking story,"I just finished viewing Children of Men which is said to be a thought provoking and intelligent movie that received nothing but praise from just about anyone who has seen it.Disappointment is not the most accurate term to describe my feelings while and after viewing it. So let me just sum up this movie for you: The world is in utter chaos, for some unexplained reason all women are infertile, no children have been born in roughly 20 years. One woman miraculously gets pregnant for evenly unknown reasons. For yet again unknown reasons she is being chased down by various parties who seem to enjoy shooting automatic weapons at her. The baby is born and with the aid of a guy she makes it to some boat and Hooray! the world is savedintelligent stuff ey?Well, if this is mankind's solution to end all the worlds misery then I got a great idea. Let's send babies to all the troubled regions of the world. We can drop them by parachute from airplanes called 'Tomorrow' and I'm sure the senseless violence will immediately stop. We will wrap the babies in flyers with incredible thought provoking slogans like: ""all governments are bad"" and ""Life's like a box of chocolates"".And when the turmoil is over, we can send Alfonso Cueron to those regions to make action-packed chase movies out of local literature with profound religious overtones. He can start with the Bible and have Mary and baby Jezus being chased down by all the other characters in the Holy Book carrying heavy artillery while they are being aided by a young Judas.In these movies we will see an even more realistic hand-held cam imagery than what CoM had to offer us. One of them can feature an unexplained global outbreak of a virus which causes diarrhea that will make key figures in the movie take endless dumps on toilets with dung-splatter on the camera-lens. The splatter will be handsomely edited out later on, for it is more important to handle the style than any real content. God forbid it wouldn't be an uninterrupted long-shot.The movies will all be without closure and will all go black at the end emblazing the title of the movie onto the screen while in the distance we can hear Axl Rose vaguely doing a Bob Dylan cover which will later be explained by vivid fans of the movie that there is probably a new G 'n R album coming out.The movies will all have cameo's of top local actors. The actors are all unceremonially killed off early in the film to save budget. Then 30% of the remaining budget will go into the cinematography and what remains is quickly wired to professional movie critics so say something really nice about the production.Children of (wo)Men, Soon in a dumpster near you!",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Dystopia at its finest,"Last night was probably my fourth viewing of this film, and as expected with every watch its message and mentality becomes more and more clear. When I first watched the film ten years ago I wrote it off as too bleak and depressing. But as I have grown older, and with the world of the last four years of Political unrest, western cynicism and anti-immigrant rhetoric, the film seems more tonally perfect than I think Cuarón could have ever guessed it would be (which could be seen as worrying as we move towards 2027 - the film's setting).Besides the quality of the work in the context of the world, CHILDREN OF MEN is also simply a visual masterpiece, the set design creating a dystopia so clear we needn't see one more caged up London bus to understand the world we are in. The masterful tracking shots, lasting for minutes on end give the film a flow and heartbeat which makes it feel more like the events of a few hours than those of a few days. Daring, unpredictable soundtracking as well does a huge amount of work to add to the theme of cynicism vs. hope.Clive Owen, who I don't always rate, delivers an on brand unflappable protagonist (which works perfectly for the pessimistic former activist Theo Faron) alongside a cracking debut lead performance by Clare-Hope Ashitey, who invokes so much sympathy and support from the audience, all the way forward from the scene in the barn. These central stories are enhanced gorgeously by the ensemble cast, a cast which also helps to bring the feeling of familiarity to this cinematic universe.Overall, this film works perfectly both as a self-contained story of a world with a future of maximum 100 years, and the anarchy that would come about as a result. And it has such power as a representation of how we are moving in the west, knowing that we are killing our planet and how we have a true lack of sympathy for those on a different path to our own.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Post-Pandemic Pre-Apocalyptic Popcorn Perfection,"So I just gave Children of Men a solid re-watch and damn, this movie slaps. Chills, every time. Such a rollercoaster ride of a flick, grabs you by the gullet and rarely lets up. The story, one of precious life in the face of certain death, is primal and archetypal. You can feel its textures, sets, props, performers, all etched by the trauma of a near-future in free fall. And that's the magic of movie-making. Films are a mirror and a mirage, of our times past, and our times yet lived. At their best, films are daunting explorations into the chaos of our human condition. And a film like this just hits with such relevance, and potency, today in particular, as we face the realities of own pre-apocalyptic pandemics and political upheavals. I don't know what else to say.

"Wow, unexpectedly awesome","I'm going to be very honest here. This was one of the best movies to come out all year long. I'm a sucker for post apocalyptic movies like this one. But this movie had great cinematography, a great story, pretty decent acting, and the sheer chaos that stays constant keeps you on the edge of your seat for the entire movie. This was on par with the departed, Borat, and all the other great films to come out this year. The one thing i thought was kinda week was how they killed off julianne moore and michael caine so quickly. I mean, one scene moore is alive and the next minute shes dead, i thought they could've added more. But Clive Owen does an excellent job acting his part and so do most others. Michael Caine looks like an old ass John Lennon and acts like it too. If it was possible i'd say this movie might have been nominated for best picture.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Dreary and bleak future view effectively portrayed...,"1st watched 5/20/2007 - 6 out of 10(Dir-Alfonso Cuaron): Dreary and bleak future view effectively portrayed by director Alfonso Cuaron, although it doesn't make for a fun time at the the movies, it does what it's supposed to do. The story is about a world in the year 2027 that hasn't seen a human birth in 18 years and doesn't have any answers as to why. Clive Owen is a government worker who is mourning with the rest of the world when the youngest person alive dies giving a world with little hope already, less. He is then kidnapped by a group of rebels, led briefly by Julianne Moore's character, who needs help transferring an illegal alien safely out of the country. Illegal aliens are normally captured by the U.K. government and put into refugee camps, but this one needs special treatment because she's carrying a child that could, of course, save the world as they know it. Owen & Moore just happen to be former mates who tried to have a baby 20 years ago unsuccessfully and therefore they are connected personally as well as professionally, and she knows he will be sympathetic to the cause of protecting this woman. The rest of the movie is a qwest to get this important woman to a secret organization known as the Human Project. The tone and the set design for the entire movie is very grey and war-like with very little clues that we're dealing with a future society. This is obviously by design as the director is trying to make a parallel to today's society and what might happen if we continue the direction we're going. This glum look on life is hard to make into an enjoyable movie experience but it does shed some light on reality and opens our eyes to how we can try and make this a better world -- with this Cuoran, accomplishes what he wanted.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Amazing, it keeps getting better with every minute","Unlike most other movies I watched recently - Children of Men doesn't start losing momentum after the opening titles, in fact - it keeps picking it up with every second, with every scene. It got really intense quickly and that intensity barely had any time to let me go. It pretty much peaked in the refugee establishment, when we had a REALLY long take of Theo getting around in the streets, ravaged by gunfire and explosions close by and in the distance. The movie had plenty of impressive long-takes that features a lot of brutal material, impressive cinematography, and sometimes shaky effects that just made me uneasy but also stressed as the situation keeps escalating. This is a quality of emotion I praise and also a quality that is shared among some of my favorite movies. Children of Men really outdid themselves in making me feel a whole array of emotions, which included being disturbed, being shocked, and being sad.The music here is really pleasant, although usually brief. I nearly lost it when I heard ""The Court of the Crimson King"" by Crimson King and the credits included ""Bring on the Lucie"" by John Lennon himself. Looking at the soundtrack for this movie, it's actually way richer than I actually thought. I missed the likes of Radiohead, The Kills, and Deep Purple. I'm not sure what scenes included these songs and I'm not motivated enough to check but it made me realize how much the movie made me focus on the plot and everything going around that I didn't even pay that much attention to the music around. Though that might be due to a scene at the beginning, where the strawberry joint was introduced and the relaxing music was interrupted by a loud ear-piercing melody. I usually watch movies pretty on a pretty loud volume and this scene early in the movie made me lower the volume a bit for the rest of the session. Though I didn't like it, that's about the only complaint I had during the movie.I kind of love that futuristic dystopias usually end up with British governments playing the villain in the story. Though my sample size is sad, V for Vendetta (2005) being the only other movie I can refer to, I can start seeing a trend here. That may have just been a mid-2000s thing but it was enough for me to know what to expect when watching a Britain-related movie, taking place in the future going on forwards. Speaking about futuristic dystopias, this one is not boring. The infertility angle is a rather fresh one (though I doubt it's an original one, as I've read a novel that featured on the sidelines before) and seeing how that affects people, how suddenly the youngest person alive is glorified, and how a new life brings hope to people is breath-taking. I don't live in a dystopia like that but the movie does such a wonderful job of making me feel what they feel.Even though this isn't a comedy, probably as far from it as it could get, I love how comedically fuelled some of the dialogue is. Well, comedic is probably the wrong word here but the wit, the quick replies with some British humor (or just humor) is just a cherry on the cake that made this movie one of the better viewing experiences I've had in a while. It made tense and stressful situations feel less nerve-racking and even used cursing in a fashion that didn't seem unnecessary or distasteful. In fact, it even made some scenes more memorable and gave them just enough edge to lift the over mediocracy. That's just another charming aspect of the movie - you never get tired of less action-oriented scenes, as the dialogue is actually worth paying attention to.I don't know why but this movie kind of made me think about Stephen King's novella The Mist. As the protagonist got put in a hopeless situation, he tried to escape from it, only to find out the mist is terrorizing much more than just the small town he got trapped in, in fact, he believes the crisis is global. But there's a glimmer of hope on the radio. Just one word. He went to kiss his son goodnight and mentioned just two words. The first one was the name of the town he believes he heard on the radio and a possible location to find other survivors. The second word was ""Hope"". This movie brought hope in the form of childbirth, the first one in about 18 years in-universe of the film. Seeing Theo turning from a pessimistic middle-classed gentleman to someone driven and motivated to make a change in the world after seeing the pregnant woman was a moment completely turned the momentum of this movie. Although expected, as it's mentioned in the description of the movie, Theo's facial expression is just priceless. That's the expression most of us will have when the pandemic will be over. That's the expression someone would have found out their favorite band will be visiting their city for the first time in a decade. There are many ways of describing that feeling but acting out it is difficult, I imagine, yet that scene made it look like it's not even worth a sweat. A flawless sequence that established the direction this movie is going to follow.I don't know if I'm getting soft but it just seems that the movies I've watched lately are amazing, every single one of them. This movie had a lot of really brutal scenes but they never were the emphasis of the movie. Kind of makes me wonder if it would pass the censor today, as it featured some stuff that I wouldn't call gory but rather sensitive, as the refugee crisis and global acts of terrorism escalated after the release of this movie. But let's ignore that for now and just appreciate what this movie brings to the table - a well-scripted movie with an interesting plot that keeps picking up momentum without dragging behind at any moment. You're never too sure what will happen and then you never guess how gory it will actually get but it keeps on delivering. It's unique in both the style of cinematography and the storytelling, it's unique in the way action is being portrayed too and it just feels really fresh, compared to Hollywood movies with a lot of shared traits. I loved it and my rating reflects that.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One of the Best of the 2000's Decade,"One of the most depressing films in my recent watch history, Children of Men is a nonstop thrill ride throughout a socially regressive dystopian society. Owen, Moore, and Caine give outstanding performances, the set design is magnetic and aesthetically over-detailed, and the camera documents a balance of both the explosive character arcs and expansive background.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Well made but rather pointless,"I must admit to being really surprised by the the number of people who seem to think this is a fabulous movie.How much doom and gloom do you really want to sit through? The action sequences were brilliantly handled and were thoroughly convincing. In contrast to the James Bond style of action which is entertaining but never engaging this film certainly makes you feel the brutality of violence even when delivered by guns rather than fists.But all through the film I was constantly hitting the brick wall of ""What is the point?"" ""Why am I sitting here?"" I have never found Clive Owen to be particularly watchable. He always reminds me of Clint Walker. Competent but rather wooden. He possesses no particular cinematic appeal.I am prepared to admit that I may well be in a minority by being someone who was not particularly entertained or enthralled with this picture. Especially since I felt exactly the same about Cuaron's other well known film Y tu mama tambien which I thought was quite a yawn.No doubt the director is a skilled filmmaker but honestly if you are looking for a film to take your girlfriend to on Saturday night this is not one I'd recommend. The world it depicts is not a pleasant one and after you've endured all the depression it can deliver it simply leaves you with a shudder.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I did wait until the end to run out....,"Nothing interesting about any of these characters. The writing was poor at best. The look and feel were very good, but none of that matters when I don't care about any of them. I also hated how everything fed to me throughout the whole film. I had to work for nothing nor did I have to wait for anything. Being walked through every reason and relationship like a little child is pretty infuriating. I heard somebody say this was our Blade Runner. And I would have to agree. It is our Blade Runner. Which means it's a far less interesting, patient and entertaining film. Oh yea, the baby was fake. That was the capper for me. Ridiculous.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Great story, great filmmaking","Children of Men grabs you by the neck and keeps you watching through a harrowing hour and 40 minutes. It's evocative of Orwell's 1984, with a bit of Terry Gilliam's Brazil (sans the humor).Based on the 1992 book by P.D. James, the story takes place in a dystopian 2027 Great Britain in which fertility has vanished from the human race. There are no babies or children, and the youngest person on the planet, age 18, has just been killed. All the major cities in the world except London have been decimated. The streets of London are battle-torn--terrorists, warring factions, the military--and it's barely safe to walk down the street.
At the same time, illegal immigrants are being rounded up and put in pens like animals (sound familiar in 2019?).Miraculously, a young woman turns up pregnant, and various political factions want her and her baby. Theo Faron (Clive Owen), a London white collar worker, is contacted by his ex-wife (Julian (Julianne Moore) to help the young woman escape the war-torn country and find safe haven on a ship called Tomorrow.Very little is explained in this film; it's all about the escape. Along the way, we meet Theo's friend Jasper (Michael Caine in a phenomenal performance) and several other characters who assist him (or turn out to be betrayers).The cinematography is astounding, with many long, uninterrupted shots, ala Hitchcock. I'm having a hard time thinking of a movie that has better camera work. You can't avert your eyes.The plot is somewhat elusive, with very little backstory, but director Alfonso Cuaron has wisely chosen to make this a visceral rather than a 'logical' film. He succeeds in captivating us.This is one of the best films of 2006, with a high budget ($76 million), but it lost money because it was not well-promoted. Too far over the average Hollywood-brainwashed moviegoers' heads, I suppose.Quit watching mainstream Hollywood garbage and seek out gems like this one. You will be rewarded.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Shocking,"This movie is a good thriller, full of tension that will keep you on the edge of your seat.This story takes us into a world corrupted by events that affected all of humanity, where the only hope that remains is at the greatest risk that we can imagine. Each event is more shocking than the previous one, thanks to the good direction it is possible to imagine that we are inside the world that the film describes, where the only thing that matters is surviving. There are several shocking moments in the story, where hope and fear are involved, the acting is very good, the production design made me feel in that world, and the direction makes you care about the characters. Although there is not much development of these, nor much explanation why all that happened, the end is very interpretive with enough material to continue this story, although at first it may take time for the action and adrenaline to start.It results in a good movie full of tension and amazement in the viewer, it is very enjoyable and made with a lot of effort.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Try a little tenderness,"I chose to go to 'Children of Men' without reading reviews although being aware of 'good word of mouth' as well as mostly appreciating this Mexican directors sensibility through his previous offerings and was delighted to go to an almost full theatre.Its an apocalyptic cinema experience which professed to place itself in 2027; yet collaged many of our immediate contemporary dilemmas. Of course, there are haunts of Mad Max, but I felt there was a push to be a little more urgent about the concerns of todays world. Interestingly, my 18 year old son walked away saying 'what a bloody mess', which is a healthy reaction. This movie should rattle your emotions - there is violence, humour, shock and surprise. To me (gosh - its just an opinion), its not quite there but my caring for intelligent movies tells me this is a very, talented, youngish film maker who will continue to grow. Everyone complains about something - mine is to try a little tenderness.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A scary vision of  the near future.,"I have never read the novel on which this film is based,but living in the north of england with a large immigrant population some aspects of this compelling film frightened the life out of me.The story is not new,but the vision of this future is scary, maybe because it is a little to close for comfort.I could go on about the performance of the actors but when you have Micheal Caine,Clive Owen,and Julianne Moore you know its not going to be a duff movie.Full marks to the style in this film was shot ,which adds to the feel ,almost like a news crew filming at times,(leaving the blood on the lens was a masterstroke,this was real shock value.)A very disturbing film ,but it still managed to keep me on the edge of my seat.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Premise Doesn't Work For Me,"I could see it was a professionally crafted movie with high production values and with a good Directing effort, and it's always a pleasure to see Michael Caine and Julianne Moore. But the premise just didn't work for me. If you love senseless, extreme violence with no cogent motive for the protagonists, this movie is for you. I kept saying out loud, ""why are they killing each other? Did I miss something?"" Let me get this straight, massive civil unrest and armed revolt occurs and the government and the people go on killing sprees because women cannot get pregnant. People attacking in groups like zombies and everybody turning into cold blooded murderers. Killing each other for no reason and swarming strangers like the infected in 28 days later. Why was that mob of people in the country chasing their car and shooting at them? They didn't explain that, they explain nothing. The military and police treating the population like Jews in Nazi Germany. Their alluding to the Nazi thing was anything but subtle. They even huddled the common people into a Ghetto! For what reason? Why were the military treating so harshly the innocent civilians in the train station? Yet another thing that remained unexplained. It's one of those movies in which they refuse to explain anything. They'll hook you, keep you watching to see if they will explain what is happening. But they never do and it's a tease with out reward. The same type of thing they did with the Phantasm movies. A lot of weirdness, and you're expected to invent your own explanations. Like an old plot method installed by a recent graduate of film school. This is England, but there is an Army of militant armed Muslims marching in the street, yelling Allahu Akbhar. Mega-weird. Why was that scene in the movie, and what was it supposed to add to the story? And why are half the English people Arabs? I think it was representative of the Director's challenge here. Keeping things moving along quickly with constant tension, weird scenes, and dramatic scenes of suffering and brutality. He has to keep it moving fast (The main characters never stop moving. They're always in flight and being pursued) so the viewers won't think about the absurdity of the premise or try to figure out the many absurd things in the movie. Not the infertility thing being absurd. But how society reacted to it. I think the reverse would happen from this premise. People would be humbled, sensing God's judgment, and society would become more peaceful in a reflective age of waiting for the extinction of mankind. They'd blame God and then blame each other and then blame themselves and then pursue redemption. It would be a multi-step process to acceptance such as people have with grief. People wouldn't kill each other wholesale, go berserk or burn down cities just because all women became barren. I don't think the author really understood the human race. I suspect the author wrote this book or story at a young age.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Top-notch filmmaking,"Alfonso Cuarón is a talented filmmaker. I do think Gravity is overrated but it showed how skilful of a director he is. I haven't seen all his films but Children of Men is my favourite so far.Children of Men takes place in the year 2027 where women have become infertile and a man named Theo decides to help a woman, who is miraculously pregnant, get to a sanctuary at sea.If there is ever a film you should watch to witness top-notch filmmaking, it is Children of Men. The technical aspects of this film is done so well and alongside its story, this film is an entertaining watch. Cuarón loves using long takes and this film is filled with them. The long takes are so impressive as a lot of action takes place during them that it makes me wonder how difficult it must have been to perfectly execute them. One misstep and they would have to restart the entire shot. Just like Gravity, this film looks absolutely gorgeous. Filled with an ugly colour palette, this film captures this chaotic, dystopian world incredibly well. All of this combined made Children of Men so engaging to watch. I completely believed in the world this film took place in and the commendable long takes adds a great deal of intensity to the scene.Where Gravity faltered for me was its story but this film has such a compelling storyline. The dystopian world it's set in has a lot of social and political commentary which makes this film more thought provoking and memorable as you analyse it further. The journey these characters go on and the fast pacing keeps the film from being dull and rather more intense as it continues. In addition to that, the performances by Clive Owen, Julianne Moore, Michael Caine, Chiwetel Ejiofor and the rest of the cast are stunning.Definitely watch Children of Men. It's a very intriguing film filled with terrific performances, outstanding filmmaking and themes that'll make you think for quite some time. I cannot wait to see Alfonso Cuarón's other films because he's a director who knows what he's doing.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Gets more impressive every time I see it...,"Some movies just take my breath away. Some movies just leave me behind in awe.
""Children of Men"" does all that to me. And mind you, I have seen it now over 5 times, and honestly it does get more impressive every time I see it...""Children of Men"" has got a heart. A warm endearing heart that pulsates louder than the exploding bombs in this movie. A lust for life runs through this picture that is like an adrenaline shot.Superlatives dont suffice to describe this gritty, violent, bleak and depressive story about a world in which a virus has caused an epidemic of child deaths at birth. No children have been born in years. One girl only, an illegal immigrant girl, has gotten pregnant and she carries the weight of the world on her shoulders because the existence of humanity is at stake here. If her new born dies, humans as a species, will cease to exist. If she can manage to keep her newborn alive, mankind has got a chance for survival.Clive Owen plays the man who accompanies this young pregnant girl literally through a battlefield, towards a safe haven. I think it is one of his best performances. Michael Caine and Julliane Moore play supporting roles that are to die for as well. The acting in this picture is sublime!Alfonso Quaron directed, wrote and edited this picture. He has also made ""Gravity"" (with Sandra Bullock in space), which has won numerous Oscars. This director is a movie genius. He only makes 1 movie in every 4-5 years, but he creates classics EVERY time.""Children of Men"" has got a natural beauty and rhythm to it, that is astonishingly impressive. How many times have I seen movies that flow so seemingly effortlessly? Not that I want to get technical, but this movie is as real as it gets in front AND behind the camera. The photography of this picture is Oscar worthy. Just follow closely how long the scenes last without ANY cut in it at all. While bombs explode, buildings are tore down, when people storm the streets, minutes and minutes go by without any cut in the scenes. That takes an effort similar to an orchestration of a classical symphony. It must have taken enormous efforts and time to make this picture as ravishing as it has become. ""Children of Men"" has that quality of real life imagery, so real that you just forget you are watching a movie. It is enticing, worrisome, suspenseful, heartwarming and thrilling.And still I feel I havent giving it enough praise. A classic can have that effect on me. I wanna conclude with a statement of the director himself:Alfonso Cuarón has stated that he ""didn't want to make a film that ends when the credits roll. He wanted to make a film that, when the final credits roll...that's really the beginning of the film"".This movie left me behind with a feeling of bewilderment about the future of mankind and the disgraceful world we live in now...",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A good movie,"""The Children of Men"" by P.D. James (1992) is a good book. It is not very good nor is it medium. It is good.The ""Children of Men"" is a movie directed by Alfonso Cuarón (2006) inspired by the just mentioned book. As a movie, it is neither very good or medium, it is good. There are plenty of alternatives to this movie but seeing it is not a waste of time.Now, there is not much in common between the book and the movie. Character names are the same but not the characters themselves. Actually, I wonder why they used the same names for essentially different characters.The basic story is the same, its background is more or less the same.The book has a political appeal but it is not that political; it is more ""human"" (feelings, instincts and affections are of course also part of politics). P.D. James would probably not like to accept this, but as the book reaches its end, it communicates more and more directly to our instinct the fact that it was written by... a woman. (A man could of course describe this and that, it is not in the descriptions themselves, it is in the underlying ""how to""). The book, even though absolutely bookish, has a deliberate vocation for a movie script.The film is an action, political and war movie. Not much ""human"". Indeed, not much well defined. Interesting that the suffering and miserable illegal immigrants in England are German (and also French). Interesting that the English authorities behave as German authorities did during the 3rd Reich. There is even a ghetto. Contrarily to the book, all important cities of the world, including our city, fell into anarchy and or destruction. London was the exception. Is this also interesting?

Worth the watch for the Brilliant Cinematography.,You must know by now that the movie is set in London 2027 and it's been 18 years since the female human populace has become infertile and the world has ascended into chaos (although it's mentioned that world was close to devastation even without the infertility problem). The movie is seen in high regards and justifies its position too. It has multiple scenes where your heart just stops in anticipation of next scene but all you are offered with is breathtaking cinematography and no background score. Just brilliant. So why only 7 stars? Well the movie is worth watching for just the seeing the magnificent use of camera but the movie lacks character development. There are deaths sprinkled throughout the movie but since you do not connect with the characters the full potential of their deaths seems to be missed opportunity.

Almos all good,"Children of Men is set in the year 2027 where women have become infertile so no baby's are being born and the human race is going to die out. There were parts of Children of Men that are incredible. The premise, most of the acting and some action scenes that have you on edge make this film great. This film uses lots of long takes that were at times very impressive and at time you didn't even notice it. What I really liked was that the main character, who was played by Clive Owen, could have been a hero who would save the world from this dystopian future, but instead he was written as an every man who was very relatable which made the movie much better. The fight scenes were also done extremely well, there's one in a car that looks like its all in one take and is absolutely breathtaking. Children of Men takes lots of inspiration from dystopian fiction like 1984 and Blade Runner and has parts that feel like they could fit into either of those story's as well as the tone being very similar.Children of Men does almost everything right. There are just some slip ups in the story. There's one part in the middle of the film that didn't feel as realistic as the other parts and some characters made decisions that were a bit stupid.

Devastating in Every Way,"In it's first hour, Children of Men comes across as a formulaic post-apocalyptic drama. A lot of it's early strength comes from the central cast including a stand-out performance by the great Michael Caine and Julianne Moore. Sequences of the film, including the famous drive-by death scene, horrify and amaze us.. and unfortunately dwindle off back into the forgettable plot. Then, something amazing happens. The final 30 minutes of this film is a cinematic explosion. It's some of the best filmmaking of the past 20 years.

A Chase Movie  ...,"This was a good, fast-paced ""on-the-run""-type movie. If you're looking for strong sci-fi cinema aspects like special effects, exotic sceneries, etc., you won't really get it here - but that's OK as long as you know that up front.The movie: we are basically given a small group of people on the run. They are trying to get to a certain destination for a particular reason. - and that is the core of the movie.If that sounds a bit dry, the movie does have its perks. First, the characters are ethnically diverse and well acted. It's interesting to see such ethnic diversity on screen at once - it's kind of unusual given movies up to this point. As far as performances, Clive Owen turns in his usual intense performance and is extremely watchable. The other central characters seem to fade in the background when compared to Owen. Still, they do a pretty good job.Action? This movie is all about action - the main group is always on the move and the enemy and explosions aren't far behind. There's not a whole lot of intelligence behind all the chasing and running, but the sequences are well-paced, energetic, and often punch out a few good surprises.This movie felt most like a war movie that takes place in a third-world country. Most of the movie was set to hippie-acid rock music which can be a bit annoying if that style doesn't appeal to you. Also, unless you knew the premise, you'd never guess it was sci-fi.If you want to see a good chase flick with a war-like setting - this movie is for you.

children of men,"My expectations for this movie were pretty high, and out of the night, it was probably the movie I was most looking forward to. Disappointingly it didn't deliver as much as I expected.First up, the plot was interesting, women are infertile so there haven't been any babies born in the past 18 years. But then there is a girl who somehow got pregnant, and they need to get her to the ""Human Project"" to get her safe and have her baby. Her baby is due in a month as well. The predictability of the plot kind of disappointed me, but I guess they tried.The acting was, alright. Clive Owen does a great job in it, but I guess I'm just a big fan of his and he hasn't really let me down yet. The camera work was spectacular, the special effects and the setting was also very good. Also the soundtrack they used was also great.Time to time I got kind of bored, or thought what was going on was stupid and decided to question the movie. But I guess you can do that in any movie. It doesn't bother explaining the reason women are infertile but I guess it's a mystery to the people in the movie as well. Like another post on here said it makes you think a lot about the future, and possibly what might come up.Overall I don't know if this movie is worth the money, I wish I could tell you to wait or not, but seeing as how I don't pay to see movies, I can't really tell if it would be worth my money.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Fantastic,"Blown away by this one, a science fiction film set in 2027 that is absolutely terrifying in its realism. It's dystopian but pretty easy to extrapolate from where we are today to the level of the inhumanity we see in the film, especially when the ugly surge in nationalism has already produced hatred against immigrants and people are literally being kept in cages on America's southern border. The scenes showing this in the film are incredibly prescient, and the footage of cities transformed into war zones is stunning. The fluidity of challenging single-shot sequences, tightness of the storytelling, and myriad noticeable little details in the world created by director Alfonso Cuarón are all top-notch and give the film very high production value.The premise of the film is that humanity has been sterile for 18 years, and the plot revolves around a young woman (Clare-Hope Ashitey) who has improbably gotten pregnant. Both the government and rebel leaders are to be feared, and it takes a special man (Clive Owen) to recognize that the most important thing is the baby and its mother, not politics. It was interesting to think of the baby as representing future generations for us in general today, with the story asking, what would it take for us to lay down our arms, see life for the miracle it is, and expend our efforts to do nothing but protect it? For a few glorious moments we see a ceasefire of sorts, which are soon followed by a resumption in the battle, an incredibly powerful moment.

INTERESTING DYSTOPIAN STORY.,"Interesting dystopian story. A very depressing movie with great screenplay and cinematography including that single-shot sequences makes u feel as if u were living all those gut wrenching scenes through the eyes of the character.
However, the ending fails to give much of a resolution to me. Hahah. But well done.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Doesn't quite deliver on a promising opening,"Writing in 2023 about a film from 2006, lets get something out of the way first. Prescience. The portrayal of a Britain that vilifies illegal immigrants and suffers huge disruption after a mystery illness is far too close to reality for comfort. Children of Men is set in 2027 and I really hope I don't watch again in 4 years time and see even more similarities.Anyway, onto the film.Alfonso Cuaron sets up a perfect dystopian nightmare in a world where childbirth simply stopped 18 years previously. Britain is a police state rife with dangers from law enforcement and revolutionaries.Clive Owen is well cast as a desperate, damaged government worker who still has a flicker of rebellion in him. Michael Caine plays against type as a caring old hippy but pulls it off brilliantly. Julianne Moore brings class as the ex-partner who wants help with a situation that might change the world.But after a dramatic peak at the end of the first act, the film loses energy. Different, less convincing characters come to the fore, and we are left with a rather pedestrian travelogue, before an incendiary climax that relies too much on biblical imagery to be entirely convincing.Two flashy single-shot scenes will raise heart rates among cineastes, but ultimately the storytelling is a little too loose to hit the mark.PS car buffs will enjoy the weird selection of modified cars. Including a Renault Avantime that they actually added rear doors to!",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Awful and without any coherent storyline or resolution,"I am a female college student in computer science who likes distopian movies, action movies, etc. Me and other grads (mostly guys) went to see this because of good reviews. This movies was so bad that I am simply shocked that it has such good reviews. The storyline is absolutely incoherent, the causes and actions of people make no sense, there is no resolution. Even the whole idea of infertility is really not justified with anything coherent.And after the movie, the longer you think about it, the more you realize how bad it is.Please, do not waste your money.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Masterpiece!,"Cuaron and Lubenzky team talent together always its out of this world, the acting its epic, Clive Owen made an amazing roll, and all the actors are amazing, the long takes are outrageous and the DP is beautiful, highly recommended!",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Disjointed, Bogs Down too much and does not Rise above average","If you can get through the first 22 minutes the story line and action pick up however, this does not compensate for a very implausible but interesting story line in a world that we know is dying from over population and where all the animals seem to still propagate quite well Solid acting by Clive Owen in the lead role and very touching believable acting by an unfortunately unbilled Clare Hope Ashitey in the role of Kee and some great believable supporting acting and all too brief appearances of Sir Michael Caine This was my second time watching this film and it was so bad the first time I didn't even remember seeing it til 35 minutes into the film – still, all in all it's not a total waste of a rainy afternoon to pop it in the DVD and fast forward to 20 minutes – you don't miss much if any important back ground. The depths of depravity desperate people will sink to is portrayed well in this film but I don't think enough time was devoted to the causation to make it believable and to connect the beginning, middle and end of the film – too disjointed – perhaps better directing would have helped – perhaps fewer screenwriters being involved – 5 is just overkill -- I don't know but it cannot rise above a low average film to me Surprising plot twist in the first battle for the unborn Baby Doe and mother Kee helps move the film along – despite some good, very interesting scenes, Children of Men just bogs down way too much.The elementary school scene is good but could be better – and when she says what is world without children's voices (even though I'm not wild about kids) it made me stop and think and this film also has what I think is one of the most moving scenes ever where soldiers stop fighting – gunfire ceases and total reverent silence ensues at the cry of an infant STILL it does not save this movie from an overall rating of a 5 – it's a very average action/drama",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Missed opportunity,"This feels like a missed opportunity. I suspect that there was enough in the story and, quite possibly, enough material left in the edit suite, to make this a really top class film. Unfortunately, the director opted for a heavy handed message (hey kids  war's bad, OK?) and a basic chase movie with a few interesting ideas chucked in, instead of a lot of interesting ideas and thoughts with some chases and explosions thrown in.Ultimately, it is actually a good film, which looks great and has well-judged performances, particularly from Clive Owen. I'd absolutely say it was worth watching. It is just disappointing that it could not exploit the full potential of the premise, so you tend to focus on what the movie doesn't do rather than what it does.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Situationally realistic,"For apocalyptic stories, this is one draws you into an amazing flowing cinematic adventure. First part is a little slow, but then the reveal and the pace and intensity increases to the end, Granted you have to buy into the situation of the world. Given that, the events are about as gripping and realistic as any film I've seen. There are long uncut scenes with high levels of coordinated action that are well worth watching. Situationally realistic is an understatement.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Tell him he's a fascist pig,"Great story, strong characters, excellent performances. The long shots are beautifully intense and intimate. The well-written narrative allows for Cuaron's dystopian commentary on the police state, illegal immigration, environmental pollution and the rise of religiosity in times of crisis. Some of the scenes are a little unrealistic but do not take away from the experience. Worth a watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
May not be what you're looking for - heads up,"When I first heard about Children of Men's plot I got totally hooked. The idea of a world where humans can't have babies anymore is fascinating and could lead to great speculations/explanations. Certainly a concept for a fantastic science fiction story.Well, that's not what it is.This movie could be described simply as a big runaway. After a few short introductory minutes some characters get together and begin a runaway (from a few parties and groups)that will be the essence of the movie.So there's no speculation about what's happening with humanity? The answer is no. Expect no ""why""s at all. Also do not expect to have to think anytime during or after the movie.Children of Man's story ignores so much the fertility issue that it could be easily transplanted to any other war-like/runaway context without major adaptations (besides the motive of the runaway, which by the say is no big deal at all).The reason for the movie's background of a chaotic society is also left blank. All the poverty, contrasts, and the imminence of a civil war are left untouched. Some people use the word ""dystopia"" here, but this is way too much generosity for me. It would take a much more solid context to transform this empty background in a dystopia.Don't misunderstand me, the movie is well done. I would dare describing it as the famous first minutes of Saving Private Ryan stretched to a full length movie, and that's a compliment.However I felt totally cheated by this movie's marketing. By relying so much on the fertility mystery it induced people to believe it was a different movie than it really is.If you're looking for a clever and complex sci-fi story, look somewhere else.If you're looking for an action movie with lots of car chases, killing and explosions, then this movie is for you.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
This is the tale of Humanity,"Children of Men was on my wishlist since a long time, finally I managed to watch it. And boy I was delighted. The movie is so emotional especially considering the refugee crisis going on now. This movie highlighted both good and evil sides of the humanity in such way that many other movies are simply not able to do. This film will be certainly in my top 10 movies.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Amazing,Amazing cinematography and story.The story tells of a world were women have somehow become infertile and it's been over a decade since the last baby was born. The main character is a former activist and is recruited on a journey to bring a special young women to the human project.The camera work in this film is absolutely amazing. The film has a good mix of hand held shots and some not but works really well together. There are also some very impressive long shots were scenes and actors are chaotic but the camera does not cut. The movies score was also good.The story also touches on the topic of how many countries controversial ways of dealing with immigrants and refugees.All in all I loved watching this movie. Especially if you are a fan of cinematography then I would recommend you to try out this movie.,9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Great effort, doesn't work completely though","I was really looking forward to see this film. The plot sounded like one of the most interesting in a long time and Cuaróns ""Y tu mamá también"" is one of my favourite movies. I'm kind of sorry to admit that the film itself didn't work out as well as I expected. ""Children of Men"" is great as a cinematic experience. It's beautifully shot in depressing colors, painting a future that has maybe already begun. Even if there might be one ""Report Illegal Immigrants"" sign too many, this future vision works as a thinking experiment and lets us all reflect about the time we are living in.What did not work for me is the story itself. I can't help myself, but this whole birth/pregnancy/baby protecting/hunting thing could just never compete with the look and the setting of the movie. Even if all the actors do a great job (especially Clive Owen), the story just lacks credibility within Cuaróns 2029 world. Nevertheless, I would recommend the movie because of its courage, the acting and the beautiful look. It just could have been so much more...",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
world building dream,The most impressive element of this movie is the world building! every frame illuminates a new detail of the world in which the characters live and how it contrasts to our own.Every member of the cast performs very well. conveying the drastic situation. this movie is commended often for its one take sequences of action but one super fascinating aspect of these scenes is watching Clive Owens character find new objectives and accomplish them throughout these scenes without the need for cutaway shots or explanatory dialogue. it is partly due to his constant awareness in these scenes that the audience can follow the action.the premise is unique and extremely well executed. shocking and disturbing in the same way as bird box or the myst. the violence in this movie can be triggering because of its sudden and immediate nature. which is perhaps different from the cartoonish violence of other action movies.,9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
