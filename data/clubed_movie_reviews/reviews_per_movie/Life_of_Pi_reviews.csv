A glorious film.,"It's a shame that I didn't see this at the cinema, I can only imagine what a treat for the senses this was on the big screen. A visual masterpiece, and an intoxicating story of belief and friendship.You must give so much credit to the team that produced this, not a book I would have thought easy to adapt, as it is so vague, the realisation is of course breathtaking, I absolutely loved it.I've read comments about those that wanted action and dramatic scenes, this film isn't about the destination, it's about the journey.Breathtaking, 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Very impressed,"I was lucky enough to see Pi in full 3D Imax at a pre-viewing in San Diego last night, and as a huge fan of the book, I was intensely satisfied.Believe it or not, I was more impressed with the the casting choices and performances of the players than by the effects. Granted, the movie was very beautiful, but in the end, Life Of Pi was more character driven than anything. Suraj Sharma as the young Pi was charming, funny, and incredibly engaging, while Irrfan Khan as the older Pi was fantastically genuine and warm. Adil Hussain as Pi's father was also a joy to watch. The characters are so rich and full of life that you really can't help but fall in love with them. I would also like to add, as someone who spends time with tigers on a daily basis, the animators did a wonderful and accurate job of bringing Richard Parker to life and making him the active and vital character that is so incredibly essential to the success of this story.I would recommend seeing Pi in 3D, but I don't think that's it's essential to your viewing enjoyment. The 3D just takes a beautiful film and makes it a little bit nicer. Also, if you've read the book and are concerned that the story you loved may have been compromised in anyway, worry no longer. This is easily, one of the best book to film adaptations I have ever seen.Happy viewing folks. I hope you enjoy this film as much as I did. I'll be seeing it again in theaters very soon.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Powerful storytelling and splendid performances presented in a brilliant 3D,"With his latest movie, ""Life of Pi"", Ang Lee further establishes himself as one of the greatest contemporary movie directors. Starting from his Taiwanese beginnings, and his highly enjoyable, family-harmonizing ""Father Knows Best"" trilogy (1992-1994), through his Academy Award winning works on gracefully choreographed, highly spiritualized Far East martial arts tour de force ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" (2000, best foreign-language film) and on an uncommon yet nostalgic portrayal of the Old West in ""Brokeback Mountain"" (2005, best director), to his other titles like ""Sense and Sensibility"" (1995), ""The Ice Storm"" (1997), and ""Lust, Caution"" (2007), quality and Kubrick-like versatility shown in his movies offer continuous attraction for wide audience of his admirers.Lee's latest and, so far, easily, greatest movie, ""Life of Pi"" is based on a screenplay adapted from the acclaimed fictional adventure novel written by Canadian author Yann Martel.Throughout his childhood, due to matching pronunciation of French word ""piscine"" (pool, swimming pool) and English word ""pissing"", Piscine Molitor Patel, named that way after later abandoned Parisian swimming pool, so predictably suffers from being nicknamed ""Pissing Patel"". In order to avoid it, once in high school he finally shortens his name to Pi Patel... Nowadays middle-aged Pi tells the story of his life to a visiting writer, apparently a book author Yan Martel's alter ego, who is seeking for the literal inspiration. Retrospectively, Pi divides his childhood and adolescence into three segments. In the first segment he gives shorter account of his life until the age of 16, describing his interaction with his family and schoolmates, in particular his relationship with his father and a girlfriend, concentrating on his exploits of God and spirituality, meandering between multitude of religious practices while in the last one he briefs about his testimonial given to officials from the Japanese Ministry of Transport, investigating the reasons why the ship his family was relocating on from India to Canada sank. Most detailed, and therefore the longest, is recollection of his 227 days in a lifeboat, an extraordinary ordeal he went through after the ship has capsized and everybody else, crew and passengers, diedWell, everybody human, but not everybody living. Namely, a number of terrestrial animals from their discontinued family zoo, offered for sale and brought along with other family belongings, have survived, too. But, not for long, because, while confined in the most limited space as they were, surrounded by vastness of the ocean, the law of the ""survival of the fittest"" prevails, takes its tall, and pretty soon Pi finds himself in a company of a single one topping the food-chain, a Bengal tiger curiously named Richard Parker.Not to reveal the story further, it is with greatest pleasure to inform that cinematic excellence has been achieved in several categories: in an engaging tale—whether allegory or depiction of realistic, believable events, filled with protagonist's rarely matched curiosity, imagination and his often reasonably unanswered doubts, encouraging the same in viewers—of an uncommon character, indeed, brought to on-screen life by outstanding performances from two contributing leads, remarkably presented via ubiquitous, yet inconspicuous animation, exceptional, CGI aided visuals and superb usage of 3D photography, all along complemented with an uplifting score. All these assets work seamlessly together in unfolding an intense relationship between Pi and Richard Parker, complex yet basic, difficult yet simple, initially charged with Pi's dreadful fear, swiftly shifting to respectful care, instantly boosting his never overbearing confidence and relentlessly improving his survival skills. Wholesome artistic experience reaches and maintains its pinnacle particularly in clever tactics and constructive survival techniques 16-year old Pi uses—amply benefiting from his instructive lifestyle of a zoo owner's attentive son, certainly well acquainted with animal psychology—to suppress the fear and convincingly impose himself as an equal to the one of the most elaborate ""killing machines"" among mammals, desperately striving for his own survival, nevertheless, generously, for survival of his seemingly sufficiently tamed companion, but still, initially and ultimately, magnificent adversary, Richard Parker, as well.""Life of Pi"" is, certainly, one of the most impressive movies of 2012, year that has just come to a close.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The most imaginative film this year,"''I had to tame him,'' (Pi) realizes. ''It was not a question of him or me, but of him and me. We were, literally and figuratively, in the same boat."" From Life of Pi by Yann Martel.You will see no more imaginative film this year than Life of Pi, whose conceit of a young Indian boy stranded with a Bengal Tiger in a lifeboat amid the Pacific Ocean is fantastical yet real in its metaphoric implications. While the framing device of a story told to a stranger uses the old flashback, the lonely lifeboat is as new as any story told in the last century.The film begs interpretation from the multiplicity of religions to the place of mankind in a hostile, Darwinian world. Ultimately the benign brotherhood of beasts and humans is affirmed not so much by lofty philosophy but by the necessity of man and beast working together to survive.The digital rendering of animals, especially the Bengal Tiger, is beautiful to behold. The opening scene in Pi's family zoo could be right out of Terence Malick's visionary camera, a montage of nature gorgeous in its simplicity. The several formalistic shots of the boat at night are worthy of the best lighting in the best aquariums in the world. Together with the impressive use of 3D, director Ang Lee has visually taken us from the opulence of Crouching Tiger and the minimalism of Brokeback Mountain into a fusion world of fancy and reality. The images are stunning.In the end, Lee is interested in the individual's place in the universe as he struggles to harness nature and yet live in harmony with these elements. The conflict with the gross cook aboard the Japanese cargo ship taking Pi's family and animals to Canada is emblematic of the challenges facing the gifted with the groundlings. Pi's relationship with tiger ""Richard Parker"" represents all mankind's struggle to live in harmony with the forces it cannot control.""Believing in everything is the same as believing in nothing,"" says Pi's father because Pi samples religions from Hinduism and Buddhism to Catholicism and Judaism and wants them all. Although it is not given to us to have them all, Pi's piety practically makes us believers in the universal brotherhood.The Life of Pi is everyone's life; the film is one of the best of the year and, even remembering the greatness of The Old Man and the Sea, Moby Dick, and Billy Budd, the best you will ever see about a boy, a tiger, and a boat.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Probably the Most Complete Film of the Year,"The movie narrates an incredible story using the most beautiful special effects and great actors.It is more that a survival story and it is not about friendship. This story is about faith. Director Ang Lee use all the tools he have to make this movie about a solitary young man not a boring one. It is narrated by both, young Pi and the Adult Pi, it uses music all the time so there is not space for uncomfortable silents and the rhythm of the scenes is fast. The result a very entertained film.The most important thing of this film is it character. It is obvious because we are seeing for almost 2 hours just one character. So it is not only important to have a great character that appeals to the audience feelings, but to have an actor that portray this person the right way. Suraj Sharma was brilliant as Pi. He can make happy scenes as equal as sad, desperate, hopelessness, exhaustion and anger ones. Very few movies allow an actor represent so many emotions.But if Pi is a good character, Richard Parker can only be describe as unique. The tiger as personality of it's own. Not many films can make an animal with so many human features and yet never stop being a wild animal. This tiger is computed animated but the audience will barely notice, because the way it walks, eats, its factions, the eyes. It doesn't matter if it is computer animation, Richard Parker is alive and is his own character just as important as Pi is.If you think that ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" have good animal effects, you have to see how this people make a zebra, a hyena and a orangutan. All this, combine with a photography created by the same guy that make ""Tron: Legacy"" looks so cool and ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" so beautiful, Claudio Miranda, makes it an incredible experience to see.This movie is definitely an Oscar runner for Special Effects, Cinematography, Director and Movie of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Breathtaking cinema,"When I heard that the film adaptation of LIFE OF PI was being released, I made sure to go and read the novel beforehand so I could compare it to the movie. I'm not a huge fan of Ang Lee and his overrated CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect with this. But I needn't have worried; this is a great movie, a film that fully explores the splendour of cinema and on-screen storytelling, and a film that's better than the book.The early and, quite frankly, boring parts of the novel are summarised well so that the storytelling is always on the move. The focus is on the survival narrative, which is as it should be, and the relationship between Pi and Richard Parker is brought to vivid and moving life. Sure, there are the occasional mis-steps along the way, like an ill-advised and tacked-on romance, but for the most part they get it right. The CGI is wondrous, especially the animals and an eye-popping shipwreck, and the story is moving, tender in places and full of heart. I'm not ashamed to say I had tears in my eyes in parts, and it's all down to Richard Parker, who must go down as one of the great animal characters in cinema. A great example of filming the unfilmable.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Great movie, but a great director!","Few movies will leave a lasting impression on you..Life of Pi is one of those. Not even a single moment is dull, in fact the story is woven so tightly that you never realize that the script is so simple. It is beautifully directed and kudos to Ang Lee, not only was he able to capture the beauty of India, he was also able to get the best of the actors. Though it does not rank too high on 3D, its just visually mesmerizing. My trust and faith in Ang Lee has gone up to the highest level after watching this movie..Luckily I was able to catch the premiere show and will continue to relish the after effects of the movie for the next few days!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
If you're expecting enlightenment...,"I read ""Life of Pi"" a couple of years ago while I was touring around Europe and I found it to be a mildly-entertaining book which touched lightly on the philosophical side. It was no surprise to me then, when I discovered Ang Lee's faithful film adaptation to be exactly that - mildly entertaining, touching lightly on the philosophical side.I believe a lot of people came to watch this movie with many different expectations, from those who wanted to watch a realistic sea-survival movie, contrasted by those who believed it would offer something truly deep and significant philosophically. Both these camps will be disappointed. As Jonathan Romney says in the IOS review ""Life of Pi is fatally scuppered by coy, bogus mysticism."" Conversely, as you will read on the message boards here at IMDb (spoilers abound there, be forewarned!) a lot of people couldn't even handle the philosophy-lite that was on offer and were ""disappointed"" that it wasn't the straight- forward boy-lost-at-sea-with-a-tiger story it falsely claimed to be (*deep breath*). Hey everybody, this film will not change your life. It will provide you with some inoffensive entertainment for a couple of hours, and probably little more.""Life of Pi"" - whether in book-form or in this adaptation - is neither high art, nor gruelling adventure. What it actually is is a fantasy story, framed at the edges with a smidgeon of realism in an attempt to add a soupçon of depth and food-for-thought. Approach the film as such and you may well enjoy it.As a heavily CGI-ed film it provides at times a stunning visual work. Again reviewers have been mixed, some claiming that the over-playing of visuals falls into the garish, and attempts to wash over the philosophical shallowness of the movie. Well, CGI is the trend today; it has some benefits, but the overall effect of digitally rendering your characters and sceneries is bound to leave something missing soul-wise. ""Life of Pi"" is pretty enough to look at, but personally I think much more could and would have been made of it if it was adapted as an (classic style) animation.I'd mark the film as 6.5 (it made my partner cry), but I'm rounding down this time because of the sudden wave of sycophancy present on IMDb, meaning that every film that comes out has 8-point-something (corporate presence?). Either way, a pleasant break from Hollywood aggression, and worth a watch.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
A visually opulent triumph of film-making!,"Ang lee's life of pi is an adaptation of a 'Man booker prize winner' novel by the same name, written by Yann Martel. It's a story set in the late seventies of an Indian teenager (Pi Patel) who is stranded on a life boat in the pacific. What distinguishes this tale of survival from the rest is that the author dishes out a delicious slice of creativity in giving the castaway, a tiger for a companion. Yes, like the posters and trailers have you believe, there is a boat on which a man and a tiger have to live! This makes 'life of pi' not only a story of human struggle against nature but also a profound tale that questions 'what separates man from beast?'. More interestingly, 'when does man become a beast'?But worry not, Ang Lee's movie does not force you think on these lines , instead it's a film that lets you enjoy it on so many levels. If you are just looking for a beautiful 3D movie to feast your eyes , Life of pi can be it. If you are in a mood for a thrilling adventure epic on weekend, this is the right ticket. If indeed, you want to experience something thoughtful, Life of pi never forces you on a particular thought, instead it whispers ever so slightly to think about matters of human disposition and finding comfort in convention while caressing your senses with fabulous visuals and background score.Suraj Sharma debuts as pi with utter sincerity while Irfan Khan(as adult pi) and Tabu(as mother) do justice to their parts. The rest of the supporting cast blend in perfectly too. Ang lee helms the film with difficult source material with absolute grace and expertise. However there are two true heroes that make Life of Pi work. Firstly the studio and creative director behind the magnificent CGI. The Bengal tiger is perhaps the best animated animal ever created! The angry green eyes, richly textured orange –white striped skin and every hair on its fur look rich and full of life in 3D.And then when your hear the thunderous roar for the first time, you will realize this is as real as it can get! The rest of the animals (a Zebra, an orangutan) look great too. The lovely blue ocean and its resident creatures are the jewel in the crown. The other hero is the writer David Magee(screenplay) who adapts the novel with near perfection. One gripe the fans of the novel might have is the lack of all the gore descriptions and a particular chapter that deals with the surviving 'French cook'. The addition of these might have pleased the audience who sought for the philosophical undertones from the story but the film would have lost out on the large PG-13 crowd (a fair deal considering the enormous budget).Life of Pi, is a rare masterpiece that stands as a prototype not only for a perfect book adaptation and a 3D movie( sorry avatar, you have just been replaced), but also for a movie based on intricacies of human nature . Now that is simply an impressive triumph of film-making!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Life of Pi is a visual spectacle, Irrfan Kahn's best","There are a lot of positive and admirable things about Ang Lee's latest Life of Pi. Cinematographer Claudio Miranda captures the most uproarious and glorious shots captured this year thus far. The 3D effects are some of the best ever seen and feels absolutely necessary in a film so heavy handed with religious tones. What Mychael Danna achieves in Lee's film has just placed him in the forefront of great film composers working today. He continues to impress with his musical range, envelopes the film's message and thematic narrative in somber and beautiful melodic notes. On Visual Effects alone, Life of Pi will likely land a nomination for Best Picture. What Lee invents with the ocean and the integration of the tiger and the other animals is spectacular. He allows the mood of the film and the imagery to marry each other in a ceremonial experience that stands next to Sci-Fi epics like Avatar (2009) and Hugo (2011).Newcomer Suraj Sharma puts a valiant effort in the role of ""Pi,"" a performance that may land him more critical and impressive roles in the future. The work is reminiscent of great breakthrough performers like Rudy Youngblood (Apocalypto, 2006) and Dev Patel (Slumdog Millionaire, 2008); both were impressive turns but sadly will not catch any awards attention. Irrfan Kahn, who has delivered in great supporting turns like The Namesake (2006) and A Mighty Heart (2007), could have his best chance ever for serious awards attention. His hurdle will be a minimal screen presence and a supporting actor race that's crowded with ""movie stars.""Lee directs the film with a firm hand. He knows what he wants to say and for the most part gets his message across. Unfortunately an unfocused and at times jumbled screenplay by the great David Magee creates an atmosphere that relies more on the visuals then the narrative. Also, I'm unfamiliar with the book by Yann Martel, never read it before, so I have nothing to compare it to but much of the story's elements of surprise feel rather cheap and ill-fitting. Not sure how it will play with others but the film remains pretty consistent on the entertainment sector.Lee explains his preparation for the film at the New York Film Festival with such passion and delight. He speaks about getting Sharma properly prepared by placing him on a boat in the middle of the ocean and meeting a real life shipwreck survivor; Lee's love for the project comes through, all four years in the making. It's a directorial achievement that the Director's branch of the Academy could easily get behind.The film lands solidly on the front door of awards season with ease and could rally a loyal legion of followers. Look out for the National Board of Review to kick it offI can almost put money on it.Read more reviews @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Absolutely Jaw-Dropping,"Just finished watching the Midnight Premiere. Did not disappoint one bit. The Acting is incredibly believable, and the ending ties it all together. The story sorta drags in the beginning, but Ang Lee did a good job keeping my attention to the film. The Animation is incredibly realistic. I couldn't tell the difference between what was real and what wasn't. Not one moment did I doze off. Definitely worth 127 minutes of your life. Ang Lee, you did an outstanding job. To the Cast, you all did excellent. I am very satisfied! Although there were a lot of pros, there were some cons. At one point the Format of the Film switched from 16:9 to 4:3, but that might have been the projector at the Cinemark I attended. I also noticed some of the animations of animals started to go off screen and you could see the animated objects in the black area of the Wide Screen part (I'm assuming that was for the 3D, but I watched it in 2D so it looked sketchy). But it's minor. An average viewer won't even notice it, I'm an aspiring filmmaker, and I notice the little things!! I enjoyed the film, and you will too. 9/10. Worth it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
A Beautiful But Flawed Film,"Life of Pi is a difficult movie to review.Certain to be one of the year's most widely-discussed films, in part because it's open to multiple interpretations, this is a bold cinematic achievement by Oscar-winning director Ang Lee.Yet, it's also fundamentally flawed, its most puzzling script gaps camouflaged by extraordinary special effects and first-rate performances by the actors who portray the lead character at different stages of his life. Indeed, the varied imagery and wide range of emotional demands upon the actors are so compelling that one might actually overlook the glaring contradiction within the film's most intriguing question — which deals with the storyteller's relationship with God. The film is such a powerful visual spectacle that the audience deserves an equally consistent storyline — and ultimately just as satisfying a payoff — which compliments the arduous endurance test of sitting through what feels like an overly-long 2 hour and 20 minute epic journey across the world's biggest ocean.First, the basics. ""Pi"" is an Indian boy who enjoys an almost idyllic childhood. His early years are spent in a tropical seaside paradise located on the coast of the Indian Ocean. Pi's family owns and operates a zoo with several exotic animals.When Pi becomes a teenager, his father decides to disband the zoo and move the entire family abroad. This leads to a life-changing adventure. To its credit, the story challenges many conventional assumptions about new immigrants. We assume immigrants are thrilled to be in a new homeland. But that's not always the case. After all, what child wants to be uprooted from a house near the beach, living happily among zoo animals — as is the case with Pi? I found this to be a powerful message — no doubt experienced by many very real immigrant children — which I had frankly never considered before. Sometimes, immigrants leave happy lives behind when forced to move elsewhere due to circumstances beyond their control.The family and their prized zoo animals set off to Canada, which is to become their new home. Pi and his family board a cargo ship scheduled to cross the Pacific Ocean, with several wild animals from what had been the family zoo boarded in steerage.A deadly typhoon changes everything. During the storm, Pi is thrown into an open lifeboat and is ultimately forced to survive on his own at sea. To make matters worse, but undoubtedly more interesting for the audience, some wild animals manage to find sanctuary inside the lifeboat with the terrified Pi. One of the animals that climbs aboard is a vicious Bengal tiger.The story is entirely plausible up to this point. In the interest of avoiding spoilers for those who have not seen the movie, let's just say Pi and his beastly companion end up spending many months at sea together locked in a battle for supremacy and survival. As one can imagine, the demands which would be extraordinary were Pi sailing solo are magnified tenfold by the presence of a wild beast that views everything on the boat as his next tasty meal.One thing which can be revealed is that Pi somehow manages to survive the ordeal. The story is told in flashbacks by an older and wiser Pi, ostensibly living somewhere in Canada in the present day. These segments introduce the film's most puzzling assertion.The movie includes strong religious overtones throughout. Pi's early years are spent searching for God and the right religion to join. This is a pervasive theme throughout all stages of the film — setting up the central character's most poignant moment of self-discovery. This takes place when the adult Pi, now in his early 40s, reveals to the listener that the perilous sea voyage enabled him to better know and understand God. The reflection is largely positive.Alas, Pi spends considerable time praising God as his savior at sea. After all, the necessities for survival were ultimately provided to him.And therein lies the glaring contradiction. Pi reveres the same God who essentially murdered his entire family, needlessly sent dozens of innocent animals off to a torturous and terrifying death, and transformed him into an orphan in a strange land — not to mention having to endure a terrorizing ordeal on the high seas for 227 days. If God is to be praised for providing precious food and water at opportune moments while exposed at sea for months on end, shouldn't the same divinity also bear the blame for causing so much death and misery in the first place? ""Gee God — thanks for the tuna and rainwater. I guess that's payback for drowning my giraffe, two elephants, plus my mom and dad."" Moreover, the beautiful imagery becomes something of a distraction. Several short interludes interrupt Pi's struggle at sea, which show off a kaleidoscope of splendor. Unfortunately, these scenes in no way serve to advance the story nor answer any of the fundamental questions and judgments which Pi is entitled to make following his experience.Life of Pi is not a film for children. It's being promoted as an action-adventure with a boy as the star, and various animals as the supporting cast. But these are not Disney animals. They are wild beasts capable of killing in an instant. There are several scenes of savagery, which left may children screaming and crying in the showing I attended. For those expecting to see Beauty and the Beast at sea, think again.In summation, this is a spectacular cinematic achievement, which will undoubtedly be rewarded at Oscar time. Deservedly so.Everyone will take away something different away from this movie. My interpretation is that life — even when filled with the prospect of danger and death — can be mesmerizing, even beautiful. However, as a spiritual awakening, this is a movie which cannot be rescued. That message remains aimlessly adrift at sea.www.nolandalla.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Life Of Pi = Best (Art + Story Telling + VFX),"According to mythology the journey of life is splayed with different forms of hurdles, the path to salvation lies in standing tall against such hurdles even if the Gods are callous to your understanding. By maintaining hope we try to live up to their expectation, knowing that God will guide us if we keep fighting on our endeavor for greater good. That's pretty much the whole and soul of the movie. Opened first time in India at IFFI 2012 Goa, I was in the mix of lucky few who got to watch the repeat show of this 3D movie adapted from Yann Martel's book of same title.Piscine Molitor(Pi) Patel as he was named after a swimming pool by his dear uncle apparent by his ardent love for the same. Piscine is born Hindu in Pondicherry India, but as he levels a understanding he begins to peek into other religion and sooner he starts endorsing Christianity and Islam also. His father, a zoo owner pounces upon a chance of relocating the zoo to Canada. On their way to far west with animals on a Japanese ship, tragedy struck on a murderous stormy night capsizing the ship with Pi and a Royal Bengal Tiger left to see the remains. And so the adventures journey of innocent young boy with life threatening feline animal begins.There was the thunderous applause from the audiences when the tiger gives his first appearance in the safety boat. Spending months to produce the Tiger didn't go waste too, he looked inch perfect and the way he has been handled in the movie is exquisite. The first few scenes are reminiscent of old India with bullock carts, later the landscape changes and so do the people. The characters of hot blooded modern day father, the supporting mother and the story involving the tender love between the protagonist and the girl are delightful however short they may be. The innocence of young Pi through his school years and his introduction to motley of faiths sets up the foundation to his uncanny characterization. But the real fun starts when they are both lost at sea and Pi tries assortment of ideas to keep him as well as the Tiger alive. The movie is never complete without the mention of adequately yet delicately used VFX. It would really be a shame to put into words those magnificently shot sequences and the scale on which the art work is done. This movie epitomizes the correct com-mixture of story with special effects. I could gather so many 'wows' while I was myself devouring on the same scenes. The humor is well prevalent and does lighten up the few still scenes between the two.Suraj Sharma plays the most significant role in the movie with all his efforts and he wins it in the end. The guy is awesome handling some tough intense scenes in the movie. Irfan Khan playing the narrator as well as the older Pi shows his maturity in the business, patient with the small parts he never misses his character and his narration and dialog's delivery is to die for. Adil Hussain as Pi's father is superb with his character and does contribute a hell lot. Other actors contribute evenly including the computer generated zoo animals. Real salute to the art directors of the movie for putting up such beautiful pictures on screen. Ang Lee is as always incomparable with his cinema, he has definitely reached shore with this movie and a more versatile director in my book.The older promises the character he is narrating that he will prove him that God exists, well did he or not? For that you have to wait for that amazing climax scene. This is art, storytelling and VFX at his best in a single movie. Who would want to miss that??",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"""This is a picture of sheer power and beauty""","Life of Pi is one of the most marvelous theater experiences I've had all year. Its Oscar for art direction and cinematography should already be locked in. It's a film of incorruptible beauty and deeply satisfying drama which squeezes so much power and emotion out of its audience that they leave feeling riveted at the same time drained. You can bet the film's main character feels the exact same way.Our main character is an adult named Piscine Molitor, who goes by the name ""Pi Patel,"" and we meet him as an adult (played by Irrfan Khan) who begins telling his long life-story to a writer planning to adapt it (Rafe Spall). It's a story that tested him as a person in every possible way, and it all goes back to when his parents made the decision to move from India to Canada, and because Pi's father was a zookeeper, take many animals such as orangutans, zebras, goats, and tigers with them on an enormous ship across the Pacific Ocean. Before this move, Pi was an optimistic soul, who ventured out as a young boy beyond his comfort zone in his Hindu religion to seek out other walks of faith, specifically Christianity and Islam, which he began following all at once.During the move, a wild, violent storm hits the ocean, flooding the ship and sending Pi, a zebra with a broken leg, a hyena, an orangutan, and a tiger named ""Richard Parker"" on a lifeboat, leaving behind the several other animals and Pi's entirely family. This whole sequence, which lasts around five minutes, feels like the entire movie The Perfect Storm shortened from its original two-hour length, only it emphasizes the emotional elements. This is one of the saddest scenes of the year, as we see a teenage Pi (now played by Suraj Sharma) desperately hold onto the lifeboat for dear-life, while being washed away from his mother, father, and siblings and there is absolutely nothing he can do about it. Between you and I, reader, this is one of the most emotionally upsetting scenes (this and the ending of the film) I've ever sat through in a theater.Now, Pi is stranded in the middle of the Pacific, with an open sky, four different animals, until they are picked off with only the tiger remaining, and his own will to live. The remainder of the film forgoes the back-and-forth narrative between adult Pi telling the story to the writer, but remains focused on his own recollection of events on that lifeboat and the acts of bravery he committed to keep him and the tiger alive. While Pi and Richard Parker are sharing the boat, that does not mean they get along. Writer David Magee makes no mistake in illustrating that while they are stranded together, Pi is a human boy and Richard Parker is a Bengal tiger. The beauty of this picture is that it never mistakes that the only common traits between these two souls is that they are stranded together and both are mammals.Life of Pi's visuals are astounding. Long shots that hold on the vast emptiness of the Pacific are invigorating because of their wide range of beauty and clarity, sequences of peril and uncertainty are captured through an equally clear, vivid lens, making them all the more real and enthralling, and atmospherically, the picture shows the dangers and the loneliness of the ocean better than any film I have yet to see.Thematically, the picture focuses on predominately on the idea of survival and spirituality, which gratefully helps Pi keep hope and optimism during these gruelingly unforgiving days. One of the most intense and poignant scenes comes when Pi is faced with the task of killing a large fish. He is starving, and becoming skinnier by the day, so he fiercely grabs a fish out of the water and begins hacking at it with a small axe. When the fish is bloody and long dead, he begins to sob tears of joy and sadness; joy because he finally has a decent portion of food, yet sadness in the idea that he has killed a living creature and is about to abandon his vegetarian vow. It's a scene that, once more, clouded my eyes with tears, just like Pi's, of joy and sadness.This is a picture of sheer power and beauty. A film that clearly tests its lead actor, Sharma, who is inhabiting his first main role, and a film that will hopefully go on to live with a reputation of one of cinema's supreme achievements. It must be said that in Ang Lee's twenty year film career that he has tackled almost every genre in the medium and done so with an extraordinary amount of confidence. His directorial efforts too have not been minor additions to the genre, but true game-changers if anything. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was a martial arts film filled with depth and delight. Hulk was a superhero movie that added so much weight to its characters and relationships, you'd think Christopher Nolan's modern-day Dark Knight franchise was taking notes from it. And Brokeback Mountain was, for the most part, a lively portrayal of two men who've kept their orientation silent for so long that they begin to embrace it by meeting each other out of the blue. Life of Pi offers more of the same grandiose ideas from the brilliant visionaire and its shocking smoothness in terms of filming, placement, and writing is beyond fabulous and wildly consuming because of its clarity. This is one of the best films of the year, and on-par with the depth and cinematography in Samsara, making this year one of the most beautiful.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Sanitized Version of the Book with Melodramatic Touches,"I have just finished reading the book the other day, and today I got to watch the film version. With the book still so fresh in my head, I went into the cinema with very high expectations. This is specially so after reading and hearing reviews which call Ang Lee's cinematic masterpiece visually comparable to ""Avatar"" or emotionally comparable to ""The Little Prince,"" as well as all of the awards buzz.The book for me was a pleasant though slow read because of the lengthy wordy, even flowery, descriptions Yann Martel uses for his languid reflection on zoo life, his comparative study of Hindu, Christian and Moslem philosophy, and of course, his survival tale at sea by a teenager and a Bengal tiger sharing one lifeboat. It waxes philosophical in the beginning, then waxes fantastical in the middle, before settling for dry reality at the end. While a movie could probably improve on the imagery for each scene, there are several key parts of the novel that would entail a lot of narration. On the big screen, too much narration cannot be too good.My first assumption turned out to be true. The cinematography and visual effects were expectedly first rate and excellent. Those camera angles were breathtaking. The colors were very vibrant. The special effects regarding animals were realistic for the most part, especially the land mammals, particularly Richard Parker. Though I have to say that the water creatures were too obviously computer-generated, not too good. A most triumphant sequence in the film for me were the scenes on the floating green island of algae and meerkats. I thought that was ideally visualized and executed, so much better than that chapter of the book.My second assumptions also turned out true. A lot of the story needed to be narrated by an adult Pi Patel as he was being interviewed by a novelist researching for his next book. These bookending present day scenes were pretty dry for me. The whole last chapter of the book when Pi was interviewed by the Japanese shipping officials was all one long narration only without supporting imagery. All of this talky narration may be boring for some people.In order to make the film appeal to more people, Ang Lee spares us from gory details which the book was not averse to describing in graphic detail. In the film, the screen time of the zebra, orangutan and hyena was very short. For all the brutality that was supposed to have happened on board, Ang's lifeboat remains almost pristine white. I thought that was quite merciful of Ang. I wish I could also say the same for some sappy melodramatic scenes, like Richard Parker laying his head on Pi's lap, which were not in the book.Overall, this film version of ""Life of Pi"" is very good, but it can be disappointing for people who have read the book. It was a loyal albeit sanitized version of the book, which is not really a bad thing. The book was not exactly inspirational to me, more educational actually. For this film, Ang Lee seemingly aspired to make this movie inspirational, and these obvious efforts may prove to backfire for some audiences.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
One of the Most Beautiful Films You're Going to See,"Life of Pi (2012)**** (out of 4)Ang Lee's incredible tale of Pi Patel (Suraj Sharma), a teenage Indian boy who survives a ship sinking that kills everyone on board except for himself and a tiger. Soon the two are on board a lifeboat not knowing what their future holds. I had never heard of the novel that this film is based on and I had absolutely no idea what the film was about until about five months prior I saw a promotional piece while waiting to watch another movie. I actually went back to work joking about the picture because I couldn't believe anyone would try and make a movie about a boy, a tiger and a lifeboat but the joke is on me because Lee has created one of the more memorable, magical and uplifting films of the year. I was really shocked to see how tremendous the picture was but what makes it so special would have me giving away countless spoilers, which is something I'm certainly not going to do. I think it would be best for viewers to go into the picture knowing as little as possible but I can say that Lee has created one of the most beautiful pictures you're likely to see. The beautiful images are just so remarkable to look at that it's impossible not to get caught up in the scenery. Be it the early stuff in India or the breathtaking moments at sea, everything in this picture just lights up the screen. I'm really not a fan of CGI unless it's used properly. Too many times I think it's just used to be lazy and save money but that's not the case here as Lee perfectly mixes in the CGI with the live action stuff. The two coming together are practically flawless and that certainly helps bring one closer to the story and characters. Sharma does a terrific job and especially when you consider he'd never acted before and was basically having to carry the entire film. I was a little mixed on the 3D effects. While some where brilliant, for the most part I think the film would be viewed just fine in 2D as it would give one better colors. Still, no matter which version you see, the heart of the picture is in its soul, its character and the lessons he learns while being stuck out at sea for over two hundred days. LIFE OF PI is a really remarkable film that has so much going for it that it's clearly one of the year's best.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"A Mostly well executed, Beautiful Experience","Life Of Pi is slow, Faux artsy and Faux Deep, and not always gripping or compelling. But, most of it's missteps are outweighed by the absolute audio visual symphony it offers. Filled with beautiful cinematography and Touching music to back, It's at times fascinating and Hopeful. It's not exactly profound, could be even shallow, and it's not exactly fantastic, But it's still a fairly well made film based on a fairly well written novel.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Great visuals serve only as a distraction from a overbearingly preachy plot and shallow characters.,"I'm going to go ahead and say it outright. This film flat out takes the cake for the most overrated film of the year. This is unwarranted and uninspired Oscar bate on a Hurt Locker level. For the first time in a very long time I have actually left a movie feeling I had wasted my money.You all know the plot. A boy finds himself adrift at sea with a dangerous tiger after a horrific shipwreck. At the start of the film we are subjected to a meandering and drawn-out set up for themes and characters that do not even see a reprise or conclusion before the end of the film. It really felt like this film was stretching every scene and concept to a breaking point to fill the three hour artistic precedent established by previous Oscar winners like Return of the King. It just drags and drags until we are finally privy to the main plot. But then, the films biggest problem comes to a head: the theme.The film's theme cannot even be adequately described as it lacks any focus or objectivity. It simply comes off as an overbearing theistic agenda slathered onto an unrelated story. It presents itself as a lesson about faith, but doesn't convey this message in any other fashion than saying ""I had faith and I survived, therefore you should have faith."" As a critical thinker, I simply counter the point by demonstrating that if a faithless person was put in the same position as the main character and made the same decisions (since none of these decisions were based his faith) they would have identical outcomes. There in lies the problem: the lesson is not demonstrated through means of the story or character progression. It is literally told to you every few scenes via frequent and uninspired narration. The first rule in screen writing is a simple one: Show, don't tell. After all, film is a visual medium. Apparently the screenwriter missed the memo.What else is there to say? The acting was wooden. The score was big but not memorable. The only thing I can give to the film's credit is some beautiful cinematography and an effective use of 3D. But presentation is all for naught if the story is ineffective, and Life of Pi never once managed to grab me, move me or convince me of anything. It serves only as a colossal waste of money and time; my own and Hollywood's.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
beautiful movie,"i just watched the 3D IMAX in Taiwan. Due to i'm big fan of Ang Lee, i look forward to this movie for a long time. I'd like to say this movie totally meet my anticipation. The animation was real and beautiful, so the scene was amazing. Some scene and action taking from different views was also impressive. This movie was pretty hot and being discussed much in my country now. Some scenes are taking in Taiwan. I did not watch the book so i can't compare between book and movie. I recommend 3D caused some view will really touch you. For kids it is alright cause some bloody scene was adjusted. I think it is more than a story, there are many points worthy of thinking. Nice try and nice working of Ang Lee!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
What's one more review?!,"By the time I got to see this film, the Oscars were long past and there already were a ton of reviews for ""Life of Pi"". On top of that, I have noticed that for big pictures which most everyone likes, I rarely have much to say. After all, I agree with the majority--""Life of Pi"" is a very good film. So, my review will be brief.THE reason to watch this film is pretty simple: You cannot say that the movie reminds you of anything you've ever seen before or since. Sure, you could try comparing ""Life of Pi"" to ""Avatar""--but that is only because they both used gobs of CGI to create fantastic stories. But the story itself, is so original. In addition, the acting, direction and artistry of the movie is tops. While I would agree with the Oscar folks that ""Argo"" was a better film, it wasn't by much.

my new #1 favorite...will be rewatching it many times,"LIFE OF PI is an odyssey that has everything: love, danger, exotic locations, swimming with tigers, and the three major world religions. It is a staggering, nearly all-encompassing metaphor for life. It will strengthen your faith in God. And it is infused with beauty throughout, via director Ang Leeahhh.I think there are two ways you could take the story: first, as a kind of magical tall tale; second, as something quite a bit deeper--i.e., not superficial entertainment, but profound testimony by an overcomer in life. I'm guessing that people who are deep and have been through a lot of difficulties in their lives will probably get much more out of this movie, whereas others might not relate to or perhaps even recognize the subtext in it (and oh, how much they will miss!!!).It isn't necessary to read the book first, although it is marvelously well written. Rarely do I think a movie so good that I see it twice in 2 days, and I will go see it a third time soon--don't miss it on the big screen!!MOST HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Good,"""Life of Pi"" is a visually stunning and imaginative cinematic journey that earns its 6/10 rating through its strengths and a few noticeable weaknesses. The film's strength lies in its breathtaking cinematography and groundbreaking visual effects, which bring the remarkable story to life with unparalleled beauty and wonder. Suraj Sharma's performance as Pi is commendable, considering the challenging role he undertakes. The score by Mychael Danna enhances the emotional depth of the narrative, although some might find it a bit overpowering at times. While the film's symbolism and philosophical themes resonate with some viewers, others may find them somewhat heavy-handed, affecting the overall impact of this otherwise visually captivating and thought-provoking tale.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Amazing movie,"I gave this film 10/10 because it is really touching and lets people think about things around us. I didn't expect it that good since I haven't read the book. Probably Ang Lee's directing made me want to see how it works, but it turned out very amazing. The film is not perfect, you can see some goofs in it. It is a sight feast in terms of pictures. The whole story and journey that Pi had been through is well told, and at last Pi told a different story, which really made me think about things around us. Many times what we believed is perhaps not the truth...but when we find something that is worth to believe, we shouldn't let it go even if we may lose everything we cared about, they will come back eventually...Anyway, it is really a good movie, worth to watch!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Life of Pi,"I remember when the novel Life of Pi came out and how popular it was. I have never read the book, but have read Beatrice and Virgil, which is also by Pi author Yann Martel and was very impressed with it. The movie version of Life of Pi, was nothing short of amazing. This is a film where everything seems to be done right. As readers of my reviews know, I am not a fan of 3D, or basically even in seeing films in 3D, but to me, Life of Pi was different. The 3D was not used in a self indulgent way to showcase today's technology, or to brag about it later on like so much of Peter Jackson's later films have been. Instead the 3D in this film is done to further enhance emotions and to affect us while watching certain scenes. We often see scenes of absolute beauty and some that are frightening, or perhaps ugly, but the 3D here is put to good use and is not done in an overly flashy way. The story itself I found to be incredibly moving and also inspiring. I do not want to go into too many details about the plot, so I do not spoil it for other viewers, but this is at times a deeply spiritual film that most viewers should walk away with feeling moved and grasping things that they might not have before. That is unless they are totally hard of heart. Through the journey of the main character, Pi, he learns so many important life lessons and things he can use later on in life. The film shows that while he does go through some very difficult and challenging times, that he does not quit, or give up and has the willpower and the faith to persevere even if at times everything looks absolutely hopeless. By relying not only on himself, but a higher power he is giving this endurance and strength to keep going and even during the most agonizing and stressful of times, he still has that perseverance and does not give up. It shows us that through life's trials often something very good comes out of it. In life none of us like going through challenging, or difficult times, but I think all of us can say that through difficult situations that we have gone through that we have learned more about ourselves and have become better equipped for future situations as well. Trials often bring us closer to the things that are actually important and crucial to our lives, but on the same thought, I realize that others do not always respond to them as well and lean to things that could be detrimental to one's health such as drugs, alcohol, or sex, but what if we relied on a higher power like Pi does in the film? Being a Christian myself I know all about that. Through my life I have gone through numerous trails in my life and I know that there will be more coming, but through all of those trials, I have been able to rely on God, and while often in those situations I felt anxious, or like giving up myself, I learned that he was with me through those trials and he was not going to abandon me. Every rough, or difficult situation in life I have gotten through. No, going through it was not always easy, or fun, but at the end my relationship with God improved and it often allowed me to trust and rely on Him more. Often these trials seem to be pointing out something in our lives that we need to change about ourselves. It could be something like an addiction, or some type of sin that while it may not seem so, is actually harming us rather than bringing us joy, or pleasure and do we really need those things in our life? What if we could live doing what is good for us and to keep our bodies healthy. Wouldn't that make us both happier, healthier and more appreciative that we gave up our old ways of sin, addiction and the things that caused us to stumble. Pi grows in this film as he goes through these trials. They mature him, give him a stronger and more trusting relationship and understanding of God and helps prepare and shape him for what may come in days, weeks, or even years ahead. This was such a revelation to me seeing all this on screen. I knew all this beforehand, but who doesn't need a reminder from time to time and a little encouragement never fails to help. What was often called an unfilmable book has turned into a motion picture experience that is something that I found beautiful for the eyes, ears, senses and my soul. I felt uplifted and encouraged as I left this film. It gave me so much to think about, but also so much to be thankful for in my own life. Director Ang Lee and screenwriter David Magee have given us a beautiful film here that works as a technical achievement, but on so many other levels as well. I hope that what I have said will not have turned off people from seeing it, but rather given them a curiosity to go and see it for themselves and see what they discover, or take away from it. This is a groundbreaking achievement in cinema and for our own selves as well. Be sure to see it on the big screen while you can. One of 2012's best films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Visually Spectacular; dramatically diminutive.,"With all the hype of a bestseller novel turning into a 3D movie, Life of Pi would possibly be the highly overrated movie of the year. Of course, it greatly impresses with its verisimilitude of the digital imagery, which is painstakingly constructed with one step on the fantasy and another on reality. I think this is so far the best imagery shot/created for a oceanic film and Richard Parker, the tiger is a marvel. Though, I was initially disappointed with the narrower aspect ratio 1.85:1; would've been more spectacular in 2.35:1But, where the movie (and the Novel) falls in its entirety is the drama, which is said to be constructed in tangence to spiritual overtones which justifies the Indian milieu ; the so called philosophy it offers is so very juvenile and text-bookish, (at-least that's how it would be for an Indian); the characters so flat and sketchy and casting over the top, detailing really bad and the authenticity in the soup (Tamil Talkie parts especially). Wondering if they hired a (right) cultural consultant. And this makes the first 25 minutes terrible to watch. Yes, all this is supposed to be carried from the original content by Yann Martel (which I consider an Yawn inducer).Having read the book and unimpressed, my only reason to watch Life of Pi in cinemas was Ang Lee. The man, in one of his interviews has said, he did have an initial hesitation and did contemplate a lot before taking up this project. I think one has to follow their intuition in creative matters and wish Ang Lee did that.So, if you've read the book, you know what to expect plot wise, and you'd be anticipating Ang Lee's visual interpretation, which is sure to enthrall you. And if you have not read the book, even better, the anticipation of 'where is this leading' might keep you engaged; only that at the end when the destination arrives, you might be left unsatisfied.5/10 for the visual magnificence.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Stunning,"Life of Pi is a wonderful film; creative, troubling, moving and stunningly beautiful.It tells the highly unusual story of 'Pi' - a young boy - who is stranded at sea on a small boat after the ship on which he was a passenger sinks during a violent storm. He is not alone - sharing the tiny boat with him are a handful of animals, including a Bengal Tiger who he calls Richard Parker. They too were aboard the ship (part of a zoo being transported) and made it to the lifeboat with Pi.If this seems a rather fanciful plot, don't let it put you off. By the time you get to this part of the story you'll be well immersed in this fabulous film, and indeed such is the exceptional skill of the film makers that you'll feel well and truly onboard the boat with them.The animals are of course cgi creations, but so brilliantly done that it doesn't seem that way. The journey that unfolds takes us through moments of danger, despair, hallucination, survival and tenderness. It is utterly gripping and leads us to an understated ending that invites us to question just who or what was on that little boat.A highly distinctive, visually original and emotionally compelling film that I can highly recommend.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
It's all about suspension of disbelief...,"Every once in a while, a movie keeps you marveling at the beauty of its imagery while captivating your mind with its intellectual richness, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is such a movie where images speak a thousand words, so is ""Life of Pi"" with a difference though: it is pretty vocal about its content. To a certain degree, the film embodies the number 'Pi' whose mathematical function and simple writing are only the tip of an iceberg of infinite immensity.Still, Ang Lee's ""Life of Pi"" is a delight for the eyes before the mind, a stunt even more impressive as 2012 eyes used to think they saw it all (3 years after ""Avatar"" and less than a decade after Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings""). Some shots reminded me of that line from ""Forrest Gump"" who was running across a desert and the morning light cast such a glow that he couldn't tell where Heaven stopped and the Earth began. And ""Life of Pi"" is fertile in such shots where you can't tell the limits between the sky and the water, and it is no coincidence that the story is a metaphysical quest à la Paolo Coelho, of a boy drifting across the Pacific Ocean with a tiger, of all the companions.God is obviously the 'guy-up-there' incarnated by the skies and the stars and Pi addresses him many times by raising his head, but when the sky and the water seems to make one, which might imply that Pi can find God, or try to, by looking at the ocean or in the eye of his feline companion of misfortune. Pi was named after Piscine Molitor which was the most beautiful swimming pool his uncle ever swam in, and in the scene showing the Parisian pool, the water is so clear, the man feels like floating in the air, it is not just gratuitous effects but the display of a heavenly, ecstatic moment, where the body and the mind are in total symbiosis. This is how the uncle found God anyway.To avoid the mockeries, Piscine calls himself 'Pi' and is so motivated that he becomes a champion of the Pi number and could memorize thousands of the decimal pieces, the cheers of his comrades making up for years of urological nicknames. But don't get mislead, the film is only about mathematics if you use the Galilean metaphor of the alphabet with which God wrote the universe. This is a language Pi is eager to decrypt, driven by his childlike curiosity, Hindu myths and Gods fascinate him, so does the story of Jesus Christ who died as an innocent for all the humans' sins, and he also finds peace and serenity while recalling the name of Allah during his prayers. Pi's ecumenical openness inevitably crashes into his father's rationality.""Appa"", a zoo owner, is a practical man who doesn't believe in religion, he eats meat and would rather have a son sticking to strong opinions rather than believing in everything, being as ""irrational"" and unlimited as the like-named number. So, it's the father who puts limits in his son's idealism where he sees him trying to feed the tiger (named Richard Parker), believing animals have soul. The father proves him wrong by tying a goat to the cage and showing him how the animals deal together. Animals have no souls, it is only the reflect of humans' soul, the metaphor for religion is obvious. We only see God through our own eyes, how ironic though that the father uses a sacrifice of such heavy religious undertones to make his point. As for Pi, the matters of God are forgotten for a time.And it takes that extraordinary journey where he's stuck with the tiger and has to learn how to tame it, to feed it so it doesn't think of eating him, to state his presence, mark his territory, to establish a way to communicate with the animal, until finally, Pi concludes his metaphysical quest. The tiger becomes his enemy but also his ticket for life. I won't spoil right now how the adventure connects with God, but it is all done in that conclusive last rhetorical question, where Pi creates his own myth, which like all myths, explains a fact through a story that might sound ludicrous but whose universal appeal is undeniable. Because that's what myths are: stories that go beyond our own perceptions, that seems impossible yet challenge our thinking to such a point that their nonexistence seems as unbelievable as the opposite.While I was watching the film, I was mesmerized by the special effects, the interactions between Pi and the tiger, even with the other animals. And I was almost disappointed to learn it was CGI, it didn't look like CGI to me, for some reason, it felt ""plausible"", too beautiful to be artificial. But maybe that is the ground broken by Ang Lee. In 1914, a man shared a screen with a dinosaur, in 1964 one danced with penguins, in 1988, one was handcuffed to a rabbit, in 1993, dinosaurs came back in the form of CGI creatures, their realness was undeniable but it still asked for our suspension of disbelief. ""Life of Pi"" is the only one where the animals are meant to be and look real, that the magic of the film would take a 'normal form' to better fool us.Some would say that God was a creation by humans but maybe the idea of God is so beautiful that humans only tries to make it approachable, like God who used the figure of Jesus, or Muslims when they pray or Hindus with all their Gods. Maybe less than the form of God, is the idea itself, maybe Cinema is like religion or myths, after all, it is all about suspension of disbelief, but for a purpose that is essential to the human soul.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Average,"Hey guys,This movie overall was O.K. I found it to be a bit boring but my siblings LOVED it. The theme was alright but I feel as if the story telling was off.Suraj Sharma as the young Pi was charming, funny, and incredibly engaging, while Irrfan Khan as the older Pi was fantastically genuine and warm. Adil Hussain as Pi's father was also a joy to watch. The characters are so rich and full of life that you really can't help but fall in love with them.

Deserves a lot of praise and much more,"Before giving any review about the movie i must request everyone to watch this movie only in a 3D format because i feel it is one of the very few of the 3d movies which retains its soul despite being in 3d format and not being a mere sales technique. Life of Pi is not a story about survival as many of viewers who have and have not read the book mentioned it already. It is not a story about a cast away. It is much more than that. It is about faith, religion, endurance and most important of all relationships. I have not read the novel on which the movie is based but yet i can be pretty sure that the movie has done almost or complete justice to it. With no intentions of watching this movie i went in expecting nothing but came out thanking the ones who took me for this movie. Ang Lee has always had an incredible ability to depict human emotions in various ways and various characters which we have seen in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and Brokeback Mountain. But in this one he goes a step beyond and creates an emotion between a human and an animal. But it just doesn't end there, he adds the flavor of perfection to the movie by giving incredible visuals. Now being stranded on a sea can be a boring script especially when you have a run time of 145 minutes but Ang Lee shows us so much in that time that you end up craving for more. With exceptional visuals and incredible performance by the lead, Life of Pi is an unforgettable movie for me and it does make me believe in God. I am sure it will succeed in making a lot of other people believe. There are unforgettable moments in the movie and it is going to be extremely difficult for anyone to pick just one. But i am sure everyone will like the last ten minute of the movie which make you think and go through the movie again. I salute Ang Lee for such a beautiful depiction of the book and portraying so many beautiful things and putting the CGI and Animation to the right use. The movie is a pure piece of Art and must not be missed under any circumstances. I would really wish to see this movie in the IMDb top 250 list",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Ang Lee keeps the things in a different realm of reality which we all acknowledge does exist but perhaps are afraid to ""test the waters"" since we as human beings are conformists by nature and can not leave our ""comfort zone"" to think things in a way they should be thought of .......this is exactly why the director succeeds in drawing our attention to small but significant things which need to be understood to make the path more worthy of further discovery......Truly world class cinema with great acting and I will not hesitate in adding that the ""tiger"" who plays Richard Parker does deserve an Oscar this season .........",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
🐐,I just watched this movie again after like 5 years and it's probably my favourite movie of all time. The movies message was very powerful and almost made me cry don't forget about the immaculate cinematography.,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Marvelous,"Let's get this out of the way. I did not see this in 3-D, so I will not talk about how amazing the 3-D was. In that respect, perhaps I am able to judge the film in its own right. The story here isn't anything too different. We've had survival stories of this kind before. The film is also told as one man's recollection, and I always have a problem with this technique. It always sort of drags the film down, because instead of you being immersed in the actual story being told, films always do some back-and-forths with the story and the character recollecting the story. This film is no exception, and it kinda falls into that same trap of cheese and over-sentimentality at times. This isn't a subtle film in any way, and it's more obvious in the present scenes.Getting that out of the way, this is a truly beautiful film in every respect. The message is clear, but powerful, and on a visual level this is masterful. The cinematography isn't just brilliant because the visual imagery is brilliant (and many times that's all people think of cinematography as being) but because the sweeping scope of the photography and the many different shots create a fantastically vivid and dreamy world. Even in it's most languid scenes there's a technical mastery here not present in most films. The strongest section of the film is Pi at sea no doubt, and it's virtually perfect. However, the last 10 or 15 minutes once again cross the line where some of it just comes across corny. But I liked the purpose of where the film headed, and what the ending was for, I just wish Lee and the script hadn't hit it with so much on-the-point sentimentality.But overall, flaws and all, this is a truly fantastic film, and strongly recommended.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Made Me Wish I Could Believe in God,"I read ""Life of Pi"" years ago and remembered little of the details about the book other than that I enjoyed it. During the first half hour or so of Ang Lee's screen adaptation, I felt myself getting bored and restless. It seemed like a religious movie, a movie whose central premise was all about reaffirming a belief in God. As a non-believer, I don't begrudge films with religious themes, but I also don't really enjoy them, feeling like someone invited to a party where everyone else is speaking a different language.But then the main thrust of the story kicks in, the young boy Pi is stranded in the middle of the ocean with a lifeboat and a tiger, and I was engrossed by the beauty and spectacle that Ang Lee delivers. And then toward the end, there's a twist that I instantly remembered from the book as soon as it happens in the film, and that I can't believe I had forgotten. For that twist is what makes this film something beautiful and much more than a simple story about faith in a higher power. Instead, it becomes a story that gets much closer to the motives behind what I think drives most people to religious faith, and that is that believing in God is way more comforting than the alternative. Some people seem to be able to choose to believe, while others (like myself) simply can't, no matter how much more appealing life seems with a strong belief in a higher power. People will argue probably forever over this film's ending and what it means, but that's what it meant for me.Ang Lee needs to be commended. This film had to be a very difficult directing feat to pull off, confined as it is almost entirely to a lifeboat and a slew of CGI effects.A truly wondrous and wonderful film.Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Quite the discussion raiser,"Just before I left to see Life of Pi my cat had found a mouse in the garage. It got me to thinking about the food chain and the frailty of life. But it also got me to thinking about why we value one life so differently from the next. Something as simple as the size of an animal can determine how much we care for that animal. No one gives it a second thought if they find a mouse dead in the street, but if they come across a giraffe or an elephant, (which probably have a fifth of the character) in the same state, it'll bother them to no end. It was an amazing coincidence for me then, when the movie had an element of these themes about it too. It took it even further making us question one's faith and even questioning the legitimacy of what we've just seen.Life of Pi is told from the point of view of the main character Pi Patel, many years after he was the survivor of a sunken ship and spent 227 days at sea accompanied by a ferocious tiger. The story has a lot of similarities with Cast Away, the most obvious probably being the sole relationship of an unexpected companion. In Cast Away it was a volleyball, here it is a tiger. While it is a necessary plot device to have these ""characters"" in the story, it is also fascinating to see just how close and reliant the main character becomes on them. Something that I imagine would actually genuinely be the case if you were in that situation.The cinematography is astonishing throughout and seeing it in 3D (even though I'm not the biggest fan of the format) was just the icing on the cake. This is a tough film to review because it leaves itself very open to interpretation. The message boards are flooded with questions and every answer to them is unique and of a slightly different opinion. Ang Lee has done well in keeping this a talked about and debated piece of cinema. I have my own opinions on most of the questions too, but to throw them out there now would be wrong. It could lead you to come to a conclusion you wouldn't otherwise have come to and it would also ruin a bit of what is fun about the ending. Go in with an open mind, form your own opinions and then take the time to read some other people's ones too. Life of Pi can be as much fun after the film as it is during.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Ang Lee's signature wisdom,"It is very hard to give this masterful creation of Ang Lee a tangible rating and critic, because much of the takeaway of the film, is for the moviegoers and readers of the original novel to contemplate.It is also very hard to rate because it has been such a hard movie to make, out of a novel that addresses both the strength of faith and weakness of humanity in a rhetoric way.Ang Lee did it, although painstakingly. I was amazing by the soul of the film, thru the eyes of the Bengal tiger (amazingly) and the maiden acting of 17-year-old non-professional actor. The conversation about the journey of life that Ang Lee has succeeded in engaging us into is a special kind that few artists like him is able to deliver.The opening music is magic.The one point I deducted is my faith in Ang Lee. I will save that for his next film.Happy Thanksgiving, movie lovers.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
A Visual Masterpiece,"How does one narrate a story like Life of Pi? And then, how does one make a movie out of it? Assuming you manage to pull it off somehow, how on earth do you find any scope for use of 3D in a movie that has no alien attacks, warring robots or swinging superheroes?Ang Lee delivers the answers to all these questions in spectacular fashion. I have read reviews comparing this movie with Avatar, and i feel it is an unfair comparison. Avatar was nothing more than a three- hour advertisement for 3D, whereas in Life of Pi, 3D becomes a part of the story itself, almost like a character in itself.The movie opens with debates on religion and spirituality, which might feel a little dull for Indian audiences, for whom these concepts are part and parcel of everyday life, but would fascinate Western audiences. Once the family of the protagonist, Pi Patel (Suraj Sharma) sets sail for Canada, along with all the animals in their zoo which they plan to sell in Canada, it turns into a gripping drama. The ship sinks, and Pi finds himself adrift on a lifeboat, which he has to share with a zebra, a hyena, an orangutan - and the star of the show, a Royal Bengal tiger called Richard Parker.The storm scenes are so realistic, and so superbly enhanced by 3D, that it would not be a bad idea to carry along seasickness bags into the movie hall. As we breeze through storms, shoals of bioluminescent fish, flying fish, exotic islands and so on - the technical prowess of the movie grips you with its brilliance. The screenplay and the camera-work, and above all, the CGI - the tiger is apparently a product of CGI - are all strong contenders for Academy awards.But the stronger point of the movie is not its technical details, but the emotional quotient. The entire drama is about the relationship between the tiger and Pi, which is among the most unusual relationships ever seen on the screen. Suraj Sharma delivers a memorable performance reminiscent of Tom Hanks in Cast Away. He showcases his remarkable ability to have you in splits with his comic timing, and at the same time moves you to tears. It's an extremely challenging role - of having to carry the entire movie on his shoulders - and Sharma does a stellar job.Towards the end, however, the movie sags down inexplicably, as if the director suddenly ran out of creative ideas and asked one of his understudies to complete the movie. Indeed, it is the last 20-odd minutes which caused me to rate it 7 rather than 9, but despite its shortcomings, Life of Pi remains a must-watch, and one of the favourites for Best Movie and Best Director awards.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
An Unparalleled Experience of Surreal Visual and Humanity.. Unmissable,"Through a movie with minimum human interaction.. Ang Lee shows humanity in its purest form.Through the incredible co-survival of a man and a Bengal tiger, Life of Pi shows us how both hopes and fears keep us going.The visual is simply groundbreaking. For moments I almost thought I was hallucinating. Many of the scenes were shot Planet Earth (the most expensive nature documentary) style, but only more stunning, in 3D, and woven together by a strong character and a beautiful story.But visual effects is far from being the only thing that makes Life of Pi extraordinary. Life of Pi is such an all-round hit. Authentic and not over-the-top acting, smooth storytelling, engrossing score.. all in all it struck me as a masterpiece not only made by masters, but also with a heart.I couldn't be more glad to celebrate this as my 700th movie on IMDb. Hope, as is Life of Pi's tagline, is what it gives me. Can't wait for Ang Lee's next movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
227 days of Pi's life drifting on the blue desert,"Well, one of most expected movie of 2012 by me. It was not a colorful visual movie like 'Avatar' which was bluish Or 'Hugo' which was orangish except in few scenes that too come in night shot though IMO you should not compare it with above two. Many part of 3D sequences were just awesome.It could have been more violent and sentimental story that ever told on this theme but not, the director cleverly blended the humor with character emotions very nicely, thats why it was just ratted PG where children are allowed with their parents approval, but it is common for them to see an animal to kill another in Animal Planet, so its not a big deal i think. The CGI animal(s) were looked so clean and good.I must say the movie don't offer what you expect from its trailer, in movie it was totally different than any movie in the world except Waterworld + Cast Away + Castle in the Sky = Life Of Pi, i am not comparing it to other 3 but saying got similarity in some parts.I did not like the end much, I mean the way it ended was not proper, I thought it still had something to go far away then realized it happen only in commercial movies.My question is can this movie do good business which got no big names and cast!? Indian cast, Taiwan's talent, American product and a great effort of various technicians from around the world is equal to LIFE OF PI in Pacific ocean over 227 days. Hoping it gonna grab couple of awards in Academy award. Worth watching it in 3D, Someday in future you can say that i was in there when it came out when it called epic like what we call some of classical movies today.You could see better and beautiful India in beginning few Minutes than any Hollywood movie which deal on Indian subject. people from in and around Pondicherry can feel proud, why not whole Indians can. The images from the movie will remain in our eyes for some time even after you left the cinema hall specially may be you won't forget the name Richard Parker.And now i go for 9 outa 10 saying must see specially we Indian coz we cant make movie like this at least for right now in our own but we can watch this western piece of Indian art carved Ang Lee.There is a chance it gonna replace 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' as his (Ang Lee's) best, i said may be so lets see.

Picture of the Year,"I honestly didn't expect to say this again in the current calendar year but ""this is probably the best movie I have seen this year"". Yes, I think this is probably even a better movie that The Dark Knight Returns which I was all but certain would be my personal Picture of the Year winner. Life of Pi was simply amazing. The story is incredible and the way the film is delivered couldn't be better. You truly go on this story with Pi Patel and Richard Parker. The acting by Suraj Sharma is surprisingly fantastic as well. Some people will surely call this movie boring because it has a slower pace to it but Tom Hanks' Castaway film was also on the slower side and as that movie showed, if a film is well done the slow pace allows for more emotion and a connection to the characters. Shoot, I got watery eyes when Hanks' character lost Wilson and that was a stinking volleyball, lol. This movie plays along that same style of a slow paced story of survival but is done even better due to the incredible cinematography that rivals Avatar in terms of magnificence. Another thing Life of Pi did remarkably well was end without disappointment. By that, I do not mean that the ending isn't sad. I mean that the ending lives up to the film. Again, take Castaway for example. That movie was great but its ending was quick and left a lot to be desired. The ending for Life of Pi throws a subtle twist that is sort of a mind blowing moment. That subtle twist leaves you pondering the events of the film well after it ends.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
An Amazing Adventure,"With four people bringing the life of Pi Patel to the big screen, no wonder no Oscars were given out in the Best Acting category. All four seem to function as a unit as the oldest one tells the story of an amazing adventure to a writer who has been told that Pi has an incredible tale to tell. The lack nominations in the acting categories is made up by the four Oscars Life Of Pi won this past year in the technical categories. The computer graphics are something else.Like Gloria Stuart retelling her life as a Titanic survivor and the audience seeing Kate Winslet playing it out on the big screen, Irrfan Khan recounts his surviving a shipwreck where he and his family are taking a bunch of zoo animals from India to Canada where the Japanese freighter they're on is sunk with all hands lost.Young Suraj Sharma manages to swim to a floating and empty lifeboat which turns out not to be so empty as a few of the zoo animals also make it there. Including a young and hungry Bengal Tiger cub who is very hungry.I won't say more because at this point the computer graphic special effects takes over. Some miracles are provided, but maybe the biggest miracle of all is that the tiger and Pi decide they really do need each other. Pi who checked out all forms of religious beliefs calls on all the Deities he's learned on for help. The biggest help granted is if not a change of nature, a curbing of the carnivorous nature of the tiger to save the Life Of Pi.I was kind of lost at the message part, just what director Ang Lee was saying about nature and nature's God to use Jefferson's phrase. But the technical achievements of the film truly do dwarf whatever message that was being told about life. Those achievements have vaulted Life Of Pi to the top of the cinematic world and it's likely to remain there.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Visual feast but difficult to grasp meaning,"Visually, this movie is a knockout. Scene after scene produces audible gasps as we see images we never thought possible. The colors just pop off the screen, the various animals shown are incredibly realistic, and the views of sky and sea are just phenomenal. Even if there was no plot whatsoever, you should see it just for the visuals.There is a plot, of course. A boy/young man is stranded on a lifeboat and is forced to survive for endless days through unbelievable hardships. And if that alone were the plot, I'd be content, but the framework around the shipwreck story claims something more, that this story says something about the human condition, about God and man, about sin and salvation, about how we should live our lives. My problem quite frankly is that I just did not see the connection. Maybe I need it told more directly, I certainly have a low tolerance for ambiguity. So if you can live with agonizingly uncertain outcomes, where you question everything you have just seen, then you will love this. But if you like things told to you clearly, you may walk away a bit puzzled, as I did.But regardless, this movie redefines the word ""beautiful."" I was just amazed to see the many, many moods of the ocean as it is portrayed, in fact it becomes one of the primary characters as it is sometimes benevolent, sometimes treacherous; calm or stormy; gray or overflowing with color; etc.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Hungry for Pi? You should be!,"The Angular tales are back with another Ang Lee feature. Director Lee is never timid in taking on a wide array of genres when tackling on a movie. And in his latest ""Life of Pi"" he might have just discovered a new genre for motion pictures because Pi serves such themes as adventure, love, courage, man vs. beast, family, religion, regret, friendship, survival, and a few others all in one just movie. ""Life of Pi"" is the most beautiful looking picture of the year, and it will have its Pi I mean eye on the Oscar prize of many technical categories including Best cinematography, sound effects, editing, special effects, and art direction. By the way, the 3-D in this picture is used to its apex. The movie features our protagonist Pi Patel first as an adult telling his incredible teen tale to a journalist, and then it rewinds to flashback in the telling of his unforgettable adventure at sea. Pi's real name is Piscine, so you could imagine how much he was bullied at school due to his name. His father named him Piscine because of his love of pools; but come on bro, out of all the pool of names you could have named your son, why that one? To avoid future name harassment, Pi during his teens, decided to shorten out his name to Pi; an incredible scene in the movie shows Pi in a 3.14 craze demonstrating to his classmates how the Pi equation is calculated in order for them to comprehend that he is now a Pi not a Piscine. Pi's parents live in India and own a farm. When economic problems arise, Pi's father decides to move teen Pi and the family from India to Canada. His plan is to sell the farm (literally) in Canada. To do this, he must first take the family and the animals on a freight ship at sea to Canada. And that is when ""Life of Pi"" transposes itself to a mystical ""survival-at-sea"" flick. A brutal storm causes a shipwreck which Pi bravely survives. Consequently, he is stranded on a lifeboat with an orangutan, a zebra, a hyena, and a Bengal Tiger named Richard Parker. Yea, that happened to me also. Anyways, Director Lee carries the picture into a thrilling state of ""young man vs. beast"" for survival. And he brilliantly depicts the relationship between Pi and Richard Parker as the forefront on many of the film's messages about the aforementioned themes. Wait, I must take a break. My cat Douglas Simpson is hungry and I must feed him. OK, that's enough. David Magee's endearing screenplay also deserves an Oscar nod for its relative verbose within Lee's direction. And Ang is a shoe-in for a Best Director Oscar nomination, I must say. Another what should be a sure Oscar nomination is Newcomer Suri Sharma's mesmeric performance as the teen Pi. And Surily I can be serious! Veteran Indian actor Irrfan Khan was solid as the adult Pi, but the young Pi Sharma had the more tasty scenes for a thespian showcase. So without a doubt, on a scale from 1 to 4 (4 being excellent), ""Life of Pi"" is not a 4 but much better than a 3.14. ***** Excellent",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
One of a kind,"Hadn't seen this since it was first released. Once it gets past a lot of religious issues/questions and a set up for what the movie is really about, it is pretty awesome to view. The CGI here is really amazing though sometimes occasionally too artificially beautiful, but nevertheless, this is a gorgeous film. It is also extremely original, exciting and inventive with again, too pretty for words cinematography. The ending of the amazing adventure within the film is also rather touching and a little sad when all is said and done. All in all, it's a pretty impressive piece of craftsmanship.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"A really very good film, visually spectacular.","After having seen this film, which adapts a novel with the same name, I was in doubt about what to think. Directed by Ang Lee, the film is a true visual spectacle and takes advantage of the best that high-quality CGI can add to a film. However, we have to agree that it is a still film, which stretches its story as far as it can, placing it on a metaphysical and theological background that can complicate the story for some people.Piscine Molitor Patel, called Pi Patel to facilitate and avoid embarrassing puns, is the young hero of this film. He was born and lives with his family in Pondicherry, in former French India. However, finances are not going well, and they are forced to leave, closing the zoo they manage there, and leaving for Canada with most of the animals. It so happens that, during the trip, the Japanese freighter they boarded on is caught in a typhoon and sinks. Clinging to a lifeboat, he survives, accompanied by Richard Parker, the irascible and terrifying Bengal tiger from his family's zoo, beginning a journey of survival and discovery of the sacred, and of himself.In fact, if there is one thing that stood out before my eyes in this film, it is the search that the main character makes about God, since childhood, in which he assumes several religions that are perfectly different. He seems to be engaged in a search for God's truth, not just experimenting with religions and beliefs, or mixing them up to his liking. The trip on that boat, therefore, reminds us a little of the despair of biblical figures like Jonah or Job, from whom everything was taken away so that, in the depths of their misery, they could find God. The film still makes a number of small changes when compared to the original book. I'm not the best person to evaluate them, but I'm not surprised by these creative liberties.Suraj Sharma is a completely unknown actor to me, but he does his part very well here, and he sounds authentic and true. He is the great actor present in the film and it is his work that gives him body and soul. Irrfan Khan was also up to his task and makes a welcome and very successful contribution. In between, we see Gerard Depardieu in a brief cameo that adds little to the film.Technically, the film makes clever and creative use of computer resources, CGI and green screen, as mentioned earlier. The quality of the work is such that we are in doubt about what we are seeing, especially with regard to the animals and their coat and appearance. The meerkat island was also magnificent, and there are several scenes at sea where light was masterfully used. The cinematography and editing were masterfully executed, the sets and costumes are authentic and the soundtrack is truly good and engaging.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
A Small Redemption for Ang Lee,"It could be said that ""Life of Pi"" is a combination of ""Cast Away"" and ""Open Water."" I would stay away from such a simplistic equation especially since pi is in the title of the aforementioned movie. ""Life of Pi"" is so much more than ""Cast Away"" in ""Open Water,"" it has its own identity, its own essence which makes it uniquely different from the other two, and not just because of the tiger.Pi Patel (Suraj Sharma and Irrfan Khan) had a fantastical story. He and his family were caught on a sinking ship in the middle of the Pacific while traveling from India to Canada. Everyone on the ship died except Pi who made it to a lifeboat with a zebra, an orangutan, a hyena, and a tiger. In short order it was just Pi and the tiger battling the elements and battling each other for survival, while also battling each other for supremacy.This was a dramatic movie with a set as colorful as the main character. Visually, this movie is stunning and it keeps the viewer engaged. You'll feel like you've experienced a lifetime of drama though Pi was in the open sea far less than that.Ang Lee lost me after ""Hulk"" and I didn't watch another movie of his until ""Gemini Man"" which was simply OK.

Not sure what the fuss is about.,"I'm afraid I must have missed something about this film. And perhaps I really did but there is nothing particularly awe inspiring as you might have been led to believe. For one the grand claim about making you believe in God is never really answered. There is a quick vague nod to it at the end but for me it made no sense. The main story has nothing whatsoever to do with God. So I'm a bit puzzled on that one. There is a bit of a semi twist near the end that I didn't see coming. This reveals an extra dimension to the story that was previously hidden to us. However the impact of the twist is never really brought home in any tangible way (that is quite possibly intentional). You would have to watch the film again to appreciate the twist but like me you will probably not be bothered.The best thing about the film is the cinematography, visual effects, pi himself, young and old (both characters and both actors)and the various animals. They are sometimes cute and have their own personalities. If you like nature programmes you will enjoy it. The 3D was never spectacular but a nice extra. There are a few gorgeous looking tableau like scenes of the boat on the sea with the skyline. Visually the film looks good throughout.Pi (younger)is an interesting character. He is intelligent and has a hunger for learning. His strange obsession with gods and religions is quite annoying though (especially for an atheist like me)and seems to serves no purpose for the narrative. I think the film might be trying to say something quite profound about religion but I'm afraid it was either made too subtly or just isn't there at all. Maybe you need to read the book. The actor of the older pi is quite brilliant and very engaging. Very stoic and dignified.All in all not a bad film but please don't believe the hype!

One day, his family have an accident while they sail. Only he survives with Richard Parker.The graphics in this film is beautiful very much. I was overwhelmed by the scene of a whale and island. This story was different with my expectation, therefore, the development was surprising for me. I felt that I wanted to know how did Richard Parker think to Pi. I want everyone to watch this film. Some people write say that the original writes scene which the movie does not write. Therefore I should also read the original.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Great movie,Life of Pi is an exciting film to watch over again. There is good visual effect in the movie which includes sound too. Pi fights for his life with the combination of faith and science. He is able to survive with the two beliefs which in this case says that both faith and science can make you overcome obstacles in life.,7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Excellent cinematography,"The story had an impact that is new to younger generations that make them understand its not how you show the content its how you tell it. Kept me full of emotion, even the third time watching it. Has been put on my top 5 movies of all times. The new and improved Jungle book. Could have been shorter but didn't take away from the movie at all. Felt the connection with the relationship between Pi and the tiger. Felt the family connection between Pi and his family. The Life of Pi was more than interesting it was astonishing enough to make the movie cast away seem like a false story. Can't wait to see what is next on the list for the Director and his leading cast. The colors were vibrant and rich. Followed the tiger them throughout the whole movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
My rating: 7,"When I first saw this movie I thought that it is not good - some animals in a boat and that till the end. The second time I watched it I said to myself - ""it is good"". Long time after that fragmentary visions of it were coming back to my consciousness. They got sense undressed.Pi is not in relation with mathematics. But it can be interpret like this - a continuously revealing essence repeating on each manifestation. Strongly metaphorical it starts the story of life on a continent, in a family, on a ship with society, on a boat, in loneliness and in the end in a new family.It is a description of human life, of its connection with nature and its creations. Of not overcoming abyss between man, animals and plants for which Sartre tells us. Of relation with God or the internal sense. Of described fantasy and trivial people. Things in the life of almost everyone of us.In spite of the long period in the boat the spectator co-experience much and is informed much. Like his own existence. Of always dynamic but essential and most of all: his own.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Life of Pawn,"This film is mildly recommended.Give me the real thing anytime! Sparkling rhinestones never trump diamonds. Plastic trees and silk flowers can never substitute for nature's glories. Artificial sweeteners are fine for awhile, but usually leave a funny aftertaste. Which brings us to Ang Lee's Life of Pi, a so-so entertainment that is long on style and short in substantial value.Overdone best describes this film. Visually, the film is a stunning work of art. ( I found the 3-D to be totally enthralling, almost too precise and overworked at times, but still a remarkable undertaking of this process. ) The film's color palette has an exciting vibrancy that is unmatched by other films, but also an artificial over-saturated glow, as if colors were boosted beyond their limits. There are scenes of true artistry that give this film a distinctive allure ( the staging of the actual shipwreck sequence, the surprise meeting of the boy and his tiger aboard the small lifeboat, a surrealistic hallucination that is filled with stark imagery, the colorful sunsets and ominous cloud reflecting upon the waters ). These effects do create an otherworldly atmosphere, which I suppose was Lee's goal, but the film's onslaught of phantasmagoric dreamscapes becomes excessive and outweighs the slenderest of plots: a philosophical and spiritual parable about a boy and his tiger lost at sea.This paradoxic metaphor is the basis conceit that enables the director and his screenwriter to explore the deeper meaning of religion, faith, and God that, in the end, makes Life of Pi become a preachy treacle, continually musing about our existence in this vast universe. ( Recent films by major directors like Terrance Malick's The Tree of Life, Lars van Trier's Melancholia, and the recent Cloud Atlas by the Wachowskis have explored this territory with similar mixed results. So one cannot fault Ang Lee with his passion and determination to film this novel and its metaphysical ruminations. )Ultimately where Lee's film fails is in its conventional storytelling. The screenplay literally sinks the movie. Its script by David Magee rambles on and is especially slow-moving in the first half hour of the film with all its tedious exposition and build-up prior to the shipwreck. Based on Yann Martel's novel, the plot set-up is told in flashback, with the adult Pi bookending the more exciting adventure storyline. As he narrates his tale of survival, the character of the younger Pi ( Suraj Sharma ) emerges, but he is never fully realized. He is merely a pawn in this sea of woe. More time and success is spent on the exquisite photo-realistic rendering of Bengal tiger nicknamed Richard Parker. The CGI enhanced Mr. Parker gives a more lifelike performance and upstages the real life actor, Mr. Sharma, who could use some acting lessons. This imbalance sacrifices a real emotional gravitas needed to really care about the central character which I found completely missing in the film. ( In fact, the tiger had a lot more patience that I would have had if I was on that lifeboat and had to subject myself to Pi's religious rants and whining. He clearly would have been dinner by midday. )Life of Pi is slightly adrift, a film full of excesses and self-important swagger. Lee overindulges his vision and seems more preoccupied in creating an ethereal world that is quite beautiful and strange to behold but, contrary to his own beliefs, it is also quite annoying to experience all of its religious dogma too. The overall effect of Life of Pi is a mixed blessing, so to speak. Life of Pi is a visually impressive achievement in filmmaking, but it remains intellectually and emotionally off-course. GRADE: B-ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.comNOTE: Years ago, there was a wonderful film based on a children's novel called The Black Stallion which followed a similar storyline: a boy and an animal are shipwrecked and need each other to survive the hardships they face together. That film used a visual, almost wordless narrative to connect story and imagery; this film relies too heavily on the imagery to connect the pretentiousness of its hollow and holiest of words.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Outstanding,"'Life of Pi' is a story about a young man stranded on a boat in the middle of the Pacific with a tiger after the ship carrying his family and their zoo sinks. Directed by Ang Lee (Brokeback Mountain), this is a spectacular film with a lot of great qualities.There's pretty much just one actor in this; Suraj Sharma makes a great debut here and I really hope his career takes off after this despite not being nominated for an Oscar unfortunately. It must be challenging being the only actor on-screen for 90% of the film with no one to converse with except a CGI tiger- Sharma handles this well though and his performance is thoroughly entertaining. Irfan Khan doesn't have much screen time but he gives a powerful performance, particularly in the last scene. Rafe Spall is a bit disappointing; he doesn't show any emotion in crucial scenes and he can take away the power and quality of a scene because of this. The exact opposite of an actors' job!I am opposed to 3D in cinema and therefore chose to see this in traditional, 'boring' 2D. Visually, it is still spectacular despite it being advertised as a film made for 3D (doesn't every 3D films' advertising campaign argue this?). The CGI animals – excluding the tiger – can look obviously fake and tacky at times which can be a bit off- putting but this is very brief. The night sequences are over the top and unrealistic but are beautiful and do somehow suit the film – Ang Lee has done well in creating the setting.Overall, this is an excellent film which is sure to do well at the Oscars. It's not really similar to any of Ang Lee's other works but it is a great film to watch and is expertly made. Unfortunately, I hadn't read the book so I can't tell if it is any better but, from what I do know about the book, I think this film tries to stay as close to it as possible.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The version of IMAX 3D is such a treat,"It's the one of two best IMAX 3D movie I've ever seen(the other one is AVATAR). I really think IMAX should take a serious consideration to use this film's clip as the demo tape. Not to mention the various meaning behind this film the reviews here said it about 100 times. I found one of the interesting part of this film is too see how the 3D effect can be used in a drama movie to tell a story, not just for those special-effect-kind film. Plus the sound editing and mixing is also well above the standard and cinematography is a lock in many awards.Ang Lee is known to bring out the best from new actors ,Ziyi Zhang of CTHD,Wei Tang of Si Jie, and Suraj Sharma of this one. They all deliver award-winning performance in their first international big screen role.I plan to see it again in IMAX 3D while it's still showing there, and I highly recommended anyone go to feel the real power of IMAX 3D if you haven't done so.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Stunning!,"Life of Pi is stunning, beautiful, and philosophical with a tantalizing lack of absolute resolution. The movie is a visual masterpiece. I gasped at many of the images contained within it. (See it on a big screen.) I know the Pi contains a mix of digital artistry and live action, but, for the life of me, I could not see the seams between them.The only problem I had with the film was that I had difficulty understanding the accented English at times. This decreased as the story progresses and I grew more accustomed to the Indian cadence. Speaking of India, Life of Pi gives a vision of an India that I had never pictured.What I believed would be the ending of a bittersweet story was turned on end by a late twist artfully introduced to remove any hint of contrivance. It was impossible to have dry eyes by the end of Life of Pi, and the last few minutes of the film will have me thinking about it for months or years or maybe the rest of my life.This movie has my vote for best picture of the year as well as a half-dozen other awards.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
I Like Pi's Visuals,"Next up on my Thanksgiving weekend reviews is the newest novel based movie called Life of Pi. This past summer I was captivated by the wonderful trailer that was visually stunning and had a killer soundtrack that matched the flow of the trailer. When I found out Ang Lee was directing it I got even more excited that this film was going to be an artistic wonder. Since I hadn't read the book though, I had no idea what else I was in store for other than a modern version of the Cast Away movie. So what did this movie have to offer? Read on to find out.For those who haven't seen the trailer or read the book, Life of Pi is the tale of a man named Piscine Patel, known by most as Pi, an Indian boy who likes to question many rules and discover new lessons. On the voyage to a new home in Canada, the boat Pi and his family are riding capsizes leaving him stranded with a few animals and some rations on a small lifeboat. The teenage boy will discover a world he never imagined, while struggling to maintain his life in the lonely world of the ocean.That's pretty much the plot, so you might wonder what makes this movie different from Cast Away, other than the main character is Indian and there is a tiger. I'll start with talking about the visuals of this move, which for me and a couple of my buddies was the best element of the movie. From the get go, the cinematography is amazing capturing the natural beauty of the Indian continent. As the opening credits start, the audience is treated to some well angled shots of the various zoo creatures, each doing their own thing as if nothing is happening. Once the movie officially starts though, the camera work continues to get better, with every angle being selected to get the most out of the scene. Even the chaotic scenes aboard the sinking ship were well captured, skipping the chaotic camera angles for the use of CGI and visuals to create the feelings of uncontrolled fear. When calm eventually returns the desolate world of the vast ocean is impressively recreated on the screen. Many of its inhabitants are well polished and designed to have you thinking they are real, that is until you get a closer look. Upon focusing on the actual creatures, you can see where the realism starts to blur a bit, as the animals become a little too polished and clean. Despite this though, the animation for the animals is still impressive, capturing their movements to the finite detail and adapting them to the interaction with Pi and the tiger. Thus the artistic aspects of this movie are definitely prevailing in this movie.A second big quality of this movie is the spirituality built into this feature film. Before even pushing out on the boat, Pi begins experimenting with multiple religions, each being explained in their connection to the deities. Those interested in religion will get a nice refresher course in theology; though will appreciate more of the practice in this movie. Scenes where Pi prays or talks to God are sure to strike up some feelings in fans, whether good or bad really depends on the person. For this reviewer, it did make me thankful for many things, and helping strengthen my spiritual connection. There are even a few other scenes that seem like a trippy experience into the spiritual realm that is visually beautiful, but still a little weird. If this isn't what you want to see in a movie well, then you might choose to skip this film. If this isn't what you want to see in a movie well, then you might choose to skip this film.What else is there to mention about this movie? Well I can warn you now that there are some graphic scenes of life that may disturb some people. I admit that some of the animal hostility in this film made me very sad, and could make little kids cry their eyes out. Despite this sadness though, I have to admit it is very realistic as when fighting for survival animals can turn into savage monsters. Those looking for a story with lots of twists and turns are also advised to skip this movie as well, since it is little more than an Indian boy fighting for survival and documenting his adventure. However, those who like movies that dive into the mind and character are going to be up for this film. Another thing about this film is the pace of the movie keeps things a little slow. Again this is a life adventure, but did we really need over two hours of film to see this? For this reviewer not really, as half an hour less could have helped with the long dragging feeling of this film. The acting by Suraj Sharma was very passionate at many points in the movie and well representative of the emotions. Unfortunately some of the scenes forced him to be a little too passionate in his yelling, leading to a little over-dramatic tension.To wrap this review up, Ang Lee and company have created a visually stunning masterpiece that makes you think about your spiritual beliefs. With award winning animation, polished creature design, beautiful settings and cinematography, and some well done editing, it's no doubt this movie will be a candidate for best visual effects. What could have made it even better though was adding a soundtrack like the trailer to further bring out the magic, instead of just using it for the sad scenes. Regardless this movie is best seen in the theater with the visuals, yet if you go for plot wait until it releases on Netflix. My scores for this movie are the following: Adventure/Drama: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0 please email rkarim11@su.edu for constructive criticism",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
A beautiful and engrossing adventure from Ang Lee,"In a manner somewhat similar to the recent adaptation of David Mitchell's 'Cloud Atlas', 'Life of Pi' shouldn't work. Based on the award-winning and widely-lauded 2001 novel of the same name by Yann Martel, it chronicles the life-changing maritime adventure of a young Indian boy humorously named Piscine or ""Pi"" for short, who after a surviving the sinking of a ship, ends up on a lifeboat, with a hyena, an orang-utan, a zebra and of course, a large Bengal tiger called Richard Parker (a moniker that came about wittily). Consequently, the book came to considered 'unfilmmable' (and for just cause), yet the world of cinema's interest in Martel's wonderful novel remained undying and after much development the proposed adaptation eventually landed at the feet of the excellent Ang Lee.Despite Lee's having proved himself to be a director of considerable talent, with superb offerings like 'The Ice Storm' and 'Brokeback Storm', themselves both adaptations, it was doubtful whether or not the much-loved novel would translate successfully to the big screen. Many other accomplished directors have failed to capture similarly ambitious novels in film form, such as David Lynch's folly that was 'Dune'. Any worry has turned out to be unnecessary though as the Taiwanese filmmaker has delivered a beautiful and moving film that is easily one of his finest works yet.There's no denying that 'Life of Pi' is filled with visual beauty, as in teaming up with DoP Claudio Miranda, Lee has utilised the film's ocean setting like an impressionistic artist to a blank canvas. Even though it is a scene that has done the rounds in the film's trailers, the night- set scene where the whale leaps out of the water is a thing of breathtaking majesty. Similarly, there are numerous moments that are nothing short of gorgeous in a way that could see even Terrence Malick become envious. Adding to this, the use of CGI is one of the most remarkable in recent years, exemplified with the meticulous detail put into Richard Parker, which renders him a significant achievement in CGI, as it becomes rather difficult to tell when the tiger is real or not.Yet, it's worth noting that this is a film that resonates on an emotional level as well as a technical. From the moment proceedings kicked off, I was engrossed in Pi's story, with its smooth fluidity, whether I was looking at Irrfan Khan or Suraj Sharma. The latter, a first time actor, delivers a great and at times subtle performance as the titular character, consistently helping me to engage with Pi and ultimately, like him. Even as he was simply sitting upon a raft in silence, I still couldn't help but find myself enthralled in the journey he had (unwillingly) embarked on.'Life of Pi' is a wonderful film, bursting with imagination and in love with the possibilities of storytelling, which sees Ang Lee wield 3-D expertly, forgoing the usual gimmicky 'things leaping out of the screen' and instead adding more depth and texture to the colourful cinematography. It's not just a technical marvel, but a true wonder all round, because the fact that Martel's novel actually works (rather well, at that) as a film is quite a miracle, and for Ang Lee should applauded.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Beautiful exploration of the soul!,"I liked this movie for many different reasons. The first is because of the amazing special effects. I didn't even see the film in 3D and I was still amazed by the magical scenes created. They felt like you could actually be there, experiencing them as Pi is. Another reason I really enjoyed this movie was because of how deeply it digs into and explores the heart and soul of the character of Pi. This amazing young actor does a great job of portraying the raw emotions of one trapped at sea. It is believable, entertaining, and understandable all at the same time. Its almost like a character study wrapped up with a visually spectacular adventure. It is one of the must-see movies of 2012. Do yourself a favor and take the time to really enjoy this great movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Excellent visuals. The best 3D visuals since Avatar,"The tale of Pi Patel, an Indian boy who grew up in a zoo in Pondicherry. The movie is shown as narrated to an author interested in penning his adventures. The main focus is on Pi's incredible journey from India, where he lost his parents and older brother in a violent storm. They were headed towards Canada to sell off their animals and start a new life, but a horrific storm wiped out the entire crew. Pi is stranded alone on a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger named 'Richard Parker'.The core of the story is how Pi manages to co-exist with Richard Parker in the harsh environment of the Pacific, with limited supplies, no help in sight, and unpredictable weather.The movie is an artistic delight. Fantastic visuals (The best use of 3D visuals since Avatar), amazing storytelling, good plot-line, and compelling camera-work. The narration was largely visual. With only one human survivor, the story couldn't be pulled through conversations. I expected a voice-over accompaniment throughout the movie, which would have been the easy way out. However, it went without the voice-over, like the 2000 movie Castaway - and this allowed the audience to drink in the vast emptiness and loneliness that perseveres through the movie.The story was interesting, but straightforward. This is possibly why the twist at the end of the story took me completely by surprise. I won't give out spoilers, but a subtle twist that leaves something ambiguous puts an entirely different shade to the whole experience. And that escalates the story from a good one to a truly excellent one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
A Nutshell Review: Life of Pi,"Once, many thought that Life of Pi, based upon the novel by Yann Martel, was unfilmmable. But I guess it takes a special someone with much imagination and gusto to tackle it head on, dealing with three aspects many filmmakers would largely and automatically shy away from - children, animals and plenty of water - and delivering one riveting picture that's as visually arresting as it is dramatically challenging in its tale of fantasy, religion, philosophy and life.In what would essentially be a one man show for the most parts, almost akin to Robert Zemeckis' Cast Away starring Tom Hanks in terms of a tale on the human spirit, Ang Lee didn't have the luxury of a world renowned actor at his side delivering soliloquy after soliloquy, but had the luxury of improved technology to assist in his cause. And technology this time helped to transform this story into what it was, especially when it came to dealing with animals, having to weaken a Bengali tiger over a period of time, as well as to shoot scenes of nature and the food chain, which in normal circumstances would be almost impossible to create and control.Life of Pi is what it is, with Piscine Molitor Patel, or Pi for short, with an extended little sub-arc to tell of his creation of the nickname, now an adult (Irrfan Khan), and telling his remarkable tale of shipwreck and survival in his family's uprooting from India toward Canada in search of a new life outside of the own they know of, which involved a zoo. But as it turns out, the Japanese vessel they are travelling in sank during a storm encountered while in the Miranda Trench, and the few survivors turned out to be Pi (Suraj Sharma), a zebra, an orang-utan, a hyena and finally, one of the earth's most dangerous predators, the tiger nicknamed Richard Parker.Much of the narrative then deals with man versus animal, man versus nature and the elements, and Pi's survival while having to deal with a predator at his doorstep. In Cast Away, Tom Hanks has Wilson to interact with, while here it's a battle between Pi and Richard Parker, which one can allude or metaphors as a battle within oneself for necessities and wants, and the picking up of essential skills to survive. One took us on a slice of life trip on a deserted island, while this one takes us on a slice of life trip drifting along in the vast waters of the Pacific Ocean, amongst what would be one of the last frontiers on the planet.And this is opportunity for plenty of gorgeous, hyper imagery and visuals, that makes it a technological wet dream to deploy the kind of firepower money can buy for a movie. There's 3D technology, IMAX with its different aspect ratios that creep in during stylized sequences, and Claudio Miranda's cinematography exploiting what's best to bring about plenty of exquisitely crafted, postcard picturesque landscapes and waterscapes that will leave one astounded as these effectively augment the themes of the story, especially dealing with nature, bearing witness to both the tranquility and the ferocity that it can bring.What made it a lot admirable, is that Ang Lee decided to stick to his guns and cast a group of relative unknowns, and handing over the lead role to a new actor Suraj Sharma, who repaid the director's faith manifold. It demonstrates the leap of faith the director had to undertake, mirroring the same leap of faith Pi had in committing his survival to higher powers, doing the best with what he has at his disposal, with circumstances and outcome for someone higher up to decide. Suraj Sharma holds his own and doesn't look overawed, or too raw for a role that deals with a coming of spiritual age of sorts, and I won't be surprised if this film provides that career boost along the same lines as Dev Patel's of Slumdog Millionaire.Those who have read the book will know of a second story arc that provides the crux of most post-viewing discussion, allowing points to be made in support of, or against each version being told by Pi. What I thought interesting was how either could be truth, and it says a lot about what us humans would like to hear - only the good stuff, and that in which we can process or accept, and is more palatable for various reasons, versus something that requires a huge dose of faith and belief from the storyteller. In light of what we cannot verify, this theme turns Life of Pi into something of a religious debate, especially since Pi himself is something of a religion connoisseur, dabbling in many and yet being the master of none.Still, if that doesn't really appeal to you, then Ang Lee's story-telling craft of Yann Martel's fantasy will, of a remarkable trip across an ocean, filled with sadness, despair, yet about survival and hope, complete with stunning visuals that will keep you mesmerized for the most parts, about a boy, a tiger, and the life boat they find themselves sharing under extraordinary circumstances. A definite recommendation, and would probably be shortlisted as one of my favourites of the year!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Master Storytelling!,"This is the most wonderfully original movie I've seen in such a long time. It is set up with an amazing touch. We are absorbed into the Indian culture by some of the most lovely people. They are understanding of Pi's dilemmas and his religious confusion. They support him, although he is an arrogant little twit at times. There is an amazing scene where he shatters his boundaries and almost gets himself killed by the tiger who later becomes his shipmate. The special effects are probably some of the most believable and effective I have ever scene, from the shipwreck to the game of (excuse the expression) cat and mouse that ensues. We are totally involved in the incredible story of Pi and how he uses his knowledge and survival skills to maintain both his life and his sanity. The tiger, Richard Parker, is so well conceived and so believable in his own evolution that we grow to feel for him and his fate. There is a comradeship that one can only view. I found myself describing this movie to a friend, and when I finished he acted like I was crazy to have liked it. I guess Pi felt the same way. This is a movie that takes a wonderful book and an amazing story to new depths. There is also, of course, Pi's struggle with his views of a god that he can't quite define. His is an honest doubt. No character in fiction is asked for more and has to question the entity that he says as responsible for the loss of his family and his abject loneliness in the middle of the Pacific. I can't wait for this to come out on video so I can savor it again. My regret is that I didn't get to see it in 3D which I don't normally care for.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Big Screen Yes, Small Screen No!","This film is cinematically stunning. We watched in on the big screen in a small theater in 3D. How many of the scenes were artificially created really doesn't matter, it was artistically phenomenal. Usually I'm not the type that likes lingering scenes in movies as I'm thinking ""come on, let's get on with the story."" But in this case, the artistry of the scenes make the movie. But the story is not solid enough to engage me on a small 2D screen. At least I don't think so. As an example, it doesn't matter where in the story I pop in on Moneyball on the movie channel, I end up watching it to the end. The acting and the story is great. I think I could listen to it with no picture. Life of Pi requires the picture. I did not read the book, but I suspect the same is true of the book in describing scenes in such a way that eclipses the story. My recommendation is to catch it on a big screen, but not sure I'd recommend it on a small screen.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Movie of the Year 2012,"Astounding movie experience!! Gripping story line that keeps you involved, and at the same time is simple and thought provoking. You start becoming / living the life of Pi as the film progresses and that is the real achievement of the movie. You are not a passive movie audience anymore.Most of you may not be aware, but ""Life of Pi"" is loosely based on the TRUE STORY of a person who survived a shipwreck along with a Jaguar. Yann Martel's 2001 Book ""Life of Pi"" on which the movie is based upon was in-turn based on Moacyr Scliar's 1981 novella ""Max and the Cats"", which in-turn was based on a true story.The quality of the 3D graphics are so real that few scenes may scare the children, but this is too good a movie to skip just because of this fact.

Visually stunning. Engrossing storyline,"I went into Life of Pi not knowing anything about it. I'd seen trailers, and assumed it was a ""Jungle Book on Water"" sort of story. The trailers don't really do it justice as far as conveying what sort of story it is. It's a truly memorable film.A young boy, Pi, on his way to Canada with his family and their animals from their zoo, is shipwrecked and left stranded in the middle of the ocean on a boat with nothing but a Bengal Tiger to keep him company. But, unlike the Jungle Book, where you'd imagine the boy and the tiger become best friends and head off on an exciting adventure together, this story remains anchored in realism. This tiger is an actual tiger, which tends to want to maul and eat animals, including our protagonist, and there is a very effective scene early on that establishes this premise.The story becomes a tale of how the two manage to survive in close proximity with each other, each knowing the other wants to survive, and each knowing that, somehow, survival is dependent on the other. And as the final scenes start to show, the metaphor behind the scenario is deep and thought-provoking. Questions of religion, faith, humanity and the soul are raised, and you'll leave the cinema having experienced a pretty thought-provoking film.Suraj Sharma has to carry the film, as he and his CGI (for the most part) tiger are the only two characters on screen for most of the 2+ hours, echoing shades of Cast Away. And Sharma does a terrific job for a young and relatively unheard of actor. Ang Lee certainly brings out the best in his performance, and the effects on the tiger are sensational. You know he must be a CGI creation, simply for safety and practicality reasons, but you truly can't tell at times whether its one of the few scenes that has an actual tiger in it. It goes to show how far CGI has come.It's a visually stunning film, and its cinematography certainly adds to the story, rather than just provide a platform. Lee has always been good at using the surroundings to bring a story to life, and whilst sometimes, it maybe feels a little too pushed (the whale scene, whilst stunning, seems a little over the top), it's still wonderfully done. I didn't even find the 3D effects distracting.I would be surprised if this won any Oscars, simply cause it's maybe not the sort of film that would lead to any sort of wins, except maybe in the visual effects field, but its still certainly a terrific movie to take in. I suspect reading the book may give further meaning to the film's themes, but there are plenty there already to deal with.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
truly terrible ending,"I must say that this movie has one of the worst endings I have ever seen. It was all a dream or the evil character is all in my head ain't got nothing on this movie. I am not trolling I will say that life of pi is beautifully shot and it is moving at times. However, Spoiler alert...the basic structure of this movie is ""narrator"" at the beginning ""let me tell you a story that is so fantastical you wont believe it."" Viewer at the end ""Oh my, did that really happen...I...I..don't believe it."" Narrator ""I told you..the reason you don't believe it.,is cause I made the whole thing up."" We then are treated to the real story which is suppose to be so terrible that he made up this ""loose"" story about animals which is some vague metaphor of the truth blah blah. The real insulting part is when the old codger ask the writer...which story do you prefer. The premise, plot, and ending of both stories are the same but do you like the one with the cuddly zoo animals or the one where we use people as bait and I watch my mother get killed. The writer and the audience in unison say...tear rolling down cheek..the one with the tiger...the end. The point being some pseudo intellectual notion that watching your mother die or being raped or insert whatever horrible thing could happen to you is all a mindset or how we choose to deal with it. OK I get it, a positive attitude can do wonders. But seriously if you survive something like the holocaust I would rather just hear the version that is the truth rather than the version where Adolf Hitler is mickey mouse and you were in Narnia the whole time. I mean come on..this is so insulting on so many different levels. First off, if you are going to tell me this stupid made up story abut honey badgers and unicorns..then stick to it like a crazy person...don't tell me the real story right afterwords. Cause you know what my reaction is going to be, not oh my god what a cute story I like the first one better. My reaction is going to be oh crap you watched your mother get hacked to pieces and you made up a story about it involving zoo animals and then you ask me isn't the first story better...um yes it is...but the story of Anne frank would be better if she was cat woman and died at the end fighting crime...but alas that's not what happened..nor is it the story I prefer.",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
a 10 out 10,"I cannot overpower my very own purist's paranoia, I watched this film in theater a few days earlier in dubbed Italian (my Italian level is so-so), I could not reckon that any film has been officially ""viewed"" until I have watched it in its original form, so thanks to the latest BluRay copy, finally I am able to hail LIFE OF PI as my current favorite film of 2012!Although the film literally is the biggest Oscar winner this year (4 wins out of 11 nominations) and Ang Lee now is up among the pre-eminent echelon of a multi-times BEST DIRECTOR winner, the unfulfilled appreciation (from the prim Academy) still seethes inside, the BEST PICTURE/BEST DIRECTOR division has stuck Ang Lee and his teams twice is unprecedentedly jaundiced.Back to the film itself, I am pretty oblivious to Yann Martel's source novel, but Ang Lee and his crew has deserved every single accolade because the outcome is simply astounding and mind-blowing, from the exotic Indian zoo, the palette of liveliness and quietude seeps directly to viewer's mind curves, then, the visual stunts take over, the minutiae are constructed into an inconceivable kaleidoscope of sea survival (ship-wrecking, heaven-like sea surface, carnivore island).The allegorical storyline which can be laconically recapitulated as ""the story between a boy and a Bengal tiger floating on the sea"", also goes beyond one's mundane imagination, the liaison between Pi and Richard Parker the tiger has gone through a minute incubation-to- transition cliffhanger (technically it is not a cliffhanger since we all know the ending beforehand, but the two-hander just conjures magic spell upon us, which is mesmerizing, eye-popping and heart-warming), with the brilliant first-time actor Suraj Sharma interacting viscerally with the green screen (an almost entirely CGI-germinated tiger heralds the auspicious retirement of all the animal cast, as long as money continues investing, leave those poor animals in peace and so are the ever-engaging animal activist). Both Suraj and Irrfan Khan (the adult Pi) deserve more recognition from their meticulous and soul-searching performances.Being an agnostic, Pi's eclectic belief in all disparate religions doesn't register enough contention to me, and also it is claimed to be ""a story could make one believe in God"", the film is marvelous in keeping its ambivalence so determined that either of the interpretation could find its recipients piously and without arousing any palpable repulsion even we all know how parochial people could react as far as ""religions""is concerned.The film is a flawless eye-candy and soul-remedy, multiple viewings are highly- recommended, it is a conscientious masterstroke to corroborate Ang Lee's versatility in mastering his universe of filmmaking (no genre boundary at all), commixed his oriental philosophy with western first-class craftsmanship and esprit de corps, Ang Lee can swagger further on the path of a true auteur, not only among his peers, even for a holistic view in the film history, his trail can be indelible.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Best movie of 2012,"This is probably the best film of 2012, emotionally and engaging-wise. It tells the story so well, great characters, a strong chemistry between the boy and the tiger. It's just an overall perfect perfect movies. Barely any flaws at all. The most visually stunning movie of the year. My only ""flaw"" with the film would probably be pi's relationship with his crush. I mean, she isn't a horrible actress or anything, but I felt it could've just been a little bit stronger and more developed. Oh well. Besides that, Life of Pi is just a flawless film, save for the romance. The runners up would probably be Moonrise kingdom, The dark knight rises, Argo, and The avengers. those films are just as equally great but whenever someone points a gun at my head and asks me what the best film of 2012 is, I would have to say Life of Pi. final score: 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Ang Lee's Life of Pi is another of his masterpieces,"Just watched this Ang Lee-directed film with my movie theater-working friend. He thought it was ""weird"" but enjoyed it as much as I did. I mean, it was so fascinating watching this Indian teen survive being in a lifeboat for who knows how many days with a Bengal tiger always threatening to eat him. And his later adult self telling it to an author provides some explanation for his beliefs and what have you. And the visuals, which we saw in 3-D, were so awesome! Ditto the music. I can't think of anything else to say but oh, what an experience! I really can't think of anything to say except what are you waiting for? If you like adventurous filmmaking, I most definitely recommend Life of Pi!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

"Spectacular 3D, Outstanding VFX and Talented Acting!","Ang Lee's 3D VFX film adaptation of Yann Martel's 2001 award-winning book of the same name, ""Life of Pi"", is such an amazing film with stunning artwork. Sitting in the cinema last night with friends, it was quite a jaw-dropping experience. I've got to say this would be impossible to do with real animals. Richard Parker, the Bengal tiger, if he was real, not CGI, would have not been easy on set. The way they animate the tiger and background is incredible. Whenever I saw a clean shot of the boat (that Pi and Parker sail in) and the sinking ship, it reminds me of the look of the animation they do in Spielberg's Tintin.Pi's life is told in three stages: childhood, teenage life and adult. The adult stage is quite emotional. The story is delivered by adult Pi (Irrfan Khan) retelling the story about his unbelievable past life to a writer (Rafe Spall, Prometheus).Pi's childhood (portrayed by Gautam Belur, age 5 and Ayush Tandun, age 13) starts with him being bullied at school because of his unusual name, which then he shortens, but still causes teasing. He soon begins to become interested with different religions which causes some amusement. His father owns a zoo and he teaches Pi how to take care of the animals. These lessons Pi's been taught helps him later on in his life.The teenage Pi's life (portrayed by Suraj Sharma) begins his perilous journey when sailing on a ship moving to Canada, when his family agree to move from India. On the way, Pi and the ship encounter a heavy storm which ends up sinking the ship and him ending up on a lifeboat, becoming the only (human) survivor. While lost at sea with no hope, he discovers that a tiger (Richard Parker) has come aboard. Although he knows the tiger wants to kill him, he eventually works out a way to control him. Thinking about Parker, he reminds me a little bit of Aslan from C.S. Lewis' Narnia series; when he walks and roars and uses tiger facial expressions, but not when he attacks. He's a lot fiercer than Aslan, who is more calm and friendly.For Suraj Sharma (teenage Pi), this is his first ever acting debut in film and already he's received his very first Bafta nomination for the Orange Rising Star Award category (and that's what I think he deserves). He brings a touching and rewarding performance as Pi, I think he's the perfect choice for the role.It's special effects and 3D are fantastic. Whenever you see the animals and human extras, you even wonder if their completely CGI. Of course whenever I saw Richard Parker I knew it was going to be computer-generated, but I've just learnt that four real tigers were used in some shots. and you still can't tell which is which. It would have been completely impossible to film right out at sea, so thanks to computer-generated imagery, it couldn't be easier. The 3D effects are incredible (like Martin Scorsese's Hugo but in a different way). This isn't a gimmick. No. These are unlike the other 3D films we see today in which 3D is sometimes unnecessary. Lee (I think) uses 3D almost like they use it on 3D wildlife channels on 3D TV. In this film the animals look as real as on a wildlife programme. You wonder how they manage it, and that's what gives the film an amazing look. At one point it feels like the sea will spill into the cinema. You'd be amazed.Life of Pi is a film that should be seen in 3D to experience the special effects. It isn't the best film I've ever seen but I still think it's spectacular. A must-see!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Boy and the Tiger makes god?,"this story will make you believe in God, is the tall claim made early in this movie. does it go on and do that is another question. The film contains stunning and beautiful visuals as well as good performances by the actors. The movie as a whole fails to be a more than the sum of its parts. I liked it for its visual imagery and only its visual imagery. The story fails to grip, inspire, force you to think etc. Even the adventure in itself does not really look like and adventure but a boring ordeal. At the end of it we are left with a fantastic but a boring story which while presented in a visually appealing way, leaves you questioning, what the fuss was all about.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
you get lost in the vast spectacle of it all!,"This movie took me by surprise. I thought it was just about a young boy and a Bengal tiger trying to survive on a small boat. But it was much more than that, for it conjured up thoughts, spiritually, visually, and intellectually. The actors were amazing and so, the Director Ang Lee. If you do see it, try and catch the 3D showing featuring the largest BTX screen/ multi-channel surround sound. I'm positive it would still be satisfying without those perks, but you will enjoy it much, much, more because it brings you into the location physically. I almost got seasick watching it because the huge screen was so, all encompassing. This movie features an all-Indian cast with acting skills displayed beyond the norm. Everything was so natural, as if no script was ever written. Spontaneity abounded throughout the film. The only negative: the theater turned up the sound too loud.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Visually nice, but not as interesting as it thinks it is","Life of Pi is nice as a visual experience, but falls a little flat as a movie.The main character Pi tells stories from the early parts of his life to build his character, but his character does not really make sense as a person. We are supposed to believe that most of the obvious unrealistic characteristics of his personality can be put down to Pi being incredibly quirky, but even still it is hard to consider him as being a believable character. His character exists purely to be the vehicle of amusing stories and situations, but when trying to consider what such a person would be like, it becomes clear that his existence is only there because it is necessary for the story. This problem might have been avoided, but I was once again underwhelmed by Ang Lee's directing. That this film won Ang Lee the Academy Award is a tragedy to me (in my opinion Spielberg, Affleck, Tarantino, and also Bigelow all deserved the award that year more than Lee did).As well, though the visuals were nice, often they could clearly be seen to be fake. This was not as big a problem in Avatar (which also had more impressive visuals), where the situations are of a science- fiction variety and are not supposed to be real events, but Life of Pi presents these events as actually having occurred, and the flaws in the CGI break up any immersion in the story.Finally, the ending fails in my mind in its purpose as a story that would make me believe in god. Unlike in the movie where it leaves things unclear as to which of the stories is better, in my view, while Pi's original account is nicer to believe, it is clear that his second account of the story is the one to be believed. I believe that man should live by the wise words of Henry David Thoreau ""Rather than love, than money, than fame, give me truth"". Believing in something you know to be untrue because it is nicer is a crime against the intellectual gifts you have been given. Connecting belief in god to belief in Pi's story portrays religion as being an obstacle to the truth, an obstacle to man's progress into the world of the future.Overall, the movie is nice to look at, but hollow and full of holes when examined beyond its pretty visuals. Briefly entertaining, but without any depth to keep it interesting. I recommend that you see it, but do not enter with any expectations of greatness or deeper meaning.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

"Sumptuous, CGI-Generated Images Bring Martel's Book Vividly to Life","Everybody has their own version of the truth, and the way we frame our own stories may have a great deal to do with a higher level of consciousness for which we all strive. Such is the gist of Yann Martel's 2001 bestseller which is the basis of this visually stunning 2012 adventure drama helmed by Ang Lee (""Brokeback Mountain""). I read the book several years ago and remember thinking it would make a great animated film by someone as creative as Hayao Miyazaki (""Howl's Moving Castle""). CGI, however, has evolved so dramatically in the past decade that the story can be now inhabited by real actors and awash in gorgeous abstraction that melds the fantastical with the intimate quite seamlessly. Shot mostly in a giant tank in Taiwan as well as on location in India, this movie is a unique example of how technology's endless possibilities can well serve an allegorical story focused on human survival and our own individual coping mechanisms.Adapted by David Magee (""Finding Neverland""), the story is framed by an interview in Montreal between a Canadian writer, a fictionalized version of Martel, and an unassuming middle-aged man named Pi. The first part of the film is a flashback set in a family-run zoo in Pondicherry, a bucolic former French colony in southern India. The central protagonist is Pi as a child whose sternly sensible father runs the zoo. We learn the origins of Pi's unusual name as it relates to an impossibly pristine pool in which his uncle swam in Paris. At once, you get a sense of the importance of both water and mathematics in Pi's early life as well as his unfiltered concept of religion. In Pi's fertile mind, which religion is a moot point as he adopts Hinduism, Christianity and Islam concurrently and despite his family's resistance. A life-endangering confrontation with a Bengal tiger under their care proves to be a turning point for Pi as he is warned by his supportive family to stay away from it. Later economic hardship prompts his father to decide to move to Canada where he plans to sell the animals.The stormy journey by freighter turns tragic around the Mariana Trench where the now-teenaged Pi finds himself on a lifeboat with an unlikely menagerie in tow. The party eventually dwindles down to two, and this is where Lee imbues the film with a surreal spirit befitting the tale as we watch the seemingly incredulous situation of Pi co-existing on the lifeboat with the same tiger we saw in his childhood encounter. Dubbed Richard Parker due to a previous mix-up in paperwork, the tiger is integral to a series of eye-catching episodes that involves flying fish pelting them with force, a plethora of glowing jellyfish at night, a breaching whale nearly capsizing the boat, a disastrous storm that carries them to the brink, and a bizarrely florid island overrun with carnivorous plants and curious meerkats. None of these episodes will surprise readers of the book, but the execution is enthralling thanks to the masterful work of Chilean cinematographer Claudio Miranda (""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"") and the visual effects generated by the Rhythm & Hues Studios.Similarities to Robert Zemeckis' ""Cast Away"" and Alfred Hitchcock's ""Lifeboat"" are probably not without intention on Lee's part, but this movie manages to hold its own. My one complaint about the film comes toward the end when things are spelled out a bit too deliberately considering how symbolic the story has been expressed up to that point. Pi is played by four actors depicting the character at different ages. Suraj Sharma effectively portrays Pi during the challenging lifeboat sequence and obviously makes the strongest impression, but Gautam Belur and Ayush Tandon are also affecting in conveying Pi's evolving psyche during his tender childhood years. Irrfan Khan (""The Namesake"") plays Pi in the present with his becalming demeanor seemingly at odds with the incredulous story he tells Martel. Khan's movie wife from ""The Namesake"", Tabu, shows up as Pi's understanding mother, and Gérard Depardieu appears inexplicably in a cameo as the freighter ship's nasty cook. Rafe Spall (""One Day"") plays Martel in a rather nondescript manner. It's not a perfect film, but many of the sumptuous images will likely stick with you for a long while afterward.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

worth every penny and hour spent!,"I just finished watching the movie Life of Pi, no words can really surmount to the story and moral of the movie.From the very moment the movie started there was a few downs and as the movie progresses on, you'll find yourself hooked into a movie worthy of standing ovations and a whole cinema in applause. Pi, whose origins roots to India, is a the sole survivor of a Japanese cargo shipwrecked, the reason of the shipwreck is unknown in the story however, it is already seen in the very beginning if viewers were paying attention.So as Pi survived, along with him a Orangutan named Orange Juice, a Hyena named Hari, an unnamed Zebra, and his companion through out the whole story a Tiger named Richard Parker. The other three animals die of hunger and feud and so leaving Richard and Pi together. Pi teaches Richard to become submissive and obedient to him through a series of struggles and eventually they both survived in the end, although, what happened to Richard is unknown whether he lived on after reaching the Mexican shore is for our imagination to work its wonders.Even though, most would probably choose the second version of the story that Pi told the Japanese investigators and its convincing for humans I'd prefer the original story that Pi overcame.Overall, the movie is jaw dropping, the cinematography is very well done, the story...ORIGINAL!

Life of Pi simple review,"Well. I just wrote a magnificent and long review of this film and then my computer refreshed itself. But i started it like this. I don't know where to start. The great new Leading Actor, this magnificent achievement in Directing, or this phenomenal use of CGI and computer animation. Piscine ""Pissing"" Molitor Patel's life is amazing. I love this movie, flat out. I can only imagine how long and descriptive the book is. Suraj Sharma (Pi) is a fantastic new Leading Actor in this movie. Especially since his supporting actor is the one and only Richard Parker. No, Richard Parker isn't a great actor you haven't heard of, Richard Parker is the name of the tiger seen on the boat with Pi. It is very hard to talk about this movie without giving away any of the plot. But i can say that this young man and his acting incorporated with the visionary computer animations was fantastic. The CGI and Computer animation in this film is in one compound word. Ground-breaking. Even better than Avatar. When you and I are in our elderly years, you being the reader, we will show this to our grandchildren as ""The movie that changed how the world looked at CGI."" I know that CGI has been around for a while as it is a newer thing but i truly think this is the first great usage of Computer Animation in a motion picture. I hope that Ang Lee is proud of himself and his crew. No other person could tell this story the way he/they did. The Achievement in Directing Oscar he was awarded was well deserved. The cast and crew captured this story the best way possible. I loved it. That is all i have to say. I recommend this movie to any and all.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

It' a treat for the eyes, but that is just the tip of the iceberg, since this combined with the amazing coming of age story and good acting, dialogues makes this a great watch for everyone.The plot is nicely paced, maybe a little slow for some, but I feel that is necessary to hook one in and make the emotions portrayed feel true. However thanks to 'Richard Parker' there is also an element of thrill that keeps you on the edge time and again. These is a certain kind of purity to the story, but without compromising on subtlety and elegance.The scenes portrayed i.e. nighttime, sunsets, the lightning and storms, the exquisite variety of animals, underwater scenes; the rare but amazing quips and the beautiful analogy used as a 'proof of god' all on the whole left me strangely content when the movie ended, i.e. without the nagging need for 'more' that some good stories often leave behind.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Proper adventure story with the visual effects to match.,"Life of Pi is a story about a young Indian boy who survives a shipwreck with a Bengal tiger. If that doesn't perk your interest, I'm not too sure what will. This film is a proper adventure story with storytelling that takes you on a journey in a way that I've not experienced in awhile. And boy how it has been translated to visual form is breathtaking. No surprises at all at the cinematography, directing and visual Oscars it's won with the best animation I have ever seen. I can honestly say that in almost no scene was any animation apparent and that just immersed me more into the adventure.Suraj Sharma does a brilliant job as the shipwrecked Pi, and Irrfan Khan plays an understated but equally charming adult Pi. The tiger, Richard Parker, forms a bond with the viewer that creeps up on you, and by the end I was hoping for it's survival as much as for Pi's. For something that spends the majority of the film as an animation, I thought that was fantastic. Perhaps the only con is the religion angle that some may not appreciate. However, I found it was just a facet of the plot and I had no problems with it.I'm going to put myself on the chopping block and say this is one of the most complete films I've seen in a long time.

A Beautiful Movie!,This is a movie full of inspiration and human survival instincts along with ample dose of emotions and Pi's affection for the beautiful Bengal tiger.Although you want to believe that animals do have feelings but this movie correctly portrays that animals only have instincts not feelings.It also makes us sad to think that they may not feel the love we want them to feel and also do not reciprocate it.That is the saddest part of the movie for me...when Pi's expect some kind of gesture from the tiger but the tiger just disappears into the jungle.But then again we must also be happy since the true home of the tiger is the jungle and he is happiest there.Also this movie shows the amazing human brains and how Pi's uses different skills to survive.I do not want to reveal the entire story but this is A must watch for every person of every age.,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
'Pi is the tiger' and other analysis,"I watched the movie 'Life of Pi' today, it was fascinating. I was not able to think while the movie was playing because the incredible imagery continuously running in front of me, didn't provide me with the sufficient time to think. Yes, the book says that he was stranded in the sea for 277 days, well, the movie showed this extent of 277 days in less than 2 hours. Though, the story is fictional (yeahh! I know it says that this is based on a true story), so imagination has a greater scope. But, in the second attempt of his story, he implies that he was the tiger who ate the co-passengers in his life-boat, including his mother, the cook and whosoever he states were with them. Even in the first scene, where the hyena attacked the zebra and the orangutan, it angered Pi. Pi rose to attack it and suddenly, a Tiger catapulted itself to the open and attacked it. This may symbolize that the tiger in Pi rose to life at that moment. Well, remember what Pi's father had told him when for the first time he made an attempt to feed flesh to the tiger. Can't remember the quote word-to-word, but it did mention that you can see your emotions in the eyes of the tiger. Blah! The child (Pi, of course), who has digested 3 religions at once could also assimilate the very notion that 'the reflection-of-emotions' can be vice verse i.e., the tiger's emotions could reflect within him too (Read this line twice to make better sense of it).Next, it killed and ate the hyena first. As that was the time when he was experimenting with new meat, he tried the human flesh (as they were dead). Please note, 277 days! So, he ate his mother and then the cook (don't remember the other character he mentioned though). So here we see, that Pi became cannibalistic. Later on, he hunted fish and ate them for the next few days. I was not able to think all this when the movie was running because the scenes were running so fast, that, I hardly got the time to digest any of it. That is why Hollywood (I dono under what category this movie comes under) movies seem believable, because, it doesn't give you the time to think.The visit to the Carnivore Island was the best part of the movie for me, just for its sheer representation of multiple symbolism. One thing I noticed was that it characterized Lord Vishnu, who is sleeping in the ocean on Anantha (the poisonous snake). The very reason that the roots of the trees were entangled and looked as though it was crawling represented this very notion of the snake. The image over all, looked like a person sleeping - Lord Vishnu. It represented his form (the island) to be the life-giver in the morning (when the Lord must be sleeping), while at night, the island becomes acidic and kills all life forms on it, the Lord is asleep then, the poisonous snake feature is activated. So, this must be one of the crazy ideas behind this (and yes, I appreciate it). Well, heard a myth that the Tirumala hills which has the Tirupathi temple in its abode, which is in Andhra Pradesh, India. This temple has 7 hills surrounding it. Some amazing person found the shape of the hill to be the shape of the Tirupathi Venkateshwara's face. You can have a look at the picha (in the link below). The Carnivorous island has a similar concept as that of the pic of the hills. Well, there is a saying/belief that one day, all the wild (carnivorous) animals would come down this hill and attack humans. This will happen when the Lord would wake up. Don't worry it is a saying.The very reason Pi-fellow could come up with such a fascinating story is because, he has read 3 religious texts and understood the best way to narrate a thing that could sound realistic and yet exploit the reader/viewer's brain. This maybe the link with his interest with the religious text, and the dichotomy of being a cannibal.While watching the movie it made me feel that Pi is so heroic and he had survived it all. But, now I feel bitter for his act of cannibalism. His lies/truth... blah! it is a fiction. No need to ponder anymore. Well, I loved the movie and I will be watching it again. *giggles*",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

I preferred to watch it in 3D and I would recommend the same to everyone.Life of Pi is one of the movies that shows more promise than the book. Though the book gives exquisite details, the movie gives a more visual experience of those details.The direction is top notch. You can't expect any less from an Oscar winning director. Steady hands. Perfect angles. And the close up shots of our only Richard Parker, the Bengal tiger. You surely wouldn't want to miss that. Cinematography is perfect.Suraj Sharma as Pi Patel is a suitable find for the character. He surely can act. Perfect kick-start for his career. His rendezvous with Richard Parker and the chemistry between them is the factor that holds you to the movie.Irrfan Khan has a brief and supporting role. He couldn't have done any better that this.The background score is scene-oriented. Though the ambient sounds are incredible. Every detail of the sound has been looked out for.In the end, a satisfying experience of picture and sound.Its a story of belief. Its a story of faith.If you have read the book, don't miss out the movie. If you haven't, and the movie trailer interests you, then go for it.Go splash in the Pacific for an amazing adventure.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Slow boring movie and smacks of new age,"First off, let me just say that I am NOT some religious nut. I a have seen the twilight movies and probably a bunch of other movies that I shouldn't be watching. I'm an adult and can sift through a movie and take away what I want and watch the rest just for entertainment value, even though I AM a Christian.That being said....this movie takes about five different religions and mixes them all together and basically says, it's okay to believe in anything you want, that everything is ALL the same and you can pick apart different ideas and make your own religion. I found that idea very disturbing and I wouldn't even mention it, except for the fact that they push this super spiritual mixture mess throughout the entire movie. I would have loved this movie if they would of left the spiritual voodoo out of the movie. Make it a simple story of overcoming the odds and finding a bonding relationship with an exotic animal that not many people will ever understand, let alone come that close to. I could believe and even respect that. Some people has special talents and gifts with animals and can understand them in ways most people can't, and the animals reciprocate that back.Enough said about the religious stuff...let me just say that the movie was pretty slow. I know that one of the main characters(aka..the tiger) doesn't have dialogue and so you have to rely on the animals body language to do the talking for you. There was one part towards the end of the movie(don't want to give it away) where I thought I was having an acid trip, the idea was so ridiculous and strange. I know this is supposed to be a deep spiritual and slightly(and I emphasize slightly) philosophical type movie, but that wasn't what I was expecting to get out of this movie and towards the end, it just got ridiculous. Not to mention, I hated the way things ended up with the boy and the tiger and the ending of the actual movie was very boring and anticlimactic.I like deep...deep thoughts, ideas...I can do deep in my sleep, but this movie was just weird on every level and is honestly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. This COULD have been a really great movie if they would of kept it simple...boy bonds with tiger and overcomes all odds...no mumbo jumbo wonky stuff.That's my two cents anyway...",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Ship,A movie about the perils of live animal exports by sea,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
an outstanding film with much food for thought,"This film is about a young Indian boy who survives a shipwreck while cruising the Pacific Ocean. The twist is that there is a tiger on his lifeboat.The film tells a tale of survival, of how Pi has to battle the treacherous ocean and at the same time fear for the ferocious tiger. His constant battles to survive is engagingly presented, as each challenge is so real. It's amazing how desperate situations can bring another side out of us. As the plot continues, something feels not so right, until the twist comes that everything makes sense again. This twist serves not only to surprise and entertain, but adds a whole new dimension to ponder upon. The struggles presented initially all pales in comparison. It's intensely moving. After watching the film, I felt tingles around my body because the emotional cascade lingers on.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
A visual feast.... but so much more!,"Life of Pi. Where to begin? Life of Pi is probably most known for it's stunning visual effects after picking up Best Visual Effects and Cinematography at the Oscars. So, that is a good place to start. The cgi is INCREDIBLE! The tiger looks unbelievably realistic and some of the landscapes are breath-taking. This visuals are commonly compared to Avatar. Life of Pi's are far supreme. The story is also brilliant yet simple; a boy and a tiger trapped on a boat. It does not hold up to the claim that it will 'make you believe in God' yet it is a heart-warming tale with a thought provoking final twist. The script does not stand out compared to the visuals but is witty and emotional and hooks the viewer. This is a Hollywood blockbuster yet mainly consists of an Indian cast that aren't very well known. I feel that this is a bonus because you do not see Pi as a Hollywood superstar but, instead, as an average boy. This doesn't mean, however, that Suraj Sharma (actor who plays Pi for the main section of the film) acted to the standard of a normal boy. The acting was very good (not award worthy) and was clever as Pi was mainly reacting to a CGI tiger. The music is also very good and fits with the cultural style of the different locations. However, I wouldn't say that it deserved the Oscar for it. This film is a visual feast to remember but is also a lot more - a story that will stay with the viewer long after the film and a script and acting that fits well. This is a real achievement for director, Ang Lee, and he truly deserved his Oscar. This film is a real gem and deserves more popularity than it has been given.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

"Just like a firework, LIFE OF PI is a dazzling spectacle at first, but it's lasting impact is ultimately forgettable","With its' poetic realism and sickly, spiritual subtext, Yann Martel's international bestselling novel Life of Pi was once declared unfilmable. Until now. Directed by Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon's Ang Lee, even if the plot stinks; this beautiful adventure movie is an absolute must-see.Newcomer Suraj Sharma stars as Piscine Molitor Patel, aka Pi; a well-educated, wistful teenager growing up on the grounds of his family's zoo in Pondicherry, India. The curious son of liberal parentage, Pi is fascinated by the religions of the world, studying them in detail but undecided, what is the correct path for him. Finding the answer and his soul mate, his father declares that the family are broke and must relocate to Canada. Boarding a cargo ship with his family and the anaesthetised exotic animals resting in the hull underneath, their journey across the Pacific is disrupted by the perfect storm; sending the vessel plunging to the seabed. The only human survivor, orphaned Pi is left stranded aboard a lifeboat with a hysterical hyena, wounded zebra, benevolent orangutan and a Bengalese Tiger called Richard Parker.You don't have to be an ethologist to see that Pi's predicament would cause an infinite number of problems. Once the animals clash, our hero is left as the carnivorous Richard Parker's final prey. But through his resourcefulness and spirituality, Pi manages to survive the fatal claws of his feline shipmate and, over a period of 227 days, the pair end up forming a remarkable relationship, built on companionship, fear and the mutual hope that they will one day be rescued.Words cannot describe how stunning this movie is to look at. With the help of cinematographer Claudio Miranda and a committed special effects team, the Oscar-Winning filmmaker behind Brokeback Mountain and the ill-fated comic-book hero Hulk has directed the first ever 3-D Art film. A bottomless box of visual delights, colours have never been so vivid, landscapes so luscious or 3D so fantastic. Instead of distancing us from the action on-screen, causing light-loss and nausea, the once-dreaded stereoscopic glasses deepen our engagement with Pi & Parker's ordeal. An extraordinary quest where they encounter millions of flying fish skittering past them, phosphorescent jellyfish glowing underneath, a breaching whale gliding across the starry skyline and an island inhabited by 60,000 Meerkats.In his debut role, Sharma is fantastic as Pi, able to balance religious fervour, comical flourish and irrepressible charm, even if his supporting catty cast member was almost entirely a digital creation, blended into the live action seamlessly. It's incredibly refreshing to see the ironically named Richard Parker never anthropomorphized. He doesn't talk, nor even exist in the real world, yet his presence in Pi's is what saves him, and ultimately the film, from excessive ""is there a god?"" ruminations.Adapted by screenplay writer David Magee (Finding Neverland), the cinematic spectacle does it's best to cloak what is ostensibly a very corny plot, but elements of the baggy original novel still creep in. In typical Forest Gump style, most of the story unravels through recollection, with a present day Pi (played by Irrfan Khan), living in Montreal and narrating the tale to a curious Canadian novelist (Rafe Spall). It's a telling-over-showing narrative compromise lifted directly from Martel's novel. A thorny branch that jolts the audience back into the mundane world we are all used to, and away from the wonderful realm where we'd rather be.Whilst my atheism was left unscathed, the rapturous aestheticism rekindled my passion for big blockbuser cinema. Life of Pi is a much-needed bit of heart-warming magic during this frosty festive season.Find more reviews at www.366movies.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Very contemplative movie with stunning effects and music,"Unlike most of the movies adapted from books that don't live up to their source, this movie has done more than justice to Yann Martel's book. The introduction to India, the music, typical school life etc have been very well portrayed. The music interluded with Indian classical tunes on Tampura and flute was wonderful. The emotions and feelings that go to and forth between Pi and Tiger while abandoned in the sea are remarkable (although Pi should have a been more emotional when he loses his family). Mr Lee has blended 3D computer graphics very well into the main story line without getting the audience bored (though once there was a feeling that CG would have been avoided in some places). The movie had space for a subtle fun too which was acted out very well by Suraj (Pi). Finally you get to really contemplate about the movie once you are out of the theater about questions like Faith and Life! Great movie to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Must watch life of pi,"When I started the movie I really wasn't expecting much, but both the storyline and the plot got me intrigued. Moreover, I saw the reviews the critics the media and people made, so I told myself: what the hell! I'll watch it and see for myself. The storyline makes you go places you wouldn't dare to explore. And the picture in this cinematography make you wonder if any special effects were used at all. The story of Piscine is intriguing, even hypnotizing. You wonder if all of this is a dream or just pure, blunt reality. Be prepared to be shocked, discover your very true nature, Or dare you? This movie is a piece of art, something everybody should reflect about and go farther than just a movie, a film or whatever you may call it. It makes you question what your life is about and what want to do with it. Enjoy the screening!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Enchanting Story with Beautiful Visuals,"Ang Lee is a Master story teller. He has succeeded yet again to deliver us with an astounding piece of work. Beautiful story and incredible visual effects and scenery. The cast was wonderful. Life of Pi takes the viewer to a journey of magic and wonder. It also depicts the vivid and colorful world of India especially during the colonial period. I would have wished the script had been a bit better, and honestly speaking there were few moments it felt a bit too dragging...perhaps overly emphasized on emotional acting.

"Big Tiger, Small Boat","Greetings again from the darkness. Every now and then we are reminded of just how stunning movies can be. Periodically a filmmaker proves to us that pushing the envelope of creativity still drives some auteurs. James Cameron brought us Avatar, which demonstrated that 3D technology could be beautiful and breath-taking. As beautiful and new as Cameron's breakthrough was, it lacked a story worthy of it advancements. Now, we get director Ang Lee's vision of Yann Martel's worldwide bestseller, and we are left gasping at what happens when you combine a fantastical story with technological advances and perfection.Ang Lee has provided us with a varied selection of films including Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon; Brokeback Mountain; and Sense and Sensibility. He refuses to be limited by genre and takes a global and philosophical view of filmmaking. He wants us to think and discuss and think some more. His Life of Pi film purposefully leaves many scenes, events and thoughts open to interpretation. You can see as much or as little of humanity in this story as you like.The brilliant opening shows real animals in the real zoo located in Pondicherry, India. The colors, sights and sounds are dazzling and give us an immediate feel for the area. We meet young Pi and his family. Pi is inquisitive and ingenious from an early age. His father imparts such wisdom as ""If you believe in everything, you believe in nothing"". This comes as Pi is absorbing multiple religions and considers himself Hindu/Muslim/Christian. At an early age, he seeks answers and meaning. Soon enough, Pi and his family take their most valued animals on a ship to Canada. Disaster strikes when a storm capsizes the ship and Pi is the lone human survivor. He finds himself in a small lifeboat with a hyena, an orangutan, and a huge Bengal tiger.The developments need not be discussed here, but rather the focus of the story is the spirit of survival that Pi possesses. His ingenious methods of learning to coexist with the ferocious tiger force us to consider what the human race has done to nature in too many regards to count. Pi's religious spirit and insightful ways, coupled with a very specific survival guide, lead him to maneuver 227 days adrift in the Pacific. In the process, we are treated to some of the most spectacular visuals ever seen on screen. At times the sea, and its sea life and sky, are phosphorescent. The story is so amazing that we find ourselves not caring how much is real and how much is caused by Pi's hunger and thirst. Some of the visual effects are tranquil, while others are quite violent. A sequence featuring flying silver fish is something to behold.The structure of the story is such that an adult Pi (played by Irrfan Khan) is re-telling the tale of survival to a Canadian novelist (Rafe Spall). While this is a traditional story-telling device, it takes nothing away from the anything but traditional story of Pi and Richard Parker (the tiger's name). We are told ""This is a story that will make you believe in God"". Whether it does or it doesn't, it certainly makes us believe in the magic of movies.Some will compare to Castaway, while others will think of 127 Hours. My best advice is to let go and give yourself to the story and the film. There is always time afterwards for debate and discussion. Instead, enjoy the moment and be thankful that a movie like this can get made ... it will lead the industry to even more creative productions down the road. So, just this once, forget what I have said many times, and go see this one in 3D. Allow it to take you away.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Too showy and overspirited with carefully selected 3D-friendly images,"Life of Pi tells the remarkable story of a young Indian boy (Suraj Sharma) whose family decide to relocate to Canada along with their zoo of animals. Then a massive storm sets in, the ship goes down, and Pi finds himself the only human survivor in a lifeboat along with a wounded zebra, a hyena, an orangutan and a Bengal tiger, and they must all fight for survival in an unforgiving Pacific ocean whilst learning to relate to each other.Hailed for its breathtaking 3D visuals and fantastic story, Life of Pi is an obvious crowd-pleaser celebrating life, nature, and a romanticized version of the survival of the fittest. At its best, the movie encapsulates much of what the film medium has to offer, but I don't care too much for Ang Lee's direction here. It's too showy, too overspirited, like something made high on drugs. Nature's wonders and carefully selected 3D-friendly images are being thrown at you whenever Lee feels the need to embellish. Additionally, the conversational narrative form makes the first part of the film too talky and explanatory. In a film as devoted to imagery as this, I would have wished the filmmakers had used the rich visuals more to tell the story than to brag.The highlights are few and far between, but in the film's middle part - the survival segments - Lee finally lets his images speak for themselves, and this is easily the pinnacle of the film. The interplay between the boy and the tiger is among the most believable and interesting aspects in an otherwise at times unbelievable setting, and it combines tension and suspense with several fascinating psychological and behaviouristic observations.The richness of this story is unquestionable, and I suspect the novel could be a good read, but the film only works partially because it's too unfocused and shallow. Some will claim that fantastical elements needn't be believable or accounted for, but in Life of Pi these elements work merely as an excuse for scoring cheap points and preach pretentiously about the importance of having faith, believing in yourself, follow your dreams, and several other vapid Hollywoodish clichés. Life of Pi will probably be a wet dream for uncritical AMPAS members, but it's really one of the most flawed movies of the year - albeit never completely uninteresting.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
A visual treat.. and a masterpiece story of survival against all odds!,"I watched this movie in Imax 3D yesterday! And boy, was I stunned! I haven't read the book so I will not compare the movie with the book. But, the movie in itself is pure pleasure for the senses, both external and internal. Its like a feast being laid out before your eyes, and eyes you wouldn't wanna blink! This is the best 3D movie so far (yes, even better than Avatar). The 3D and effects aside, I think its the story and the direction by Ang Lee that keeps the viewers engaged. And of course, the ferocious Royal Bengal Tiger, named Richard Parker. If only, animals could be awarded for their acting, the tiger would get the best actor award. The best scenes of the movie are the nighttime shots of the vast Pacific ocean and the underwater sequences. I didn't like the ending of the movie though, which made me doubt what I saw from the start. The spirituality aspect is delivered in plenty in the movie. Afterall, its a tale of survival against all odds. The movie is a winner because it delivers a simple tale which would have been so difficult to film in a manner which is not only beautiful but also humbling.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Once again 'Ang Lee' proves that he he is a master story teller... More than the actor 'Life of Pi' belongs to its director Ang Lee.

scientifically challenged,"I think the possible scientific explanation of this entire event that the boy experienced could be nothing but dream or hallucination or delirium. the most logical sequence of events as i see it is that the boy hits his head or may be due to extreme state of starvation, dehydration or stress is either hallucinating or dreaming while he laid in the boat in an unconsciousness state until he hits the beach where he is rescued by Mexican guys. the whole dramatization is pretty much unreal otherwise. the appearance of this unrealistic floating island which is not known to exist and disappearance of tiger supports this argument. good for a change though.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The Conceptual Review,"World is a zoo bearing many species of the life where each individual witnesses the minds and souls of others which actually represents the universal truth. Opening with the soothing voice the Indian classical music of Bombay Jayashree gives us the calmness that exists in the blue planet. The takeover of the story slowly grabs the impetus in the traditional method of the Irfan khan recollecting the olden days as though inculcating the thought process of mind which always moves back either into the history or toggles into the future and never stays in the present. The years of 1950's of newly born India's is well thought of to be a subject matter. The story giving a philosophical glimpse starts with Lord Krishna who symbolizes the ultimate bliss of life throughout his journey of life, by a way of circumscribing the entire Universe in his tiny little mouth is a valid way of representing the Pi responding to it while his brother doesn't. The interests of pi and his brother are varied throughout the movie. The hunger for knowledge awakened the pi while his brother was attracted by the fantasies of the world, cleanly represented by the holy water in the church. The senses of hearing of Allah did not affect Ravi but the listening Allah touched the ears of Pi. The concept of Absurdity is also meaningfully taken into the story by the introduction of Albert Camus to the pi. The worldly fascination doesn't give the ""Anand(i)"" is very well depicted in the movie. The concentration of the fact of Darwin's theory of ""struggle for existence"" is shown at every step of the movie such as his father's business mind where he thinks to move to Canada, and also by the fact in the life boat where at the point where he kills the fishes to feed himself and the fierce Richard parker. The conflict in the mind about the killing of the fishes (other species) for the one's own survival on this planet is the lively truths of past, present and the futuristic tendencies of the world. The colors about the godly islands which shall mark the origin of the all the energy which starts with the birth of cold and healthy water lakes along the sunrise and dawns with the water being acidic in nature turning wild to end the life of many species also seems relevant to life. The realization of the nature's thunder storm-god paradox is brought evidently to depict the curiosity (JIGNYASA) to know the world, one self and God .The simile of Tiger to that of the soul of the pi is very interesting. Life is a journey of the body and the soul in this planet to evolve or reach a destined destination. On finishing the journey body shall cry for the loss of the soul, nevertheless the soul is liberated without even bidding the good bye, becomes one with the universal eternal energy. The tiger which represents the depth of the pi, departs without any hesitation deep into the forests brings the end of the 25 years story in 3 hours. The making of the movie and the 3d effects and photography has really made it worth the golden statues. The editing and the Foley have made it supportive to the great Oscars.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Life of Pi-mind boggling visuals,profound narrative and story telling at its best","Life of Pi- a must watch It's quite apparent going by the trailers and the buzz generated by this movie that its all about a young man's survival from a terrible ship wreck and a certain Bengal Tiger ( named Richard Parker for mildly amusing reasons) during a storm in the Pacific Ocean. A middle aged Pi ( with a generous mop of curly hair , played by the subtle and extremely engaging Irrfan Khan) recounting his tale to a wide eyed Canadian novelist.The older Pi takes the novelist down memory lane and in the process paints a picture postcard of Puducherry, the zoo owned by his rational and strict father and his innate faith in godliness, religion whetted by his curiosity during the adolescent years. The parents had a different perspective on religion and spirituality – the father an atheist and the mother – mildly encouraging and endearing do not impede the young boy's religious intentions giving him the wherewithal to choose his own path.His life is not devoid of love as Pi in an understated manner states "" We both had just enough time to break each other's heart"" In due course of time due to the unstable financial and business climate post emergency, the father takes the stellar decision of migrating to Canada for a better future aided by the sale of zoo animals. Aboard the ship, nature plays spoilsport in form of a terrible thunderstorm leaving Pi the only human survivor with a ferocious tiger for company Picture this – it's just the boy and the Bengal tiger out there in the dark deep sea along with the forces of nature playing against him ( rain or shine plays true here) The Bengal tiger aka Richard Parker is an offshoot of digital imagery – the eyes, majestic walk, fur and the famous roar makes it all the more believable. This story is appealing as it deals with the problems Pi must solve which forms the most dramatic center piece of the film and you start identifying with Pi and the leap of faith he sorely needs. How in the middle of the ocean would he find food and water, avoid turning into Mr Parker's meal of the day, guts and gumption required to sale through this ordeal. The relationship he shares with Parker shows shades of fear, competition, predatory instincts, compassion and love with the director showing remarkable restraint and control in not following the predictable path.LOP's background score does not distract you, rather it plays a supporting role (the Tamil ditty at the beginning of the movie sung in a very soft and mellifluous voice) . The 3d visuals speak a language of their own (turquoise blue water, flying fish, dancing dolphins) aided by engaging story telling make it a visual spectacle Sooraj Sharma who plays the teen age Pi, is utterly believable as the character and you live and identify his trials and tribulations, while Irrfan Khan underplays the ordeal he has survived with an uncanny blend of normalcy. Adil and Tabu as Pi's parents in their own sublime way add a lot to the character of the boy who transforms into a man with a life changing experience The movie is one of a kind which is a visual marvel aided by wonderful storytelling , has profound lines , goose bump inducing moments and makes you believe in all the wondrous things and the avalanche of emotions the director has used to play with the human psyche be it Pi or us.It may also make you ponder and ramificate in the end whether you have seen anything at all :)p Love,Life,Luck and Laughter, Shekhar Vijayan.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Overrated pretentious Hollywood Nothingness!,"Let me start this review by saying I have enjoyed many of Ang Lee's films in the past. Let me also say that I am an animal lover. And as an animal lover I am appalled that this movie got made.Now I am fully aware that a significant portion of the animal scenes were cg. Nonetheless, the extent of distress that the animals suffered in the actual scenes that were used on top of a blue screen amounted to nothing less than gross levels of animal cruelty and so typical of a person completely indifferent of modern day animal issues.For that Ang Lee should be ashamed of himself.Bottom line, I can't say strong enough that this is NOT a story that should have been put on film!!!I say that for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is that the start of the film was culturally inaccurate. The mere suggestion that an Indian boy could freely and happily explore Hinduism, Islam and Christianity is nothing short of ludicrous and extends way beyond the scope of being able to 'suspend disbelief'. As for the cg, again, I felt is was ordinary at best and certainly not worth all the Oscar buzz it achieved.Don't get me wrong, I got the bigger message. I just don't think the vehicle for it was suitable for film and I don't think it can be even mentioned in the same sentence as films like Avatar. I have not read the book and I'm sure it was a great book, but it should have stayed a best selling novel.As for the film; it is used toilet paper and for his complicity in gross acts of animal cruelty, I hope Ang Lee never works again.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
the best review for the life of pi,"when a person believe that there is someone responsible for the existence of every thing and every body but he doesn't actually believe at any religion......that person should be pi-sen or pi .may be he loves Jesus and may be he can see the greatness of Islam and at some point he also liked being Jewish and he is actually a Honduran , a weird combination of a believer but it is not a weird thing of a city like India where every one may has his own religion.but if we have a little look to the other film makers we may realize that it is not really weird and i think it is intended.the novel writer is Yann Martel and he is a Catholic and the director is Ang Lee and he is a Buddhist a great intended combination of thoughts you will recognize when you see the life of pi and that is a true cinematic achievement for sure ..does the animals think of us like we think about them ?? is that possible that a relation between the Man and animal may Exists ??The most important thing of this film is it character. It is obvious because we are seeing for almost 2 hours just one character. So it is not only important to have a great character that appeals to the audience feelings, but to have a great script like that script ..Ang Lee took a novel which a lot of critics thought that it is impossible that it might be made as a movie someday and David Magee made a brief script which explain the novel from Lee's point of view ..many people may consider that the fearsome Bengal tiger presents some thing more than a tiger and that might be a true thing cause Martel tried to explain that you can't live without fear of some thing and that is the reason that pi said that he is a live till now because of the existence of that fearsome Bengal tiger in his amazing journey..he tried to tell us that without fear you can't survive in your life and it is a fact , you must fear and struggle also he showed us that a relation between man and animal could be exist but eventually it is a relation between an animal and the man ..and the best thing about that movie is that Lee let you to choose which story that you prefer the tiger one or the other story at the end of the movie so which one do you like most the realistic one or the the Imagined one and even which one of them is the real one and the imagined one for you ...the movie helps you to meditate generally especially when you experience it in 3D or Max and of course the visual effects played an important role ..the sound editing and was quiet and soft and it was Proportionate with the movie Ambiance which also may help you to Meditate ..the movie has 11 nominations but i don't think that it will gain more than 3 wins specially at the existence of other great movies like tango unchained and Lincoln and Le miserables and others ..i don't think that it will win the best motion picture of the year or best directing but another wins are waiting like the Sound Mixing and Visual Effects ..",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
good movie about a kid stuck in a boat with a tiger,"Life of pi is a very good film, What Ang Lee does visually using 3D and the surroundings are amazing throughout and a testament to his confidence behind the camera. The themes of religion and story telling and all that hoo hah are presented well enough and I had a lot of moments where I was all like ""this can be applied to my own life and stuff, man"" so I'd be surprised if you walked away from this completely unaffected.The majority of the film that takes place upon the boat is incredibly well handled and often told through purely visual means without having a character speak. The computer-generated animals are also a marvel to watch and came about as close to seeming tangible as I've ever seen in a movie.One of my problems with the film is it's bookended by the grown up Pi relating his story to the shell of a journalist that presumably once contained a personality, and as far as existing to provide a basis for the narration it works, but it's a VERY obvious narrative tool.If you're looking for some competent awards season fare that raises some mildly interesting questions about faith and identity while also having some very life-affirming moments give this a watch. If not, I recommend you watch anything by David Cronenberg and feel violated in knowing you just saw what you just saw.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
One of the best movies I've seen in a long time...,"Life of Pi was simply amazing! It had that epic feel in spanning the young life of the title character beginning as a young boy - and then his adult self. Add to that the drama and sense of adventure and survival as he is stranded at sea with some animals and eventually the tiger, Richard Parker. Throw in some fantasy and exquisite cinematography with the nighttime scenes especially. And the cherry on top? The message of faith but not in a preachy way. I think some have tried to read into the religious aspect maybe too much in reading other reviews. This film IMO was generalizing to suit a purpose. It's pretty easy to figure out. This is one of those movies that sticks with you. I will be buying a copy on DVD for my permanent library. Ang Lee has done it again!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
the Will,"*When: 7:20, 25th Nov. 2012 *Where: Maichilai, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.*How: Driving to theater. After exercising.*Why: Ann Lee create a film which is echoed well from the critics. although I didn't successfully join the Taiwan Mobile VIP due to seats too much near screen for my Mom, I decided to go to see it and share with Janet.*Whom: Myself.*What: Despite of the confusion about which one of the stories is true eventually, there are some deep meanings inside of the film. The father next to me was yawning in some quiet scene. Maybe he's still figure out the essence of it. The great things I enjoy are the artistic design and natural arrangement of 3D. The core idea delivered from this film is not only the will of survival but also a philosophy of life in an unknown adventure.*Conclusion: a great one for refreshing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Ang Lee Does A Good Job Of Adapting What Must Have Been A Difficult Novel To Adapt,"Having read and enjoyed the book, I approached this movie very cautiously, wondering how ti could possibly live up to the novel on which it's based. In truth, it didn't. Rarely does a movie based on a novel manage to do that. However, while it doesn't meet the standard of the novel, I have to give credit to Ang Lee and others who were involved in the production. ""Life of Pi"" (the novel) would have been a very difficult novel to adapt for the screen for a whole variety of reasons - but I think Lee and others did a commendable job of bringing the basic story to life.The film starts out relatively slowly, with an exploration of Pi's upbringing. Named ""Piscine Molitor Patel"" after a swimming pool in France, Piscine adopts the shortened form of ""Pi."" He's raised in India, spends much of his time observing the animals at the zoo owned by his family and embarks on a spiritual quest, raised as a Hindu, but also adopting Islam and Christianity, because he simply wants to love God. Then, his father decides to move to Canada, and while on the way the ship they're travelling on sinks and Pi finds himself the only human survivor, adrift on a lifeboat with only a tiger named Richard Parker for companionship.The shipwreck and the voyage in the lifeboat is wonderfully portrayed, if a little bit (to say the least) unrealistic. Of course, when I say that I'm falling into the trap of the Japanese ship owners, who also can't accept that Pi's story can be real. This, of course, is the spiritual crux of the story: what, exactly, is reality? Are some stories too good to be true? Are some stories so good that they can only have come from God? It's an interesting spiritual exploration - not at all heavy handed, but often front and centre.The ocean voyage is basically a one man show, carried effectively by Suraj Sharma as Pi. The other characters, of course, are the animals in the lifeboat: Richard Parker the tiger, a zebra, a hyena and an orangutan. The animals are animated, but incredibly realistic. The older Pi, who tells the story, is played by Irffan Khan, whose soft-spoken portrayal captures the essence of the character.It's a commendable adaptation of the novel. The opening scenes in India left me a bit dry to be honest, but the very powerful portrayal of the ocean voyage drew me back in completely. Overall, a pretty decent adaptation of the novel.

Easily the best movie of the year,"This was an outstanding movie that combines solid acting, great photography, outstanding special effects and an interesting plot line. I was puzzled at how the director could make a movie about a boy and a tiger in a boat interesting, but he does that in spades.It is especially interesting to try to determine which scenes with the tiger are real and which are Cgi. Other than looking closely at the eyes, it is often hard to determine. The transitions between real and artificial are so seamless, the tiger feels real throughout.The ending as well is something special and leaves room for your own interpretation.Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Life of Pi..is spell-binding!!,"I often try to use the movie name or something about it as part of my blog title. However, nothing short of 'spell-binding' does justice to this one. Ang Lee brings to life practically the impossible – a supposedly unfilmable book is presented in a manner that is a treat for the senses making Life of Pi a must-watch all the way!!Life of Pi starts off slow and after a time you begin wondering where's all the water, animals and action you saw in the trailer - but patience bears fruit. Once the adventure begins you are completely swept away and by the time the film reaches its abrupt intermission (since there's really no intermission in a Hollywood movie) you are well entrenched in the adventure and in no mood for a break.There's a lot of talk about the 3D of Life of Pi being better than Avatar. I'd just say that Life of Pi is presented in 3D in an Avatar of its own, the kind that perfectly suits the story that is told. The 3D isn't as extravagant, but peaks up at exactly the right moments and some scenes are sure to give you the thrills you would seek from a 3D movie. Clearly some lessons for all and sundry on how to use 3D in a movieHowever, while its a visual spectacle, Life of Pi is a real winner more because of the kind of depth its storyline offers. On the face of it, its an adventure, a tale of courage, hope and survival all very well but peel the layers and you find profound depth and meaning to everything you've witnessed in an entirely different light. I myself believe that I have only scratched the surface of what Life of Pi has to offer apart from its visual treat and best of all the director doesn't push you to think in any given direction. Its for you to think, explore and ponder or notThe performances are top notch too, Suraj Sharma the protagonist does a decent job and pulls off a difficult role. The treatment to his character and his visual appearance is thoughtful and consistent, making his unbelievable story come to life. Irrfan Khan delivers yet again and though his initial accent is a little unbecoming, his emotional delivery later in the movie takes the cake. So does Adil Hussain impress with his impeccable accent and delivery in the earlier part of the movie. The only one wasted, is Tabu who given her range of performance is given a rather simple and short roleThe real star of the show is however, Ang Lee – first for believing that such a movie was possible and secondly for presenting it so wondrously - with scenes shot under and over water, at close quarters with a royal Bengal tiger and a host of other superb sequences.After one has almost given up here comes a real winner. One should never lose hope..so is the case with God, and Hollywood too I guess ;)To read my reviews on other movies check out my blog at http://www.anitalks.blogspot.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Life of Pi is a wonderful journey,"If you are paging through reviews trying to determine if this film is worthy of your time, effort, and money, let me cut to the chase for you....YES! YES! YES! This is a very unique movie, unlike any you may have seen before. The acting is brilliant, the storyline is compelling, the cinematography breath taking, and the adventure is spellbinding. If that sounds like a fun time at the movies, then this one is for you.I had the good fortune to see this movie in 3D, I'm sure it is good without the 3D effect, but if you have a choice, try 3D as the special effects are nothing less than mind blowing.I loved this one, time seemed to fly by and I didn't want this adventure to end, I'd say that is the true test of a great film.....enjoy!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Enjoyed the film in spite of some controversies,"I have not read the novel, but thoroughly enjoyed the film which far exceeded my expectations. The direction and photography are among the best I have seen, so there is nothing to compare with. However, I wondered whether it was necessary to have the film in 3D, as one felt that the film could have been equally well enjoyed even without that. Irrfan Khan is as usual at his best, as the older Pi. The special effects are also fantastic, with the island of carnivorous trees so believable! And so is the quality of editing and casting. No wonder that the film has received several Oscar nominations. But, the only major point which jars is the controversy back home in India regarding the opening lullaby, over 80% of which is a straight lift through translation into Tamil from a celebrated Malayalam lullaby, Omanathingalkkidavo, composed by Irayimman Thampi exactly 200 years back, in 1813, on the occasion of the birth of Swati Tirunal, declared king even before birth, and who later became one of the four leading composers in Carnatic music of the era. Barring this obvious bit of plagiarism, the rest of the movie was thoroughly enjoyable. I wouldn't mind watching it again, merely for the cinematic skills.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
a good movie,"''I had to tame him,'' (Pi) realizes. ''It was not a question of him or me, but of him and me. We were, literally and figuratively, in the same boat."" From Life of Pi by Yann Martel.You will see no more imaginative film this year than Life of Pi, whose conceit of a young Indian boy stranded with a Bengal Tiger in a lifeboat amid the Pacific Ocean is fantastical yet real in its metaphoric implications. While the framing device of a story told to a stranger uses the old flashback, the lonely lifeboat is as new as any story told in the last century.The film begs interpretation from the multiplicity of religions to the place of mankind in a hostile, Darwinian world. Ultimately the benign brotherhood of beasts and humans is affirmed not so much by lofty philosophy but by the necessity of man and beast working together to survive.The digital rendering of animals, especially the Bengal Tiger, is beautiful to behold. The opening scene in Pi's family zoo could be right out of Terence Malick's visionary camera, a montage of nature gorgeous in its simplicity. The several formalistic shots of the boat at night are worthy of the best lighting in the best aquariums in the world. Together with the impressive use of 3D, director Ang Lee has visually taken us from the opulence of Crouching Tiger and the minimalism of Brokeback Mountain into a fusion world of fancy and reality. The images are stunning.In the end, Lee is interested in the individual's place in the universe as he struggles to harness nature and yet live in harmony with these elements. The conflict with the gross cook aboard the Japanese cargo ship taking Pi's family and animals to Canada is emblematic of the challenges facing the gifted with the groundings. Pi's relationship with tiger ""Richard Parker"" represents all mankind's struggle to live in harmony with the forces it cannot control.""Believing in everything is the same as believing in nothing,"" says Pi's father because Pi samples religions from Hinduism and Buddhism to Catholicism and Judaism and wants them all. Although it is not given to us to have them all, Pi's piety practically makes us believers in the universal brotherhood.The Life of Pi is everyone's life; the film is one of the best of the year and, even remembering the greatness of The Old Man and the Sea, Moby Dick, and Billy Budd, the best you will ever see about a boy, a tiger, and a boat.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Wow .. this is the one,"Just wow.Is a must watch movie , and I think this would be the movie of the year. The best movie I've seen this year .The actor is perfect , PI did a great job on acting what he's suppose to do . I watched it just now in 2D and I think is a 'must watch 3D thing' cause every scene with effect I keep on wonder how beautiful it is if this was in 3D. Ang Lee did a great job on presenting this character to us , and describe every emotions a human would have.I definitely going to watch second time in 3D , Gives me this feeling (dont know how to say) the same feelings when I watch Big Fish .

Pretty But Perplexing,"This was a beautiful movie to watch, from the opening credits all the way throughout the entire film. The CGI...some of the best I've ever seen. I was really impressed. And the acting...top notch. As far as the plot, I was left feeling like a movie that tells ""a story that would make you believe in God"", ended more sacrilegious than anything. So much so, that I was left wondering are they really saying religion is just a coping mechanism??? I guess their objective was for you to continue thinking about the movie long after you've watched it, so mission accomplished. However I'm thinking about it for all the wrong reasons & I can't help but wonder maybe something was lost in translation. I must admit, I did not read the book. But maybe ""the book that couldn't be made into a film"" really couldn't after all. I guess I have to go read it to find out.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
A Train Wreck from Start to Finish,"Live of Pi was so bad that I'm at a loss as to how to review it. Here's a list of a few things that were wrong with this production.The way the story was told (as a flashback over dinner) could not have been more boring.Filling the blackboard at school with digits added absolutely nothing to the story line and seemed like an afterthought.All scenes with animals looked totally fake, including Pi's initial interactions with the tiger.Pi's behavior on the boat deck during the storm made no sense and seemed like an LSD trip.None of Pi's actions on the raft made any sense. It seemed as if he did everything he possibly could to ensure that he would not survive.Nothing about the island made any sense.In summary, it is as if everyone involved with this movie from start to finish was on drugs the entire time. There's really no other plausible explanation as to how something so bad could have ever seen the light of day.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
One of the best movies of 2012 ! Outstanding.,"This is my second review @ IMDb. I usually write reviews to movies which are close to my heart.This is one of the most outstanding movies of 2012 with great effects and great story. This movie has proved that a Hollywood movie can be made with Indian actors and a masterpiece can be made. The way the story was narrated and the way it progressed is really amazing.About the movie: All the characters played their part wonderfully well and they did justice to their roles.Technical aspects: The use of 3D technology has changed the way we see movies today and thanks to People like James Cameron and Ang lee, We are heading for better movies in the future. Movies like Avatar and Life of PI, We are going beyond our imagination.Story, Screenplay, direction are really good and thanks for the author who wrote this book.The background music score was awesome and with an Indian touch. This was bit similar to the one ""127 Hours"" Movie.All in all. One of the best cast away movies. A movie about a Man who finds a reason to live and fight fear in his life with a help of an animal. He has seen it all and He doesn't need to fear anymore.Awesome job Mr. Ang Lee :) Vamsi.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Just like the book,"For those who do not know, Life of Pi is a famous novel written by Yann Martel.As a person who has read the book, I have to say I am incredibly amazed at how accurate the movie was and how every little detail was incorporated in the novel.The 3d animations were extraordinary and it was just as I had imagined when I read the book. It was very realistic and the scenes were calming to the mind.The actors, where do I begin? Amazing just like how I remember them acting like in the book. I never really cry in films, but I did in this one. Very touching, very realistic and very exciting.I don't remember blinking or breathing at times threw the film. It's an exciting adventure that takes you threw the journey in the eyes of Pi Patel.Enjoy it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Visual Extravaganza and Some Great Life Lessons,"After the creative extravaganza of 'The Avtar' and the 'Three Musketeers', here comes another Hollywood movie, that promises a lot on the unlimited possibilities the 3D Technology and the CGI Technology offer the viewers. Having seen, the movie, I must say, the movie has impressed me, almost as much as 'The Avtar' did!Based on the best selling novel by Yan Martel (not just best selling, but Man-Booker Prize Winner too), the initial part of the story is set in India, Pondicherry.To go further, Pi (played by Irrfan Khan) is having a conversation with his french Author-friend and tells him how he survived 227 days on a life boat with only a Bengal Tiger (Richard Parker, the tiger is named) for company. He is also picked up by two Japanese Maritime Officials so as to investigate how the ship sank. The Officials don't believe his outlandish story and dismisses him. But what exactly is Pi' story, and that's what the movie is all about.Son of a Zoo-Keeper, Santosh Patel, Pi of Piscene Patel is born to an affluent family. The boy is, pretty aware of the need to co-exist in a world with animals and also is quite understanding of their needs. Raised as a Hindu, he is also introduced to Islam and Christianity and is a believer of the 'Vasudeva Kudumbakom', in true Indian Psychology! The family, one fine day, decide to relocate to Canada due to political turmoil in their native place and sells some of their animals, and also carrying some with them on their journey in the high seas. Their ship encounters a heavy storm and is wrecked and his family along with the ship and the crew sinks. Pi soon finds himself stranded on a life boat in the high seas with four animals, a Hyena, a Zebra, an Orangutan and a Bengal Tiger.The rest of the Pi's tale is how he survives 227 days on the sea with the Tiger (He names the tiger as Richard Parker). All the while, Pi assigns in each animal, a distinctive personality based upon his observations and the people in his own life. The other animals die as the Hyena kills the Zebra and the Orangutan out of hunger. The Hyena in turn gets killed by Richard Parker. Pi now realizes the need to keep Richard Parker in good humor in order to save himself, and feeds him fish. He eventually develops a bond of friendship with Parker and they both realize and appreciate the need of each other for their own survival.They ultimately reach the coast of Mexico soon, Richard Parker escapes into a jungle without looking back at Pi leaving him in distress and even making him question their friendship itself.Irrfan Khan plays the role of the grown-up Pi, who is being quizzed by the Japanese Officials about the ship wreck and his tale of survival. The officials don't believe his story of survival along with the Bengal Tiger, so Irrfan then substitutes his tale with another one with people in his real life and asks whether the story is more believable now. He is absolutely fantastic with his accent and does a fantastic job. After 'The Namesake', an excellent performance from him.Tabu, plays the role of Pi's mother, Gita Patel, with aplomb and is impressive. Adil Hussain is Santosh Patel, Pi's father.In spite of this luminous star-cast, Suraj Sharma as the teen-aged Pi is the back-bone of the movie and is fantastic. French and Hollywood actor, Gerard Dipardieu appears in a Cameo as the Cook of the Ship and no word is required to describe how this wonderful actor has performed.Underlying Layers in the StoryJust as the boy finds that his class-mates in Pondicherry is quite amused as to how someone could be named 'Pissing Patel', he shortens his name to Pi, the mathematical constant, having 'no end'. The story, too, has lots of inner-layers to it, and each animal represents a different character or a person in Pi's life. The tale of surviving 227 days with a tiger is as much a tale of how to see with-in and to survive in adversities and believing in one-self. It is a wonderful story of growing-up and survival and is a must watch! If you have not read the book already that is.Many have asked me, as to what is so grand, about a boy being castaway with a Bengal Tiger for company, and I would say, this is not just a fantasy story. The life-boat represents our life itself, the calm seas and the storms, its ups and downs. The Tiger is Pi's Self-Destructive Alter Ego, and the movie is all about how one should spend his life, fighting and taming the destructive self. It is a story about courage, and self-belief as much as it is a story of spiritual and philosophical overtures.Directed by Ang Lee, who won Oscars for his 'CrouchingTiger, Hidden Dragon' and has directed 'Sense and Sensibility' and 'Brokeback Mountain', The Life of Pi, overall, is a wonderful movie, and can be enjoyed by everyone alike. The only thing that i was miffed with was because, for some unknown reason, Gerard Depardieu has been given such an insignificant role. He appears in just one scene, and it cannot even be called a Guest Appearance. Such a great actor, and he has nothing to do here!But still, Embark on this adventure and discover yourself along with Pi, on a journey that knows no end! Miss it, and you have missed one of the best movies that has come out in recent times!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Pretty but Pointless,"After his ship is hit by a storm, a young Indian man finds himself adrift on a boat with a tiger. The cinematography is so dazzling that Lee won an Oscar for this, one of the few instances where a director has won without the film winning Best Picture. Unfortunately, Lee is better with the special effects than with the actors, whose performances are uneven at best. While the movie looks great, like pretty postcards, the script, based on a popular novel, is too weak to sustain interest. The story, disjointed and somewhat clumsily structured with flashbacks, is fantastic and nonsensical, and ultimately pointless.

Beautiful!,"The Life of Pi is a wonderful movie adaptation of the book by the author Yann Martel. The movie beautifully shows us that in times of need, the Animal in us will help us survive, but we have to take care to not let it overpower our human nature completely. This is when most people look to God and their beliefs.Just like the irrational number ""Pi"", faith in God is an uncertain field in itself, but believing in it helps people cope with that uncertainty and see the best in everything.In The Life of Pi, ""Pi"" Patel retold his Survival story in a glorious, mystical manner so as to portray a fascinating image of his adventure. His narrative holds beauty and wonder over the cold, ruthless experience he had to undergo. And just like in the case of God, it's our choice to believe in the better story.

Life of Pi: A journey to Inner Self,"As I hail from India and the cast and storyline of this film revolves around an Indian family, our traditions and specifically our national animal it appealed to me in the first place than our own Bollywood flicks as well as other English movies.Its my bad that I haven't heard of the name of the novel but as I saw this film I enjoyed it very much due to its AMAZING 3D in the first place. But when I viewed it 2 more times I tried to understand the deep meaning beneath the uncommon name.We all know Pi is an irrational number but without which rationality cannot be achieved as explained in the euclidean geometry. Similarly faith although inexplicable by science but it can be the greatest tool to make impossible possible; quoting the Psalms: ""Trust unto god and He shall direct your path"". A child's innocence has always have been an object of humor to the adults but its the meaning we try to avoid by laughing away. And so Pi Patel's father tries to reason with his young son saying that he sees his own emotions reflected back from the eyes of the tiger. But this is how GOD watches upon all of us, no? Actually the power to do good, to do a miracle lies in all of us. What we lack is the courage and that's why we pray, expect Him to do our work. But fortune always favors the brave and victory loves preparation. Being shipwrecked Pi haven't forgot his trust, faith, belief, courage and above all hope. and these made him survive 227 days in pacific ocean growing a symbiotic relationship with the majestic Bengal tiger for survival or we may say GOD in form of the tiger. But during that time GOD made him see what we yearn to see our whole life: the heavenly beauty of His creation both known and unknown, explored and unexplored and also made him realize not to stop until the goal is achieved for which he escaped the sleeping lady shaped island. So after being landed in the shores of Mexico Pi sought, goodbye from the tiger but its justified why it didn't turn back. GOD is all the time watching us, treading beside us so why would he say goodbye? It finally comes to us what we believe and what we choose to believe. And I will say Yann Martel and Ang Lee has both succeeded in delivering this ultimate message.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Visually magnificent and Philosophically worthwhile,"Hands down one of the best visual films of, hell all time! I was pleasantly pleased with Skyfall and went to watch Life of Pi with modest expectations. The 3D itself was something inspiring but that wasn't the best part. The capturing of the sea, the perfection of each shot and the acting of both the boy and the tiger, all perfected what was indeed an unfilm-able fairy tale.But the best part was the ending. No not that ending. the very last one. I shall not divulge the secret because that would be a criminal offense. And no it isn't a twist of Himalayan proportions. Just a minute detail out of place and there you have it. Perfection and simplicity. In a deeply complicated theme.In one word, Brilliant.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Beyond belief,"I have to say, I almost never review a movie - mostly because there are already so many reviews out there - but I have to make an exception this time.I saw the movie for the first time 5 days ago, and I recall that when I got out of the theater, I had a mixture of feelings about the plot, the characters, the believability of the whole concept. But, as Irrfan Khan said in an interview for the Screen Team Show, ""It's a film that will start resonating after you watch it"".I saw it four times in one week, going from theater to theater, seeing it with a variety of people, and each time, I discovered countless details that got away the previous times. I grew to admire and love the characters, the actors and the way they everyone managed to embrace their role.I think Suraj Sharma was amazing in the role of Pi, and I am quite disappointed seeing that he didn't manage to get nominated for an Oscar. His acting is flawless and he conveys the energy in a way that it affects your subconscious and you start recalling and rewinding the movie many times after it's over. I believe his acting surpasses that of many appreciated and versed stars and, as he said, part of it is the merit of director Ang Lee, who showed his genius one more time in this incredible motion picture.Finally, the soundtrack is one of the best I've listened to this year and it fits the movie perfectly. Mychael Danna has done a great job again.I recommend you to go to this movie several times, for understanding it deeper. To see it in 3D is amazing for the first time, but after living this experience, a normal viewing will help you pay more attention and see many details you missed before. It is in deed, an amazing movie and no wonder it got 11 Oscar nominations!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Surviving With A Tiger In The Pacific Ocean,"The movie 'Life of Pi' (2012) is written by David Magee and based on the original novel 'Life of Pi' (2001) by Yann Martel. It is produced and directed by Ang Lee and stars Suraj Sharma in the main role as Pi Patel. The picture can be categorized into the genres adventure, drama and fantasy.
Before jumping straight into this review, I am going to give you a quick synopsis for the movie.
At first, Pi Patel and his family live in India and his father is the owner of a zoo. Their biggest highlight is the tiger with the name of 'Richard Parker'. Our main character Pi lives his teenage life as a Hindu, Catholic and Muslim which is contrary to his scientifically minded father who doesn't believe in God thinking that ""religion is darkness"". After some time his father decides that the Patel family will move from India to Canada on a cruise ship. Instead of a comfortable ride on the ship, the passengers and crew members are involved in a thunderstorm. In the following, the ship has to be evacuated however only Pi manages to get on a lifeboat as well as a few animals that he gets on board with, such as a zebra, the orangutan 'Orange Juice', a hyena and the tiger 'Richard Parker'. Unfortunately for the innocent and helpless herbivores on the boat, the impatient carnivores start eating them. As a result, the tiger Richard Parker kills and eats the hyena as well, leaving only Pi behind who is in constant danger of getting himself killed whenever he approaches him or nears himself to the wild animal. Over the course of time, Pi builds a relationship with the tiger trying to survive the sea together while also hoping to be rescued.As 'Life of Pi' (2012) unfolds, the viewer really gets to appreciate the artistic vision of the director. Ang Lee did a fantastic job at making his story believable, grounded and realistic. His great directing is further on emphasized by his incredible visual effects team who did an outstanding and visually astonishing job with the animation of all the animals included plus the animation of the cruise ship and the animation of clouds being reflected on the surface of the water during gorgeous sunsets. In the making of 'Life of Pi', Ang Lee had his crew build an entire set for this movie. He tried to do as many things with practical effects as he could, even bringing a real tiger and hyena on set for 2 weeks in order to make the animals and the scenes look as realistic as possible. The visual effects team used the real tiger to animate the CGI animal. The CGI is some of the best I have ever seen in a movie. Deservedly so, 'Life of Pi' (2012) won the Oscar for 'Best Achievement in Visual Effects' besides the other 3 wins for 'Best Original Score', 'Best Achievement in Cinematography' and 'Best Directing'.
The heart of this movie is first-time actor Suraj Sharma who plays Pi Patel in a very realistic way knowing how to act in completely different situations. He masters his scenes with great acting giving a believable and emotional performance that resonates with the audience. Another strong point of this picture is how the character-driven storytelling can be a real tear-jerker for the viewer.
The screenplay seems to have been translated very nicely onto the big screen. The concept of this story is great and the execution of the idea from the script was also very well handled. 'Life of Pi' dives into really dark and mysterious thematics in its own mythology. However this movie does leave me slightly empty-handed because it should have spent more time on the developing relationship between Pi and the tiger. Instead of a strictly cohesive, unfolding story, we get a smidgen rash plot that definitely explores the relationship but it treats the philosophy between the two characters in a too superficial way.
On the other hand, the story is nicely compelling and fascinating, but the viewer already knows that the protagonist makes it out alive because throughout the entire movie an older Pi Patel tells his life story to an author who is interested in his dangerous, traumatic experience, just like the audience, which makes the ending kind of predictable. Unfortunately this undermines the tension created by the filmmaker. There is also an odd mixture of great dialogue and superficial conversations with deep content that should have been dug deeper into. The editing and the transition between two scenes were very smooth. The director of photography Claudio Miranda did incredibly effective work with his astounding cinematography by using a lot of wide shots in the limelight. These amazingly shot sequences are very frequently supported and underlined by the visual effects team with 1226 members being involved in the process. One of the absolute strengths of this motion picture is the very melancholic, atmospheric and beautiful score by Mychael Danna, Rob Simonsen and Mike Nowak. The music switches from cultural and traditional Hindi music to epic Hollywood blockbuster type of music in appropriate segments of the movie.
'Life of Pi' is mostly well paced which is really pleasant to watch and to experience. This also comes in very handy since it is an adventure movie. However this movie also suffers from slower parts that drag the film down quite a bit and feel even a little bit jarring for the viewer. But this is more of a nitpick instead of a huge problem.Overall, 'Life of Pi' is a very good motion picture with an interesting philosophy on religion that I won't go into further on because that would result in me talking about spoilers which I want to avoid for this movie specifically.It is also refreshing to see that 'Life of Pi' is a movie that resonated with audiences in its theatrical run while being a smash hit at the box office making 609 million dollars on a 120-million-dollar production budget.

Cinematography is so beautiful --- Suraj Sharma as Pi is  Brilliant,"This is an excellent film, beautifully done,beautiful cinematography and the digital scenes were seamless. I want to see it again for those reasons alone. The movie made you feel as though you were part of the story experiencing all the things Pi did and felt. Suraj Sharma, a 17 year old unknown, was the absolute right choice to play Pi he is wonderful. It made me wish for more young actors like him instead of the same cookie cutter no talents that the movie industry seems to feel the public wants.

Very deceptive manner to promote false religions or not...,"The movie is actually a 9.5 out of 10 as far as special effects, but the story plays heavily on religion and is more of a moral teaching that all religions are the same, worthless while at the same time pushes anti- religion. The man who tells the story is a very intelligent person so it is very puzzling why he cannot tell the very marked distinct differences in religions yet finds that he can worship many at the same time, a belief that is beyond belief and believability. The story would have been a perfect 10 had it left out the heavy emphasis on religion because the shipping scenes and survival portions are very believable and beautifully done, almost magical. Overall, the mocking of religion leaves some, as us, with a sense of a thorn in the flesh. While we enjoyed watching it very, very much, it is not a movie we would buy or own. It is just too politically religiously abusive.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Obviously it's a fantasy film but it didn't stretch my imagination or leave me wowed. Was I missing something? or maybe I was looking too hard for some kind of message.

The spiritual journey was so subtle yet so grand. I found myself getting very emotional towards the end, with the dialogue, it was a wonderful story. I watched it with my 10 year old daughter and her 11 year old girlfriend. All three of us were captured from the start. I very nearly turned around and watched it all over again.

Entertaining special effects festival with alleged depth and meaning.,"Told in the style of a story-within-a-story (very Heart of Darkness, the original novel) a middle aged man tells two stories (to a visiting journalist) of how he - as a teenager - survived a shipwreck thanks to a lifeboat. But which does the listener believe? The standard version or a very bizarre version involving circus animals?In the ""bizarre"" a boy (Suraj Sharma) is set adrift on a lifeboat with only a wild tiger for proper company. The tiger being part of a zoo being transported to Canada. The tale of how they get along and/or both survive takes over most of the rest of the film.What an unlikely premise for a film this is! I came to it with an open mind and left it with a bit of an open mind too. Lots of thrills and spills and the usual special effects wham-bams which modern cinema has to offer (I didn't see it in 3D) but I am not sure what this was supposed to be about (other than basic survival) or why it needed to be structured the way it was.The set-up is simply tedious and since the production seemed to want to shout its central novelty from the rooftops it became a bit of a wrist glancer as it worked its way towards this - inevitable - central novelty. Either we get to know the people well (think The Deer Hunter) or don't bother at all. I mean Gérard Depardieu in a cameo role? For what purpose?The central character is mad as a bat anyway. He goes out on deck in a storm with nothing on but a shirt. Do you know how cold it is in the middle of an ocean? He dances about as the cross waves crash over him. Oh what fun it is to have ice cold waves crash over you! Laugh a minute.Given there is little else to see or talk about (and I don't want to start spoilers) how does a wild tiger (who only feeds on land anyway) catch anything from a boat. And how much fresh water does it need a day. Apart from lots? Not very realistic to nature is it?Like War and Peace is something about Russia this is something about religion. I suppose people who escape disaster tend to believe in God more than those who don't. Might just be luck though.The good thing is that I found it generally entertaining. And Shama is solid, although he doesn't have to do much other than be thrown around in front of a green screen. Would be very tedious to watch twice (apart from seeing in its intended 3D on a big screen) and that is the best acid test of a good movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Moving, brilliant. A perfect masterpiece.","This is not just a movie, it is a real masterpiece. It is what a film should be.

"Life of Pi was certainly not a ""great"" movie!","This movie was very disappointing. I was appalled at the fact of animals attacking each other as this is rated PG. It was extremely gruesome and depressing and definitely was not a good movie in my book. Although this was a creative plot line, it certainly was not necessary to include such horrid scenes and tragedies. One thing is for sure, this movie will NEVER be recommended by me. I am not positive this movie should have been labeled as a ""PG"" movie because it contained scenes that certainty were not kid-friendly. I am truly astonished at the fact that this movie had good ratings because it was so beyond horrible, in my opinion. If anyone asks me how Life of Pi was, I'll tell you now, I will not be giving it a positive recommendation, let alone any at all.

Remarkable discipline here, remarkable results. Perhaps the most wonderful aspect of this wonderful movie is the way the 3D, that much maligned technology is used to create effects that bolster the emotional weight of the story. There's no sense of having things thrown into your face, just to create the illusion of 3D. The illusion here is that it all looks very real, especially the presence of the ocean. There's sense of depth as well as of dimension. It should open the way for a lot of creative work in this medium.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Sailing and Surviving With A Bengal Tiger,"Finally 'got to watch Ang Lee's 'Life of Pi' based on Yann Martel's classic novel. This is perhaps one of the few films that pays attention to detail in order to be as true to the book as possible. Of course filmmakers take cinematic liberty and there's nothing wrong with that as long as the final result matches up at least to what the book accomplishes (which isn't the case with most Hollywood adaptations). 'Life of Pi' is perhaps as accurate a film can be to its original.Now we come to Ang Lee and his art team's fantastic imaginative visualization. It's all about the details. While the CGI images look terrific, I also loved how the live images were captured, especially the colours of India. A majority of the film takes place at sea but even there colour plays a significant part. The detailed CGI designing of the animals especially the characters on the boat is impressive.Newcomer Suraj Sharma delivers a sincere performance. Irrfan Khan and Adil Hussian are great. Tabu is terrific in a small role. The child actors are very good too.For those who haven't read the book (read it if you haven't) and those who have, while 'Life of Pi' is a beautiful story of survival, in the end it's more about how imagination and how that alone can keep one alive when all else is lost.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Visually stunning metaphor,"Beautifully made movie about the complex relationship between Good and Evil, Man and God. The only negative is that the movie is so visually stunning that it may lead the viewer to appreciate it only on the physical concrete plane.The real point to the movie is to show us that the tiger is not in the boat trying to kill the boy, rather that there is a metaphorical tiger living in each of us, and it is through the mythology of religions that each of us may discover for ourselves how we deal with our own tiger.In this way, I think that the medium of film cannot match the impact of the written text for a film of such metaphoric import. It is through the imagery created in each individual's mind through the living life experiences of each person reading the passages of the book that give it deeper personal meaning and sense to the metaphor. This movie, as every movie, must impart the visions and experiences of essentially one person, the director. But it is such a beautiful vision after all.Thumbs up!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

"""What Hurts the Most Is Not Being Able to Say Goodbye""","It is a rare opportunity to see a film in which every frame evokes miraculous imagery. So it is with Life of Pi: Director Ang Lee translated the bestselling novel by Yann Martel into one of the most visually arresting cinematic events of this year. Like a fever dream that occasionally transforms into a nightmare, before delivering you back into a state of nirvana, Life of Pi is at its best breathtaking, but also looms with a mysterious energy prepared to pounce when you become comfortable.The story of Piscine ""Pi"" Patel (Suraj Sharma) unfolds through the narration of the elder Pi, who recounts his story for the benefit of a writer, in search of a story that will ""make him believe in God."" It is unlikely that Pi's engrossing story will have any effect on your religious inclinations, but it will certainly entertain. Pi's life is completely upended when a cargo ship carrying Pi and his family, as well as numerous animals from their zoo, is lost at sea. Being the sole human survivor, Pi is forced to contend with a troop of animals that also managed to seek refuge on his lifeboat. As the days pass, the group of four animals is cut down to a single animal: an adult Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. The two survivors are faced with serious challenges on their journey across the ocean, and none is more terrifying than the close proximity they share. What develops is a volatile relationship that ultimately saves Pi's life.The entire weight of Life of Pi is balanced on newcomer Suraj Sharma's back. The true beauty of this film may be its cinematography, but considering how much of this movie focuses on a solitary human in a boat with a tiger, casting a weak actor in the role of Pi would have been as disastrous as flinging acetone on a painting. The range of emotions conveyed by Sharma makes it difficult to believe that he earned this role accidentally (He only attending the casting call to support his brother's audition, and ended up winning the role out of 3,000 actors.), and has no previous acting credits. If Life of Pi is any indication of what Sharma is capable of, we shall be seeing a great deal of this talented young man in the coming years.Life of Pi is substantial achievement in storytelling. The film covers a variety of topics: spirituality, mortality, maturity, death, and survival. The film is incredibly dense, and having little knowledge of the novel beforehand, I was not prepared for how intense a film this would be. The quality of trailers shown before the movie seemed to indicate that many might treat Pi as a children's film; it is most certainly not. While a story of a young man on a boat with a tiger might sound like the beginning of a children's fable, the substance of this film would be difficult for a child to stomach.Ang Lee has proved himself a master of stylized film and Life of Pi is possibly his most visually stunning motion picture to date. Life of Pi illustrates the ability of a story to captivate our imaginations, and attests to the wonderment of storytelling.http://flickermotion.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
A film that re-ignites the wonderment of the universe.,"LIFE OF PI (2012) Dir. ANG LEEFresh from Oscar-winning Ang Lee, veteran of the groundbreaking Brokeback Mountain and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, comes a film that will make the grey of modern life melt away - and reignite that childhood fascination with the universe you thought you had lost forever.Set, like quite a few films of 2012, against the colourful and bursting collage of India (well, at least before the boat bit) this is a road movie unlike any other in both the obvious and more magical senses. Our protagonist (unsurprisingly) is a young Indian man called PI, short for Piscine, the French for swimming pool.During a lavish and wondrous prologue we explore the past of our boat-bound hero - the son of a Zookeeper who has sadly been forced to leave India in search of Western opportunity, PI is about to see the world of magic, colour and fascination he loves vanish from the port window of a grimy Japanese freighter. As PIs origins unfold, we examine the cross-religious makeup of India, and the similarities between religious paths are directly pointed out (as is the silliness in them condemning one-another), interwoven with the unspoken soul of the nation, the culture, and the magic that seems to radiate from the very soil itself. Pi is a curious child, filled with the confidence and love of all things that can only belong to a child, surely?A storm claims the freighter, and Pi loses everything. His family, his future, his very world. The only thing that he seems to retain in this cataclysm is his positivity, very-Indian resourcefulness, and a charm you can't really figure out.Reset to zero, Pi has travelling companions who share his life-raft that happened to survive the crash - an Orang-Utan, a Zebra and a mischievous Hyena. But, as we all know from the trailers - there is a stowaway who quickly makes an appearanceOur Hyena is running amok, and after murdering the rest of their jolly band he turns to Pi. He doesn't get very far before Richard Parker leaps out of the storage compartments and flattens him. Richard Parker?Oh yeah, the Bengal Tiger.What follows is a touching, funny and sometimes crushingly despairing tale of a young Indian man following his soul - and becoming a citizen of the planet Earth. In the frame of endless nature in every direction, from beautiful sunsets that mirror on the untouched oceans, to storms that seem to conquer all, this film is about the erosion of cynicism, and the embracing of the magic we all deny ourselves. Can a human being co-exist with a tiger? Can a human being co-exist with the Earth? If we can - would it be a happy marriage?Ang Lee thinks so, and with the use of truly world-class special effects, including the greatest deployment of 3D I've ever known, we see a tale that has implications for the entire universe unfold. This film is for those who watch ducks, love sunrises or the smell of crisp wintry air. For those who smile at the scene of two magpies, or stop to stroke strange cats. This is a film, presented with cinematography that is more artful than functional, that tries to make you believe that you too, can fall in love with the world you were born in, all over again.Pi's adventure is a testament to what you can see when you take time to look - so take time to go see this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

This would be a great movie if it didn't try to make the point that in the end the author who hears the story from Pi will believe in God when the end makes no reference to this. The faith of Pi is a wonderful thing but the ""theology"" of the movie is shaky and should not be used to make a big point which is not made in the end anyway. Also there is a pointless hospital scene near the end where Pi comes up with another story which is more believable and therefore a little confusing since it was even hinted that it may be the true story.

Clearly not a 'love at first sight'..! simply a brilliant movie!,"Once in a while you see a movie and think ""god its brilliant!"".

Firstly, because its an Ang Lee movie and secondly, because its a movie about survival and facing your fears. But what was waiting for me in the theater, was just another 3D flick with a lot of CGI graphics. At least, that's what I thought! But after watching the last few scenes, began one of the most intense thinking processes of my life! And finally realized how brilliant the story is and how brilliantly Lee has made it into a movie. Life of Pi may not be the best acted movie ever but everything else about it, is inexplicable.Speaking as a south Indian myself, another good thing about the movie is that Lee has managed to minimize the amount of clichés which occur a lot while making a Hollywood movie about Indians.I played the movie, scene by scene in my head again and again, only to realize not everything is what it looks like. I highly recommend this film to everyone. whether you like it or not completely depends on your perception. In the scene where the tired young Pi asks his 'companion' to talk to him and looks deep down into the ocean, the camera goes deep into the ocean from Pi's tired and hopeless face, captures everything he has lost, ends up at his mother's smiling face and comes back up to his 'companion''s strong, confident face. That one scene has a strong inner meaning and another dimension, which you will realize if you really want to!

Or so I imagine. I saw it in 2D. For me it was like watching a collage of art student drawings.The basic story-line is nothing new and very thin. The video and CGI overpowers the light story.

Ang Lee has created a masterpiece in the world of cinema and this film will long be a very-memorable film due to the breathtaking cinematography and beautiful scenery.,"Read my full review (thoughts on the film, what I liked about it, the plot etc.) at: http://miloponsford.blogspot.co.uk/2013/01/kill-list-2011.html...Normally I don't like 3-D films; I hate the cheap, uncomfortable glasses, I hate how you have to look directly at the center of the screen all the time, and they make me feel dizzy. However, the visually-stunning masterpiece that was up on the screen completely took me away and I was completely engaged with the bright colours and amazing imagery. I've heard it's amazing in 2-D, though, and I'm sure it is. There aren't really any exclusive 3-D scenes (such as subjects coming towards the camera), but there is so much more depth in 3-D films, which really brings out how amazing the cinematography was. The composition in every scenic shot was brilliant, and there were some really-amazing scenes and random events that occur with Pi out at sea. The book challenges the idea of reliability, as the imagery could be made-up due to Pi loosing his mind when he's at sea, but we see this vivid imagery ourselves which makes us lean towards the crazier story about the animals on the boat, not the people......I first read the book, Life of Pi, by Yann Martel, in 2009. I also read it in 2011. I've always loved the book as it too has very powerful imagery (especially for a book), and I was hoping that the film wouldn't let down the book like most film-adaptations seem to do these days. I really wasn't expecting Ang Lee to direct it well as his previous films have been nothing like Life of Pi. However, the film was exactly like the book (besides a few little differences), and I was more than satisfied. I'm not sure whether I prefer the original book or the film; they're both brilliant......The story leaves the audience with a question: which of Pi's stories is the truth? I believe the second story to be true. I would like the first story to be true, with it's incredible sequence of random events that haven't been experienced or discovered, but it's unlikely. Why? Because Pi was stranded for a very long time and after seeing nothing but sea and having a bad diet, lack of sleep and suffering from the heat and the pressure he faces, he probably went crazy. We see how exhausted he is when he arrives on the shores of Mexico; he cries and cries until he is in hospital. Also, the island has never been discovered and there is no evidence of any of the animals or events that happened. I also struggle to see how a young man survives that long at sea on a raft with a very hungry Benga tiger, even if he trained it; as Pi's father says earlier on in the story, ""you think tiger is your friend, he is an animal, not a playmate"". The whole movie is about knowledge versus faith; Pi questions and tries different religions and throughout the film these beliefs are questioned with knowledge. What the audience has to decide is whether or not they believe in knowledge of faith, just like Pi did earlier on. I believe in knowledge......In conclusion, Life of Pi is an absolutely brilliant film. Ang Lee has created a masterpiece in the world of cinema and this film will long be a very-memorable film due to the breathtaking cinematography and beautiful scenery. The film is far from a let down to the book, and in my opinion actually excels. 10/10, because it's exactly like the book, not a typical Hollywood adventure and I honestly can't flaw it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Must watch for believers and the non-believers !,I'd say the movie is a must for both the atheists and the God-fearing beings. It gets cleared out in the beginning itself Society today has lost and confused the meaning and the spirit of God. Movie try to make sense of out of His spirit. One of the dialogs in the end changes one's all entire outlook towards Him. Its not a thriller movie but still I'd say its the core of this movie. Movie has some of the best visual special effects I have experienced since Avatar in 3D - especially the beginning and his imaginations in between. I'd suggest watching it in 3D only as 2D might just take away all the fun form it. Acting of Pi is very good. The movie deserves an Oscar from next year's academy. Excellent watch !,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
One of the best movies i've ever seen,"I have not read the book and did not know what to expect from this movie. Therefore the impact of the storyline and the ""surprize"" at the end really caught me bare handed. It made such an impression on me that i actually could not fall asleep that night still trying to understand the subtle meaning of the stories.You need to see it in a 3D cinema. Although the 3d effects are not what makes this movie great, it does add up to the overall impression Hope to see some Oscars on this one, for interpretation, effects, storyline, everythingAng Lee as always in best of shapes!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Bad Aftertaste,"It could have been an enjoyable movie, but it left a terrible taste in my mouth. From the beginning the movie seems to be pandering to some wishy- washy conventional ""respect-all-religions"" message, but it's only a front. By the end it becomes clear that the message of this movie is something even more insidious: that life is cold and cruel and meaningless, and humans just like to make up pretty stories to placate ourselves.The movie would have been fine if they had just told the story without pushing the theme so ham-handedly. The story is touching, the imagery beautiful and masterfully done, it has scenes you'll never forget. But then at the end the movie cuts off it's own legs with its cynical theme.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Visually impressive and nice acting but has some plot problems,"I was very hopeful for this movie, and while I was expecting a lot more out of it I won't say that it was a bad movie. It was good. The visuals were breathtaking and obviously a lot of work went into making the animals realistic. However to go along with the visuals there is some solid acting and an interesting premise. However, the movie's final act is where the film stops floating and begins to sink and this final act makes me mad because the movie could've been a lot better.So the movie starts off with a book author visit our main character (Pi) who is an adult man who wants to tell an interesting story to the author which will make the author believe in God. Then Pi goes on to say that when he grew up he believed in three different religions... this is one of the incredibly stupid moments in the movie. While the idea sounds interesting, it doesn't work because two of the religions (he becomes a Christian and a Muslim) say that worshiping other gods is wrong and he is also a Hindu (who believe in many gods). Now if he said he liked the attributes of each and made up his own belief then that would make sense, but for him to say he is devoted to each is a lie. His father actually says one of the smartest things in the movie: ""I would rather my son believe in something that is false than to believe in everything, because believing in everything is the same as believing in nothing"" and this is true. However for some reason the father is looked down upon even though he said the most intelligent thing in the film.Continuing: Pi also tries to befriend a tiger (his father owns a zoo) named Richard Parker. However, his father wants to prove to Pi that animals are dangerous, so he puts a goat outside of the cage and... MAGICALLY THE TIGER PULLS THE GOAT INTO THE CAGE! I laughed out loud because it is never explained how the tiger managed to pull a goat into the cage.So Pi is on a ship with a bunch of animals which are being sold. Pi goes on deck and notices that the ship is sinking. When he returns he finds a zebra in the hallway he just walked out of a couple of seconds ago. Did the people even think about the zebra got there? All of the doors were closed to the hallway but some how it magically appears in the hallway. Either way Pi gets stuck on a boat with a Zebra and finds an orangutan floating on a raft of bananas. Shockingly enough Pi is stupid enough to NOT GRAB THE RAFT OF BANANAS AND USE THEM FOR FOOD! Soon it is discovered that a hyena is on the boat and was hiding under the boat cover and it kills the other two animals but is then attacked by Richard Parker (who was under the same boat cover).Most of the movie revolves around how Richard Parker and Pi creating a truce. They encounter storms, rain, beautiful ocean views, and a strange floating island. The floating island part of the movie really bothers me because it is a raft of vegetation with a legion of meerkats (if the ship sank it Japan and by the end of the movie he is saved in Mexico then that means this island was in the pacific but meerkats live in Africa). Apparently the floating island has pools of freshwater (WTF) and has fish that live in the freshwater but the freshwater turns to acid at night and the plants digest the fish (Again if it is floating in the ocean then the only fish it will get are saltwater fish and even if freshwater fish got in then they would all be dead in one night but apparently this happens on a regular basis. Pi also finds a tooth in a flower and realizes that the plants must've eaten someone but if it ate a person then THERE WOULDN'T BE TEETH GROWING OUT OF FLOWERS! That's like eating a chicken and having a beak growing out of your arm!EITHER WAY, Pi is saved but no one believes his story so he tells another story that involves real people instead of animals and it is much more realistic. However, nobody like his realistic story so everyone goes back to believing the original (non-sense) story. So the question is: how does this make you believe in God? Was it the miracles? Was it the way he was saved multiple times? Nope, it makes you believe in God because he says religion is the same as his two stories, EVERYONE BELIEVES THE FIRST STORY BECAUSE IT IS MORE FUN! His argument for why you should believe in God is because it is more fun.The movie's ultimate problem is that it is wrong in so many ways. Believing in everything IS believing in nothing but the movie says otherwise. The final reason for why you should believe in God contradicts the entire movie as well. Furthermore, I'm surprised that this movie spent SOOOO much time on animating animals realistically yet it missed some very obvious things. Bananas don't float (so orangutan would've been dead), the tiger can't get to Pi because his claws keep on digging into the boat cover so he gets stuck, maybe the book/movie forgot that tigers have retractable claws? Pi would've been dead. When the zebra, hyena, and orangutan die there are flies on their bodies yet they are in the middle of the ocean, there are no flies. How come in the movie there are no dead bodies of the animals literally from one scene to the next. It is just plain stupid how much this movie misses.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Why not choose the better story?,"According to Yann Martel, author of the Booker Prize-winning novel ""Life of Pi, ""If your fear becomes a wordless darkness that you avoid, perhaps even manage to forget, you open yourself to further attacks of fear because you never truly fought the opponent who defeated you."" In the film version of Life of Pi, the fearful opponent is a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker (explained in the film) and its worthy adversary is a teenage boy (Suraj Sharma) trapped in a lifeboat in the middle of an unforgiving ocean. For Pi, fear is the ingredient that is both his enemy and the friend that keeps him alive and helps him to maintain his faith.Directed by Ang Lee and adapted for the screen by David Magee, the film is an adventure story in the mold of Robinson Crusoe, a testament of faith, and a philosophical Rubik's Cube that will keep you awake pondering its meaning. Whatever meaning you ultimately bring to it, the film is a sumptuous visual experience that combines a dazzling combination of state-of- the-art 3-D and CGI technology to breathtaking effect. The adventure is framed by the adult Pi Patel (Irrfan Khan) relating his incredible story to a Canadian journalist (Rafe Spall), sent by a friend to listen to a story that ""would make him believe in God."" As a young boy Piscine Molitor Patel (Ayush Tandon), the son of a zoo keeper in Pondicherry, India, shortens his name to Pi to avoid being teased at school. Pi is a spiritual seeker who attracted to Islam, Hinduism, and Christianity and has even studied the Jewish Kabala. Pi's embracing of all non-conflicting religions is rejected by his parents whose philosophy is secular, and his father Santosh (Adil Hussain) challenges his son to make hard choices in life. ""Believing in everything,"" he says, ""is the same as believing in nothing,"" Santosh is a hard taskmaster who graphically demonstrates, after Pi attempt to feed the Bengal tiger in their zoo, that wild animals are not your friend and will kill you without a moment's hesitation.Unfortunately, hard times fall on the family and Santosh must sell the zoo and take the family and some of the animals to Winnipeg, Canada aboard a Japanese cargo ship. When an unforeseen storm batters the vessel, all members of Pi's family and the ship's crew are lost at sea. Pi is the only survivor and clings to a lifeboat accompanied by a hyena, an orangutan, and the huge cat, Richard Parker, who climb aboard. The young Pi witnesses the survival of the fittest and soon finds himself alone in the middle of the ocean with a ferocious tiger. The terror of the shipwreck is made real in a visceral 3-D experience of the raging water, thundering in surround sound.The central portion of the film depicts the day-to-day effort of the boy to tame the tiger and provide enough food for both to survive their over 200-day ordeal. The magic of technology produces beauty as well as terror in scenes of the ocean at night with the boat wandering alone beneath the stars, a cadre of flying fish, luminescent jellyfish, and a leaping whale. Whether or not you believe that the boy is really in danger aboard a boat with a man-eating tiger does not detract from the sublime feeling of connection with nature that the scenes engender. To add a surreal aspect to the adventure, the two companions find themselves on a strange floating island overrun by a colony of African mongoose known as meerkats that allows Pi to gather more food for his return to the sea.While the film's coda puts a slight damper on what we have just seen, the questions it raises are central to the film's message. Contrary to the opening invitation to the writer to research Pi's story because it would ""make him believe in God,"" Martel says that, ""God is not IN the story, but that God IS the story,"" and challenges the viewer to choose which story to believe, the one we have experienced for almost two hours or the alternative story that Pi tells Japanese insurance investigators. According to the author, ""Stories are important, because everything is in how we perceive it and nothing is really real until we say it is, so why not choose the better story?""In my view, what Martel is saying is not that we should choose the better story because it provides a palliative by keeping pesky reality away, but because it offers the context for a richer experience of life. Did the Hanukkah candles really burn for eight days without oil? Did the Buddha really live? Did Christ? We can never know for certain, but ultimately it may not matter if the impact of the stories can lead us to a true spiritual experience, one that is touched by love whether or not we believe it or have a Bengal tiger along for the ride.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Not Well Grounded,Visually stimulating but hardly Spiritually uplifting this Film tries so hard to be Philosophically relevant that it drowns in its own excessive pretensions. Especially after the Revelation. What is meant to be an Epiphany is more like an Exorcism.It pulls so hard at the Soul that it is a painful extraction of belief and Faith. A watering down of deep convictions and hopeful beliefs. The message here is not well grounded and is left floating about meandering every which way and is so heavy handed that it can be a detriment to its own determined thesis.Undeniably stunning at times it is the disjointed editing and the completely cop out ending coupled with the thick Theology that keeps this from being completely successful in the way of The Way.There is simply so much shallowness to the Script that it is barely saved by the expanse and the exciting vistas. Probably better enjoyed if you let go and take the voyage with as little intellect as possible and nary a search for Enlightenment.,6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Great visuals, pieced together story","The setup and foundation for this story were interesting and unique but there are some fundamental flaws which give the story a fragmented feel. The writer tried way too hard to establish motivation for the main character. When a character's motivation is too obvious, the story loses meaning. I am not sure if the writer intended to push a religious agenda onto the reader or he/she didn't know how to keep the story moving without a spoken ""meaning"" behind everything Pi experienced. Sometimes it's enough to just tell a great story. The visuals were impressive enough to keep my attention throughout the film but overall, I would rate it as a mediocre experience which is quite a shame since there was so much potential.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Rushed storyline and downright cheesy editing cancel out breathtaking visuals.,"I'm not gonna lie, Life of Pi is absolute eye candy. The visuals are striking and impressive, especially considering more than half of the movie takes place in the middle of the ocean. However, maybe Life of Pi was best left as a novel; the translation from paper to the big screen just doesn't stack up. The undeniable brilliance of Martel's novel is muted by rushed filmmakers trying to squeeze 227 days out at sea into a 2-hour time limit. In addition, some of the transitions between scenes were corny in all the wrong ways. Long story short, the people making this film really love to fade characters on and off the screen. So, despite seamless computer graphics and gorgeous cinematography, it's not a satisfying product overall.I really wanted to like this movie, and I was excited to see just how the contents of the book could be projected into a film. But after reading the novel, it falls flat. If you want to enjoy this movie, don't read the novel, or better yet, skip it all together and get ahold of the book instead. The bottom line is: it's not awful, but it fails to do Yann Martel's work justice.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Amazing cinematic visuals !!,"First of all this movie is an amazing visual treat. Got the pleasure of watching in 3D IMAX ! and boy did I love it !

The movie grips you right till the end and at one point or the other everyone can relate himself with the lead character Pi. That according to me is the ultimate achievement of Ang Lee.

An atheist perspective!!,"Pi Patel is the son of a zoo owner in Pondicherry,India and when the business fails they decide to move to Canada and sell the animals off.The family sets off on a Japanese ship with all the animals on board, much like Noah's ark,only this time the biblical floods have been replaced by Indira Gandhi's emergency.But that does not make it a political film! There is a perfect storm at sea and Pi somehow finds himself adrift in a lifeboat with a zebra, an orangutan, a hyena and a huge Bengal tiger named Richard Parker.The smaller animals fall victim to the food chain and Pi is left alone with the tiger.We are now faced with a simple question, are there two animals on the boat or one human and one animal? This is one of the pillars of our belief system.If we believe the we humans are in a league of our own and above all other animals we fall roughly into the camp of those who also believe in intelligent design and therefore puts us immediately at loggerheads with environmental issues.To accept Darwinian evolution and mix it with spirituality is one of the key challenges and part of the bigger question of reconciling science and religion in a post industrialized world.Children are born atheists and amoral.They acquire morality and faith or a combination of both as the result of a variety of factors driven primarily by parents.My 5 year old daughter is drawn to the creamy layer of Hindu Gods( out of the teeming masses of no less than 33 million) when she listens to stories of the Ramayana and Mahabharata. At school they pray to a secular God everyday.Yet she lives happily in an atheist household.What her beliefs will be I do not know, I merely intent to give her the gift of choice, while gently reinforcing my rationalist standpoint which I regard as my moral duty, just as my parents felt it was theirs to imbibe in me the fear of God.The key question of why Pi was drawn to religion remains open. He ends up a professor of theology.The 200+ day ordeal can change anybody profoundly.The trapped Chilean miners contemplated resorting to cannibalism to survive.Danny Boyles 27 Hours is another true example of the triumph of the human spirit when the protagonist amputates his own arm to survive. So the fictional story of a boy who survived impossible odds should not make us religious. The film is shot magnificently, its a superlative act of visualization to bring this story to the screen and Ang Lee certainly has that gift. Intriguingly, the way he handles the Indian angle of the film and the prelude to the fateful voyage reminds me of Mira Nair's work in The Namesake which was a lesser film but filled with some of the same elements, a boy who grows up with an improbable and embarrassing name, the presence of Irrfan Khan and Tabu and the challenges of an immigrant family in the alien landscape of America as a nuanced adventure, thematically similar to Pi stranded with a tiger in the vast oceans.There is a scene at the end of the film where Pi parts ways with his feline companion.Richard Parker does not look back at Pi to bid him farewell and walks away unemotionally while Pi sobs with heartbreak.The tiger and its fear kept Pi alive, which is an interesting counterintuitive logic where fear keeps us alive.Perhaps an emotional void is mans biggest enemy. As he recounts the story many years later his eyes well up with tears again.We are supposed to feel that humans have a monopoly over emotions and this sets us apart from the rest of the animal kingdom, which is factually incorrect. Richard Parker deserves to be cut some slack as he has just survived an equal or probably even greater ordeal at sea!Mention must be made of Suraj Sharma who went to the audition to accompany his brother but landed the role out of 3000 aspirants.He does an outstanding job as a gangly youth who fights his circumstances with remarkable ingenuity and pluck.But the star of this visual feast must surely be the CGI tiger who looks us in the eye and brings to mind William Blakes classic poem The Tyger( a wonderful way to spell,sadly rectified in our school anthology) from his collection Songs of Experience, which was a sister poem of The Lamb.Pi is the Lamb here.When the Royal Bengal Tiger walks into the pages of history he will not look back with emotion at us humans who proved to be his worst enemies.We will be left wiping away our tears at having lost the most beautiful creature ever to our greed, indifference and arrogance. William Blake's poem brought to life by Ang Lee in the Life of Pi will hopefully survive for our children to fire their imagination.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

"Runs longer than it needs to and the spectacle hurts the substance, even if it looks good while doing it","Life of Pi was one of those books that interested me and was constantly on my mind to read but, being quite a lazy man, I never actually got around to it. The story is one told to an American writer by a man called Pi Patel and it involves a ship wreck where the only survivors are himself and some animals which were also being transported on the ship – the most notable of which is a tiger called Richard Parker. Pi relates his struggle to survive, the things that happened to him and ultimately seeks to make the writer believe in god.Although there is an establishing period early in the film where we discuss god and then also see young Pi and his various religions, the majority of the film occurs once at sea and for most people this is the film they came to see. The posters, the awards and so on all point to this film as a spectacle and to be fair it is. Throughout all the animal sequences it is pretty much never unconvincing; the animals look real and look like they are right there in the same scene. Where bigger sequences occur they are also impressive and technically the whole film looks great. I saw it on 2D on only a television rather than the cinema, but it still worked apart from bits of personal preference – I never like those 1950's style scenes of 'poking audience with stick' – they seem in service of technology than story. Anyway, technically the film works.The problem is that it works too well. It becomes so much about spectacle that we forget all the work in the early part of the film – all that talk about god and ultimately Pi's statement that he will make the writer believe in god. This comes back at the end in a way that is actually quite satisfying because although not as smart as it thinks it is, it does make you think even if it is pretty bleak. The thing is though that this seems stuck on to a special-effects movie, not that a movie about religion had effects in it; so the irony is that the substance of the film really doesn't work as well as it could have done. The need to make the spectacle also means that the film runs much longer than it needed to do if you really were focused on telling the story.It is still a well made project though and the work of all involved is really up there. From the cast, Sharma is great in his first film – convincing in the emotional and physical sides. He is well represented by the older version of his character by Khan (although I did keep hearing his In Treatment character in his slow tone). There are other good performances in here but generally the film is all about Sharma and it is impressive that he isn't lost in the special effects or scale of the scenes. Life of Pi is a film that works best as something that it is not – a big, technically impressive, spectacle. The downside of doing that so well is that it is runs longer than the narrative actually needs and makes it feel like the substance is the thing that is a bit out of place in the film.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"all the strengths, and even some of the weaknesses you'd expect from an innovative film..","""Life of Pi"" is one of the better films from 2012.I had heard it was a landmark film in terms of moving into the ""digital-age"", and the visuals definitely set this film apart, but I have to admit that the movie had a better storyline and under-lying meaning than I was expecting.The visuals were only one facet of this fine film, and on occasion, the films only weakness. The digital make-up of this visual wonder allowed the actors, animals, and the vast ocean to share the same space - while never sharing the same space. The films use of generated 'space' is unrivaled. It's a backwards movie in terms of production. The plus-side is no formatting issues. The film blends many computer-generated visuals along with the digitally captured live-action.It's a landmark in film-making much like Tron, Last Starfighter, Blade Runner, A Scanner Darkly, and Roger Rabbit, in that it uses a new technique that opens up all sorts of doors for the future. BUT, if you look back at the films I just mentioned they all have weaknesses(well maybe not so much Blade Runner). Like a new model car - they might have few recalls down the road.Ang Lee did a good job here meshing all this together, but he also took some liberties with all this technology - occasionally taking it a bit too far. That's about my only gripe. After all, most of the film is told in flashback style which gives you the ability to embellish without necessarily being untruthful, but there are a couple of moments that might have been better-off if they were toned-down just a bit.The acting is superb.Some of the scenes involving the animals are hard to watch, but I think the film actually took great care of that aspect of the film.I can highly recommend this as something that is much more than a man on a boat.You MIGHT like this if you liked: Tree of Life(not as good and slower), Slumdog Millionaire(better and stars one of the same actors), Titanic(about equal in every way, but Life of Pi is only 2hrs not 3).79/100 Should have no problem holding a top-ten spot for 2012.

A delicious Indian Pi,"A boy and a tiger in a stranded boat. Hmm...Now how interesting can that be.Everything . Every damn thing. For the naive, the title is just too timid to fool you to think of another story of a stranded guy (if anyone told you that already), as sooner you realize the scenes and the walls around you take a life of spellbinding artistic imagery and spectacular scenery of an Indian boys amazing adventure of self realization.As colorful as the nation he comes from, Pi's life is injected with the faiths of all the major religions. Set in sun soaked Pondicherry vividly portrayed basking in colonial inspired lifestyle and architecture, Pi realizes early in life from his mother the playful antics of the Lord Krishna and tribulations, from a Priest, of the Son of God; to praying to Allah, all at once, to the disdain of his rational zoo owner Father.Armed with the self knowledge that there is a soul in every living being, Pi is put to a horrendous test of faith when he loses all that holds dear to him and tragedy strikes on his exodus family, as he leaves behind an innocent love story on Indian shores. In midst of the ship wrecking storm (superbly done in 3D), a cue is put forth to the audience when Pi shouts out ""who let the animals out"" which has surprising revelations at the end.And thence the stage is set for the ordeal, fear, bitter struggle of life and death between a tiger and a 17 year old boy.It dawns up on Pi that it's in God's creation the tigers and its like are carnivorous, with no fault of their own. To avoid being the next bait to a hungry Bengal Tiger, Pi takes the life of a fish to feed it. His agony of snuffing out another life (being a pure Hindu vegetarian himself) is taken by Pi as one of God's many tests. Magnificently portrayed in luminescent and glowing waters of the Pacific, Ang Lee shows one bigger species usurped by a far bigger one in a never ending cycle of life and death that we are all enslaved to. Animals are not categorized as animals but given a distinct name, and we, well, just happened to be higher in the food chain due to power of reasoning. Pi, the Indian boy with a French name and Richard Parker a Bengal tiger christened after his English capturer, are no different - reflections of oneself in the other, as Pi puts it. But the ending comes as a whimper, like a balloon inflated to the hilt just squeaks away with dead flat climax that I thought initially was a rude joke until everyone around me went dead serious. :SThere is no need for a note on Irfan Khans acting. He is so much at ease with his Hollywood stars and Tabu played the perfect mother. What was indeed as spectacular to watch was this boy who did a great job for a newbie.Its been ages since India has been told with so much positive vibes.It could be karma or his Asian lineage that this movie had to go through the rejections of 3 directors before Ang Lee tamed it. The canvas was Ang Lee's for the taking. Brush strokes of far reaching clouds and still blue soaked ocean coming to life with flying fishes; it wouldn't be surprising if he just walks away with the golden statuette in the coming months.All said and done, this is an experience not to be missed in 3D (which I'm usually not a big fan of) bringing to life fascinating islands you wont find in an Attenborough video and the species of the abyss James Cameroon can only dream to see, that makes it a humbling experience - Life of Pi portrays the antics of God's beings and His never ending mavericks of the cosmos.At the end we, just by accident, will end up believing an incredulously told story.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

The story with god in the machine,"Films usually work upon the same mechanisms, it is what religion in old times simply used to warn against. In more typical dramas, the sin is acted out as some part of life, the more recognizable the better. This was fine for centuries, but the invention of the camera opened it up in great ways. More ambitious films visualize the experience or feeling as it arises, more or less vividly render the hell of it (think Lynch), usually with some the ambiguity and mystery it happens in real life.This is midway between the two ways.Framed with religion and the search for answers, the story here is of a young boy on a spiritual journey with his animal self. The boy has previously adopted religion, several in fact, and this deeper perspective he cultivates is the film we see. On a simple level, it is a story of survival, but so extraordinary that you know there's more to it, hidden depths. Visualized around him, we have a series of meditations inspired by the elements—in tempestuous seas, in the whale magnificent to behold but wrecks everything, in the magical, by day, inter- connected nature of the island but turns deadly by night.Visually, the experience has been more evocatively done in Tropical Malady, which is on the same journey to inner self (once more a tiger) and clarity. Greenaway has more puzzling symmetries. But it's a nice film to have, perhaps too clean and cutesy, but clean for a reason.Here's the caveat. The idea so simplified in the end, is that we can't know one way or the other, but here we are, loved ones perish, we continue to be tossed in an ocean of suffering, and that god is perhaps the more attractive story to grim reality, it provides purpose and color, soothes the soul on her journey. This explains the Disney cleanliness, as his mind not dwelling on death.The sentiment makes sense of course, but suddenly reduces.Going back, you will see this reductive logic in places, reductive because it IS logic. The most telling spot for me is the following, it is the one that should be the most emotionally powerful moment in the film, the most purely visual because it is directly of the boy's soul. Among the visual meditations, there is the one of him being submerged in the sea to the quantum level of soul where images bubble up and form everything else, he goes past the animals, past the symbols, and settles on the face of his loved one, all of it illusory.It is of course the feeling that has arisen in him, but see how it is rendered. Schematic isn't it?Not unlike its notion of god, which reduces in retrospect by too simple sense. So keep this film to heart, it has its heart in the right place, but imagine how you would do the swim. Zen starry waters without the Disney luminescence maybe? I have similar issues with Koyannisqatsi's constructed nature.The magic in it being what it is, not constructed, revelatory as it is.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
beautiful movie,"Human movie to draw a figure of a boy has become that the cargo ship carrying the family who runs a zoo sank by storm , to drift left behind along with the tiger in the lifeboat . I saw this movie without expecting too much, but it was really great. I worried about how to be or going to expand the story in so few characters because in the notice, only pie and tiger appear on it.However, it was interesting because tale of drifting was so substantial. Although this is supposed story of tragic and very cruel, it is portrayed as a beautiful and delicate story in a manner that does not show so dare.

There is a tension as if there are wild animals , so I felt both the beauty and natural threats.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Remarkable, Incredible, and years from now  -  Memorable.","The last time director Ang Lee made a tiger crouch, he walked away with about a dozen Oscar nominations, all from just one film. This time Lee goes all the way by unleashing the dragon – this is not just a beast of a movie, it is nothing short of a cinematic miracle in everything that it sets out to be.Possibly the best adapted screenplay this year, LIFE OF PI remains true to its award winning source material by Yann Martel; at least for the most part. Just like the novel, the story plays out in three parts, starting with the introduction of Pi and how he was named after a swimming pool in France. Narrated by Irfan Khan as the older Pi, the story is set in 1970s Pondicherry, a former French colonial city in India. Born and raised a Hindu, Piscine Molitor Patel, the teenage protagonist and titular character dwells into the beliefs of Hinduism, Christianity and Islam, without claiming any one religion as superior. Pi's father, a business minded zoo owner has other priorities like migrating to Canada, along with some of the exotic zoo animals for sale once they reach their destination. In a cruel twist of fate, the journey is short-lived soon after they sail into the Pacific Ocean on a cargo ship. Although tragic in nature, the sinking of the freighter, along with Pi's parents and elder brother, is emotionally overwhelming yet visually spellbinding as the first of many sequences Lee and cinematographer Claudio Miranda has in store for the audience. What follows is a fierce and fascinating tale of survival when Pi finds himself in a lifeboat with an injured zebra, a merciless hyena, an orangutan and a fearsome but majestic Bengal tiger called Richard Parker.Right from the opening credits, Lee and Miranda mesmerises us with one of the most incredible set pieces ever built for cinema. Forget what TV spots and teasers are calling this movie. Judging from what critics have to say, LIFE OF Pi is indeed an epic visualisation but not necessarily justifiable in its comparison to AVATAR. Apart from the novel use of 3D in both films, I personally can't think of any other similarity. Lee's use of 3D is not just immersive for the sake of being so; it becomes the skeletal binding to the pulsating flesh and blood of the story in such a way that I actually forgot about the 3D spectacles resting on the bridge of my nose!Thanks to David Magee's adaptation, Lee has made possible what acclaimed filmmakers have previously side-lined as impossible to film. From virtual humming birds hovering at arm's reach, to the scene when we first meet Richard Parker, to embellishing the sheer beauty of creation, Lee has broken new ground in the way cinema interprets literature. No doubt there. However, Lee's nuance as a storyteller is in bringing out the book's underlying significance of subtly suggesting the existence of God, through a relentless test of faith. This is done by two actors: Suraj Sharma as the ship-wrecked younger Pi who exalts God even in the most trying situations. The other actor is of course Irfan Khan, whose retrospect narration to a writer proves the very existence of God. For a débutant, Sharma has a large chunk of screen-time and holds the story singlehandedly with some amusing interjections. On the other hand, khan has fewer scenes but skilfully advocates the phrase that less can prove to be more.From where I'm seated, LIFE OF Pi has a sure fire lock-on for a few Oscar nominations. But the real reason this is a must-see film, preferably in 3D (I can't stress this enough), is because there is every bit of passion in its making from surreal cinematography, a soul stirring original score, to spectacular visual effects, and a phenomenal narration that only ends when you hear an inner voice that says 'Believe'.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"A beautiful film, and a visual tour-de-force","A young writer travels to Canada to meet Pi (Irrfan Khan), an Indian man with an incredible story to tell. It is the story of his younger self (Suraj Sharma), who gets stranded in the Pacific Ocean with only a fearsome Bengal tiger to keep him company. The two castaways form a strange bond as they try to stay alive and get help.That's the story of Life Of Pi, the novel written by Yann Martel back in 2001. For nearly ten years the international bestseller was deemed unfilmable, despite numerous attempts. It was only when Ang Lee took control that the movie became a reality, and it has finally hit the big screen.The result of Ang Lee's attempts is an epic piece of cinema. The film is absolutely brilliant, with just the right amount of humour, emotion and action to satisfy everyone. I've not read the book yet (I will, for sure), but I get the feeling that justice was done here in regards to the adaptation. Characters are properly fleshed out, major and minor, and relationships are developed well enough to matter as the film goes on. If anything could have been explored better, it would be the relationship between Pi and his mother (Tabu). The influence she has on his life seems understated, and not in a good way.Life Of Pi is very much a work of fiction; at no point are we led to believe that it is based on reality, and this works massively in the filmmakers' favour. Unlike Zemeckis' Castaway, which is rooted in the reality of it all, Lee opts to focus more on the fantastical and beautiful. There is no real sense of time, and we aren't always told how certain things happen. They just do, and the story moves along.There are two things that stand out about this movie, and one thing that lets it down sorely. The good first. Suraj Sharma, as Pi, is excellent. Considering he has no acting experience, he is a revelation. And secondly, the movie is visually stunning. Absolutely beautiful from first frame to last. It's a visceral treat.Now the bad. I watched the film in 3D, and thought many times: why is this in 3D? I counted literally two moments where the 3D worked well. Other than that, it was useless. If the money spent on 3D was spent on shooting it in IMAX, Life Of Pi could have been even better. Instead, it was a bit darker than it needed to be, and everyone sits in a cinema looking like Stevie Wonder for no reason.The good heavily outweighs the bad, though, and I highly recommend the movie. Like with Avatar, the movie should be seen for the visuals alone. Unlike Avatar though, this is actually a good film. You'll fall in love with the characters, you'll be engrossed with them, and you'll feel a genuine sense of rejoice as everything unravels. I can't tell you if the movie is better or worse than the book. I can tell you that that doesn't matter here: the movie is excellent all on it's own.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Playful and showy, but too much ""wreathed"" worldwide","Although the movie has a nice balanced approach of visual and spiritual, the plot is still hectic and with too long scenes and repetitions - its duration of about 2 hours could have been avoided. Directing and camera work are, of course, excellent, and powerful nature (the sea, above all) and animals are catchy to follow, but this shipwreck story becomes a bit annoying soon (thanks to the tiger, not totally boring though). Moreover, the flashbacks and recollections could easily be shorter. And the ending, well... Just the joy of storytelling.As for actors, they are not so memorable, typical Bollywood, and Gerard Depardieu has too small part. Speaking of India-related movies, I would definitely prefer Slumdog Millionaire or The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Generally tedious despite visual splendour and an interesting premise.,"Showered with praise upon its initial release mainly for its supposedly ground-breaking visual effects, this ambiguously fantastical survival story falls fairly flat thanks to the fact that, for much of its run-time, it's actually pretty boring and all the spectacular special effects in the world aren't enough to save a piece from sinking if it has the weight of tedium tied around its ankle. Even then, the effects in 'Life Of Pi (2012)' aren't all that impressive and haven't held up nearly as well as many pictures of a similar age (not that old at all I'll add) or even older, as well as including a few odd design decisions, such as evolving aspect ratios, that seem sort of justifiable but ultimately distracting. Its somewhat confusing commentary on spiritualism and the nature of truth is actually a nice conceit, but isn't fully formed enough to warrant its rampant lack of conclusiveness or make up for its inherent failings to tell a griping tale. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

"It didn't make me believe in god, but made me want to read the book!","Life of Pi is one of those films that almost immediately draws you in to the world it has created. I watched the film with a permanent smile on my face and surely that is all you can ask of any film!OK, so we all know the film is about a young man who is cast adrift with a tiger in the Pacific ocean in a small life boat. But, inevitably the story is so much more than that. Told largely in flashback, questions of faith and the human spirit are asked and sometimes answered. Almost uniquely in the day of the big Hollywood blockbusters, the film allows its audience to draw their own conclusions and not to be preached at. I'm sure the film says different things to different people, showing that what you bring in to a film will determine what you take out of it.The cast are excellent, especially the various actors who play our hero Pi Patel through various stages of his life. The different actors are all engaging and make his character believable and likable.The visuals are stunning and some of the 3D adds to the story and doesn't totally detract from it. I'm not a fan of 3D and this is the highest compliment I can pay to any 3D film. But, I think the visuals would be stunning in 2D. To be honest, I wish 3D would go away as it doesn't add very much and is a novelty at best. But, to be fair to director Ang Lee, he used it pretty well.I haven't read the book on which this film is based, so I can't say how true to the book the film is. But, the highest compliment I can pay to the film is it made me want to read the book.All in all a great film that I can highly recommend.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Pi oi pi,I am watching this movie right now. I am on 1:19 min. Movie was good. The survival movie. My kulfi or barf in ni freeze wow waiting.,,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Life of Pi is an adaption of the novel by the same name.,"The movie tells the story of a 16-year old boy named Piscine Molitor ""Pi"" Patel, who survives a shipwreck in which his family dies, and is stranded in the Pacific Ocean on a lifeboat with a wounded zebra, an orangutan, a spotted hyena, and a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. The story in itself is very straightforward, but was still captivating enough to keep me interested to actually finish the movie. Personally, I didn't find the movie in itself that interesting and could have been told through a short film. The story is very tame, but certainly had the potential to actually be interesting. With that said the cinematography and soundtrack is what carries this entire movie. Every single scene in this movie is visually breath taking and makes me think of James Cameron's Avatar. Just like Avatar it demonstrates what happens when you have an unoriginal manuscript but an overambitious director, skilled cinematographer, and truck loads of CGI. If the movie had had more substance to it and wasn't just a display of modern technology it might have actually won the Academy Award for best motion picture.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
A work of art.,"This movie was without a doubt a work of art. Weather it was the cinematography the special effects even the storytelling was all exceptional. This will be a Oscar nominated movie very worthy of a win or so. Watching this movie I felt transported into the movie like I haven't been before. With the religious and spiritual themes are simple and deep and reveals more questions about what your faith and belief than to answer them. Sense there was no preaching about religion or spirituality made it also more entertaining. The way the story unfolded it explored how our storied can get us through the worst of experiences and to deal with the aftermath. This was more of a survival story and how faith in god, a higher being, or just in yourself. The way Ang lee did the movie with the narration from old and young pi to music all the whole time so there aren't any slow dead scenes, and the result was a faster more entertaining film. With there being basically one character for most of the movie it was important that the character appeals to the audience feelings, but also having the right actor. Suraj Sharma was excellent as the adult Pi. His ability to make each emotional scene as equal to the others shows the talent he has. Even the tiger on the boat with him almost having human features but still keeping him the wild beast he is. Although the tiger is computer generated it is quite hard to tell a lot of the time with the way it acts during the movie. He was as important a character as Pi was. Most movies that seem to have a lot of computer graphics even 3D sometimes don't add to the movie even a way to hide a weak plot. This movie it was almost necessary especially with the heavy handed religious tones. What Lee invents with the integration of the ocean and the other animals is nothing but spectacular. He ability to marry the imagery and the experience was on par with movies like avatar and Hugo. Lee's preparation for the film and his passion for the subject matter further shows in this magical masterpiece that is a must see movie of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Unbelievable!!!,"My rating on this film might be confusing because I say it was unbelievable, but I'll explain it later in this review.The visual effects were so incredible that I can't even find any words for it! It was so well executed, and the sound effects together with the visual effects were once again just unbelievable!So, what made me vote 7/10? It's because I think it was way too long (2 hours), it was so much details that I thought wasn't necessary. Overall the acting bits was just perfect, I really enjoyed that! And now that I've seen the movie I was not surprised they won so many Oscars!I highly recommend anyone, from young children to old people to watch this movie. Actually I dare you to do so!

Interesting ideas but otherwise middle-of-the-road. Best scenes are the ones on the raft with Richard Parker.,"Life of Pi is one of those books that I distinctly remember looking at the book cover on the floor and thinking ""I'll wait for the film."" So, 10 years later, here I am, and now I'm actually quite interested in the book. Ang Lee is one of those directors who I always seem to have a strong yet divided opinion about. He's made some of my favourite films and some I've loathed so I'm really surprised that Life of Pi is so middle of the road for me. While it does have some great ideas that are very thought-provoking, particularly in how the protagonist has many religions, Lee's execution isn't as strong as it could have been. Its main weaknesses are the introduction and ending, particularly with the use of a very weak and tired framing device of the older version of the character telling a journalist or writer their story. However, it must be noted that I am big fan of Irrfan Khan's subtle and emotional performance as older Pi, which was a great surprise as I disliked him in Slumdog Millionaire for his wooden deliveries, ironically as a character in a similar style framing device.It's one of those films that's been hyped for its great use of 3D so I decided to indulge and try it out. I really don't think I'm one for 3D. Unless the director thinks out every single shot of the film, the 3D holds it back. It especially betrays simple medium shots of people where they're the only thing in focus because it makes it look so unorganised and sloppy. Perhaps I should rewatch the film in 2D as I didn't feel as though the 3D added anything to the scenes where it was clearly intended for. However, these scenes, where Pi is alone on the boat with the Tiger, remain the film's strongest and most focused moments. Post-crash scene, Life of Pi finally came into its own with fascinating, sometimes funny and really beautiful scenes of simple survival. Unfortunately, Suraj Sharma, who plays teenage Pi, isn't a strong enough actor to hit his big emotional scenes and they come off and false and contrived. The film does have its merits and mostly on a technical level (forgetting the 3D), but the third act is really messy and doesn't climax in a satisfying way, cinematically or emotionally. I understand its final note on its themes regarding faith and beliefs but the execution doesn't do the idea of it justice. How anyone could gain a faith in God after a story like that is beyond me. It's an enjoyable and watchable film, but quite underwhelming.7/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
World of Possibilities,"Pi Patel is a rambunctious boy, who is wise beyond his years. He seeks the truth in life and in the spiritual world.In the Life of Pi, Pi is caught in a wild adventure as in a twist of unforeseen events he ends up literally the turbulent waters of the ocean with his wits and accompanied with a tiger. Directed by Ang Lee and based on the novel by Yann Martel, this movie is beautiful and mystical that opens the door to a world of possibilities. This movie has what is expected from an Ann Lee movie, full of color and the scenes are larger than life. It is a touching tale and will definitely be a Lee classic.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Life of Pi: life lesson for all ages,"The feature film ""Life of Pi"" is the film that brings many life lessons to people that watch because no one can imagine what a young Indian origin can simply learn as much as Pi learned during the story reported. A film that also has many high quality cinematic effects also shows that no matter what your religious belief, anyone can express their faith in what you believe in, and even with the most difficult situations, such faith will not be shaken. Through the vision of Yann Martel, author of the book that gave the film, and its director Ang Lee, with great simplicity and beauty portrayed the drama of a young man who finds himself often helpless, trying to survive in the middle of the Ocean Pacific in the company of one of the largest predators on the planet, we are led to reflect on our own lives and the difficulties they face in everyday life, and what is the real strength (or faith, as it is very prominent in the story) that we have within us to overcome our challenges, and Pi had great courage to face their challenges in life. The Indian actor Suraj Sharma in just 17 years, it surprises with its superb performance, it brings much life and brilliance in all the passages of the film that depict the adventures that Pi lived during his youth. Like many films were inspired in large bestseller, ""Life of Pi"" was also a result of a book, in which Ang Lee masterfully and also metaphorically portrayed to perfection in this movie. As much as Pi has experienced situations that virtually no one lived, the whole story is a way to show that you cannot give up in the face of an obstacle, however it seems insurmountable to our eyes, because as the plot shows, it takes to trust in ourselves, in our inner strength, even with my eyes closed, so that our faith is put to the test, because if there is no doubt we cannot say that faith exists permanently. ""Life of Pi"", a film for the whole family, who teaches the true values that often are forgotten over time and generations, to make us see the importance of a united family that cherishes the Sacred Teachings and mainly the respect for life, be it any creature.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Astonishing,"Pi Patel, played for the most part by Suraj Sharma with a confidence defying his absolute inexperience in front of the camera, and surely qualifying him for a Best Actor nod at the Oscars, is thrust into an adventure of survival at sea. The ship carrying his family and their zoo hits bad waters, inexplicably sinks, and from there he must learn how to share the confined space of a lifeboat with his only companion, a tiger named Richard Parker.Like 'Cast Away', due to its idea a great deal of the film is without speech, save for Pi's one way conversations with the animal and the occasional narration by adult Pi, played by a spectacular Irrfan Khan, who is telling his tale to an author, one who is after a great story that will ""make you believe in God"". Also much like another of this year's spectaculars, 'The Hobbit', the front end of the movie is loaded with a lot of setup, which those who who only saw the trailer may find surprisingly hefty. Unlike 'The Hobbit', however, this front end engages you fast and it is not long before you are enjoying the development of Pi as a character, the amusing finding of his faith, his love, and his place in the family. Some genuinely hearty and smart humour can be found in this first act, also. The brilliance is that whilst it is not in any rush to get where we all know it is headed, at no point is there any wish for Lee to push it along faster; there is some understanding intrinsic to the direction that this is all important and not to be overlooked, which even those who have not read the hugely popular book pick up on. To add to this, it must be said that the length and pacing of this movie is outstanding; you would not want any more or less time spent basking in the warmth of the love and care that clearly went into putting every single gorgeous frame on the screen.The second act is where we really see the film kick into gear and start rolling out what is stunning audiences and critics alike. From the greatest CGI animal I think I have seen on the silver screen, to the overwhelmingly beautiful photography, effects, and perhaps not the first, but certainly the best use of 3D technology to enhance the engagement with a story, 'Life Of Pi' sweeps the floor visually with anything previously held up as a bar setter. Nothing against those previous movies, but it really does.All of this is obviously nothing without everything else being in place, and thankfully Ang Lee knows that the heart of his film is not how pretty it is, but the story by Yann Martel and the themes with which it deals. So what is 'Life Of Pi' about? The wonderful thing about this piece is that this answer could be different for you than it was for me. It is about a boy surviving at sea with a tiger. It is about the nature of life, death and loss. It is about the balance of fear and respect. It is about love and hope. It is about humanity and compassion. It is about religion and faith, faith not just in a higher power, but in anything in the world. It is about all of these things at once, but what I most took away from this film is how it is about the nature of nature itself. Yes, it sounds heavy and preachy, doesn't it? The truth is Lee gets the balance absolutely spot on; you take from the movie what you want and at no point does it preach at you about anything. It does not matter how you walk in, an atheist, a Hindu, a Christian, but if you are a human being with anything close to an open heart and mind, you might just walk out feeling a better person! Released for the festive season, it is an oddly uplifting film that entertains on one hand, and on the other is positively philosophical about our place in nature, our treatment of her, and of one another. Not often would I say that a film might just change your life, but as the film reached its finale, with both Sharma and Khan absolutely owning their respective final scenes, I realised I had been inescapably moved to tears more than once, had consciously assessed how I think about certain things, and that yes, this film just might change you for the better. Is the preceding challenge to make a character believe in God achieved? That would be telling, but more importantly, it does not matter; in a rather smart bit of writing and beautiful execution, the film underlines that this is not really the point, and indeed should never be.Ang Lee is a man who directs with a heart full of compassion, and a head full to its brim with an understanding of cinema's sheer power to entertain, engage and challenge, sometimes all at once. A look at his previous work is evidence enough of this; sure, not everything is a hit, but never could his passion for cinema, bravery and humanity, be more on show than with 'Life Of Pi'. He has done what was said to be impossible, taken a book that should never have translated to cinema, and not only made a successful film, but made the all-round best spectacular to hit the big screen since Nolan's 'Inception'! A loss at the Oscars for its visuals and adaption for screen, at the very least, would be a sin! Regardless of one's reaction to the movie, Ang Lee may well have created his masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
A truly extraordinary adventure,"Amidst movies like The Hobbit, Jack Reacher and Skyfall, all packed with action, fighting, shooting, killing and breaking, comes ""Life of Pi"", from director Ang Lee, someone who brings a different kind of cinema to audiences.I should tell you that I'm a fan of Ang Lee's and he's only let me down once (Hulk, anyone?), but I went into this film with an open mind and ready for whatever came my way.""Life of Pi"" follows the life of Pi Patel from his very early childhood to his grown up years as he tells it to a writer interested in his unusual life story. We get a glimpse of Patel's life as a boy in India, his relationship with his parents, brother, God and.....animals. As a teenager and after surviving a shipwreck, Patel will experience loss, faith and the loss of it as well, but he will also develop a bond with a Bengal tiger that will change and shape him forever, and challenge everything he knew about life.Most of the movie is spent in showing this relationship and its effects in the leading character. Nothing can really prepare you for what's in store for you: I suggest you abandon any preconceptions you might have and simply enjoy the experience because as simple as it sounds, this story is absolutely surprising and there's no way to tell where it will go and how it will end.In fact, the characters in the movie didn't know it either and this helps your own disbelief.Additionally, the film is a visual feast. Unlike some other visually stunning films, however, the effects here are used to tell a story and to actually enhance it, not to dazzle the audience with outstanding visual effects. As beautiful as it is, the story is the most compelling part and though it might not be 100% original (we've seen movies of human befriending animals before), I guarantee you, as a movie junkie that I am, that you have never seen one like this; I think the fact that the protagonist is Indian and the director Taiwanese helps this film to be culturally and philosophically very different to what we're used to and this factor made the experience all the more rewarding.As a side note, this movie is ideal for families: the movie theater was full of kids and they all enjoyed it. There are no scary scenes, no brutality, no cursing: just life, with its share of sadness, love and happiness.I wouldn't go as far as saying this is the best film of the year, but I can say for sure that you will not see another film that even slightly resembles this one in terms of story, visuals and life lessons.

Prepared to be Wowed. Truly Magical!,"I loved, loved the movie. Makes you think about it long after it's over.Are there differences between the book and the movie? OF COURSE. So what?!? Many people have not read the book (including myself) and many that did read the book failed to understand/did not completely understand the spiritual and philosophical aspects of it, mostly because many terms are based on several philosophies from different religions and not to mention usage of Hindu philosophical and some Tamil words throughout the story. The movie somewhat simplifies all that and brings an otherwise impossible story to the big screen. It's truly magical.You may want to look up ""Life of Pi"" terms for better understanding. Also there are a lot of words spoken in Tamil language and an entire song in Tamil – ""Pi's Lullaby"" which actually is a great song -http://www.amazon.com/Pis-Lullaby/dp/B00A12VUM4/ref=sr_1_1? ie=UTF8&qid=1355507080&s=dmusic&sr=1-1The movie has a lot of scenes that have so much meaning and depth if you understand the Hindu philosophy and culture. For instance - mom seeing revolving earth in the mouth of young Krishna, Lord Vishnu coming in the form of a snake to save the world or the Kathakali dance sequence.

"A greatly satisfying movie, probably the best of the year!","Life of Pi!What a brilliant cinematography? A visual masterpiece! The movie itself had a character apart from that of Pi. The animals seemed to be acting as well, what a brilliant SFX work! The background score was fantastic, you feel goose bumps all over during some extreme scenes! A completely satisfying movie! A couple of Oscars are some deserving jewels for this crown!I am an Indian, and I can definitely say, in India, some plots explained in the movie do not happen! But they can be excused as it is more of an emotional story, of courage, of faith - more like a fairy tale!If you watched this movie, you would find these interesting:1. Anandhi, the classical dancer, makes a sign or a mudra during her dance. Pi later asks doing the same mudra, 'why would a lotus hide in a forest?' And Anandhi is shown to be embarrassed. That's because, in hindu symbology, lotus represents a woman's vagina! It hides in dense pubic hairs, doesn't it? (damn) By the classical dance, it is symbolically meant that the lady is shy and wants to express her sexual feelings.2. The whole carnivorous island is seen as a Hindu God, Vishnu (the supreme soul) lying on his back! It is a beautiful metaphor! Vishnu has said in Bhaghvad Gita, 'whatever is given to you is taken back!' The island gives you food and shelter in the morning and takes it all away in the night. Such an island is scientifically impossible to exist, but like I said, it's a fairytale.These are the things I couldn't see anywhere on the internet. But, if you read the novel, you can definitely understand the complex and intricate relationship between humans, life and survival instincts. The whole movie is a beautiful poem! It takes some time to understand it!I would give a 9 on 10, the movie lacked nowhere, and yet I had to take off the one because of some cast's poor acting!

"A magical journey, no matter what you believe in","I love coming of age movies. They have been my go to movies for over a decade. A real world experience that molds a person's character for rest of his/her life is a universal subject that would never dry up. But then there is this book called 'Life of Pi' that I came across and provided more than my staple coming of age diet and take me through a journey of faith and beliefs. This book acts as a disguise to be spiritual (given that is set in India), but at the core is a coming of age story of a boy finding answers of faith and beyond having born in a nation of millions of gods. And to turn this book into a captivating movie, we have Mr. Ang Lee; who clearly love challenges.Set in India and made by Hollywood studio; you should expect the simplistic description of a very complex nation and its affair with religions of the world. But Mr. Lee manages to breeze through the shallow storyline based in India. Almost all of the situations and scenarios about young boy Pi's life in Pondicherry, India are created to suit the taste buds of western audiences. As we watch the young Pi grow in dreamy India along with a soulfully spoken narrative by Irfan Khan in background; we instantly are lost in the color and the mood of the film. We never look beyond those colors into reality and we are ready to accept anything.But as we move on from Anglo India into open sea; faith and personal beliefs of Pi collides with nature's fury. After Pi Patel's father, a zoo owner decides to move his family in Canada and sell the animals to a North American zoo for a good prize; they begin their journey. The entire family along with all the animals travels through a Japanese cargo ship across the oceans. There they have encounter with a borderline racist French cook and a very gentle Buddhist. There reel time is only for one sequence, but there presence and importance will be felt late in the movie. As the journey of the ship abruptly ends in a very violent ocean; Pi is survived on a life boat with an injured zebra, an Orangutan, a Hyena and a Bengal Tiger.And from here on the journey could not be more breath taking and satisfying. It literally and astonishingly unbelievable with Pi surviving on a life boat with these animals and they are animals. They will do anything to survive like humans. The mystery of the journey and whether you believe in the memories of the adult Pi about his experiences across the vast ocean will make you rethink about all the mystical fantasies that we have ever came across.The story already hooks the audience into the ongoing proceedings and Mr. Lee's breathtaking visuals puts 'Avatar' in its place & carries you through a journey of vast beauty across our planet. After Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and Brokeback Mountain, Mr. Lee successfully trumps those monumental achievements in Cinema history with this visual masterpiece that deserves compulsory 3D viewing.For more reviews visit http://cinemadose.blogspot.com/",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
utter garbage,Visually stunning. thats all. the main character on the boat was so irritating. carricature performance. nobody talks like that. could not get past first hour. no story. the main character was an idiot who deserved to be eaten by the tiger.,6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Breathtaking visuals complement provocative tale,"In Life of Pi, Ang Lee's philosophical spectacle, makes for a fascinating viewing, succeeding on multiple levels of enjoyment. There's the adventure itself, a massive sojourn of a boy in a lifeboat - with a Bengal tiger. And then there's the meaning of the story itself, which is happily left ambiguous. It's also about the spirit and resourcefulness of man, and above all it's about hope and optimism.Pi Patel (Suraj Sharma), named after a famous pool in France, is on his way from his home in India with his mother, father, brother, and a lot of animals (the family owns a zoo) aboard a Japanese vessel, bound for Canada. During a particularly terrifying thunderstorm, the ship sinks, and Pi finds himself on a stocked lifeboat with a few of the lucky creatures (none human) and no idea of his location.The animals are inconsequential except for one - the tiger. How does one survive in a lifeboat with an untamed beast who'd love to make a meal out of him? It's not easy, and luckily our Pi is quite resourceful. Rest assured, though, there is no silent understanding between the two, even as hunger and thirst rob each of his strength. They are not friends. They each wish to survive, although a case can be made that Pi, at least, has no intention of harming/eating the tiger.The tiger is not stupid - oh, quite the contrary, he is a cunning brute. He can't be cowed, and he won't allow Pi to have dominion over the lifeboat, which forces our human hero to construct a sort of floating annex to the boat, tethered and filled with supplies.Of great interest to me were the tantalizing, beautiful aquatic scenes. Whether it was the sight of thousands of fish flying through the air at our passengers or a glimpse into the remarkably clear water to see gorgeous - and sometimes quite large - marine life blithely swimming by, there's rarely a slow moment. Picking up the slack in such matters, of course, is how Pi survives, how he keeps his wits about him, how he manages to get by with a ravenous tiger so close by.If you think that Lee is trying to present a moralistic story to us - he touches quite a bit on religion, for example - you are right. But it's not heavy handed by any means. To illustrate this, Pi (as an adult relating his tale to a writer) notes that when he was a young lad in India, he joined up with several different religions, a way to show us that he was having trouble finding his way, choosing the right path. As his father remarks to him at dinner one night, it is fine to be different, but in the end one must choose a path. Net thing you know, Pi is afloat on a raft, drifting aimlessly across the Pacific Ocean. He still had not found his way.In the end, Lee doesn't appear to be trying to teach his audience. He is not moralizing; he is presenting choices and explaining how, in this situation, a single man found his way through life, not simply to survive but to live. This is not a movie about a boy and his pet tiger roaming the seven seas; it's about learning about one's inner self and finding an exciting direction in which to take it. And even apart from the symbolic journey that Pi involuntarily undertakes, there is a second moral quandary posed at the very end that will get the viewer thinking. And that, to me, is the real selling point of this movie. The beauty, the majesty, the excitement of the cross-sea trip is almost surreal - but sufficiently realistic to allow one to enjoy its wonder. Yet that final question, posed by the adult Pi, seals the deal. This is a movie best seen on a large screen, the better to appreciate its epic scope.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Better At the End Than the Middle,"Why you shouldn't see it:Not to give away too much about this particular movie, but... it drags at parts. While it doesn't necessarily feel any longer than its two hour runtime, it does feel every minute of it. Have you ever watched a movie that takes place entirely on a lifeboat? Well, neither have I, but I've now seen half of a movie that takes place entirely on a lifeboat. I understand there's another movie - titled, coincidentally enough, Lifeboat - that takes place entirely on a lifeboat. Maybe someday I'll watch that Hitchcock piece, but until then I'll have to settle for this particular lifeboat-centric movie. Okay, okay, I have exaggerated slightly how much of this movie takes place on a lifeboat. The parts of the movie that take place on the lifeboat aren't technically entirely on the lifeboat, as there is also the 20-or-so-foot radius of open water around the lifeboat where some action also takes place. So there's that.This one actually reminds me a fair amount of Cast Away in that the majority of the movie leans heavily on the ability of a single character to engage the audience's interest while he does nothing more than try to survive in extraordinary circumstances. The problem with that comparison is that Suraj Sharma is no Tom Hanks (full disclosure: I an almost creepy respect for Tom Hanks' acting chops, so I may be biased here). While the latter half of Cast Away thrives on Hanks' ability to make otherwise mundane on screen moments incredibly intriguing, Life of Pi just doesn't have as strong a feature actor to revolve its survival story around.Strangely, some of the more dragging parts of the movie happen before Pi ever fatefully sets foot on a boat. Since the story isn't so much about a lifeboat as it is about a boy and the man that boy becomes, there's the sometimes regrettable necessity of building a backstory about where this person is coming from. It's hard to explain, but there is just something about this backstory that doesn't hold my attention nearly as well as others (for example, Cast Away). As a general rule, I spent a fair amount of the first half of the movie wondering things like, ""When are they getting on the boat?"", ""Why are they not on the boat yet?"", ""Why do Indians wiggle their heads like that when they talk? Do they think it conveys any message to the listener other than induced confusion?"", and, ""Wait, does this movie even have a boat in it?""Why you should see it:Perhaps above I didn't mention a fairly big (literally and figuratively) additional character in the movie, specifically in the lifeboat: an adult male Bengal tiger. The tiger has a name, but I won't spoil that for you, and I will just refer to it here as ""tiger."" So anyway, what you thought was going to be a nice, laid back, somewhat boring adventure on a lifeboat turns out to be, in fact, a second-by-second struggle for survival against a freaking Bengal tiger. In case you're not as familiar as I am with Bengal tigers, just know that they average 500 pounds and are considered to be the most aggressive subspecies of an animal that is known to occasionally eat people.Tiger has a funny name in the movie, and I will give credit to the author and screenwriter for occasionally adding in appropriate moments of humor and everyday humanity into an extraordinary coming of age story. If it hadn't been for the occasional giggle moments in the first half of the movie, I'm not sure I would have made it to the second half. Well, that's an exaggeration, since I'm pretty thoroughly stubborn when it comes to finishing movies, and even more so when it comes to best picture nominees. Still, suffice it to say that there wasn't much to hold my attention for the first hour.All that being said, there is really one main reason that anyone would want to see Life of Pi, and that reason has everything to do with an appreciation for visual art. Once the film reaches the boat, nearly every frame of the movie one could take, frame, and put it up on his or her wall. The visuals are stimulating not only due to the fact that they include crystal clear detail and vivid, saturated colors, but they also depict images that are not frequently seen. You may not be aware, but an adult male Bengal tiger does not often chill out on a lifeboat playing with flying fish in the middle of the ocean. Even in little moments, Lee finds ways to create visual art out of his material. When the opening credits are rolling over footage of a small Indian zoo, the words on the screen behave like the animals on the screen. Sometimes it's the little things.In Short:Life of Pi is visually breathtaking at moments and beautiful for the rest of it. If you have interest in seeing it and aren't opposed to the whole 3D phenomenon, I recommend it as a readily available way to suck you even further into the visuals Lee has created. The story drags at parts for me, and but for the payoff at the end (which I won't spoil for you), I would be happy to write the whole thing off as eye candy and nothing more. But that payoff is there, and as a consequence I've been thinking about it since I saw it almost a week ago. If it weren't for the occasional slowness of the movie itself, I would rate it higher, but for now I'll settle at a 7 out of 10 and recommend it to anyone who likes pretty things and/or exploring the nature of storytelling.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Truly worth going to the movies for.,"I saw this film last night in 3D. I was expecting a Disney style, jungle book kind of movie, but this was a WOW experience!!! Maybe it's because I see a lot of films, but honestly, I haven't been truly impressed by a movie in years and I was blown away! Ever hear the expression ""killing me softly"" well, that's the only way I can describe the emotion I felt.This film is truly an impressive masterpiece, in every sense of the word. From the cinematography, to the story telling, to the pacing of the film, it is so thoughtful and grand. I can't say enough about what an authentic soul searching story this film turns out to be. The way it's told doesn't force a spiritual journey on you, but instead, presents you with a story that allows you to journey into yourself. If I just read the from someone else cynical side of me would roll my eyes, but it truly isn't a pretentious or preachy film, it's just a soul affirming experience.The film makers did everything right in this movie. From the casting, to the thoughtful use of 3D, everything gels perfectly and leaves you feeling grateful for going to the movies.In short I recommend this movie to anyone but young kids. There is no way they could sit through this whole movie without becoming an annoyance to all the other patrons. The subject matter is too deep, and they would not be able to handle some of the scenes or the lengthy film time. Be kind to everyone else at the movies and go with older kids or adults.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Nice Film But Not Perfect,"By now everyone will know Life of Pi is the story of a young boy and a Bengal Tiger trapped on a small lifeboat after the sinking of their ship. Visually the film is without peer, with strong acting and well drawn characters. We are treated to some superb CGI renderings of sea and land creatures and the 3D is used to good effect. I believe Life of Pi features the best CGI rendered creatures to date and makes the likes of Avatar look like a 1980's computer game.I saw Pi yesterday and I did very much enjoy it, but I can understand why some people might be disappointed. It really depends on the level of expectation you are going into the cinema with. I went in merely expecting a nice story and for me I got this. The story is driven nicely along and never becomes dull, despite long periods without dialogue or any particularly action. The story itself is so simple and enjoyable that it could be the film is best enjoyed at that level alone, but there is another level, a parable, and that worked for me too. But I was acutely aware that the symbolism and metaphors used in this level were laid on very thick and that subtlety is not Pi's middle name.As an example, there is a short bit of exposition near the end and it was like being hit by a sledgehammer, talk about patronise the audience. Clearly these ham-fisted elements are designed to convey meaning to those audience members who are more at home reading picture books with big writing, but it's this side of Hollywood that detracts from films and grates on a lot of movie-goers.Life of Pi is a very simple story and is very easy to decipher, there's no great reward for decoding this sort of film. And there is nothing wrong with that, sometimes the simplest stories are the best, but when the film attempts to elevate itself above its station via heavy use of symbolism or allegory, it can become self-important and even pretentious. I think Pi dallies with the former but does avoid the latter, nonetheless the heavy-handed application of these elements do detract from what is a very good film and it's quite clear the message could have been delivered far more elegantly.Nonetheless, if you go into the cinema just wanting to see a good story told via the magic of cinema, you will be pleased with the Life of Pi.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

"Truly an amazing story, with a great adventure that is hard to believe.","This is truly an amazing story, with a great adventure that is hard to believe. Pi, (Suraj Sharma) an Indian boy, is on a ship with his family who is moving to Canada. One night there is a terrible storm that sinks the ship and only Pi, a Hyena, Zebra, Orangutan and a Bengal Tiger whose name is Richard Parker survive. They are all in one of the small life boats trying to stay alive. After a while it only becomes Pi and Richard Parker who are adrift in the Pacific Ocean. Pi is now trying to survive, but is in fear of Richard Parker. Based on the best-selling novel by Yann Martel, this adventure is created in 3D and is one of my new favorites. The visual effects are amazing and capture the marine life really well with all its beautiful colors. I like the way this film is set up like someone is telling it as a story, this really keeps my attention. One of my favorite scenes is when a big whale comes out of the ocean; it is so big and pretty to see. It is incredible. I also like the way we learn how the Tiger is named Richard Parker. It is somewhat funny and unusual. I would love to know How Director, Ang Lee, directs all the animals in this film, it is truly amazing how they act. David Magee, (Screenplay writer) is doing a remarkable job on transforming a great novel into an amazing script. Other casts in Life of Pi include Vibish Sivakumar (Ravi Patel) and Rafe Spall (The Writer). A big message I found is to never lose hope no matter where you are in life. Pi is in the middle of the ocean for many many days with a big storm, and a Tiger, but thru it all he never loses hope to be rescued. I recommend this film for ages 8 to adults. Younger ages may be a little frightened when they see some of the animal scenes, but other than that, this is a must see. You can enjoy it with your family and friends. I give Life of Pi 5 out of 5 stars. I love the message and the visual effects. This is a great story of hope and determination.

Visually stunning,"I recently watched the Life of Pi movie and am pleased to say I thoroughly enjoyed it. Having read the book I was worried they might deviate too far from the original storyline as so many book-based movies I've seen in the past have done. Life of Pi was definitely an exception. I don't feel that anything was lost in translation. In fact, I believe the movie actually added to the wonder of the original story through the beautiful cinematography, special effects and acting. There were so many stunning shots throughout the movie, but the zoomed out scenes of Pi Patel's lifeboat floating over the placid sun, sky, and star reflecting waters of the Pacific Ocean were simply breathtaking. I was also very impressed with the 3D special effects, namely the re- creation of Richard Parker (the tiger Pi was stranded with), but overall they did a simply amazing job.

You Can't Herd Cats,"Have you ever actually physically seen a tiger? I had the tremendous fortune to see one once, at a zoo, concealed behind what I presume was a fairly thick wall of glass. They are sprightly animals: expressive faces, strangely full of both confidence and apprehension; eyes which cut right through you when they stare you down. Their agility is quite striking, gracious, but of course deadly, in their hopping and pouncing to and from their chosen platforms. Between the open-air monkey enclosure; the penguin performance and the tarantula on one of the zoo keeper's arms, the tiger was certainly one of the highlights.Broadly speaking, the premise to ""Life of Pi"" is that someone, a teenager, is stuck on a small life raft with one of these beasts in the middle of the ocean. The tiger cannot eat the boy, otherwise it will starve, but of course it doesn't know this, and the boy, who is of course stranded, must fish for food to sustain both his own life but also to keep the tiger at bay. Ang Lee, directing, spins a nimble tale out this idea, borrowing, in terms of imagery and general approach, from some of the more successful films of this stock from recent years: ""Forrest Gump"" and ""Amélie"", for instance, while the sense of being stranded in one place and having to rely on resourcefulness calls to mind ""Cast Away"". You know the types I mean: slick, good looking and colourful dramas which glide along at their own pace. Fans of its genre will enjoy it, but there is a little bit more in there besides in terms of its exploring things to do with morality; evolution and where exactly God sits in the world.The film begins in the present-day, and so broadly speaking consists of one, long flashback, with the titular Pi, a man of Indian descent, in his Canadian home speaking to a struggling author (Rafe Spall). The author is looking for something with some spark to put down into a book, and he seems to think he's found it in the titular Pi, who experienced what can only be described as a unique experience in his younger life. We flash right the way back to India during Pi's youth, wherein his family runs, in actual fact, a zoo. But amidst all the animals on display, hypnotically put to us via the opening credits sequence, it is the tiger which attracts Pi's attention the most - beautiful but deadly, elegant in its movement and monitoring of its surroundings; fur like velvet you can only stroke when it is under anaesthetic.In a sense, much of what Pi encounters during this opening act in India has little to do with what the film will come to depict, in that he excels somewhat at mathematics at school; has difficulty communicating with girls and swims a bit, but it presents him as a human-being and a boy who, like any boy, has these experiences at school and home. At the zoo, his father forces him to watch the aforementioned tiger consume a goat when Pi becomes a little too enamoured with the creature, and this kills something inside of him he cannot quite define, although to what extent it had to do with anything later on is unclear. Perhaps his experience at sea was the catharsis he needed to rekindle his lost feelings, but it couldn't be as simple as that, could it?Lee moves the film into the second act with a dramatic shipwreck sequence when Pi's father feels the family set-up and all involved must move across the ocean to Canada; the going down of the liner and our perspective of it eerily, and I'm sure not wholly accidentally, calling to mind the earlier imagery of Pi's father swimming in the crystal-clear waters of a Parisian pool with the bright blue sky in the background. From here, the meat of the film unfolds as Pi and a scatter-shot crew of animals from varying points on the food-chain uneasily congregate on a lifeboat and are left to float on their own. The passage allows the film to mediate on a variety of things, but only via the perspective of a young boy who has happened to read up on the world's religion, but has also lost everything he had.Consequently, the film teases us with a Darwinian plight involving the animals which, unsurprisingly, goes the way of the fittest. There is a tantalising moment whereby an Orangutan, the closest to human-beings in an evolutionary sense, seems to realise it needs to put on a life-jacket. Pi confronts God via prayer when he is forced into terminating the life of a fish to survive, something which drags us back to the world of the Old Testament when people were forced into the barbarous action of slaughtering bovine animals in order to live before using God to justify it and writing it all down in Leviticus, a sort of apology to themselves. He then does so again via a means he at least thinks is more physical when a tropical storm strikes the boat and we are, again, reminded of how people in dire situations used to put their circumstance and the natural world around them down to a deity punishing and/or testing them.The film is all at once a disaster movie; a comedy; a biography and a rumination on life and the world, but it is never enough of any one of these things to have it feel contained or constricted to the generic demands of either of these things. Instead, ""Life of Pi"" is a refreshing and often exhilarating drama with a bite as powerful as any wild cat's.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
All the better for waiting for,"When I read Yann Martel's magical 2001 novel a couple of years after it was published, I was aware that there was interest in filming it, but I could not imagine how this would be done. The delay of almost a decade in bringing the story to the screen has worked to the benefit of the enterprise because, as well as attracting the directorial talents of the wonderful Ang Lee - who has made such terrific films as ""Sense And Sensibility"", ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and ""Brokeback Mountain"" - the technology has developed so much that the combination of Lee's art and CGI science is an absolute triumph.At the core of the movie is the 227 days that young Indian Pi spends aboard a life boat with only a 450lb Royal Bengal tiger called Richard Parker, a female orang-utan called Orange Juice, a zebra with a broken leg, and a hyena for initial company. Amazingly this part of Pi's life is represented by Suraj Sharma, who has never acted before and even had to be taught to swim, selected from more than 3,000 boys seen, and only 17 at the time of most of the filming in a vast tank of cold water in an abandoned airport in Lee's home nation of Taiwan.I saw the film as Lee wants it to be seen - in 3D.

A movie you might have to ponder upon to know why it's a great movie...,"So this is a movie based on a novel, now video game movie adaptations doesn't seem to work a lot of times. But it works from novel to movies sometimes and I haven't even read the book. But it seemed like this is a great adaptation. Now I wasn't even excited for this movie or anything, when I saw the first trailer I didn't even know what this movie was about. It just showed a guy and a tiger on a boat. This kinda seemed like ""127 Hours"" and ""Castaway"" combined kinda. But it is a more meaningful movie that has some deep messages to go with it. Now this is a family movie but youngsters probably won't be entertained much by this but for the adults that like psychological and spiritual movies just might dig this one. I can't really say I was very entertained throughout this whole movie, some parts seemed a bit slow for me. But this is just one of those movies you might have to ponder upon about after seeing it to know why it's a great movie. The cinematography is just vivid and beautiful to watch even if it's mostly nature. Most of the running time is taken up while showing the relationship between Pi Patel and a tiger and they are both stranded on a boat. And I especially liked how it didn't go in a far-fetched direction but you can actually buy into the relationship between Pi and the tiger. Overall this is a great movie that is worth seeing, just don't expect a lot of action or laugh out loud comedy. Although there are some witty and cute comedic parts in this movie.

Screenplay by David Magee is very good, dialogues are fine and they support movie very well. Screenplay has the typical essence of Hollywood. Everything has been plotted very well. First they shown the hurdle then use it afterward. Very realistic approach. Tiger is after all a tiger. Less of emotions and more of violence. Even they justify it in climax in very touching way. Credit must go to the director Mr. Ang Lee. There is good message beneath the entertainment that never ever lose hope. They touch the religion based God issue in very light but sensible way. VFX is seamless. It is hard to differentiate between the real scene and VFX. Now with the help of VFX it is possible to show the impossible. Performance wise the young PI, played by Suraj Sharma is very good. Irrfan Khan and Tabu are fine. Adil Hussain as PI father is also good. After all watch at least once.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Lost and Found,"For me, Life of Pi was a yo-yo between overt romanticizing of vignettes of Indian life and times by a non-Indian author, and a movie that has some seriously profound insights in spite of the same. The quaintness of a zoo in Pondicherry, finding religion, the mystique of Indian dance, the uprooting of a family owing to economic circumstances - all had an overtly lyrical, if not particularly original - aura. Then, suddenly, we find Piscine Molitor Patel aka Pi Patel (Suraj Sharma) - a castaway in the middle of the Pacific ocean - with all his beliefs called into question. Is there a point to overt faith? Can a human and a large carnivore be (to borrow from Star Wars) symbionts? Where does a man who has lost everything find hope, and the will to move on with one's life? Somewhat if not profoundly moving, Life of Pi is about how we are shaped by our bouquet of experiences, and how, from those experiences, one can draw upon great reserves of strength",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Most over-rated movie ever?,"I've seen lots of worse movies than Life of Pi. But I'm not sure I've ever seen a more over-rated one.The list of awards, accolades, triumphs and trophies for this movie is as long as your arm. The critics rave about it, and even the IMDb ratings hover at a very high 8/10. For the life of me I can't figure out why.Everything in this movie happens for one reason, and one reason only: because the author wanted it to. There is no build up to any event, no context, no association to anything else. It just flits from one scene to another without a hint of flow.In a fantasy movie like this, you normally tolerate very big plot holes. But this movie was one painfully long continuous plot hole. The tiger being under the sheet on the lifeboat for a day before he even realised it was there? Oh, come on! Worst plot device ever.There were lots of annoying small things as well - like when the tiger eats the goat ... it somehow attacks it and drags its dead carcass away, despite the large goat being in the OUTSIDE of the cage. Spare me.If you saw this movie at a local movie theatre on a lazy Tuesday night you would probably give it a pass mark. But I cannot possibly imagine why any jury of any film festival would even nominate this plot-driven, derivative nonsense for any award, much less go through and bestow it with more accolades than most other films in the history of cinema. Really, it's just not that good. The Emperor's new clothes?",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Life Of Pi might be the first 3-D film to win Oscar,"Life Of Pi gave me very good lessons about Life..... It is film about Life,Friendship,God and Religion.The Film has very nice shots taken,its really a cinematic achievement.The shots taken of the ocean are completely unbelievable.I enjoyed through out the movie.Its not the movie to be enjoyed with popcorn,but a movie to learn something about life.3-D effects r not that good but the shots taken are awesome.The Ocean looks pretty good.Acting was throughout good in the movie,especially the kid Suraj Sharma,he did an amazing job in this movie.He is going to achieve a lot of things in his life.From this movie I a lot about relationship between animal and humans.This movie shows that animals too have souls,they too have a soft corner in their heart.Overall the movie is one the best in 2012.It might be the first 3-d movie to go through and win Oscar.Hats off to Ang Lee.He has given us a film something learn to.It will be another achievement for him,or it might give him the Oscar.But I gotta say its superb directorial achievement.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Wonderous,"What would you do if you found yourself orphaned, alone and in the middle of the ocean? Drown, surrender, pray? Now imagine you had company in the form of a dangerous predator.We join the story of Piscine Molitor Patel in adulthood. Piscine, known as Pi (played by Irfan Khan) is an Indian living in Canada. One day, a young novelist comes to his door after being referred by a friend of his. Named after a swimming pool by his parents, Piscine came by his nickname after exhaustive chiding of his given name by classmates in school. His father ran a local zoo and Pi took an intense, and as far as his father was concerned, unhealthy, interest in the zoo's sole tiger. Named Richard Parker as the result of a clerical error, the tiger is fed a live goat while Pi bears witness in an effort by his father to instill an appropriate amount of fear. Though raised as a Hindu, Pi (played as an adolescent by Ayush Tandon) discovers Christianity as the result of a dare from his older brother and, by sheer chance, discovers Islam sometime after. As an adult, he refers to himself as a Catholic Hindu. At 16, Pi's father decides to close the zoo, sell the animals and move the family to Canada. This is a crushing development in the life of our main character as he has just fallen in love for the first time. The family and the animals make their journey west on a Japanese freighter. Woken by a severe storm, Pi goes to the top deck to marvel at the magnitude of the waves, wind, and rain. It is that extremely questionable decision which lands him in a lifeboat while his family and the rest of the crew sink with the ship. All this would make his chances of survival slim enough, but for better or worse, he's not alone in the boat. With him is Richard Parker the tiger, an orangutan he refers to as Orange Juice a zebra and a hyena.This is an incredible movie. Some would say elements of the story are too fantastic to be believable but, with the first film in The Hobbit trilogy and the alleged final chapter in the Twilight saga currently in theaters, those objections seem hollow, to say the least. The struggle between man and beast and the eventual development of a symbiotic relationship between the two make for an extremely gripping tale. It's made even more so by the trials and tribulations they both encounter in their fight to survive. I thoroughly enjoyed Life of Pi, and wish I'd seen it sooner.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"I haven't been astounded since grade school, until now","I bought the book when it was first being touted as a literary gem but then decided not to read it, so I have nothing to gauge how well Ang Lee did in interpreting the book. That said, this is one of the most endearing movies I've ever seen.My first thought having just seen it was, thank God some studio didn't get a hold of it first to do an American take on the book. This movie so deserves and demands its setting and foreign lead actors. I admit I probably would have enjoyed one of our better young leads in the role of Pi, but I'm much better off having grappled with the Indian chosen by Lee who, for some reason, populates this movie with everything from Mexicans, Indians, Japanese and Anglos to tigers, hyenas, orangutans and zebras, but not one Chinese person. I thought that a little odd but perhaps the books that way too.I saw the 2D version mainly because I was expecting some exploration of the god issue, but I was mostly disappointed in that. The talk of religion is very brief and not very interesting. What was interesting is the survival story and the boy's relationships with wild animals.I had no idea whether for the most part I was watching a real tiger or not. Let's just say that if Lee had to wait for the tiger to do everything he does in this movie, he by rights should still be out there filming. Someone with a real love for animals and an eye for their behavior clearly had a hand in making these scenes look real. And then there are the shots at sea. The sea rises in great swells and you would think Pi is actually in a lifeboat in the middle of the Pacific being carelessly tossed around by a violent storm; it's truly masterful, unprecedented filmmaking.Even my wife who is no friend to animals thought the movie went by quickly and was happy to have seen it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Great directing but screenplay not so much,"I can't say any bad things about Ang Lee.This movie couldn't filming beautiful more than this.I am amazed from some scenes,i can't believe how could shoot that scene but if you're a director and you don't write your own screenplay you could face some problems.If you had average screenplay,you could turn to good movie not amazing movie.About screenplay i don't get why writer even put to god into the movie if this movie about just Pi's life i think,it will be more effective than this.There's nothing wrong little Pi's religion search but adult Pi has a big headline 'when i finish my story you'll believe God.Sorry,adult Pi but end of the story i think your success rate 0/1.000.000.If we back to Pi's story why its end Pi was a teenage?Yes Pi's survive is a big story but end of the movie we leaving Pi in Mexico's some hospital with nothing.A huge nothing,no family no money no home....How Pi turn to a successful academician in Canada or USA(we don't know that either) We have no idea.Ang Lee do his best but is it enough to get best motion picture award? We'll see",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
I was intensely satisfied,"I was lucky enough to see Life of Pi. I was intensely satisfied. You know Life of pie is based on a novel written by Yann Martel.(BookCover Image - http://bit.ly/U1vpNu ) Also this book is amazing! it is one of the best I have ever read. Enjoyed this book also. Could not put it down.I agree with palariaa who said - So far this is the best movie of the year. It is an entertaining, well-directed, well-performed piece of art. If you want to see what groundbreaking crafts look like, go see it. Yes, the special effects are mind-boggling, especially Richard Parker, the tiger. But only when you look beyond the 3-D and visual effects that hold you in awe for most part of the movie (and that you have probably read in several critical reviews) you begin to see the real genius of the film and its director. This is a Taiwanese director making a movie with a mostly Indian cast, about Indian characters and places and he pulls it off so well (his India is way more credible than the Dickenson India shown in Slumdog). Life Of Pi is a bold movie made by a bold director who does not shy from making unconventional movies. Yes, it will upset some people for its unconventional subject, and some critics will find the off-beat movie preachy for they have grown so used to understatements and subtleties that they confuse those with art, but nobody can deny the powerful force of the movie. For the most part, the movie has only one human character on screen and yet it never gets boring - slow at times perhaps, but not boring. One last point - the movie could not have been what it is without the actors, particularly the one who plays adult Pi and the young actor who portrays teenage Pi and gives an unbelievable debut performance.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"""Perception"" in modern day Liberty Valence story","This can be viewed as a modern day Liberty Valance film, and I don't think that is specific enough to be a spoiler.It's also a story of ""perception"".It's a slow paced film, which usually only works when the characters are credible.The characters aren't ""credible"" here, but that might work because all but two of the characters are told from the point of view of a sole ship wreck survivor.The trouble is that the second of the two characters not told from his point of view, a writer, is not credible. We learn this at the end when he immediately has a revelation of truth that could only come from piecing a puzzle together.The writer character is poorly written for this reason. His immediate understanding of a puzzle is like a man reading a cryptogram and not even looking at all the letters, but solving it immediately, the first letter, then second, and so forth, in a normal cryptogram puzzle.Despite this, the story itself has its merits. Another problem is that we sit too long through the two characters droning on in a very dull way. Not that they're dull, but just that they aren't interesting. And it takes too long to get to the ""story"" part.I understand that a background is set up for the ""point of view"" of the sole survivor of a ship wreck, but this background part fails, or at least gets a ""D"" grade, for being overly long, when it could be just as well described in seconds by a good writer. Also, the character of the story teller doesn't seem credible for his background.The story teller explains himself in an Agnostic way, and a way that questions everything he sees. And we get this effect in the first story he tells. In the second story, however, he questions nothing, and his description of at least one character looks suspiciously made up.The dynamic part of the story could also have been better. There are some good cinematic touches, but this is very slow paced.What does bring this film up a level is the psychology of ""survivor"" stories. If one ever reads accounts by survivors of battles, wars, disasters, one sees pretty much a common element. The survivor almost never describes himself as nice, and in fact, almost all survivors try to describe themselves as harsh, tough, and a survivor because of natural selection.We do see that in the survival story here, in a good allegorical way. We also see that the survival story is told in such a way that we feel the survivor does perceive the events in ""flash photo"" form, which affects his perception of reality. Those aspects are well done.It's too bad that is about all that was done well. It's a good idea, but just not well written.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Perfect Visual Treat !!!,"First of all thanks to Ang Lee for directing an Hollywood movie based on Indians and their traditions. The story narration was gud, from start till the end and Irfan khan delivers wat director needs. His acting was really gud. Also the small boy does a great work, sacrificed everything for a gud movie. We can see his hardwork, were at end of movie he looks very skinny.A great visual works steals the show, stunning cinematography and CG works. We must not compare it with AVATAR but a gud movie in the lines of avatar. The hero of the whole movie is Richard Parker, The Bengal Tiger. The way it looks and the way it roars was gorgeous. Gud to see Tabu in Hollywood movie, congrats that she got another offer from the same director.Ang Lee delivers some thing special exply for Indian audience. Iam very much proud bcoz the title song of the movie was in ""TAMIL"" !!! My only request is please watch the movie in 3D and experience some thing new which u couldn't miss ...",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
It was a good movie but let's keep it 100.......,"Do I really have to reiterate the plot? If you don't know the Life of Pi is about a young boy stranded at sea with a Bengal Tiger, then I want to know what rock you've been sleeping under and how long. But seriously, that's pretty much what the movie is about. The movie also chronicles the life a young boy named Pi from his early childhood up until and after the ordeal.Let me start off by stating the visuals are excellent. I saw this movie in 3D (as if there's any other way to see it) and I think the composers did a masterful job creating a dynamic of animals and humans with the same feelings and facial expressions. The movie utilized awesome 3D visual effects to put you smack dab in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.The plot is simple but intriguing. There is something about the idea of being stranded in the middle of the ocean that awes the public. Add in the fact that your stranded with a wild animal is even more fun. The film focuses on the struggle of human survival in addition to spiritual enlightenment.I know what you're thinking. ""If the movie had all these good things, why did you rate it a 6?"" That's a good question, so I'll give you my reasons. After about 40 minutes into the movie I began to wonder where all this was going. The movie seemed to drag on and on with little indication there was any meaning to it all. You go through about an hour and a half of fishing, sea storms and animal taming. It was like Cast Away on the Pacific Ocean. The offshore adventure was fun until about 45 minutes. After that, the film just seemed to drag on with one futile triumph after another.There were religious and faith-based references throughout the movie, and the narrator made it clear there would be some type of revelation at the conclusion; leaving you with an anticipation of an prophetic event or climax. However, the film never really delivered. As weird as it sounds, there was nothing much out of the ordinary that happened in this story from any other story about a boy stranded in the sea with a wild tiger. The fact that he was stranded at sea with a wild tiger was what was out of the ordinary. Get me? I came into the movie expecting to be taken on an epic journey that left me with some great revelation. Instead, it was like watching an extended HD documentary on the discovery channel concluding with a dubious spiritual message. Don't get me wrong, I liked the movie. I mean, I like watching the Discovery Channel. As I mentioned before, the movie had great visuals and an interesting plot. I just don't think it lived up to all the hype and had the phenomenal effect so many people claimed it to have. To each his own though.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
A Disgrace,"I have to say this first. Being an Indian, its shameful that Tabu and Irfan chose to be a part of this THING. ! And the young guy that played Pi, should be served a life time ban from movies. ""Richard Parker, I brought water for you, Richard Parker"" God ! Ang Lee made this? I thought he was a good director. This is the first of his films that I have watched. and I swear I will not see any more of his films in my lifetime.And that terrible accent. For those of you who don't know, its not how we Indians speak English. Seems Irfan had to imitate the young guys accent for the sake of creating the impression, that he was the grown up version of that awful guy in the boat. I wonder how can anyone relate to this horrible character. I just wished Richard Parker lunged at him and finished him off in a single strike. But the tiger is just as lame as the lead character.Usually Tigers show up well on screen. But they managed to undo that too. So we get a cartoonish Tiger.When you see the guy reading out some text on surviving sea wrecks, while riding a raft, having just lost his entire family. and the fact that the director has chosen to devote 10 minutes to all that crap, you know you are in for a nightmarish movie.The only question, the only emotion that the movie evoked in me was, how could anyone make such a movie, and how did it manage to make the money it made. I am ashamed of being a part of this population of 7+ billion, the majority of which found this movie worthy of praise.This movie and its story is so dumb, I need to make a few clarifications. Wish they had had the sense of consulting some experts before making a movie on religion and philosophy. The first thing is the vegetarian-turns-meateater sermon. For the record, there are vegetarians and non vegetarians residing peacefully and in harmony in India. But the people who are vegetarians don't try to turn the non-veggies into veggies. and vice versa. Now the point that the movie seems to make. That a boy stranded on a boat without food, abandons being a vegetarian and starts eating fish. Well, its OK for him, he is such a lousy character anyway. I don't mind seeing him eat fish. But you cant use such an example for making ur point. There are people who would rather die of hunger than eat fish. I am not talking about those celebrities who turn to vegetarianism for the sake of their boyfriends/girlfriends, or being fashionable and trendy.I may write more late on. I conclude for now.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Breathtaking,"Life of Pi is a beautiful film that can be understood on several levels. The first level contains more of less a fairytale of an boy and some animals who survived a shipwreck. Another level shows the adventures character. So far so good, because it is very entertaining and very interesting images can be seen. On another level however,this picture is about the depth of the soul. Not only with this boy Pi, but it will be clear that his soul is as transprant and yet as dark at the same time as any soul can be. Especially at the end of the movie, you can enjoy some wonderful wisdom, that are not expected in this film. A wonderful film",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Life Of Pi... A Visual Treat,"A movie which is totally different from the rest. Life of Pi is a going to offer you a great visual experience. Those 2 hours spent in the theater are totally worth if you are expecting some extraordinary visuals and cinematography. It has one of those stories which is very difficult to tell through a movie. But Ang Lee has done an extraordinary job this time.The visual effects are going to keep you on the edge of seats all the time. If you want to enjoy this movie go watch in 3D. Its the effects that take the movie to next level. If you are budding filmmaker then there is lot to learn from the cinematography of this film. It is definitely a visual treat for the viewers.The story telling was so awesome. To depict the movie whose major portion involves just a tiger and a boy in a boat trapped in the middle of a sea struggling to live in this nice way is itself a great achievement.If you are not much into the effects or you like drama this flick may disappoint you. But it is not the fault of film, it is just the difference of taste that people have.It is probably the best movie in 3D after the Avatar, also one of the best adaptations of any novel.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
It's a worth watching fabulous visual experience for sure but not an emotionally or spiritually moving fantasy.,"Widely publicized as a spectacular, visionary project with a spiritual touch, Life Of Pi was eagerly awaited by both the appreciators of meaningful cinema and the lovers of realistic 3D technique together. Also promoted as the most astonishing visual achievement after Avatar, the makers were successful in putting many innovative ideas in the mind of the enthusiastic viewers waiting to be shocked and amazed by some unbelievable kind of content as shown in its promos.However, the film makes a mixed kind of impact as it ends wherein the creative team perfectly fulfills the main aspect of their promises made regarding the superior technicality of the product. But at the same time the film is not able to cater the spiritual or emotional aspect of its storyline that impressively. Adapted from Yann Martel's novel, its unarguably a superb visual experience without any doubt. The execution of its unimaginable plot and sequences through a fresh colourful palette on the screen surely transports the viewer into a different fantasy world in its two hours of duration as a novel experience. So if you are willing to see an eye catching extravaganza supported by some outstanding hard to believe computer graphics, then you would love watching Life Of Pi a lot.But in case you are expecting an emotionally moving spiritual experience talking about a rare journey in the sea lived by a young boy and a tiger together then you may find it a lot less appealing than promised. Enacted well by Suraj, Irrfan Khan (ignoring his accent), Tabu and Adil Hussain, along with a graphically created incredible Bengal Tiger it's a difficult film directed by Ang Lee and remains a stunning treat for your eyes throughout as far as its cinematography, under-water takes, frames, sound, treatment and execution is concerned.Yet Life Of Pi cannot be rated as a movie with a highly emotional quotient giving you some enlightening insights of a divine existence around us through its fictional characters. The few initial moments of the film devoted to the discovery of various religions by Pi fall flat without any clear vision and the same can be said about the questions raised on the subject of Life, Death and Faith in its various tense moments.To conclude Life Of Pi is surely a life time achievement by director Ang Lee if one only considers its unique, never before kind of visual impact alone. But honestly I couldn't feel any human heartfelt touch in it and couldn't applaud it whole heartedly as I was willing to.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Magnificent!,This is a movie(very common word for such piece of art)that is worth writing 1 million words and still wouldn't be enough. Thank God that they are still directors that can make such art.

Too Much Money Makes Bad Movies,"I've had a positive opinion of Ang Lee in the past. But having seen this movie, I think his stature and the state of the financial world is ruining him. The best movie of his I've seen was Eat, Drink, Man,Woman. I found that truly original and accessible. This movie seems more influenced by things like Thor and The Avengers. Wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy too much use of special effects. Plus, the storyline is way too much like The Namesake. Both movies have Irrfan Khan telling a story, including an explanation of the name. Gogol or Pi. Tabu was the main female character in both. Both protagonists end up in North America. Mira Nair told the story of The Namesake in the same way that Ang Lee told the story of Eat, Drink, Man, Woman, very personally and with some subtlety. I really prefer Mira Nair to tell Indian stories. I even prefer Danny Boyle. Ang Lee is, at best, third. He approaches it with the awkwardness of a foreigner.Slumdog Millionaire and The Namesake didn't burst like sensations on the movie scene. But once word of mouth got around, they ran for months and months. I am skeptical that Life of Pi has that kind of legs.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Beautiful to watch but hugely overrated as a movie,"I did not have huge expectations on this movie since it is not exactly my style of movie but nevertheless I have to say that I was disappointed. The movie is certainly quite beautiful to watch, at least part of it. However it is also a movie with a strong theistic agenda. Even though it is, luckily, not really religious/political extremism it is thick and intruding nonetheless. I was expecting Pi to actually learn something during the course of his adventure but he does not. He starts the movie gullible and foolish looking for meaning in life (religion) and the movie ends pretty much in the same way with him claiming that he had faith and therefore he survived. Yet none of the decisions he made was based on faith but simply pragmatical decisions of survival. If anything the movie proved that faith or religion had nothing to do with it.As I said the movie was, partly, quite beautiful to watch and this is entirely what rendered it the stars that I gave it. For the rest it was a very boring movie. The only mildly entertaining part was the scenes on the boat with Gérard Depardieu playing the very unpleasant cook. As beautiful to watch as they were many of the scenes were quite unrealistic though and had an artificial look to them even when, I believe, it was not intended. We bought the movie because my youngest daughter loves movies about animals but not even she was overly entertained by this movie.",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
A very good movie bearing the message of philosophy solved through rationality,"Life of Pie...the name although did not interest me at all on the firsthand, but after starting the journey with Irrfan khan aka Pi Patel, I became convinced that director Ang Lee had done one of his best jobs with this movie. Mesmerized, mystified I witnessed the adventure of Pi,a pondicherry boy through struggles in life. The questions of rationality, existence,and beautiful philosophy that God can give us having utter faith upon him was so easily depicted. From the little Krishna exposing Pi to thinking on a cosmic scale, to Vishnu showing the supreme serenity, to Christ taking pain for good of all. Pi, a topper of his class, although thought differently because he thaught from the purity of heart. Not always by brain. The way he introduced himself to Richard Parkour nearly killed him, but the way he saved Richard parkour, saved his life too giving sign of a mighty heart. This movie also is a platform to describe us why a faint hearted man can not accept God, but Pi could because of his inner beauty, love and dedication with hardwork to achieve something. Thats why at the end of story, it seems that his mother smiles at the end of table while having dinner. Pi of course,in the end also thanks hid father for teaching him to be rational. He found his God being rational and thats where the crunch of story lies with its beauty.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
A Beautifully Crafted Film,"Wow. That's really the only word that comes to mind. Watching this for the first time a few days ago, I found myself in a perpetual state of awe; this movie is an absolute work of art. This will be a short review, since it's virtually impossible to say much without giving anything away.The film starts with a small introduction into the life of Pi. It explains exactly how he came to have that name, and how he came to be stranded in the middle of the ocean in only the company of a fierce Bengal tiger. The rest of the story that ensues is absolutely top-notch; I really can't give this film enough praise. The narrative is extremely visceral and interpretive, filled to the brim with symbolism, and the conclusion is very satisfying.As far as acting goes, I was thoroughly impressed. The lead actor is very strong here; he is the only actor on screen for almost a full hour in the middle, and he knocks it out of the park.Now, the truly incredible part. This film is shot in spectacular 3D and I have never seen it used better. Seriously. People in the theater were literally gasping in awe as some of the more engaging visuals flashed on the screen. The viewer is completely immersed; you feel like you're a part of Pi's universe, stranded right there with him on that boat.This is one of the year's best films. It's as simple as that. I give it my highest recommendation.RATING: 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The best 3D movie & one of the best movies of all time!,"Life of Pi is about the incredible journey of Pi Patel(Suraj Sharma) after he's stranded on a boat with a couple of zoo animals, such as a zebra, an orangutan, a hyena & the most important animal is an adult Bengal tiger called Richard Parker. The story of Pi's life is narrated by an adult Pi(Irrfan Khan). Pi's story begins in Pondicherry where he lived with his mother(Tabu), his father(Adil Hussain) who is a zoo owner & his brother, Ravi(Mohd. Abbas Khaleeli). From here on the story just flows at an incredible pace where you neither get confused nor do you get bored even for a single minute. LOP is a treat to watch even before Pi gets stranded on a boat with all the animals.First off, this is the most visually appealing film of all time! The 3D in this movie is more or less the best 3D I've ever seen. It's even better than Avatar because most of the environment in this movie, is real! Ang Lee has portrayed India beautifully. This movie deserves all the Oscars that it's most probably going to get. A note on the performances. Newcomer Suraj Sharma is brilliant as Pi. The viewer doesn't even realize that he's a newcomer. Irrfan Khan is, as usual, mind blowing as the adult Pi. Tabu is great as Pi's mother. Abbas Khaleeli is impressive as Ravi. The other kid actors who played Pi & Ravi at different stages in their life are spectacular as well. Therefore, Life of Pi is a must watch. I promise you that, it's an experience of a lifetime!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Visually Excellent, Emotionally Subtle","Life of PI should be counted as a visual treat more than an emotional experience. Yet it should be considered as one the very good movies Hollywood has shown to the world in the past few years; where visual effects are dominating the screens.This entire story is about Faith and Hope. PI as a child was fascinated towards God, Rather restrict himself to one religion, He understood that ways of God might be different but destination in one. He accepts every thing good in every religion. He understood the concept of Faith in Hinduism and When He was introduced to Christianity; PI does not say Hinduism is wrong, He thanked Hindu God for introducing him with Jesus. The same positive approach was maintained throughout the movie in this character. When He was left alone in the ocean with Tiger, He says to God that he surrenders himself to him. That was truth. He surrenders himself to God and whatever comes in his way he went through it and took his life and way as God is taking him forward and his action is only to pass through the stages but not complaining or loosing hope. At one moment we believe in this where PI tries to survive, God tests him more in the form of Richard Parker (Bengal Tiger), Second Storm where he looses his total food supply, Prepared to be taken away by God (Death). Then God gives hope as a floating Carnivorous Island and again making him move forward without loosing hope.Richard Parker is a character rarely seen in movies. A silent villain character who makes the Hero survive. Imagine without Richard Parker, PI would have died in loneliness. As said in the movie, The terror of death from the Tiger kept PI alive. If Parker is another test by God, PI passed it by taming him. The relation between these two went very well through out the story when it started as predator and prey it transforms in to Master and Animal and finally hunger makes them both good friends in their own emotional levels. Though PI wanted Parker to look back and get his final greetings, Parker accepted them by stopping for a moment and leaving him alone without hunting down.Movie is visually astounding but visual beauty dominated the story? Certainly for an extent where there was not much story happening in the Ocean. It was lagging and on slow pace. Then comes the magical Island for rescue. But an immediate climax was a disaster for the movie. The way PI concluded the story before Japanese Cargo employees is good. But due to visual domination and partial drawbacks Life of PI just missed to be a Classic but almost there but worth watching once or twice. This movie cannot leave you in a trance where you go home and spend some hours thinking about it. Once you walk out of the theater the movie is over.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Life of Pi - Master Piece from Ang Lee,I was lucky enough to see this Incredibly Visual Treat movie in 3D.Life of Pi is surprised me a lot though i had some expectation before but trust me i witnessed One of the Best Experience in My Life.Story is more about a Survival of life and its more about faith in god.Why it is highly Recommended to Watch: Truly an Amazing Story with great adventures - Well Crafted movie - Hats off to Ang Lee - No Confusion from the Start to the End. If You know about cinema well or if you are a film maker you would notice many things in this movie which is just brilliant. Performance of Suraj Sharma (Pi) is was equally good with the Visuals. His body language towards the end was unbelievable. Special Effects of this movie is the Best of the lot. Some of the Scenes literally took my breath away. Richard Parker(Tiger) was terrific. Its introduction in the boat was the highlight of the movie. Undoubtedly My Favourite Character.It looked like a Real Tiger has shown its emotions throughout the movie. Great work by CG Life of Pie is an Honest Attempt and it is a World Class Cinema. Don't miss it !!! Happy To Share with You All !!!,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
I'd take the third story,"Life of Pi is ultimately a flawed film because the writing fails to involve the viewer enough in the story.It is a very enjoyable film but fails to be great. The reasons are related to the story and, since I prefer not to discuss specifics, I'll just say that the decisions made in presenting this story are awkward and lack the brilliance and daring required to make the viewer believe in and truly root for the central character (let alone believe in God). The over-reliance on visual style and beautiful photography means that, however hard everyone tries, the film grabs your attention but can't win your heart.The technical skill on display is brilliant, don't get me wrong, this is a good moment at the movies, just that, in the end, it rests on the surface of things much like the raft Pi himself floats on.There was possibly a beautiful love story or a brilliant fable somewhere to be polished enough until it shone through (Shyamalan would have brought it out for sure, shame he dropped out...) the skill would have been in finding the madness and the bravery in faith and giving the whole thing a profound meaning.The tiger is very cool... but it's still not quite enough. You can almost hear the Hollywood execs' pencils scribbling equations like: 'Titanic' meets 'I Bought a Zoo' meets 'Slumdog Millionaire' oh yeah and throw in some 'The Usual Suspects' for a adapted screenplay Oscar bid, oh yeah, and it's from a critically acclaimed bestseller, yippee! Add it all together and throw in some 3D and fluorescent glowing nature scenes to remind everyone of Avatar! 20th Century Fox have created a prestigious blockbuster fry-up screw story or character, or actually making a good film, that's why I hate those business school grads and their Venn diagrams and powerpoints!(sorry for the rant)If only those jerks died out and got replaced by real people we'd have even more good films to watch, oh yeah, and we'd need less advertizing, lobbying, brainwashing, propaganda... A miracle, then. We'd better all start believing in God, quick!Life of Pi, in conclusion, is not so great after all; that's why everybody is off to see The Hobbit!",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Best film of the year,"It is more that a survival story and it is not about friendship. This story is about faith. Director Ang Lee use all the tools he have to make this movie about a solitary young man not a boring one.Ang Lee did it, although painstakingly. I was amazing by the soul of the film, thru the eyes of the Bengal tiger (amazingly) and the maiden acting of 17-year-old non-professional actor.Each shot has been framed perfectly by the cinematographer, Claudio Miranda.Be it the early stuff in India or the breathtaking moments at sea, everything in this picture just lights up the screen.But the best part was the ending. No not that ending. the very last one !",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Finally a stereoscopic film actually worth watching in 3D!,"To tell the truth: I really hate stereoscopic 3D. Well that of course is very irrational. After all it is just another tool in the filmmaker's toolbox. So the reason why I do not like it has more to do with the fact that a lot of studio bosses and distributors try to tell me that in the future all films will be 3D and in seminars some Stereoscopic Supervisors never become tired to tell people, that now films are so much better just because they are in 3D now. So ever since Avatar I had to watch one 3D film after another and come out of the cinema with the impression that at best the stereoscopic effect did not harm the movie - although sometimes it did. But I hardly ever felt that the 3rd dimension supported the story telling in any way. So besides the fact that the distributor can charge extra on a ticket for a 3D movie and thus will get more money out of it why use it?And why watch it in 3D, you might ask. Today going to the cinema is like ordering a sandwich at Subway. You can choose between 2D and 3D, with intermission (if the film is longer) or without, original language with or without subtitles or the dubbed version, IMAX or non- IMAX and now Peter Jackson added another sauce to the menu: HFR or 24 frames per second. Call me old fashioned but when I was young filmmakers actually made decisions when choosing the right format for their story and did not leave the choice to the audience that naturally does not have a clue what's best for the film. So I always try to see the version that comes closest to the directions vision. But this is hard to decide especially when you see that films like the new ""Star Trek"" or ""Man of Steel"" are suddenly announced as a 3D feature but were originally shot on film in 35mm and IMAX format. Who has made the decision here? Did the director even know that his is going to be a 3D feature? And how I am supposed to know?So this time having been so disappointed by watching the 3D Hobbit just a week before I tried to be clever and picked the cheaper 2D version of Ang Lee's ""Life of Pi"" and I immediately realized that this might have been a mistake. Even by staring at the 2D images of this great movie I could imagine that here is the film I have been waiting for ever since the whole 3D hype broke loose. So I went to see the film again the next day, this time in 3D and I got to say words that I never thought would come out of my moth: ""You really have to see this movie in 3D!""Here finally is a director for whom stereoscopic filmmaking is not just another technical gag to make more money or to hide a 3rd rate screenplay behind it - excuse me, mister Cameron - but a filmmaker who really uses this technique to support the story and to make it an integral inseparable part of his movie like sound or color. Ang Lee constantly plays with the stereoscopic effect for example when he dives into a comic book illustration of the universe in the mouth of the goddess Shiva and thus illustrates the transcendental experience the protagonist has by reading this comic book. You really feel it. In another scene he morphs form 3d to 2d. The flying fish sequence is actually one of the most stunning 3D scenes I have ever seen. You actually start to worry about having a fish on your lap. But Ang Lee never uses 3D in these scenes just as an effect. It always supports the story and it does not only enhance the emotions but it really becomes an important part of the development of the protagonist's character. A reason why this works so well in ""Life of Pi"" is that in this film more than in most other films the story, the emotions and the inner struggle of the protagonist is reflected in the scenery and the setting.In interesting point is also that if you watch closely or check out the technical date here in IMDb, you will see that Ang Lee constantly changes the aspect ratio of the film depending on the scene. This shows how much aware he is of the importance of the format he uses.Of all the stereoscopic films that came out recently for me there are probably 3 modern films that are really worth watching in 3D, there is ""Hugo"", ""Pina"" and now on the top of the list Ang Lee's ""Life of Pi"". So what can we learn from this: Cinema of the future will be 3D after all if we only follow Ang Lee's lead? Definitely not! But if a filmmaker chooses a format for his film, he has got to make sure that it is the right one and that he really means it. A movie is not a Subway- sandwich after all.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Visually Pleasing Experience!,"I watched this movie in Lucknow, Wave cinema at 10 40 PM show.It was 3D show and was priced at 150 , I would say it was my highest ROI film ever watched .And it was one of the most beautifully picturesqueness movie I have ever Seen.The movie was in 3D, the scenes were awesome, an angle of emotion,philosophy I would say it is must watch movie for everyone.It will lead to into entirely different world altogether.I am giving 8 , not 10 on 10 it lost somewhere, where in the end it doesn't do justice to the overall film.And somewhere in the film also the speed is lost somewhere.Otherwise some of the scenes are just out of the world. And it can show you real power of 3D cinemas in near future.I would say this is another landmark movie after Avatar for 3D cinema, though I haven't seen Avatar in 3D.So guys Don't miss this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"great special effects, but felt cheated by the ending","I thought this movie was OK. The special effects were great. All the zoo animals and then the tiger in the boat, and all the meercats, all of it looked so real. And it is hard to tell a story about a guy stranded on a boat, but the story had enough to be entertaining. I was hoping the tiger would be more grateful at the end. I liked all the shots of underwater from under the boat, with the fish and all. And the ship sinking had good effects too.What I didn't like is at the end when Pi has to tell his story to the insurance people and he has to tell a different version minus the animals. It's basically saying everything you watched was a lie. I felt cheated.FINAL VERDICT: Worth seeing for the visuals.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Life of Pi is Fun,"Life of Pi is one of those films that you would think about leaving the theater and would stick with you for a long while. It has a lasting appeal, and a great ending that is not often seen in films these days as most film endings suck.It didn't start out strong though as we follow an older Pi telling his story to a journalist. He covers the younger years of his life, and if anyone has ever seen The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, you will know that his earlier years is fairly boring. We discover why his name is Pi, and its from a swimming pool. Okay. It isn't until he gets older where we finally see him on that boat and that big tidal wave hits, and the imagery is astounding. Pi is thrust into a lifeboat and this is really where our movie begins. Pi is trapped on a boat with animals: a zebra, an orangutan, a hyena, and a fierce tiger. In fact, most of the movie is spent with Pi surviving hunger and not being eaten by this tiger in the middle of the ocean. What a great concept! It's also narrated by Pi, and its fantastic!If there is one complaint that I think most people would agree on is the use of very heavy CG. You can almost say there is too much CG and what is some beautiful cinematography. The tiger especially as it looks very good, but at times you can tell it was CG. You would notice this on a scene on a beach where the tiger is walking. The movement seems a little off and it ruins some of the realism on what could have been a very emotional scene.I can't recommend Life of Pi enough though. There's so many things I could say about it and it is a fantastic journey that if I saw it as a kid, it would be one of those movies I look back on and love even just for nostalgia sake. I'm seeing it again with my mom. This is one journey I think everyone should experience!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
How to turn a Classic to an Over-rated Visual-heavy flick!,"Life Of Pi, directed by Ang Lee, adapted from Yann Martel's Booker prize winning novel of the same name seems to be the talk of the town now. From the moment I'd seen the previews, I was not so sure I wanted to go for this one. This would just be another Avatar-clone cashing in on the 3D and 'jaw dropping visuals' and nothing else. And I was correct.Going with the 'monotonously obvious choice' for a cast when it comes to a Hollywood movies, Ang Lee went with AAA Indian actors like Irfan Khan and Tabu. I am not saying its a bad choice but weren't there any other Indian actors who could replace Irfan Khan/Tabu? The most interesting portions of the movie is with the boy, the tiger and the ocean and thus Life Of Pi could be watched for its powerful singular performance of débutant Suraj Sharma taking the whole show on his shoulders. The completely CG Tiger (I still have suspicions that almost all of 100 minutes of it is CG) is a work of marvel indeed. Gollum was the last one I was impressed with and although 'Richard Parker' wasn't as impressive as Gollum, it did manage to convince me and question me whether it was a real tiger or not. Add to that a remarkable score by Mychael Danna, Life of Pi does incredible wonders to both your sensesthough but it still seldom manages to touch your heart.I wouldn't be surprised if 'Life Of Pi' ends up in the Oscar buzz or even winning one just like the way the very-over-rated 'Slumdog Millionaire' had done. I never thought 'Slumdog Millionaire' deserved an Academy Award.its a technically sound, well adapted, well directed entertainer and there's nothing else to it. Likewise 'Life Of Pi' is a visually extravagant, well made piece of adapted material. Some books are so good they are called something: A Classic and movies adapted from them, no matter how well they are made, wont be called the same. 'Life Of Pi' might stay with us till the Academy Awards or until all these dust of visual gimmicks settles down, after that I am sure not many people would even remember it. Nonetheless do watch it and take your kids along with you, they wouldn't care all the philosophical and spiritual babble and chances are that they'd end up loving it more than you.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Stunning Visual Portrayal of A Spiritual Journey,"Thiz is a simple movie with stunning visual portrayal of a spiritual journey. It starts like Tim Burton's ""Big Fish"" (2003) where everything is odd and magical, steps like Danny Boyle's ""Slumdog Millionaire"" (2008) with its compelling flashback in storytelling and it feels like Tom Hank's ""Cast Away"" (2000), only thiz time the survivor is not accompanied by Wilson the volleyball, but with something called Richard Parker. It is a courageous adventure story about a young boy named Piscine (Suraj Sharma), who unfortunately lost all his family in sinking ship. His survival effort along with all the animals, especially with a ferocious Bengal tiger, brings him to an understanding of life as a whole. The newcomer Suraj Sharma delivers a sufficient performance to describe a boy who has to survive nature. Adil Hussain and Tabu make brief but memorable appearances as Pi's father and mother. On the other hand, I think that Irrfan Khan could have been better as Adult Pi. His central role as the storyteller is just enough, not extraordinary, not even close, compared to Gloria Stuart as Old Rose in ""Titanic"" (1997). Ang Lee who is formerly known as the Director of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" (2000), ""Hulk"" (2003) and the controversial drama ""Brokeback Mountain"" (2005), wrapping thiz movie with astonishing visual treat. ""The Storm Scene"" is one of the remarkable moments in thiz movie. I bet you won't get thiz experience before in any other movies. Thiz is something that you have never seen before, followed by other scenes like ""The Giant Whale Scene"", ""The Flying Fish Scene"" and my favorite ""The Exotic Meerkat Island"". I think thiz movie has lots of powerful philosophies all over the place. It's like metaphor in metaphor, there comes a point in everyone's life, thiz will be something that needs to be thought about. It's emotionally gratifying. Actually, the movie is not just about survival, it's not even about the sinking ship, and it's definitely not about the tiger. It's simply about your relationship with God. In the end, we know very well. In every spiritual journey, your greatest enemy is none other than yourself.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Ang Lee shows us how 3D can be used effectively,"¨All of life is an act of letting go but what hurts the most is not taking a moment to say goodbye.¨This film reminded me of why I love movies so much. Even though it is very hard to come across these gems nowadays, once you finally discover one you completely fall in love with it and are reminded why you fell in love with movies in the first place: it is just such a magical and emotional experience. Life of Pi is among the 3 best films of 2012 and despite my dislike towards 3D movies in general, I loved its use here. The art direction, visual effects, and cinematography were astonishing; it was one of the most beautiful films I've seen. This is a film you will want to see in 3D and enjoy the experience as much as possible because in my opinion this is the best use in 3D that I've seen. Life of Pi is based on the successful novel written by Yann Martel which many considered impossible to adapt to the big screen, but Ang Lee found a way to do it yet again. Lee amazed me in 2000 with his wonderful Chinese film, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. He has always been a magician artistically speaking. He also did a wonderful job with the storytelling and cinematography in Brokeback Mountain, but in Life of Pi he directs his best and most complete film to date. I left the theater totally satisfied and amazed with the wonderful visual experience. I also enjoyed the performances and the storytelling; so I have nothing really negative to critique about Lee's work here. I also love climatic twist endings and this film has one of the best I've seen since The Sixth Sense. This is a masterpiece and a must see movie for all.A writer (Rafe Spall) has been sent by an acquaintance to visit a man named Pi Patel (Irrfan Khan) who has a story to tell him that will make him believe in God. Pi receives the writer kindly and while he cooks for the man he begins to narrate his story. The writer is curious to find out what Pi has to tell him and he patiently listens to him as he narrates his story from the very beginning. He explains how he got his name, what his family was doing in India at the time, and so on. Of course none of this is really what the writer is expecting to hear until Pi gets to the heart of the story. He explains that his family owned a zoo and that his father suddenly decided to move them all to Canada. While they are all (including the animals) on their way to Canada on a carrier ship a heavy storm intercepts them and the ship sinks. Pi (the younger version played by Suraj Sharma) manages to survive along with a couple animals: an orangutan, a zebra, a hyena, and a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. Pi struggles to survive along with the animals in the small lifeboat in middle of the Pacific Ocean as he encounters many obstacles that will test his faith. The film is told in a similar fashion to Slumdog Millionaire (through flashbacks which happen to be longer than the present scenes) as we have the narrator telling his incredible story to the writer.Suraj Sharma is really great here as the main character. Incredibly he has had no prior experience as a film actor, but he singlehandedly delivers this movie considering he is in the boat almost the entire time on his own (the animals were added mostly through CGI). A lot of credit has to be given to the visual effects department considering the animals look so real and believable. This film is really beautiful to watch, everything about it is just wonderful, including the powerful climatic ending which had a great message. I thought the film worked as sort of a parable more than an actual metaphor. I haven't read the novel, but I really can't see how it can be better than the film. Lee's imagination works better than mine, and he has created a wonderful film with many memorable scenes that will stick with me forever. The film touches lightly on themes of religion and faith, but at the end it will make you think about it. Everyone can make their own conclusions as to what story they want to believe, but it was pretty clear for me as to where the director was trying to get as to how he viewed God. The less you know about the film before going into it, the better. The film does start a bit slow, but it was a nice setup in my opinion with some beautiful cinematography, and it just picks up from there.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

In whole movie hero try to survive in the sea with tiger all alone. Then there is strange island come with many meerkat nice to see that island totally special in this movie.

The tiger is impressive,"I enjoyed the movie, but a little like TED if you take the animal out of the movie it loses a little of its charm. The big downside as regards the Oscars is that there is actually very little acting involved - unless the tiger could be nominated. Lots of beautiful scenery but the relationship between the boy and the tiger just does not convince. The movie is in 3D so there are lots of scenes with the tiger coming towards the boy (you) but after a while that becomes a little repetitive - rather like the guy on the horse in The Virginian. The ending is disappointing. I am not sure there was a need to put things in black and white. I know that many people dsilike ambiguous endings but there really was no need to spoil the illusion. In summary, an enjoyable movie but far from a great one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Art at it's purest form,"Incredible !!!! I have never been to a movie that left me stunned at the end like Ang Lee's Life of Pi. I looked around and everybody in the theater was sitting in there seats, momentarily stunned, absorbing the wonder of the movie that we all just experienced, and when the Credits displayed on the screen the movie and Ang Lee received a warm applause, a scene I've never seen before. Everyone watched this movie thinks he simply understood it. they think the story is so simple that a young boy lost his mom and dad and his brothers and everyone who knows and everything he has. Then he continues on his journey alone with a TIGER in the middle of the ocean 227 days until he survives. REALLY? The story is more sophisticated than that ( I'll explain later..) The movie itself so outstanding, from the first minute to the end, its very entertaining, exhilarating, and heart-touching. The story-telling was great, the visual effects were perfect, the acting and directing was the best I've ever seen, Ang is really GENIUS, the way he simplifies the story (book) without loosing it's basic ideas was really a great film-making. the 3D was perfect (Watch only in 3D!!) Back to the story.. (I'll try not to spoil) - the scene that left me stunned is right at the end, when Pi Patel told the Japanese guys the other story, that scene helped me realize that there is something hidden in this movie.. something far more greater than that. After research i found that all the movie and the story is about symbolism, it's all about metaphors. these symbols sometimes brings historical stories like the name of the tiger Richard Parker, and sometimes even mathematically the story connects as well like the name of Pi (22/7 = 3.14) .. So who is Richard Parker?? who is the Orangutan? who is the Zebra ? What was the idea of the island ??!! why Richard Parker didn't look at Pi when they survived?? and many more symbols!!.. But more important than that was the faith, hope and other spiritual symbols. I won't go further in that to not spoil the movie! but when you watch the movie make sure to read about the hidden ideas to understand what Yann Martel- the writer of the novel- wanted to tell from this CLEVER story. That's why the novel Life of Pi won the Man Booker prize and that what makes it really a masterpiece and art at it's purest form.so in summary, I want to thank Yann Martel for the awesome novel and of course i want to thank Ang Lee for such a magnificent movie, waiting more creativity from you!If you haven't watch this movie yet, RUN to watch it in 3D before its gone and experience this journey on your own. because it's simply a MUST WATCH FILM!!.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
π,"The story revolves around a man named Pi (Piscine Molitor Patel), who lives in Canada and is sharing his story with a novelist of how he survived a shipwreck in which he lost his family when he was younger. He starts off by telling the novelist of how he received his real name and his nick name Pi. Gradually, he moves into detail of his family and his experience of vast religions he found and practiced. Then he announced the almost unbelievable story of being lost at sea for months at a time with Richard Parker, a tiger from his father's zoo. He explained the great ups and downs of their extraordinary friendship. Pi believed that Richard Parker was a true friend to him, until one day they washed up on shore and with no hesitation Richard Parker ran into the forest without glancing back. To know that his one and only friend at the time left without saying goodbye or any acknowledgment of his disappearance left Pi devastated.One of the major things that really grasped my attention throughout this whole movie is how director Ang Lee did such a wonderful job with the main character Pi. Throughout the whole movie we can feel his pain and sorrow just because he does such a terrific job on revealing his emotions. No matter what situation he was confronted with during the movie he always managed to pull through and overcome every obstacle. If a problem occurred he always handled it in a very nonfictional, believable way. The relationship between Pi and Richard Parker was very enjoyable as well as individual roles. Man and animal surviving together, grieving together, and working together is outstanding! Never have I seen such a remarkable outcome between animal and man. I would most definitely refer this movie to anyone; it is a must see of this century! The theme of this movie is that we never know what life will throw at us. We should never take anything for granted as well as never be afraid to experience new things. One of the worst feelings is not only letting people or things get away from us, but not having the opportunity or chance to say goodbye to them especially to those whom we love the most. What hurts the most is not appreciating all the little things that they have done and coming to a realization when it is too late. Last but not least, the most important message of the movie is no matter what life throws at us our faith must remain intact!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Colossal grace,"Everything I've seen in this movie is absolutely perfect. From the beginning to the end.

It reminds me of a Romanian dramatic parable, Iona, but instead of the character being eaten by multiple fishes, talking to himself and losing his inner soul, here we face the opposite, a young and brave boy who gets over any difficulty and who finds his true identity in life by overcoming forces that are not of his league.

"Visually stunning, lacking everywhere else","I wanted to write a review of this film soon after I watched it in theaters as I doubted if I would remember it in the future. Walking into the theater the poster outside read ""THE NEXT AVATAR, LIFE OF PI"". Not being a fan of Avatar I wasn't sure why the makers of this film would want to compare their work to it. The movie began with a long, dragging opening sequence containing various animals and sights in India and it really set the pace for the rest of the movie. The acting was excellent but I really never ""beleived"" the movie. From the cheesy flashback sequences, awkward moments between the writer and the main characters older self and the entire middle of the movie stranded at sea sequence which seemed to last hours on end. A mash up of Titanic, Cast Away, The Jungle Book and Avatar made me think more of those movies that the actual one I was watching.

The director has added another feather to his cap of great cinematic achievements. Beautiful scenery and vivid colors, makes you marvel at the wonders of nature, some fantastic ocean storm waves, showing just how big and powerful the ocean really is. But let's not forget this is a fictional movie, and like the Superman or The Hulk etc etc, movies, it's very believable and engaging. In a broad sense, it's also a treatise about mans faith and belief in religion and a God, a personal vs an Abstract God, told allegorically; a boy on a life boat with some other survivors, depicted as wild animals, and towards the end of the movie alluded to be humans (and more specifically inhumane humans), all vieing for survival. It's left up to the viewer to choose which story-line they prefer to believe in: and the analogy to which religion/God they prefer to believe in. So if you can come way from a Superman or Batman movie without it challenging your faith and belief in the real world around you, this movie should be approached in the same way, with the added bonus, that you might view your relationship with reality and religion afresh.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

3D does it justice,"I don't know if it is fair to compare to the book? If not comparing to the book, I would give it eight stars (8********)!

Wildly over-rated religious claptrap,"This film is a must-watch only for its 3D imagery which is quite extraordinary. If you are a religious type you may enjoy it for more than that because the film-makers' target audience is the emotional believers. If you are a rational atheist kind there is little for you to connect except perhaps briefly in the beginning, when Pi gets to learn about the nature of the beast, and towards the end, when he has to recount the story to the wrecked ship's insurers. Indeed, I could not help but conclude that we just took a journey through the delusional mind of a hungry and thirsty castaway. Did someone just say that the origins of all gods, spirits and other affiliated ethereal 'entities' is in the hallucinating minds of our wandering hungry and thirsty ancestors? I believe Ang Lee just did, though I can't be sure whether this is one of the interpretations that he deliberately set out to convey. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

There were so many elements introduced that could have played out as being relevant to the story, but in the end didn't connect together at all. We learn how Pi got his name. That is amusing, but so what? He could have been named Paul or Peter. Being named Pi had nothing to do with the story, and so was a waste of screen time. Similarly, other elements introduced early on carried no meaning in the story. The book was the same way. It's like the author ""felt"" there had to be some meaning there, and so he threw a spaghetti mess of ideas on the wall, hoping some strands would stick. Shoddy story telling.

"A mess of a narrative, but a beauty of visual art.","Often considered a book to be ultimately unfilmable, Ang Lee faced a struggle in adapting Life of Pi. Was he successful? Well, anyway, the movie follows young Pi Patel, the lone survivor of a ship sinking, trapped for a long time on a lifeboat with a Bengal Tiger as his companion. The film highlights some weighty and thought provoking issues of faith and religion, taking a bold road rarely seen in family films. It does sound like something that would work well in the script's favor, but then I have to back up and remind myself that the narrative is uneven, diminishing the emotional impact that should be felt, and the narration and present day sequences overstay their welcome.To be fair, for a movie that spends half the time on a boat with only a young boy and tiger on screen, Life of Pi is still a decent movie to watch. No one can accuse Ang Lee of not knowing what he wanted this film to be, for his direction is the movie's strongest point. Lee is the proper example of a director fully confidant and in control of his own vision, so I do respect the film more than I actually liked it. If nothing else, we can all marvel at the visual aspects, which are quite enchanting, if at times a wee bit too obvious.*** / *****",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The Life of Pi - Imagery Deluxe,"The very stylish film, The Life of Pi, is one of the finest modern Indian films ever made. It does not rely on silly Bollywood song and dance numbers, nor does it try to portray neorealism in the lives of common Indians (as did the master director, Satrijat Ray). It is a stand-alone film about the fantasies of a young man and his tiger; that's right, every boy should have a pet tiger. This is as different a story as you will ever see on film.

Have to admit I was a little bored,"When I saw the trailer for Life of Pi, it really sparked no interest in me. I have never really been a fan of Robinson Crusoe stories and I didn't think the presence of a tiger would make much of a difference. But then the movie received 11 Oscar nominations, and I thought maybe I had shortchanged this film. I'm glad that I saw it, but my initial instinct was correct: Life of Pi just isn't for me.I will start with what I liked about the movie: the visuals. Just about everybody agrees that Life of Pi is the visual masterpiece of the year, arguably a greater contribution to 3d than Avatar. The digital creation of the tiger, named Richard Parker, is one of the most realistic examples of CGI in recent memory. The way the clouds are reflected in the water and the psychedelic images that Pi sees on his journey are the most amazing things you'll see this year.For anyone who might not know, Life of Pi is about an Indian teenager's (Gandhi, not Sitting Bull) harrowing spiritual journey as he is stranded on a boat for over two hundred days with only a Bengal Tiger for a companion. This story is partially narrated by Pi as an adult, who is visited by an author with writer's block. The author was told that Pi's story can make him believe in God. The problem is the author is the most boring character you'll ever meet and the constant transitions back to the older Pi are intrusive.Overall though, Life of Pi gets off promising start despite the poor framing device. Pi is raised by an atheistic father who owns a zoo, so understandably he becomes enamored with animals and religion. Pi is raised Hindu, but he soon becomes interested in Christianity and Islam and converts to both faiths. I thought this was an interesting point in the film- why couldn't somebody follow all three religions? When Pi's family comes upon rough economic times they are forced to move their zoo to Canada. Their freighter encounters a vicious storm in what is the most visually impressive experience in the movie. Pi evacuates on a life boat with a wounded zebra, but after the storm passes he discovers an orangutan and a hyena. Somehow, the tiger hides under a canvas on the boat for two days, but whatever. Pi must learn how to hold the tiger at bay while surviving at sea.This is where Life of Pi started to lose me. No matter how hard I try, I just can't seem to focus on survivor stories. There might be something more than my bias against these types of stories though. There is something about Ang Lee's directing style that reminds me of still water- it just doesn't excite me. I admit it's not fair to categorize this film just as a survivor story because it deals with the testing of faith during a crisis. But the religious themes just felt pedestrian to me. For me, this film's saving grace was the 3d, which is unusual because I usually think that 3d is a waste of time.The most controversial aspect of the film was the ending. Without giving away too much, Pi reveals an entirely different version of his survival story and the audience is forced to choose which one to believe. I like the idea of being able to interpret the events of this movie in more than one way, but I didn't like the way it was executed in the story. It would have been much more effective to hint at the alternate survival story during the movie rather than just lay it all out at the end. I find myself strangely indifferent to the plot twist. I don't think it's particularly clever or ""deep.""Nevertheless, this film has a real chance at winning the Oscar for Best Director because they snubbed Ang Lee for Brokeback Mountain. It will certainly win a lot of technical awards, and deservedly so. Overall, Life of Pi is not a bad movie, but it never really excited me as much as it should have, nor did I find it particularly thought provoking.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

There are only two notable actors throughout the film and that is Suraj Sharma and Irrfan Khan. They both do a great job. I do not intend to sound racist, but the accents used throughout the film get horribly annoying after the first half hour.The pacing is very slow.

It'd perhaps looked better on 3D than 2D,"(2012) Life Of Pi
FANTASY ADVENTURE DRAMAI just want to point out that I'm reviewing this in ""2D"" since that was how I saw it- not as how it's intended to be seen which is in 3D. I feel that the amazing 3D visuals can sometimes detract viewers from the initial story line, since it is after all based on a novel written by Yann Martel. It is called ""The Life Of Pi"" because it is about how this particular East Indian person got this unusual name in the first place, and the adventure he had to endure that went along with it. 'Pi' at first started as an embarrassing name for him which was short from ""Piscine"", but was pronounced as ""Pissing"" which his father named him because he used to love swimming in radiant swimming pools, and one of those pools happens to be his favorite called the 'Piscine Molitor' resulting his son's full name to be 'Pisicine Molitor Patel'. Piscine then managed to convince his fellow peers to call him 'Pi' after memorizing many numbers before 3.14. And it was about this time his real adventure begins involving being stranded on a small boat with a Bengal tiger whom he calls Richard Parker, since his parents owned some of the animals from the zoo where his parents were renting the property from. All I can say is that the viewing experience would have been better had it been seen on 3D than on 2D as a considerable amount of the sequences are quite visionary. Some of the little things baffled me, such as if Pi initially didn't want the tiger or the hyena for that matter to tag along with him, he did have the opportunity to hit these aggressive animals with his paddle back into the water. Movie doesn't really amount to anything except to witness an artificial somewhat spiritual journey.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Absolute Masterpiece!,"One of the best movies you can see in your life. I have seen this multiple times and it continues to impress me still. The connection between man and animal has been shown beautifully. It also proves that animals also do have soul and they are not mere creatures.Ang Lee's film adaptation of Yann Martel's novel Life of Pi is a stunning cinematic achievement that blends breathtaking visuals with profound storytelling. The movie captures the essence of the book while bringing its fantastical elements vividly to life on screen.Strengths1. Visual Masterpiece: The film is a feast for the eyes. Cinematographer Claudio Miranda's use of vibrant colors and CGI creates mesmerizing imagery, from the glowing jellyfish to the stormy seas. The scenes of Pi's lifeboat floating on a glass-like ocean, blending reality and surrealism, are unforgettable.2. Strong Performances: Suraj Sharma, as the teenage Pi, delivers a heartfelt performance, especially impressive considering much of his acting involved interacting with a CGI tiger. His portrayal of fear, hope, and resilience feels genuine and compelling.3. Adaptation of Key Themes: The movie stays true to the book's central themes of survival, faith, and storytelling. The dual ending, which presents both the fantastical and the grimly realistic versions of Pi's journey, is handled with care and leaves viewers pondering the power of belief.4. Musical Score: Mychael Danna's hauntingly beautiful score complements the film's tone, enhancing the emotional depth of the story.Criticisms1. Condensed Narrative: Some of the book's deeper philosophical musings and character backstories are shortened or omitted to fit the film's runtime. While this keeps the movie engaging, fans of the novel might miss these elements.2. Dependence on CGI: While the CGI is remarkable, it occasionally feels overwhelming, making some scenes seem less grounded. For example, Richard Parker's animation is impressive but can sometimes pull viewers out of the story.3. Pacing: Like the book, the initial portion of the movie, which explores Pi's upbringing and spiritual journey, may feel slow to some viewers compared to the intense survival sequences.Life of Pi is an extraordinary cinematic experience that captures the heart of the novel while elevating its visual and emotional impact.

A good adaptation,"A teenage boy survives a shipwreck travelling from India to Canada. As various zoo animals on board also survive the shipwreck, his life is endangered further.The film is based on the superb novel by Yann Martel. The film-makers did a fine job in adapting the novel but perhaps missed a chance to add their own flair to the story. The director is Ang Lee, one of the best directors overall of the past two decades (Brokeback Mountain; Sense and Sensibility; Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon; The Wedding Banquet; The Ice Storm). Lee's special flair is less evident here than in the aforementioned films though the task of adapting such an unusual story was probably challenging enough - especially with the superb special effects used to create animals.An exceptional scene, however, occurs near the beginning of the film when the boy and his brother anticipate the entrance of a tiger in an L-shaped cage in their family's zoo.

"Optically brilliant, powerful and satisfying 3D adventure","""Life of Pi"" for sure ranks among Ang Lee's best works (next to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, one could say). It tells an incredible story of survival, hope, and friendship. It may start off as a biopic, but this is not exactly the way its crafted. This film is a breathtaking technical triumph, anchored by the eye-catching cinematography, which makes it a visual treat for viewers, but the enormous scope of this movie goes beyond this aspect: it contemplates (and makes the audience do so, as well) over themes of religion, beliefs and how important is to dispute them and not accepting them without processing them. Another subject matter tackled is that of unexpected bonds which can be forged under the most adverse circumstances, and that communication in order to achieve this forging is worth it, no matter how impossible it may seem at the beginning. The importance of expressing love, gratitude, longing and even pain is also highlighted. The power of faith, even in the verge of despair and death, and the fact that it can help people who believe retain their hope is emphasized, as well. One more virtue of this movie is its emotional storytelling, which makes the story more impactful and realistic, and its incredibility adds more to the story's charm, as well as how polarising are the two stories presented near the end. The musical score matches perfectly every scene. Suraj Sharma delivers a standout performance as the main character who strives to keep himself alive, Irrfan Khan is also great as the mature, adult Pi, and the cast who portrays Pi's family does a similarly good job. This movie undeniably deserved the four Academy Awards it won (for Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Original Score and Best Visual Effects). In general, this motion picture is a beautiful, intense, gripping, immersive and touching cinematic experience, which blends its optical spectacle with an emotionally rewarding conclusion.

A Fantasy the may become a Classic,"The word was this book was unfilmable. After finally watching this movie, having not read the book, I can certainly see why. Most of the cast members are animals, who must look and for the most part act like animals. Although you can train some animals, to get them to act on cue is not easy. While watching this movie the pacing was impeccable, meaning the actions of the animals were not reasonable for actual live animals. There are scenes where a human and 2 animals are interacting on a boat. There is no hesitation, the animals appear to hit their marks perfectly, and the three characters create drama nonetheless.To accomplish this feat, you cannot possibly work with live animals. That meant the animals I was watching on the screen I know were CGI. But save for a couple places, perhaps mostly with the hyena, the effects were undetectable. I have never seen any existing animals (dinosaurs and fictional Avatar beasts not included) rendered by CGI that looked real. I think of the digital wolves in ""The Day After Tomorrow"", or the beings in ""I am Legend"". Then I realised that Ang Lee went through great efforts many years ago for ""Hulk"" to get more natural movements from the CGI models. Even though that film was a flop, his expertise in working with these effects benefited the making of ""Life of Pi"". With so much at stake at these effects being believable, I am utterly amazed that this film was greenlit. It is such an achievement, there is no doubt that it deserved Academy Awards for effects, cinematography, and direction. The look throughout the film (except for a couple shots near the end) when the tale is being told, has a vivid other-world look to it. Most notable are the effects with water. Although the splashes and waves come off as real (which is probably one of the most difficult effects to produce), the photogenic quality of animals water was surreal in the clarity. And the variety of animals - whales, sharks, flying fish, along with the magnificent looking tiger, were impressive.Aside from the technical achievement, the story is a fresh entry in the big budget film world. With no stars, and offbeat story of a boy whose father owns a zoo, plays as a series of anecdotes. Only after we are on a ship with the boy and the animals, does the main story of being stranded on a lifeboat play it's way through. Another aspect to the story, perhaps thought unfilmable for the sake of extended interest, were the many days that pass on the lifeboat adrift at sea.Ang Lee solved this by making the look and feel of every scene seem magical. Such as the boy learning to fish. The camera travels underwater, overhead, and everywhere else. There never is a dull shot. There were some obvious 3D motivated shots, and I believe the film could have benefited from a 3D showing, although I did not see it in the theatre.This is Ang Lee's best film, and I predict that this film will be considered a classic in the years to come.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Faith,"This movie urges the audience to complete self-knowledge, and also pushes religion and belief to each audience. Almost everyone in the film is depressed. But everyone has faith in their hearts. People with faith know that all the hardships are tested by perseverance in faith, and it ie faith that guides them towards a bright world.

Cinema and metaphor,"'Life of Pi' tells an amazing story of a boy who survives a shipwreck after being marooned on a raft with a tiger for company. With what is either remarkable computer graphics or a remarkable feat of animal training, the film version of Yann Martel's novel is certainly an entertaining watch, even if the tale seems unbelievable. The conclusion invites us to conceive of the story not as literal truth, but as metaphor, for events perhaps too bleak to remember without disguise. Although I haven't read the book, my guess is that the reader's shifting understanding of the narrative is crucial: the film struggles a bit, if only because film always struggles with imaginative metaphor, rendering everything with concrete reality. Film has the power to show us impossible things as fact; it's thus a tricky medium when the point of the story is, in part, that impossible things are indeed impossible. So I enjoyed the movie; but I wonder if the book might not have better handled the uncertain nature of its truth.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Your choice.,"We doubt all the goodness and refuse to recognize the cruelty of reality.
Therefore, people with faith and tigers are easier to be happy than us.Frankly speaking, until PI started telling the second story, my movie watching mood has been declining. If I have any dissatisfaction with the whole movie, it is the popular story ""The Adventure of Me and Tiger at Sea"", which is somewhat loose and Insignificant, highly respected 3D impact, the effect is fully within expectations. After watching the full movie, I have been wondering how if Quentin came to shoot this story, how would I shoot the escape from the sea, I am afraid there will be more flying paragraphs such as whipping tigers and fishing with tigers. However, since in addition to the function of pleasing ordinary viewers, the more tasks of Maritime Adventures are to show the director's aesthetic pursuit, it can only be lamented that Li An's dream is too restrained, too clever, and full of Eastern style of tranquility.When PI slowly tells the story of the second kitchen version of the sea escape, it seems to me that it is a bit of a nightmare awakened from a deep sleep. At this time, you only find the foreshadowing before, all Not idle writing. Wang Baijie, who eats gravy, Depatillo, who does not respect faith, and the godly and tolerant PI mother, come into the seat one after another with the zebra and the orangutan after boarding the ship. The cruelest cruelty is that you rely on your imagination to regroup one by one and restore it to yourself. This is much smarter than the way some movies cry and spit blood on dogs.In addition to the simplest character correspondence restoration, looking back carefully, ""PI"" is really careful in the text. For example, before the lifeboat fell to the sea, Wang Baijie shouted: ""Zebra, zebra"", in fact, he is the zebra. There is also a sentence that asked the orangutan, ""Your child?"" For example, that cannibal island, ""exactly"" is the shape of a person. Another example is when introducing the three kinds of Hindu Buddha, when talking about the three-faced Buddha flowing on the river, everything in the world is just his dream. There is really no better explanation of how PI built the first story. Everyone is his own god, you can't dominate the present, but you dominate the memory of the past and the fantasy of the future.When both stories are in front of you, it is time to choose to come.The Japanese refused to believe in the dreams of fairy tales, but they were even more reluctant to believe in the cruelty of reality, and after hesitating for a while, the reporter chose the first dream story, ""You Follow God"", PI's answer gave a The answer is ambiguous and clear.I chose the second story without hesitation.The Bengal Tiger in the first story, an easy interpretation is the other side of PI itself, but it is probably too sloppy to explain it with animal nature. PI's father gave an explanation-and you don't have feelings, and you learn from his I can only see my reflection in my eyes. So the Drift on the Sea tells the story of multi-religious believers and vegetarians-PI getting along with themselves. PI has experienced the process of fear, symbiosis, domestication, and dependence on tigers. This process is also about the balance between human nature and reason. In the end, the tiger's head didn't go back to the jungle-""Life just keeps laying down, but sadly, I haven't had time to say goodbye to you.""-When people walk into the social jungle, why not forget it Looking back?I am curious, what is Li An's choice?As far as I understand it, I think tiger is the embodiment of fear. This fear comes from the awe of nature, the challenge of survival, and the inner loneliness that results from it. These fears of human beings may be enduring and desperate. The choice of adult PI is probably Li An's choice-experience him, face him, accept him.The middle part of the film is all alone, but at the beginning and end of the film, PI has two things to accompany in his life-family and religion. Family and religion are the best ways for people to escape fear. Religion provides a conjecture to explain the world. For individuals, he is always a comfort for us to face the unknown. The family makes us feel responsible, connected, and contributing to this world, which proves the value of our existence. These two aspects gave us the courage to face ourselves in terms of being born and joining the world.When you understand that life and ego are not used for victory, but for getting along, you will understand that although some things are not reasonable, you must believe that some things are not strong, but you must rely on them. This is not the choice in Ang Lee's movies. This is probably the first choice in Li An's life in the world.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

"""TIGER, tiger, burning bright"" - William Blake. 1757-1827","Ang Lee's ""Life of Pi"" is strikingly beautiful in many ways, from great cinematography to the story being portrayed.

Because of business concerns his father packs up the zoo animals on a freighter setting out for Canada. Due to a mishap Pi no longer has to speculate but actually lives ""life the universe and everything.""

The story though felt a little heavy on a kind of 'mysticism' and particularly the portions of the film not on the boat as we're seeing the storyteller speak seemed to be trying too hard to create/convey some grand, super-enlightened message/story.

A fantastic voyage,"The little I knew about Life of Pi before seeing it - a young Indian man is stranded on a lifeboat with a tiger - couldn't in any way prepare me for what I was about to see. The truly amazing thing is that that's pretty much all there is to it. Ang Lee weaves an incredible amount of emotion and depth into a very minimalistic, poetic story, and for that reason Life of Pi may be the most impressive cinematic achievement of the year - it's true cinema, a film that doesn't rely on a complex plot, shocking twists or tons of characters, but simply on coherent, free-flowing storytelling, beautiful images and utter precision. There's not a wasted minute or an unnecessary shot - the special effects are impressive but always subtle enough to leave center stage for the story. The film is incredibly easy to get into, it's constantly interesting, it's simple yet deep, and it leaves a lasting impression and plenty of room for debate - really, what more can you want from a film?Ang Lee is proving time after time that while he hasn't become a brand name like Spielberg and Tarantino, he's one of the most fascinating directors working today, mainly because he doesn't make the same film twice; Life of Pi is a perfect example to use when demonstrating how important a director is, and how much a good director can do with a very lean and (on the surface) plain script. Lee always had an eye for beautiful imagery, though, and Claudio Miranda's cinematography in Life of Pi makes for some of the most beautiful yet; not only the bulk of the film that takes place in the middle of the ocean and is dominated by CGI, but also the live action segments, especially the first thirty minutes. The opening sequence in particular is one of the most gorgeous I've seen in years, and while watching it in 3D makes the immersion a bit quicker, it's by no means essential and it's impossible to not get lost in the film, no matter how you watch it.A quick word on religion: I've heard about some people who avoid Life of Pi because, as atheists, they reject the religious undertones. I'm a devout atheist myself, and enjoyed it immensely, and I encourage other atheists to watch it too. The film has a spiritual undertone, yes, but it doesn't force salvation down the viewer's throat like some other films. In fact, I don't recall seeing another film that made me feel so sympathetic towards believers; it portrays religion in an ambivalent, affectionate yet critical way, and it leaves quite a lot up to the viewer's interpretation. It also makes a point of showing that, while religion has its purposes and can be of great help to people in tough situations, the division and hate between believers in different brands of religion is the thing that messes everything up, which is a message that I, as an atheist, related to. All religion, Life of Pi says, is pretty much the same - it's a way of coloring reality, of making it easier to handle and seeing the beautiful side of it. Like stories, and like films. Life of Pi is an ode to storytellers, be they Pi, the originators of religion or Ang Lee itself, and it's one of the most beautiful pieces of storytelling you'll see.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Ang Lee continues to surprise,"I think it might be time to put to bed the idea of an 'unfilmable novel'. Particularly in recent cinema history, as Hollywood has increasingly relied on existing material for its output, so-called unfilmable books have yielded movies of varying quality. It's true that some (such as 2012's two-part adaptation of Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged, by all accounts a catastrophic failure) only bolster arguments favouring the concept, but let us not forget that Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness was long considered unfilmable before Francis Ford Coppola gave us Apocalypse Now, not to mention the certainly difficult but successful job Peter Jackson did with JRR Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy.Which brings us to Life of Pi, based on Yann Martel's introspective 2002 Man Booker Prize winning novel. A challenging story to bring to the screen to be sure, but under the expert hand of Ang Lee the film is yet one more example of how difficult material can be adapted given the right amount of time and care.Life of Pi is at its core a tale of survival against insurmountable odds, following the titular teenager's (Suraj Sharma) months spent adrift on a lifeboat after the sinking of a cargo ship transporting his family from India to Canada. A dwindling menagerie of animals from the family zoo are also along for the ride, including the fearsome Bengal tiger Richard Parker, representing those who managed to escape the ship and cling to Pi's tiny craft.Perhaps the difficulty of adapting the novel lay in keeping audience interest during long sequences involving little more than a boy and a tiger, and it's likely the film would have dragged were it not for the astonishing visual spectacle Lee brings to the screen. He takes full advantage of all technical wizardry available, balancing the ocean's serene beauty and unapologetic violence in just the right measure. Even the 3-D, something I personally am usually resistant to, never intrudes or calls attention to itself, but rather complements the oppressively flat horizon so much of the film plays out in front of. Life of Pi will undoubtedly be in the best visual effects conversation come awards season, with Richard Parker in particular standing out as one of the most impressive digital characters yet created.Exploring Life of Pi a little deeper, Lee develops strong thematic currents relating to storytelling and faith, and how the two are entwined. As a story about storytelling, the film works very well from the beginning, as the older Pi (played wonderfully by Irrfan Khan) relates his tale to a visiting writer (Rafe Spall). Yet it is also a story about faith, and here the waters get a little murkier. What Lee is trying to say about faith and religion is open to interpretation (and that's likely the point), but the film's one major shortcoming is a lack of satisfying answers regarding what is the most clearly defined aspect of Pi himself.The narrative seems to promote the importance of faith as a general concept, not tied to any specific religion, but more akin to a sharing of humanistic beliefs. It's not the specifics of faith's origins or even ultimate goals that matter, but rather how the beliefs are shared, adapted and passed on. Not the most conclusive analysis I know, but the links between faith and storytelling are there, and perhaps repeat viewings will offer up more answers.Despite the elusive nature of some of Life of Pi's subtext, it really is a film that deserves praise and attention. Never one to pigeonhole himself, Lee has crafted a thoughtful and moving fantasy that is beautiful to behold yet also offers much intellectual nourishment.tinribs27.wordpress.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
An incredible disappointment,"The first 5minutes of this Ang Lee creation are thoroughly absorbing as you are introduced to a sublime immersion in an incredibly well handled 3D film experience. The following 20mins offer an interestingly warm and humorous introduction to the childhood of the main character. However a raging cold tap is soon turned on as we are treated to a clichéd flashback/reminiscence scenario as 'Pi' relates his tale in an unconvincing manner to an unconvincing 'author' on various park benches and other random seated areas. Indeed Ang Lee suddenly and without explanation has them at the park after previously seeing them in an apartment eating lunch which is a very heavy handed and lazy attempt at creating a bit of narrative. That's by the by as the heart of the film is obviously the boat experience. It has it's moments, some are breathtaking but not nearly enough so to make up for a very very slowly progressing story that repeats mundane scenes with little variation and in the end despite the visuals becomes quite tiresome. The problem is it doesn't live up to the promise. Pi says he has a tale that will make you believe in God. He doesn't. He has a lost at see alone tale with and not much else. In fact just as you come to the conclusion (after endless attempts at forgiveness) that this film isn't deep, moving or at all inspired the story is turned on it's head in a confusing and upsetting way. The overall feeling is of betrayal. And the manipulative emotional music slapped over the monologue quickly becomes sickening. You are left with nothing except a desire to walk out of the cinema. No sympathy for anyone, no astonishment, no surprise...well that the film doesn't work on any level is quite surprising. Overall is very little here apart from stunning CGI. There are no revelations about the character, his experience or life in general.

The lifeboat scenes look great. Ang Lee has filmed the unfilmable. I do wish the island be more otherworldly to clue in the unrealism of the story. And the island had a more religious overtone in the book which is missing here.I also wish they filmed the real lifeboat with the people characters. A visual depiction would be much more dramatic.

Here the director wisely stops with the flashback narrative and focuses purely on young Pi and his adventure.For me the next 90 minutes of the movie was mesmerising as Pi wrestles with both the forces of nature and his own various faiths. Suraj Sharma who plays the lead then gives a fantastic performance alongside a convincing CGI tiger which taken literally is a wonderful story of courage and survival but also works on several deeper levels addressing the role of faith when applied to storytelling.The CGI in the this film is stunning - every frame is visually dazzling (the film rightly won several award including the directing oscar for Lee) and I can only imagine how it would have looked in 3D.As a family adventure film about a young boy lost at sea with a supporting cast of larger than life animals this film is unmissable but as a story about faith and its role in unbelievable narratives then this is essential viewing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Not a Special one,"This is the first movie that i watched in an IMAX theater, so was very much excited to watch. The Visual effects are really good but not great, animations are excellent!!. A great movie to watch with kids and family.The movie has a good start with a narration on the character - PI. The charm gradually fades till the visual and animation come into picture.Felt a bit weird to listen the conversations happening in the Indian style(No offense, I am Indian too).I feel normal English accent could have been more gripping.None of the characters are gripping enough except the character - Richard Parker.I wont tell who Richard Parker is, portrayal of this character is excellent. Ang Lee has focused more on visual effects and has digressed from the characterization of roles.Its worth watching once,its not a movie that you will remember for a long time.The movie will be in no picture when movies emphasizing on visual effects start to come(which is a trend happening now). If you are a classical movies lover, don't watch it with high expectation, you may be let down.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"'I suppose in the end, the whole of life becomes an act of letting go, but what always hurts the most is not taking a moment to say goodbye.'","As is obvious from the number of rave reviews this film LIFE OF PI was are sounding success in the theaters when it was shown in 3D. There is no question but that the story, so well known over the past decades since the publication of the book of the same name by Yann Martel, draws everybody in, whether because of the indomitable spirit of our surviving hero or the religious aspects of the story. Perhaps because of all the hoopla about director Ang Lee's manipulation of CGI effects and the endless interviews about the making of the film that make the final product (on DVD at least) seem so contrived and unreal that some viewers will find the end product less than satisfying a version of the novel. David Magee sculpted the screenplay from the novel and while that provides a lot of background about the character of Pi before the main event of the lost at see episode, it does seem disruptive at times and in this viewer's response robs the story form some of the poetry.The story has been summarized elsewhere as follows: 'In Canada, a writer visits the Indian storyteller Pi Patel and asks him to tell a story. Pi tells the story of his life since he was a kid in Pondicherry, India and the origin of his nickname. One day, his father who owns a zoo tells his family that his business is not good and he had decided to move to Canada and sell part of the animals in the United States. They travel in a Japanese cargo ship with the animals and out of the blue, there is a storm followed by a shipwrecking. Pi survives in a lifeboat with a zebra, a orangutan, a hyena and a male Bengal tiger called Richard Parker. They are adrift in the Pacific Ocean and when the tiger is hungry, he eats the other animals. Soon Pi learns that he might find a way to feed and domesticate the tiger to survive.The character of Pi Patel is played for the most part by Suraj Sharma while his earlier years embodiments are shared by Ayush Tandon and Gautam Belur and the adult storyteller by Irrfan Khan. Pi's parents are played by Adil Hussain and Gita Patel and his brother Ravi by, depending on age, Ayan Khan, Mohd Abbas Khaleeli, and Vibish Sivakumar, Rafe Spall is the writer who will create the book from Pi's story, and for a few brief moments Gérard Depardieu plays a Cook on the ship.There are some very beautiful scenes of skies and waterscapes, but we are left wondering how much of this is carton created in the large studio tank that serves as the ocean. Some of Martell's original explanation of the various religions Pi adheres to are retained: they were the best part of the novel. Perhaps in 3D this film would have worked better.Grady Harp",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
A compelling story. 85+%,"I can't say that I was very excited to see this movie but I thought I'd give it a shot and found it very rewarding. In fact, it has repeat viewing value, given the ending. What surprised me most, perhaps, was the wit and humour in the dialogue.Not having read the book on which it was based, I have nothing else to compare it to, and found the story worked well as a spectacle...of which there are many.Without giving too much away, the story concerns the life and adventures of Pi Patel. We see him as a small boy and as an adult recounting the adventure most of us would be familiar with via the commercials for this film...himself as a teenager (played well by Suraj Sharma) adrift at sea, with a wild tiger as both a constant threat to him yet a constant but uneasy companion. Most of the movie is set at sea and here the cinematography (which I saw in 3D) is absolutely magnificent. You really do feel a sense of the infinite as Pi drifts endlessly on an endless ocean. Even some of the urban settings in Pi's childhood do have a wonderful picture postcard quality to them.Another contender for most surprising aspect to this movie was the theme of religion. I just did not expect this to be part of this movie, for whatever reason. In a way the movie is about religion. Or stories. A story about stories, in other words. Some professional reviews do mention the issue of how to interpret the movie. Maybe it is a parable? Could it be like a dream, requiring Freud to make sense of it? In these interpretative strategies there is the problem of mapping one thing from the sea adventure to some other thing from Pi's ordinary life. And doing that to account for everything. The desire to do so is powerful but the adult Pi does comment near the end of the movie about the merits of this procedure.Some professional reviews I've seen criticise the narrative device of having an adult Pi interviewed by a writer. Since I don't know whether this was in the book or not, I can say that it wasn't so much of an issue for me. There was a concern before I saw this movie that it might come across like one of Kamahl's commercials for a certain brand of tea, but it worked well for me. The writer (played by Rafe Spall) functions as an 'everyman' asking the kind of questions the curious audience might want to ask. Being a literal minded person, I did really appreciate the writer's attempt to interpret Pi's sea adventure...it is that titbit of information which gives the movie repeat viewing value...I had expected to give this movie 80%, but it's this potential repeat viewing value which bumps my score up to 85+%.Special mention should be given to the special effects in this movie. It's great. Having this volatile mix of carnivores and herbivores on Pi's boat interact with each other in a believable way was admirably achieved. At times the tiger seemed to be a CGI creation, but maybe I was wrong on that? It's very rare that you think these special effects don't feel quite right.It was a surprise to me to see so many young children watching this movie at the cinema. Appropriately, perhaps, the animal life cycle was sanitised on the boat...there is no great gore to speak of, but there are some dark themes verbalised at the end of the movie, which makes me wonder how suitable it is for children. But that darkness houses felt pain, which was another rewarding aspect to this film. It has great humanity.Whilst a movie like ""Seven psychopaths"" is my pick as the most entertaining movie for the year, I don't think I would be allowed to pick that as my choice for best movie. ""Life of Pi"" seems a more intellectual choice to make and I do feel that an award for the best movie of the year would be well deserved, along with awards for cinematography. Ang Lee deserves a nomination for direction too. Suraj Sharma is also worthy of a nomination.This movie is a wonderful spectacle but the tale has hidden depth to it, which makes it ripe for revisiting and seeing it anew. Which viewing would explain the meaning of the movie best? That is the question. When Pi's father states his preference for the scientific story of life, I do wonder whether the movie agrees with him or not...or if there is truth in any story...just preferences for one story over another. Was the other story Pi told the writer true?",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The new Cast away,"The title of this review may seem offensive to some people, especially those who exceptionally enjoy the marvelous and emotional performance by Tom Hanks. As much as my affinity towards ""Cast away"" still vividly remains in my memory after 12 years, I can honestly say ""Life of Pie"", based on the best-selling novel by Yann Martel is impressive in terms of both staging and acting.The plot is simply about a French-Indian boy, Pie, encounters a life-threatening shipwreck during immigration to Canada with his family and a herd of Family-run Zoo animals caged in the Japanese cargo ship to start a new life. However, the main story focuses on Pie and the tiger, aka Richard Parker, trying to survive after being stranded in middle of the ocean. The two who consider each other as enemies developing a heartwarming friendship by going through all sorts of conflicts with hand-to-mouth supplements on the rescue boat is what makes this movie adventurous and distinguished.The Visual effects consists of computer generated animals that interact with people. The magnificent underwater scene amuses me with a detailed presentation along with a giant wave where tremendous storm devours the ship. The most amazing part of the movie is to be able to witness the surreal CG tiger who steals the thunder of other animals using its fierce eye and charisma.On top of that, a young and novice actor, Suraj Sharma should get nominated for an Award for his incredible performance. Despite there are hardly anyone around him while shooting due to the large amount of CG used in the movie, he executes his role without being awkward. Endeavoring to engage with imaginary CG animals and trying to stay focused while being surrounded by the sea hazards must be as challenging as what Tom Hanks did in ""Cast away."" I can see a bright future ahead of him.Overall, this is an emotional and inspiring film for everyone who loves watching the nature and survival stories. One flaw of this movie would be a slow-paced storytelling. Things that transpire in the beginning is partially incoherent. However, that does not negate the fact that this is worth watching as it also contains a lot of hidden messages that are worth learning.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Excellent adaptation,"After reading the book, I wasn't sure what to expect from the movie, but had high hopes. And I wasn't disappointed. Ang Lee was able to capture every emotion, every important detail and spin a very compelling tale, while leaving out a couple of details from the book that, in my opinion, needed to be left out. The flashbacks between present day and past were perfectly timed, and the actors playing Pi were flawless. And a big thumbs up to the animal trainers! The tiger displayed just the right amount of ferocity balanced with compassion and a recognition of the precarious situation he was in . And the visual effects.....simply amazing!In most cases, I (as most others do) find movies based on books to be sorely lacking. This was not the case here. The entire team did a superb job in bringing this excellent book to life.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Very enjoyable,"I've just reviewed the movie ""The Impossible"" and that would have been quite an appropriate way to describe ""Life of Pi"". Although I've not read the book the making of it as a movie must have seemed impossible.For those people that don't know the majority of ""Life of Pi"" is played on a small boat. It focuses on the survival efforts of Pi Patel and a host of animals with a Bengal tiger Richard Parker being his main company. Suraj Sharma is brilliant as the lead character and obviously the vision of Ang Lee in bringing this to the screen is amazing.

Flat story,"Life of Pi was a disappointment. Framework of the story, with a reporter interviewing Pi, was totally unnecessary - it made it difficult to get involved with the fate of the main character - after all he would survive to live conventional suburban life. Story didn't move me at all. Whole time I was just wondering are the filmmakers selling this story as a real story, based on a fact, or as a fantasy film. As a 'based on a true story' it could not happen - tiger would eat a scrawny Indian boy in a heartbeat if it was truly hungry and the whole island thing didn't help the realism at all. As a fantasy film, the story needed magic carpet ride and a giant - that would do it. In the frame story the reporter said that: ""You had a story that would make me believe in God."" That was setting the aspiration of the story quite high. I was ready to yell ""Hallelujah"" or ""Allah Akbar"" in the moment story would do it's magic, but it really never happened. Story shouldn't promise something that it can't deliver.Special effects were very good and actors did their job well - although I was surprised that Depardieu had so little screen time. Better survival film would be Cast away (2000) and better depiction of storm was in The Perfect Storm (2000).",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

"A film of courage, wit, determination, and survival a visual treat!","Every once and awhile you have a film that comes along like that of ""Life of Pi"" one that's a tale of courage, wit, determination, and a survival tale it shows that life was worth living as it's often an unexpected and tough unusual journey. Told mostly in flashback form you now have a grown Pi Patel(Suraj Sharma and Irrfan Khan)and Pi recalls the times and days of his India zoo keeper family. And the most life changing and memorable moment that would shape Pi's life is when his family took a ship movement to Canada only to be wrecked by a sea disaster in the Pacific ocean. After the wicked waves of the Pacific have departed Pi's family on the lifeboat he's left with his most notable zoo animals like a zebra, hyena, orangutan and most watched is a fierce growling grown to love Bengal tiger. Along the way this is a cat and mouse game of will and survival for Pi to live it shows that on an unexpected journey skill and wit can be learned for survival. Aside from the film's personal themes of will and determination the special effects are top notch.

Graceful nature story bisected by spoon-fed theologism,"An American survival drama. An epic journey of adventure and discovery layered with messages about the true nature of God and storytelling, told in a fabulist style.
Very life-like special effects are used to good effect - critical in terms of telling a story about a young man and a connection with a fearsome Bengal tiger.
The film borders on brilliance because of the skilful storytelling at sea and marvellous cinematography. Illusion must be tightly linked to meaning and truth. Pleasingly, the special effects meet this criteria. Unfortunately, the film's narrative does not. The backstory about a writer who has writer's block serves as bathos, worsened by a self-important dialogue which produces some stilted acting at times. As a fairytale, it keeps nature 'red in tooth and claw' which is a refreshing aspect. Flash-forwards spoilt the tension created by Suraj Sharma's lead performance which was enchanting. All in all, it's a very good film. Its false note is a relentless articulation of thematic aims which failed to create enough subtext.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

An Interesting Journey With A Decent Survival Aspect,"Life of Pi largely centers on Pi's survival at sea, and i do must admit that in terms of survival movie, i am much prefer the jungle type of survival like Cast Away for example or anything besides the ocean, because i've seen it before and even if i or you're not, it feels somewhat predictable and limited in terms of what can happen, and it doesn't usually bring anything new, while it was like that for the most part, what elevates this film is Ang Lee's creative choice to add visual richness to certain scenes, with all the visual and special effects that are stunning and captivating, adding a layer of beauty that enhances the experience, the survival aspect is decent, Pi's relationship with Richard Parker definitely adds depth and intrigue, and the performances are solid, while i do like Pi's part of the story before the disaster more, Life of Pi remains an ambitious film from Ang Lee and an interesting journey to follow.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"No sex scenes, only mesmerizing visual poetry...","First of all; Life of Pi has very little appeal for movie goers unfamiliar with Yann Martel's novel. They will have to glean from whatever information is available before deciding whether to watch it in the cinema or buy on DVD.Second; movie poster is a ""big heads in the sky over tiny people on the sea"" type, and it doesn't stand out among the ones with catchier designs.Third; it casts two virtual unknowns--fierce looking Bengal feline and plain looking Indian boy (newcomer, Suraj Sharma). Which means there will be no attractive Hollywood celebs to ogle at and no sex scenes to anticipate.Fourth; the movie tagline is cliché--""The Journey of a Lifetime."" It is so generic that it can easily apply to any movie off the top of my head: Castaway, Chronicles of Narnia, Titanic, Alexander, PathfinderLastly; the movie poster underplays two things that will most certainly sell the film, Ang Lee and 3D.****************************But watch it anyway because Life of Pi is unlike any film Ang Lee (Taking Woodstock, Brokeback Mountain) has ever made, yet it is the most profoundly moving piece of cinema in his twenty years as a filmmaker. From the very beginning; lush evergreen and a mellow giraffe fade in before enchanting melody drifts across the airwaves--it instantly captivates, right until the very last frame. I would have liked to describe Life of Pi as a genteel; romantic cousin of Slumdog Millionaire but that would be off base. Both exude different energies. One is extroverted and dynamic, while the other is intuitive and intensely dramatic.Adapted from Yann Martel's 2001 novel, this film is a 3D adventure fantasy drama based on adapted screenplay by David Magee (Finding Neverland). In broad terms, it tells the story of a 16 year old boy named (after a swimming pool in Paris) Piscine Molitor ""Pi"" Patel; and his journey as a shipwreck survivor, adrift on Marianas Trench--deepest part of the world's ocean.Story is told from one narrative viewpoint—an older, middle aged Piscine in a flashback as he recounts his 227 days ordeal stranded on the Pacific Ocean.He lives with his parents (they run a private zoo) and elder brother, Ravi. After an unforeseen land dispute, the family boards a Japanese ship in an attempt to sell their zoo animals around the world before settling as migrants in Canada. But a storm hits and passes; with his family gone, Pi finds himself stranded with a lifeboat and some animals. Hours turn into days; as he contemplates the difficult situation, thematic focus of this film unfolds. Separation, survival, self- discovery, the will to live, hunger and thirst, faith and belief all culminate in one of the most impeccably crafted bildungsroman I have ever seen.No one in recent years has improvised upon French Impressionism so spectacularly as cinematographer Claudio Miranda (Tron: Legacy, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) did in this film. We see a cloud filled sky blazing with azure before young, curious Pi plunges into the pool but imageries are never indulged for its own sake. Frame after frame; photography continues to fascinate by embodying important symbolic ideas and emotions of the story. Visual poetry in this film is mesmerizing, and I'll be damned if Miranda fails to bag an Oscar for it.There is a scene in the final act that brought me to snot dribbling tears. When Richard Parker stopped in his tracks at the edge of the jungle, right before he enters it. The fact that he has no human characteristics makes it poignant; the emotional impact came very suddenly, I wasn't at all prepared for it.cinemainterruptus.wordpress.com",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

"""Life of Pi"", The meaning of the floating algae island; is God exists?""","Synopsis:""Life of Pi"" Yann Martel's 2001 best-selling novel, is a magical adventure story of a young boy, Pi Patel, son of Santosh Patel, a zoo owner living in Pondicherry, India. The family decides to move the zoo to Canada, hitching a ride on a huge freighter. After a shipwreck, Pi finds himself adrift in the Pacific Ocean on a 26-foot lifeboat with a zebra, a hyena, an orangutan and a 450-pound Bengal tiger named Richard Parker, all fighting for survival.Review:Novel ""Life of Pi"", and film director Ang Lee's version seems, I never imagine its possible to combine the philosophy into the film screen. The imagination through the novel was fantasy in my opinion when the film version is magically realistic. The use of modern highest resource of 3D technology is a merit of success achieved by the art-direction team, I salute. The film made me speechless even after it ends I was sitting and waiting to watch more and more. I was thinking where the digital entertainment is sailing the boat for the NextGen?The movie contains good sense of humor regarding the dialogs. In market, Pi was following a girl he saw at the dance class. When she catches Pi and asked why he is following? Pi innocently asked at the dance class she ended two wrists joined loosely cupped hands, what does it mean, he wonders. The girl tells him, the lotus hides in the forest. Pi asked, ""Why lotus will hide in the forest?""At the end when Richard Parker, the Bengal tiger left unceremoniously, Pi says, ""All of life is an act of letting go but what hurts the most is not taking a moment to say goodbye.""Is God exists?The narrator promises at the beginning that he will prove God exists. Well, in Yann Martel's book he did, but in Ang Lee's movie, did he or not? In 2012 film ""Life of Pi"", you see the floating island of vegetation with its own ecosystem that could be boarded and had animals living on it out in the middle of the ocean. It seems far-fetched, but does anything you notice in the movie?Pi Patel's confession of faith was regarding Lord Vishnu, the Vedic God who masters the past, present and future, the one who supports, sustains and governs the Universe and originates and develops all elements within. Its called Vishnu sleeps in the ocean of milk with his companions. Did you see very carefully the structure of the floating island? The art-director shaped the island like sleeping Lord Vishnu! I was surprised to see the art work at a glance.In my opinion the movie is a lifetime experience, so don't miss the movie and as well if you did not read the book then read it too.

Visual Orgasm,"As aesthetically stunning as its trailers suggests, Ang Lee's ""Life of Pi"" (or, as I call it, ""Indian Castaway"") is no doubt the work of the most impressive cinematography/director duo of the year. In saying that, while visually Lee makes the meat of this adaptation sing, like many critics have stated before me, not every great novel (which Yann Martel's ""Life of Pi"" is) can be translated into a fully entertaining piece of cinema; no matter how talented the director, or how faithful Lee's vision of ""Life of Pi"" actually is.The Plot: If you haven't read the book, ""Life of Pi"" tells the story of a young man that goes by the nickname Pi, whose family owns a zoo in India. Events (concerning taxes or something) cause his family, including all of the animals, to relocate to Canada, via huge freighter. But when they run into a storm, that leaves Pi stranded on a lifeboat, in the middle of the ocean, with a zebra, a hyena, an orangutan and a Bengal tiger named RICHARD PARKER, his chances of survival look grim at best. But wait, Pi is narrating the film, so he had to have made itright? OK, to tell you the truth, I was rather bored for the initial 30 minutes, which consisted of 100% conversational exposition. But when the storm happens, everything changes. It isn't until the story moves out onto the water that it begins to take on the visual form that audiences paid for. And during this massive section, Lee doesn't disappoint, creating nearly an hour and a half of mind-blowing, million dollar visuals (at times it is hard to tell what is real and what is computer generated) with an understated suspenseful atmosphere throughout, that will have audiences on the edge of their seats for most of it.And now for the bad stuff (when pertaining to the adaptation aspect): When I initially read the novel back in high school, the religiously curious, philosophical and man vs. man aspects that the character of Pi is infatuated with in the first part of the novel, reads much better than anything David Magee's screenplay or Lee could combine to manifest on screen; through no fault of their own. But maybe the most standout issue with adapting a book like ""Life of Pi"" arises when sitting down and actually watching this film's resolution. This final ten minutes, taken from (in my opinion) the most intriguing portion of the novel, will come across to a viewing audience as less morbidly engaging, and more lackluster and kid friendly than those who read the book might expect. But then again, I am not reviewing the book, am I? Side Note: I should also make it a point to say that, because a majority of ""Life of Pi"" is a one man show, Suraj Sharma, who plays Pi, should get tons of credit for pulling off a rather impressive performance. A performance that will surely be taken for granted because of what Lee pulls off behind the camera.Final Thought: I can't state enough how the monumentally impressive visuals here have laid down the gauntlet for all future CGI based films. So, if the CGI is the only reason you came to see ""Life of Pi"", you won't be disappointed, as this is clearly the most visually gratifying film of the year, with visuals that will undoubtedly lead to an Oscar nomination for best picture. Yes, some of the sequences come off as slow, the ending, while faithful to the source material, seems more like a cop-out than anything, and at times Lee asks audiences for a suspension of belief that they may not be willing to give, but with a movie that holds its award worthy visuals paramount, ""Life of Pi"" is (for the most part) an entertaining success and worth seeing.Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

captures the way myths are created,"OK so I just finished watching, and thought it was a profoundly beautiful movie that captures the way myths are created, and the truths they hide, and beautiful... so did the tiger exist?

"A touch overrated, but not a bad film by any means","I don't think this film would have gotten as much hype if it hadn't happened to hit the 3D wave at precisely the right time. Because, while it's a gorgeous movie, and one of the best 3D experiences to date, its story doesn't match its visual splendor.The setting is definitely imaginative. A young man, survivor of a sunken ship, is stranded on a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger of all things. Together they must face the horror, beauty and mystery of wide open sea to reach solid land once again. I just don't think they do everything they could have done with such a premise. It's outlandish enough that you can pretty much kiss any sense of realism goodbye. And to its credit, the film doesn't try to take itself too seriously, and the unreliable narrator the film utilizes only adds to this while neatly explaining all the weird aspects of the story. Yet most of the time is spent following the main character around on the boat as he tries to not get eaten alive by the tiger. That's interesting, sure, but not really Oscar-worthy, if you ask me.Had they done something more out there, it would have kept me entertained far better. Now there are some things they encounter at the sea that are very cool to look and and also imaginative enough to arouse my interest. I say some, because more often than not it's one or the another. Either it's absolutely gorgeous or it's interesting on an idea level. It should be both more often than not.In the end that means I think this is a good film. Not great, but good. It's definitely worth a watch and I can see why so many people enjoyed it as much as they did. Alas, without easy access to 3D experience, it doesn't have that rewatch potential a great movie needs to have.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
DecentI,I'm sure everyone has said this but the book was better. The film definitely transports you to the world and it is an enjoyable watch. The production values are great. Loved the tiger. The protagonist does a great job (the actor I mean). Worth watching if you're a fan of the book!,7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Beautiful, but nothing truly interesting.","This movie goes for art and stuff, the cinematography, the colour pallete it's nice looking. Sadly this movie lacks realism on all fronts. More like fairytale.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
it's a life's work,"After escaping from the zoo, Pi gets stranded on a boat with a lion named John Snow and proceeds to survive on the sea and has hallucinations about an island that is alive, whales, his girlfriend (played by Michael Cera) etc. In his time he develops a unique surfing style with his lion. The minimal use of CGI was impressive, the fact that they filmed the whole movie in the Atlantic ocean is amazing, kudos to the director and producer. The tiger wrangling scene particularly in such a small space was an impressive feat by today's film standards in industry inundated with VFX. The experience was an immersive experience made one get as lost as Pi. Cast was believable, enjoyable movie, 3/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Starts slow but gets better over time...,"Life of Pi gets off to a slow, and frankly boring start but as time goes on the film get progressively better. The films greatest achievement is in its visuals. Nothing ever looked fake in the movie. Every shot in this film is a creative spectacle to gaze upon. Unfortunately the story although captivating is often boring and uninteresting. In the end it's a fun movie for its style but not for much more.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
should have waited for video,"Finally went to theatre in order to view on the big screen but was very disappointed. The CGI effects were just OK in my book; the story certainly did not move me emotionally; and while pretty to watch it held no great moments that were believable. Whale sharks are spectacular but this one just didn't fit; it was just one more ""effect"" thrown in to an effect filled movie. The best director award was a joke. Steven Spielberg, Kathryn Bigelow or Ben Affleck were far more deserving. Don't bother paying for tickets just watch at home for free. The ""Academy"" seems to have something against Spielberg and I think that snubbing Affleck for even getting nominated, in spite of winning all other director awards, shows a lack of respect for his work. All in all ""Life of Pi"" was just boring and and exercise in fancy CGI effects. The continuity of PI's hair length did not jive with time spent in a boat. At one point the boat is completely full of water and next scene the water is gone. When a viewer starts to notice little things like that the director has a problem.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Life of Pity,"Life of Pi (PIE not PEE) directed by Ang Lee and starring Suraj Sharma is based on the novel of the same name by Yann Martel, who joins Lees as co- writer on the film's screenplay, in what is probably one of the most surprising features of the film version of a truly great novel. Lee, a master of cinema on the theme of fractured relationships, who also brought to us unforgettable screen versions of the likes of Annie Proulx's classic short story ""Brokeback Mountain"" and Rick Moody's ""The Ice Storm"", here takes on what to most readers of Martel's gripping debut must have seemed like a virtually impossible task, filming the unfilmable. At the heart of Martel's tale is the story of a young Indian boy, Pi, and a Bengal Tiger adrift in the middle of the Pacific ocean after Pi's family are lost in a shipwreck on route from India to a new life in Canada, leaving only Pi and one of the family circus animals to fight the odds and each other as they cling to the hope of reaching dry lands across thousands of miles of open ocean. Yet in what might have initially been tenuously achievable in the form of a Pixar or Walt Disney animation, Lee, in characteristic ground breaking style, opts to tackle in a live action version. Perhaps, Lee felt emboldened in his mission by having the original novel writer on hand to adapt the novel for the screen. In this regard there are both winners and losers - most of all the story itself and in particular its denouement. It has to be said, however, that Lee excels in turning the imagery of Martel's novel into a visual feast. There is no doubt in High Definition 2D, Lee has created a magnificent palette for the eyes (I have heard the 3D version is breathtaking (I cannot believe I would agree, I find 3D visually distracting). Not alone that, but with his usual flair, Lee somehow manages to makes a seemingly restricted scenario unfold with a tension worthy of Hitchcock. This is one of the aspects that, in addition to the imagery, Lee has translated faithfully to the screen since, for much of the novel itself, the reader is kept adrift with the protagonist in gripping prose on the open sea, suffering the mindless boredom, the cracked lips, stinging with salt, the chapped fingers, the scorching sun and the ever present danger of fading hope. The cinematography is seamlessly intertwined with the fate of the boy the and the tiger so that the viewer is not left in the virtual doldrums, but pulled along on a tide of rising anxiety for the fate of the rafts occupants. Then something goes uncharacteristically wrong. The closing acts of the film suddenly seem like the work of an altogether different director. The final ten minutes are stuffed with explanation after explanation. The script itself becomes noticeably lazy and flat, the characters utterly functional in a way which hits the viewer like a stupid stick and drains away the essential novelty and searing brilliance which made the novel a rightfully acclaimed work. It is almost as though, the film-makers of indeed editors had decided the visual spectacle of the film was sufficient for the audience and the story itself, even the horrifying truth at its core, was somehow dispensable as a narrative. Martel's novel is a profound multi-layered polemic on hope, belief, imagination, survival and trial. In his book the strands of several stories are intricately interwoven and so brilliantly so that the explosive finish unfolds in a matter of sentences casting the reader back through the entire experience of the novel. All this of course is lost in the film. What does this say about Lee or Martel? Lee was awarded with best director for his efforts and clearly due to the visual translation of the novel which is simply stunning. But, it is hard to imagine anyone being inspired to read Martel's novel on the basis of this version of his story. It falls apart quite possibly because, after all, it just might be an unfilmable novel - even by Ang Lee and even with the novelist at his side.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Unusual and Enthralling!,"I had not read the book and so came to this movie without preconceptions. We saw it in 3D and there are many visually stunning moments that really work in this format. One marvels at the technical ingenuity of the film-makers and the imagination of the story's author. Superb acting from Suraj Sharma, as the adult Pi, who must have spent an awful lot of his time during the making of this film soaking wet!The movie would have attracted a higher rating from me but for a few failings. It was too long and could have been shortened to good effect; the plot is not as tightly constructed as it could have been; and the ending is something of an anti-climax. After all the drama and visual fireworks that precede them, the closing scenes verge on the dull, which is a great shame as there is much that is brilliant here.It must have been a great challenge translating this tale from the book page to the cinema screen. The result has certainly produced a unique and very enjoyable viewing experience.(Viewed at The Cornerhouse, Manchester, UK, 13.01.13)",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Amazing!!!!!!!!!,"I'm sure I was like so many who had read the book. Frankly we were skeptical and didn't want to go. We were more than skeptical; we were cynics, doubters and we were almost afraid to go to see the film fearing it might adulterate our love for the book.How could you turn this amazing book, this amazing yet highly personal and internal journey into a visual feast? Who could film some of the parts of the book that were almost dreamlike and yet intensely realistic and violent? How to convey the utter sadness and yet the exhilarating triumph of this individual journey? What would happen to the writer's unique use of language, his pacing in the book, his quirky scene setting? How would this all fit in?Wow Ang Lee obviously loved the book just as much as we all did. I guess when he read the book he could picture it all visually as a visual storyteller supreme. Certainly the best movie of the year. A ""tour de force"" in film making. You wanted to stand at the end and give the film a standing ovation.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Engaging. Impressive. Riveting.,"When the Narrator of the story is in the title, you can be sure the Narrator will not die. Pi (Suraj Sharma) is the Narrator. He and his family are on their way to Canada to sell their family zoo. A storm comes up and wrecks the ship and the only survivors are: Pi, a zebra, an orangutan, a hyena and a Bengal Tiger (so named Richard Parker due to a cargo manifest order mix-up when the family bought him). Peter Parker was already taken. HA!After the Tiger eats the other animals, Pi decides he needs to teach the Tiger to fish or he will be eaten too. Wait, that's not right. What to do? What to do? Well, there is only one solution left and Pi hopes Richard Parker has enough intelligence to catch on.Now, getting the heavy stuff out of the way, there are 2-stories in here and which will you believe? The mystical one: a tiger and boy on a life boat; or a more believable one where Pi's mother, a seaman, and cook are in the life boat with Pi? Much of this has to do with a belief in God or having faith as the adult Pi (Irrfan Khan) unfolds the story to a writer who was told he would believe in God when he heard Pi's story.Okay, good choice. You selected the boy and the tiger. Once they are in the boat together, there is nothing but tension, wariness, anger, fear and really too much suspense. But this never drags. It is like you are Pi and watching out for the tiger every minute of the day and night; and you don't dare rest – and even though we are watching from a comfortable couch, we cannot rest either. We are riveted as is Pi.Yes, there is much CGI in here but everything is so well done, we are still afraid to sleep. We see Pi put together a make-shift raft away from the boat attached with a tether. Now Pi is able to get some restand we try too.We see storms with very high waves, lightning, sharks, whales, flying fish come upon Pi and the tiger and even though Pi, as a very young boy, experimented with Catholicism (even asked to be baptized), and Islam it was the Hindu god Vishnu who he thanked for saving them time and time again. Hey, you go with what you know.The cinematography and photography are simply outstanding.Did you go with what you know when you selected your choice as I asked above? Do you know why the Tiger didn't look back at Pi when they landed on the sand? When you know the answer to that, you then know which story was the true one. (9/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Spectacular show of Titans...,"Elite club of exquisite works by Yan Martel, Ang Lee and team. Kudos to the ravishing and bold depiction of cinematography by Claudia Miranda. The struggle for survival becomes elegant when you have wealth of faith. Even the most horrifying experience hold a beauty within. Surviving a shipwreck for 227 days in an open sea with the dynamic mate such as a Bengal Tiger and crossing Pacific in a life boat is perhaps an unusual occurrence. However faith, friendship and perseverance can make such a tale. Superlative 3D technology and other technological and visual effects are simply jaw dropping and give a tactile essence. Story's opening fashion sets an anticipation of belief in God which is carried thematically. Drama and tension keeps the film truly electric. Odyssey that can rightly set on a voyage on cinematic triumph of a beautiful class. Pondicherry is textured as a delight. Visual mastery is the x factor of the movie and the best part, it never any where dominates the emotional and humanitarian aspects of the creation. Convincing enough to be called as a visual feast.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
A Visual/Spiritual outstanding journey ...,"In short, prepare yourself from the beginning to interpret everything that mind-dazzle you in the movie not only as an outstanding cinematography & visuals, but as a spiritual enlightenment as well ...if you didn't do that, you'll miss the whole point behind the incredible script & there's a big chance that you'll be very confused by the ending & you might need some explanations (& some Google searching) to get it ..And if you didn't, don't worry about it ... you'll still be very impressed with the visuals ... think of this movie's capturing images as the closest realistic version of the nature beauty & mind-dazzling visuals in (Avatar) ...Directing with brilliant, outstanding music, good acting ... But the script ( & the spiritual journey within) along with the visuals are what makes this movie a Must-Watch movie ...Definitely one of my favorite movies in 2012",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
A few holes in a beautiful fabric,"This is a lovely story, beautifully told by the wonderful Ang Lee. But there were a few moments where things just didn't seem to hold together very well or where the story felt like it had a gap. It reminded me of a great garment you might find at a vintage store that may have a few holes, but you still want to take home because the fabric and styling are so amazing.I personally resonated with the moral issues of how to treat animals,especially in such an extreme situation. (I was glad to hear a kids asking his mother why Pi expressed remorse at killing a fish. Perhaps this will plant a seed for future mindfulness.) The ""God"" stuff wasn't really my favorite, but I understand it's part of the story. In fact, I wondered why Buddhism was left out of Pi's tour of world religions.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
