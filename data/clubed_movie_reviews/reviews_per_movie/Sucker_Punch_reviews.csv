Dazzling and unique,"I'm already giggling picturing the cries of protest that will rise up when I post this review, but the hell with it, I really like Zach Snyder's Sucker Punch. I never deliberately play the contrarian, I just seem to often gravitate towards films that have been maligned by the masses, and I can't really help it. Now, in this film's case, a few of the many and varied negative criticisms are somewhat warranted, yet blown out of proportion when you really take a good look at the story. The film is pure style, and although Zachary might have let his imagination run a little wild and clutter the whole affair with fanboy fantasies and video game visuals, there is a clear and discernible story beneath if one cares to look. Now, the only way that story is entirely comprehended is by watching the extended director's cut, which includes an absolutely crucial, pivotal scene that's should have never, ever ended up on the editing room floor for the theatrical version. Seriously, they we're straight up asking for hostility and confusion by not keeping it in every cut of the film, it's just common sense. Speaking of story, here we go: the film opens in breathless style and classic patented Snyder slo mo, with young Baby Doll (Emily Browning) trying to save her little sister from their tyrannically abusive stepfather. Outsmarted and shipped off to an austere mental institution, her journey is a sad, surreal and somewhat befuddling one, but there's a method to the madness that might not be clear with only one viewing of the film. The asylum she is sent to is plagued by a sinister orderly (Oscar Isaac) who is abusing the girls in his care, and as a result, Baby Doll channels such horrors into a grandiose set of fantasy worlds, the base of which rests on a burlesque style brothel where she and others work for volatile pimp Blue (also Isaac). Joined by Amber (Jamie Chung), Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish), Rocket (Jena Malone) and Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), she blocks out the reality of what is happening and replaces the details of an elaborate, systematic escape attempt with impossibly epic, highly stylized adventures, each of a different theme or set in a vaguely familiar period of history. Battling medieval dragons, giant samurai golems with mini-guns, WWI zombie hordes in a gaunt, bombed out European landscape, it's all a detailed rush of sound and fury that hits you like a ton of bricks, and although is far too much for the film to handle and still get its point across, it's completely dazzling stuff, especially on Blu ray. Guided by a mysterious Wise Man (a kickass, rootin tootin Scott Glenn) who shows up in a different get up each time and mentored by brothel Madam of sorts Vera Gorski (Carla Gugino), each setting holds the key to move along a certain cog in their plan, correlating back down the line of delusions straight to the asylum, if a little tenuously. Now it all hinges on the arrival of the High Roller (Jon Hamm), a rich playboy who has come to the brothel to see Baby Doll dance, and probably more. Here's where they messed up royally: The scene I mentioned earlier is a monologue from him that is pretty much one of the most important parts of the film, capping off both realities beautifully, and without it, not only is Hamm relegated to basically a walk on extra, the entire final punch of the climax is rendered lost and neutered, not too mention quite uncomfortable in a sense. Whoever was in charge of that particular piece of the editing should be tarred, feathered and run off the studio lot by teamsters. With the scene left in on the extended version, however, the story is given both point and purpose, feeling like a complete vision with a little weight to go along with it's Hindenburg sized bag of visual tricks. Not Snyder's best for sure, but it's in no way close to the turkey some people will have you believe it is. Whiners. Style over substance? Yes, I'll definitely concede there's an imbalance, but don't try and tell me the whole thing is bereft of substance at all, because that is a lazily researched argument. The soundtrack is a treasure chest, I might add, with beautiful covers of Sweet Dreams and Sing Me To Sleep sung by Browning herself.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Snyder pushing buttons for polarising results.,"Off the bat I have to say I'm over thirty years older than what some pro critics have claimed is the demographic for this one. Sucker Punch, as reviews etc attest, is not for everyone, it has been called any number of things in derogative fashion, which since I enjoyed the film a lot means I'm a misogynist fetishist gamer, which to the best of my knowledge is not true. Lest I'm in the closet and now in middle age about to unleash traits and feelings previously untapped. Which if the latter is true you would have to say well done Zack Snyder, for that's serious film making...Sucker Punch is loud, full of visual orgasms, musically adroit, exciting, clever and very sexy. Snyder has made no secret of his fetish leanings when making this piece, but it hardy constitutes a dark seedy mind at work. It can easily be argued that the film is very much pro women, the story itself - in amongst the explosive thunder of the fantastical action - is tender and beautiful, complete with emotional kickers. Perhaps it's in the eye of the beholder? But I see a strong female led action movie, with shifting fantasy realms, and cunningly it calls for deeper ponder come the finale.Love it or hate it, Snyder has pushed buttons with this exercise. Better that than another cash cow sequel or another remake, re- imaging or rebirth. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Idiosyncratic, atmospheric and engaging fantasy","With its rustic-futuristic visuals, synergic use of classic rock music, overt sexuality, and dreamlike action sequences, SUCKER PUNCH feels like a live action homage to 1981's HEAVY METAL with a heaping helping of MATRIX folded in for good measure. Excellent, quirky performances from a bevy of skilled young actresses serve to enhance the idiosyncratic nature of this film.From its atmospheric use of color to its smallest detail (think a snowflake melting on an eyelash), SUCKER PUNCH is a visual feast. The movie sounds great, too. Contemporary versions of songs like ""White Rabbit,"" ""Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This),"" and ""Love is the Drug,"" to name a few, harmonize well with both the imagery and the unique, fantasy-within-a-dream storyline.Like many, I'm scraping the bottom of the Netflix quarantine barrel and wasn't expecting much more from this movie than a forgettable distraction. I couldn't possibly have been more pleasantly surprised. SUCKER PUNCH grabbed me from its third-wall-busting opening shot and held my attention right to the eyebrow-raising ending. I'll be watching again. Soon.7 stars.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A fistful of mediocrity.,"With 300, Zack Snyder has made it abundantly clear that his movies dazzle they eyes, indeed they do, but his characters never engage the audience in a personal and emotional level. And Sucker Punch is just that. A visually dazzling collage of mental insanity taken to the extreme with a fairly interesting premise that looks promising on the surface, but never truly lets you sink your teeth into the inner workings of the main character.Emily Browning plays Babydoll, a blond bombshell who is placed in a mental institution by her cold stepfather, and is then seen trying to persuade the orderlies into lobotomizing her to keep her from giving details surrounding a tragedy in her life. However, Babydoll begins to create a dreamworld in which not only to pass the time, but to figure a way out of the asylum.As if that makes any sense whatsoever, here are the main problems with Sucker Punch that's been plaguing modern cinema; no plot and character development. Barely any of the characters that the protagonist meets are developed. They're just static talking heads spouting out lines that are trying to hammer into the audience that they are more than just cliché's and cardboard cutouts. The acting feels stiff and artificial with no sense of tension or suspense. You never feel that the characters are in real danger of any kind. It just goes thru the motions and despite having a nice premise to go on, the film feels like a half-ass-ed attempt to be something new and fresh.Sucker Punch has some merits. The special effects and action scenes are impressive. I did get a kick out of some of the battle scenes which are nicely choreographed and executed with lots of explosions. Watching it is sort of like looking at a silent film on steroids but minus the heart and soul of that bygone era.The incredible aesthetic beauty and action choreography are a lot impressive than Snyder's 300. But the problem with Sucker Punch is that even in a fantasy film, or any action film for that matter, you have to put effort into making the audience care for your characters no matter how good looking the action and special effects are. You simply won't care who lives or dies in this film. At some point, you have to try to make the audience care. This film simply never does.I think that I got my point across perfectly clear regarding this film. If it entertained you, fine, then it did it's job. The problem is is that there's nothing remotely remarkable about this film aside from the visual aspect of this film. If more time was spent fleshing out the story, characters, with a more coherent script, then this could've been a really good film. But since so much potential was utterly wasted, I have no choice but to give my grade and it's a D.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Watch it twice for the heartbreak.,"Really underrated movie. It's not just your typical stylized action flick, it's quite a heartbreaking story in its core.On a rewatch of this movie I really started to understand what was REALLY going on here.

Nowhere NEAR as bad as reviews claimed.,"I avoided this film like the plague when it was in theaters, having heard nothing but the worst reviews imaginable. Hardly anyone had anything nice to say about it, and usually that is a pretty good indicator a film is bad. I mean, one or two bad reviews can usually be brushed off. Even a 50/50 split amongst critics can sometimes indicate a good, but misunderstood film. But when a movie is universally panned, it's a safe bet that you're not missing anything by skipping it.Wow, were they wrong here. I decided to catch Sucker Punch on HBO now that it's available, and I'm very glad I did. It's definitely not a perfect movie, but it's also nowhere near as bad as we've all been led to believe.It's got a few moments that don't really work, and I could have done entirely without the narration at the end, but other than that, it's a terrific, beautifully stylized action fantasy, filled with imaginative villains, lush graphics, pretty girls and a uniquely offbeat storyline.I simply don't understand where all the hate came from here. Yeah, it generally portrays a male adolescent fantasy of hot girls in skimpy outfits. Big freaking deal. There are far more exploitative films out there, few of which inspired the level of vitriol hurled at Sucker Punch. It's a cool fantasy film, with heavy elements of B-movie and classic pulp noir skillfully added for good measure.How this film can be hated but something like Grindhouse critically beloved is beyond my comprehension. Yes, Grindhouse is better. But not so much better to justify the massive disparity (83% to 23% on Rotten Tomatoes).And I'm not even a big Zach Snyder fan to begin with. I thought Watchmen was awful, and didn't think very much of 300 either. But I have to give him credit on this one; he was truly robbed this time around.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Beauty and Style,"Sucker Punch isnt a new high in case of Story telling, altho it manages to keep the somewhat plot interesting enough.A handful very beautiful Girls try to escape some kind of asylum, which is also a brothel in which the Girls have to ""perform"".Its not easy to explain whats going on since the small plots are mixed all the time.But overall its like a standart Video Game. The Girls have several Goals to archive to get certain items they need for the escape. And every ""mission"" is told in a complete new setting on its own. Those sequences are maybe around 10 Minutes long each.And here is where the strength of sucker punch is.The Action is solid, the effects are great and the pacing fits.This Movie is the definition of Popcorn Cinema. Good Popcorn Cinema.Normaly i enjoy intelligent Movies more, but this one is just 1,5h of lay down and relax after a hard days work.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Not as awful as you have heard but just empty, noisy, pointless, heartless and cynically commercial","Of course I had heard all the negative reviews when I sat to watch this. Of course I had seen the MTV-friendly action trailer. But critics can be biased and marketing can be misleading, so I decided to give this a go. On the face of it this film could have been similar to Pan's Labyrinth in regards the idea of a young girl/woman living through hardship and extending that hardship into a fantasy world of demons and otherworldly creatures. Certainly after watching the first very stylish fifteen minutes this felt like a film that would take this foundation of abuse and deep physiological injury and do something exciting, interesting and clever with it – at least, that's how it felt it could have been.The problem is that, despite setting up these themes, the film does nothing with them – nothing at all. The dual fantasy sequences do not connect to any of the ideas or possible themes but rather represent an action sequence in the place of a (often mundane) aspect of the girl's plan to escape the burlesque house (which itself is a fantasy version of the mental institution). So for example when Babydoll dances to distract the mayor to allow the others to pickpocket a cigarette lighter , we cut away to a sequence of the girls raiding a castle to kill a dragon and steal the crystals that make it breathe fire. It might as well be a different film in these action sequences, and indeed they are – but the problem is that these sequences seem to be the film that Snyder wanted to make.In fairness these massively dumb action sequences are full of style and presentation with impressive effects. They work for what they are and, even though the slow-mo, use of music and overall design is derivative, it does still provide plenty of style. But they aren't connected to anything in the film and this means that they have the same effect as they do in the trailer – ""oh, that's fancy"" but nothing more. There is no heart to them and as such these parts of the film are nothing more than another blockbuster with loads of effects but nothing else.The lack of anything else is what kills the film because by the halfway point the empty noise becomes nothing more than noise. It is not even that it fails to make something of the ideas, characters and story – it is that it simply has no desire to do anything with them – like it is happy to be nothing. This annoyed me and it gets worse as the ending of the film attempts to suddenly have a darkness, to have a heart – it is too little too late and it doesn't work. In the absence of ideas to interest the viewer, one is left to think about other things. The exploitative fetishism of school-girl outfits, guns, sexuality and violence is one such thing I thought about – particularly since it was in a film whose final lines of dialogue appear to lift up the women characters. The sexual costumes and imagery do nothing of the sort but there is not some underlying misogyny as some have claimed – it is simply another part of Synder making his film as emptily commercial as possible, and sexy young women being sexy sells – just as gun porn and special effects sell. The cast match this as well – occasionally they look like they could have delivered more but ultimately they are little more than sexual effects. Browning, Cornish and Malone have a bit of heart to them but Hudgens and Chung are just flesh (not that I minded too much). This is not a film that cares about its cast – and the audience won't either.Sucker Punch is not as awful as you have heard – it is too expensive and stylish for that. No, it is just poor because it simply does nothing other than empty, heartless style that is noisy and pointless. The ideas and themes go nowhere and the film has no interest in them or the characters. All that matters is slow-motion, cool music, big action and comic book style – if that is all you want without caring about any of it then this will fill your ears and eyes for a while – but if you want more then best give this a miss.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Layer upon layer,"They tell you in the ads that you wont be ready. That's probably true. This film is far more cerebral than the trailers might lead you to believe. But it's action packed and filled with beautiful women and some deep emotions to connect with everyone on some level. The more you get,the better the film. It blends elements of Manga, Sin City and Inception for starters and with a bleak but hopeful feeling sort of 1920-30-40 that I remember mostly from the video game Fallout, so if you were fans of any of these things Suckerpunch has something for you.Visually stunning in lots of ways; from the Gothic comic book flavor of the ""reality scenes"" to the fantasy sections and then into the fantasy within the fantasy it keeps you on your toes mentally and visually.A relatively simple plot is delivered in a complex way and forces you to hang on to the incredible coping mechanism Baby Doll creates in order to deal with her surroundings. From there she creates a mystical fantasy that transports you into her problem solving world that answers the problems she faces in the distant but harsh ""real"" world.A fascinating ride for those who get it. If you were expecting a spoon feeding of a shoot'em up vengeance story from the cookie cutter plants in LA then you might miss the subtlety here, and be left wanting more. My 19 year son, who was with me, totally missed the point nd wanted more action and chicks with guns. I thought he fit the target demo pretty well. Go in with a open mind and connect everything to everything. It's all there if you are paying attention.I loved it. It's up there on my list with Domino, Sin City, and Fight Club for getting more than you bargained for.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Time Will Tell,"Nearly every review you read for this film will say the same thing, it's a 'love or hate' movie, and there's a very good reason for this. ""Sucker Punch"" is not the film you were expecting, whatever that might have been, particularly if you were expecting a hyper-masculine affair a la ""300"". If anything it is hyper-feminine; at its core this is a movie about women struggling against the evil male influences in their lives. That doesn't mean it isn't loaded with action - it really is, and it is beautiful, but if you're looking for an easy watch, this isn't for you. In terms of sheer originality, this movies narrative style is right up there with classics like Pulp Fiction and Memento, but there is a downside to this - you need to keep an open mind. If you can't watch this movie, at least once without - and this may sound weird, but you'll get what I mean when you watch it - demanding to know exactly what is going on, right the hell now, it will lose you, and it won't get you back. But if you can keep an open mind, right till the end, at the very least it will give you a lot to think aboutOn the other hand, don't go thinking that is all it has to offer. It is visually stunning in a way that makes director's like Michael Bay and (dare I say it) James Cameron, look like blind toddlers with a handy-cam strapped to their heads. As for the music, it's not often I'm afraid of giving spoilers for a movies soundtrack, I'll say that much, and every track fits the movie perfectly.I'm going to shoot myself in the foot here, but when it comes to this movie, don't listen to the reviews, and just go see it. I really think time will tell with this one on that front. I can't promise you'll like it, but I can promise you'll remember it 6 months from now, and how many movies can you say that about?",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Some good, some bad...","I do agree Sucker Punch is a love it, hate it type of film. Some people loved it, some despised me. As for me, I neither loved it or hated it. I have mixed feelings on Sucker Punch. I noticed some good things, but some areas of improvement too. It is not among my favourites of the year, but I think there are much worse movies released this year.PROS: Sucker Punch's visuals are spectacular, the case with all of Zack Snyder's movies. The cinematography and editing are excellent, and the costumes, settings and effects likewise.There is also an atmospheric soundtrack, stylish direction from Snyder and good performances from Emily Browning, Abbie Cornish, Jenna Melone Vanessa Hudgens and Oscar Isaac.Plus I loved Sucker Punch's idea. It was original and very interesting.CONS: Despite this great idea, Sucker Punch doesn't quite live up to it in the execution of the storytelling. The story had this great concept and started off wonderfully, but as the film progresses it does get increasingly bewildering and convoluted.Pacing is also uneven. The film could have been longer, so the film could have had more time to explain itself further, and some of the middle feels a little pedantic.The script does have some stilted moments as well, and the characters while intriguing and decently acted could have done with more development.In conclusion, Sucker Punch has its good points, but some assets could have been better. 6/10 Bethany Cox",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What If You Spent $50 Million on a CGI Man Taking a Dump?,"It's kind of difficult to comment on the movie, without just writing, ""Terrible,"" and clicking the submit button. To write a good comment, one must write WHY it is terrible... but where to begin? If someone came into your home, and defecated in the middle of your living room, would you need to explain in a calm manner, three reasons why the person was wrong for doing such a deed? No. You'd toss them by their ear out onto the street, left with the unenviable task of having to clean up. Perhaps you'd even call the police.If, on the other hand, you spent $50 million (or whatever the budget was; it was too high, in any event) to have someone take a CGI dump in your living room... is that any better? There are three actors in this movie: Scott Glenn, Jena Malone, and Carla Gugino. Four, if you count Jon Hamm, but he's not in the movie long enough to matter. There are these three, and everything else is there to talk until it's time for another special effect. Jena Malone isn't even required to do any of these things, but because she has actual experience as an actress, bothered to create a character and reflect an emotional state during the 'story.' Everyone else just showed up, put on the costumes, and talked until the director said 'cut.' Vanessa Hudgens should have been a clue.Even if the story is awful, unmemorable, or predictable (Suckerpunch is all three), other Hollywood movies may rely on memorable action sequences or visuals. In a movie roughly 100 minutes long, these action sequences take up roughly five minutes of screen time. Then Snyder detonates an explosive in New York. Again.It's not so much that Zack Snyder hates audiences, it's just that he's incredibly naive, like a 12-year-old suddenly given the keys to his dads liquor cabinet. He wants you to like a character, he makes them female and puts them in a low-cut top. He wants you to hate a character, he makes that character a rapist or molester of children. He does this again and again; these appear in every movie he's ever made, save for his first (and best) film, ""Dawn of the Dead,"" which was written by someone else entirely. Someone who understands subtlety and character development. Realize, too, that I'm saying this about a movie where a smarmy rich dude accidentally chainsaws his most recent sexual partner.Whatever fancy visuals made it to the trailer, the movie is this: Zack Snyder wrote a script with his camera-man, and it is neither funny nor exciting. It's a 100-minute demo reel, and considering this is his fifth movie, he really should have actually created something with weight, by this point.I'm not going to call the police, but I am going to be mad for a week, because even though I've cleaned my floor, the smell lingers on. 3/10.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Wildly Misunderstood and Underrated,"I've loved this film since its first run in theaters. Largely panned by critics and somewhat of a box office bomb, this film has been misunderstood from day one.At face value, its t*ts and *ss and violence. I suppose the majority of viewers either loved it or despised it at that level. No doubt, knee jerk feminists were loud and strident haters. Seeing it as exploitation. I believe there is more nuance to 'Sucker Punch'.It's more of a comment on how girls and young women are manipulated sexually and emotionally. You have to look a bit deeper past the in-your-face sex and violence. Most viewers won't invest themselves enough to see past this which is a bit sad.Aussie actresses' Emma Browning and Abbie Cornish are exceptional as is Jena Malone. The rest of the cast is adequate.The dream sequences are sublime, and the soundtrack is simply outstanding. These are some of the greatest songs sever recorded.

Not a movie everyone would like,"There are movies which everyone loves, and then some which everyone hates. Sucker Punch cannot fall into either category-- its more like a film made by a geek for the geeks among us. From what you see in the opening sequence - the lead character being lead to the asylum - you get the feeling that this movie is done by a director who wanted to put in what he himself loved into the movie. The dark clouds, a very brooding arch with the name of the asylum on it, the stylized automobile...everything gives the scene a typical flavor. And you either get immediately attracted to it or you just get put off. Me, I was pulled magnetically!The movie has everything a geek loves - there's Steampunk, there's Fantasy and there's Sci-Fi. Running through all this are the lead girls-with-big- guns-and-swords and the amazing fight sequences. Its a totally fun movie. But if you go in for the movie looking for a reason or method to the mayhem, then you will come out feeling confused, disappointed and duped. Its a movie to be enjoyed just for the way it IS. No hidden meanings to be expected, nothing to be deduced. Everything is served the way it is, and you have to enjoy it in that spirit. Don't treat the movie like Wine--looking for all the hidden flavors and subtleties - but treat it like a shot of Vodka - just take it for what it is, shut up and feel the kick! And one solid kick it is, with the lovely girls, skimpy skirts, big explosions, massive fight sequences and amazing CGI.I went along with a non-geek friend and he didn't get it.

It has excellent technical aspects, as one would expect from Zack Snyder, but i rather more enjoyed the LEGEND OF THE GUARDIANS than this one, which although was an animated one about owls, had more story and worthy visual effects than this one. Mistake me not - the FX in this movie are super cool,and the eye-candy kicking their way through the plot are well worth it. But it is the plot that i cannot grasp. The director has definitely succeeded in blurring the lines between reality and fantasy, and you do get to understand the way things go even though it appears to be fantasy, which is the basis of this film ( as per tag line and storyline, a girl dreams of other things to plot of escape in a very glum asylum) However, after sitting for nearly 2 hours with this one, i can't keep wondering...what's the point of this film??",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Why Sucker Punch Works and why it will rock DVD sales,"I originally wrote a review the day after I saw Sucker Punch. I panned it. To me my initial feelings were rather lukewarm at best.But then I gave it some time.And as I went through my days afterward my mind would wander back to the story and think about the visual food for thought.Yeah, the girls are hot. Yeah, the action is over the top, but if you look at the emotional landscape that is being explored in a more literal fashion via the action then yeah, this is a pretty cool idea.Sometimes films come along that are a ""sucker punch"" in terms of originality. The general public usually reacts negatively to it which leads to poor box office results. But later on the audience has had a chance to digest what was given and revisits the film and breaths new life into it.My prediction is that such a situation will happen with Sucker Punch. It'll probably not recoup its initial budget at the box office. People will flood the IMDb forum with reasons why it did not work. We will probably see about a few dozen threads at least where people will vent their reasons why they hate the film and why you too should not see it.But given some time it will recoup via video sales and other distribution deals.Why?Because it's still a solid story. The style of the movie is an Otaku's wet dream, but overall result is still the same: it does surprise and give ample food for thought.Think of it as stylized parable about repression, personal will and sacrifice. Because sooner or later after all the negative backlash and reviews blow by those emotional messages will be all that will be left.And people will remember it for that reason.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Visual effects overkill!,"There is only one word to describe this movie, which is: overkill! The movie is like a long visual effects stravaganza, but it almost seems like someone forgot they where trying to tell a story.Lets begin at the beginning. First of all, the opening scene is actually quite good. The almost non-spoken scene says more then enough, and the visual style sets the tone for the rest of the movie, which is fine. But once the movie gets started, things start to be unclear. The switch from fantasy to reality and back are unclear, and the it's almost as if Snyder forgot what story he was telling, and only focused on the visuals of the movie.Now, the visual effects are stunning, as is the whole visual style of the movie. If only we would care about our main characters, and would understand the movie, things would've been much better. At one point in the movie, I actually felt in one point of the movie, I wanted to know how things ended in reality, in stead of the fantasy world, which I think is not the intend of the filmmaker. The whole purpose of the fantasy world, is to keep you at the edge of your seat, thrilled and amazed. But instead, I was only annoyed when they cut to this world, since this real world, was much more interesting then those fantasy pieces, which seemed to have no goal at all then just entertain the audience.It is obvious the goal was to entertain with the huge spectacular visual effects, but to me it shows something different. Apparently the filmmaker was so scared his story would not be interesting enough, and therefore added in this whole fantasy world, to keep things entertaining. Too bad, because I would've rather seen the real side world, which I thought could've given a much more interesting world.In my idea, this is a typical example of a director using visual effects, which he doesn't understand. He doesn't use them to tell the story, he uses them because he can.Poor movie, poor script, wonderful art direction and visuals though. A clear case of a good team, but no good leader.

"Surprisingly dark and sad movie, but also entertaining","Saw the movie today.It's super fun, I loved the visuals that Zack Snyder put into it, great fantasy sequences. Original plot, even if it is too simplistic and somehow muddled. The girls were super hot too, especially the main blonde chick, she's stunning Oscar Isaac as the villain is absolutely fantastic in the movie, amazing performanceI think the main problem with this movie, and why I think critics didn't like it, is that it takes itself too seriously - not in the action sequences but the 'real' scenes. It puts on too much drama and deep thoughts that could be acceptable if it wasn't a fantasy action movie with hot girls shooting around all over the place! It has some philosophical lines with some deep meanings that the movie couldn't achieve by itself, so it was very pretentious on that account. There were some things that didn't make much sense to me but... F-ck it. I wish there would be 1 or 2 more fantasy sequences. Not a fan of the soundtrack either, it stood out but in the wrong wayIn conclusion, well made film with great visuals and nice concept that often takes itself too seriously and overly dramatic but never loses the fun6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Let your mind take you to an action on heels!,"I liked it.This is a very unique movie. It has a multilayer plot where real actions are presented to the viewer as visual metaphors. I'm not gonna tell much more about the plot. Just understand the basic style of this movie.The action scenes were awesome. They were dynamic, fast, epic and hot. Also pretty random. But isn't it what we people mostly want to see? Just screw the idea and watch the insane action where the milieu, bad guys and explanations don't matter?Despite that, the real-life plot wasn't bad either. They made it somehow depressively cool. The editing was good (slow motion, other camera tricks), and the music, especially remixes. The computer graphics were good, but not the best. But I still really like the fantasy world they're in - the environment and details especially.Oh, and one more thing. Go see the movie now!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Had low expectations...loved it.,"Here's the thing about this movie, its demanding. You have to be able to let go, realize that it's stylized after a modern comic book (of the adult genre), and just go with the movie. Let it take you on its ride, which is a beautiful/wonderful thing.You also have to pay attention. This movie is layered in metaphor and is way more cerebral than one might expect. You have to work to understand what's going on and part of that work is letting it take you away.If you can do this, and your friends can do this, you will have hours of conversation afterwards about what it all means, what the metaphors mean, and what was actually happening in the 'prime' reality of the insane asylum.If you can't do this you will probably think the movie is stupid, contrived, and pointless. But you would be wrong.Oh...and beyond all that stuff above...the fight scenes are an absolute nerdgasm, a sci-fi/fantasy orgy of epic proportions.Steam-punk Nazi Zombies... I came out of that movie feeling like I just had a threesome with Isaac Asimov and Anne McCaffery.I absolutely loved it.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Worth Revisiting!,"I just rewatched this movie and wow am I glad I did! Talk about underrated! Sure, the entire movie is a bit over the top, but Zack Snyder deserves more credit than he was given when this movie originally came out 10 years ago.At first glance, most viewers would believe this is simply hot girls doing action scenes, but that would be selling them short. There is some impressive work being done here by the entire cast. The fight sequences are elite and the cinematic elements of the film are actually quite spectacular. Some top-notch camerawork, cinematography, and visual effects take you on a grand adventure. Watching the 5 main women in combat was some of the best entertainment I've seen on screen in a while.What makes Sucker Punch so impressive, but ironically also holds it back, is that it's trapped between reality and fantasy. The movie presents an obvious question of what is real and what isn't, but when it came to figuring out that answer, I found that I didn't actually care in the end.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Sorry, this is a load of crap for LA loosers","I really enjoy Tarantino, Rodriguez, Ritchie postmodern, pop cultural, comic, ironic style of filmmaking, but still when you use it you should be original. using this style itself isn't original at all, definitely it doesn't give any credit of whether to make such a movie or not. sucker punch was about to blow the system (as it seemed reading and hearing about it) but unfortunately it all went wrong. bad acting, clichés in characters, actresses not knowing what to play, playing generally not specifically as it should be in this very case... director overplays his hand killing the meanings and possible core of the movie by throwing some cliché 3d generated crap we've seen before!! Tarantino is laughing now for sure, watching this 'killbill wannabe' movie sampled from garbage after better directors. Don't watch it unless You are trapped in the cinema waiting for hurricane to pass by outside.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Somewhat Refreshing,"Zach Snyder has continuously wowed his audience with extremely fast-paced action scenes coupled with impressive camera angles and theatrical slow motion. The stories he works with are simple, relying heavily on action and intrigue. It is no different here.Sucker Punch is in fact an enjoyable movie with highly gratifying action and a fitting soundtrack. Music goes on and on, one new piece about every ten minutes or less. It honestly could be said that this movie is a long music video. All the special effects, at least concerning the swarms of enemies, are surreal; they don't look too realistic, but then again, they are not supposed to. Baby Doll's imaginary world is comprised totally of nightmarish villains almost or entirely lack humanity. Let is be noted they do not look cheap or fake, either. Those who say the action scenes have no connection omit the fact Baby Doll is envisioning a world, any world, where she controls the deadliest of situations. She is traumatized, essentially locked up. It not so much the images but the situation as a whole and the insanity she is imagining.The storyline is simple once again. However, it comes with an end that is in fact refreshing to see and makes the movie worthwhile. The acting, when not focused on stalwart fighting, is good, even well done. However, I can't say the movie connects very well on all ends. It has little do with the beginning; while the movie makes sense, it seems derailed from what it presented its own plot to be.If one is looking for a movie that is simple, innovative, philosophical and makes total sense, don't see this one. If you're looking for a simple to complex, action-filled, adrenaline-pumping movie with a surprise, do go see this movie. It's not the best, but I for one enjoyed it immensely.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Future video game,"I saw this at Warner Bros. where I work. Really like Zach's visual style, but man, is he weak on story. So many things are not well played out. The girls are at an asylum, but no one acts crazy. The fantasy world of the movie feels like set pieces for an upcoming video game. There are times when the girls seem to be capable of anything, and other times hopelessly ineffective. One last thing, if you're going to use rock music in a score, use the originals, or at least have killer versions by new artists. Glad I saw it, but I'm really getting tired of cartoon movies and cartoon characters. Zach Snyder has so much promise in this industry, and I'm really pulling for him, but I think his only home run so far has been ""300"".",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Could have made a bigger success,"The action scenes and the visual style are brilliant. Zack is really an artist and full of experimental and innovative ideas. However, this film could have gone further if without the strange storyline and the dark ending. Zack is a very good story teller but the problem is that he shouldn't really use this type of story for this film. The film did almost everything that it wants to achieve; but it's just that these achievements are somehow covered by the story, which shouldn't be an important part of the film in the first place. I hope Zack could have used a much simpler story so that the audiences can focus more on the visual part of the film, realise its achievements and give a better response. I cannot say that I totally like or enjoyed the film but I still appreciate Zack's work on it. Afterall, still a good job Zack; keep working on. Hope to see more movies made by you.Oh, one more thing. The part that Baby Doll fights against the three giant warriors, it is, WOW, so cool that I almost don't know how to describe it.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
When Imagination stops imagining..,"Girls from Anime, now in live action, fighting monsters and bad guys? OK, I get the ""attractiveness"" of this concept, but such a pointless plot and bad execution? From some really bad casting choices, like completely unbelievable villain, to a failure to create a story which makes sense..! Both worlds, the reality and the fantasy lack consistency and originality. Also creators tried so hard to stay within PG13 ratings, that the result is a film which is pointless and naive to a mature viewer and way too suggestive and confusing to a youth. The film leaves an impression of an eclectic piece edited out of some visually stylish dark French movie and pointless CG action sequences from a computer game.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"An action-extravaganza that is haunting, beautiful, polarizing, and brilliant.","After absorbing myself in the world of Zach Snyder's ""Sucker Punch"" for a while, including one viewing at IMAX, one in my local theater, and multiple listens to the soundtrack, I felt the unusual calling to dump my thoughts out regarding this haunting, beautiful, polarizing, and brilliant film.From the first trailer I saw, I'd been anticipating the release. Usually this is bad, as it means my expectations are built up and it will take an outstanding performance to meet those expectations. Turns out, Sucker Punch is everything I'd hoped it would be, and more. Some would say that in art we see what we want to see, though maybe it's true also that we see what we are prepared to see. Here's what I saw and felt about the film, why it resonated with me and why many people didn't like it: Within the first five minutes, I knew I was in for a treat. The film opens with an excellent cover of ""Sweet Dreams"" by the film's lead actress. The initial scenes are otherwise silent and the storytelling is all visual. Yes, you're about to experience a film that is basically a 120-minute music video. But that's not all. It's also an action extravaganza AND it's cerebral to boot.Right out the gate, from as early as the opening sequence (where we enter through a state and later rain on a car window forms the movie's title), this film announces that you should shut off your disbelief. It's fantasy at all levels and doesn't have to make sense to entertain or ask provocative questions, both out loud and suggested.Thank goodness for the fantasy elements as had this been a movie about an escape attempt from an abuse-steeped asylum, it would have been immeasurably depressing. Snyder's vision protects the audience from what Baby Doll, Sweet Pea, and the rest were experiencing in the ""reality"" of the film probably more effectively than Baby Doll's fantasies protected her from those horrible experiences. As it is, the film is sad enough in its portrayal and suggestion of certain negative themes like incarceration, lobotomies, aggression, rape, corruption, and betrayal. On the other hand, it's also a film that is both empowering and moving.In contrast to the dark themes, we also have several positive themes like the individual's search for freedom, teamwork, giving, love, forgiveness, risk, and courage. This film likely upsets many viewers because it doesn't exactly have a happy ending. (An approach which tends to spell failure at the American box office.) I enjoy the apparent contradictions it presents to the audience. One popular debate is whether the film is empowering to women. I think this debate in particular misses the point of the film, and takes too much at face value, but it does show how polarizing the movie is.The conversation, both internal with yourself and external with others, about what is portrayed in the film can be difficult for one to consider, which is likely why it's a turn-off for so many. The critics may be upset by the questions it provokes about themselves. Cognitive dissonance encourages them to just forget all the issues, label the film a piece of garbage, and move on. Other viewers were likely upset by the film's darkness - it certainly made me uncomfortable, but that doesn't mean the movie was bad. For those of us looking deeper, there are all manner of important questions provoked.People are being abused. What are you doing about it? Is reality a prison? If reality is a prison, as the trailer for the film states, what does that make you? Why are you here? Are you here to be ""corrected"" or to escape? Do you want to be free, or should you just shut up and let the guards continue to take advantage of you and the other prisoners? What will it take to escape? Are you willing to risk your life in the quest for freedom? Is Sucker Punch really just a action-extravaganza with no plot (as many critics would suggest), or is it a subtly and cleverly presented art film about your evolution and self-empowerment? The film even asks a series of provocative questions out loud in the final narration. I'm a panentheist, and I don't claim to know what Zack and Deborah Snyder believe, but my interpretation of the final narration is that it is reminding people of the divine dichotomy. We are individuals, but we're all connected to all-that-is. The world's horrors and beauty were created by us, collectively. What we see around us is a reflection of our collective beliefs. The contrast exists so you can continue to choose what you want. Will you consciously choose to evolve, expand, and therefore grow all-that-is? The film explains this by announcing that you have all the weapons you need and encourages you to ""fight"". Leave the realm of living life by default, and begin working towards freedom. Gather your tools (map, fire, knife, key) and don't forget the fifth element - love. Prepare yourself to lose everything and gain the perfect victory.The fight is not with swords and guns against horrible monsters outside you, but inside yourself. It's your task to vanquish your fear. That will set you free internally, which eventually will help free you (and the rest of us) externally. You may not make it out alive, but all-that-is will benefit from your efforts.Sucker Punch wasn't a mind-blower like The Matrix, but it was an entertaining, well-made action film with an intellectual layer and depth, for those who were prepared to receive it. I left the theater with conflicting feelings about what I'd seen. I liked that. It's a stunningly beautiful and poignant film. It was exactly what the trailer promised and more. Oh, and the soundtrack is pretty great, too! Consider me a fan.4.5/5 for the theatrical version. I'm looking forward to the director's cut.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Pretty good actually even if ""too much""","10 years later, the visual effects are still impressive.I did like the story.The actors are good.On the minus side, it's ""too much"". Too stylish during the real life scenes.All in all, good entertainment.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Plot less, poor acting, but I suppose it had pretty colours.","I however, do not care for pretty colours.I sat through this movie utterly perplexed due to the amount of plot holes and inconsistencies. It took an incredibly poor concept, mixed it with a confusing and unnecessary sub story to produce an outright mess that one would generally be reluctant to call ""film"". Of course, the absence of a story was overshadowed to most of the viewers by scantily clad women and dream-like fighting scenes.This, I must say, is absolutely the most gratuitous movie ever made. The plot revolved around a group of women, institutionalized, who find themselves in a concocted dream-within-a-dream world for reasons irrelevant to anything. The task they find themselves attempting to accomplish is using their feminine cunning and guile to entice the men in the institute so that they can steal a number of menial items to grant their escape. The horrendous writing was not a distracting element to others as there was a plethora of scandalous women running around with guns and causing explosions. The budget of this film was spent solely on special effects and did not, apparently, leave any room for pants for the women to wear.Though I thoroughly detested 'Sucker Punch' from beginning to end, it became apparent to me that the rest of the theatre actually found themselves enjoying it.So I suppose, if you are looking for some late night, 14A, fun filled with pretty colours, women, guns, and explosions, but do not care for plot, respect towards women, intelligence, and good writing or direction, this is the movie for you!",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A love it or hate it type of film.,"I personally enjoyed the film and I am a fan of Zack Snyder's previous films (Watchmen,300,and Dawn of the Dead). The visuals were pretty much stunning with very few exceptions, but they are easily forgiven and not distracting at all. The acting wasn't anything ""Oscar"" worthy, but then again it shouldn't be. The performances were very good for an action film and I like it that way. This films definitely attracts the teenage male demographics, who like action packed films filled with hot women. This film, however is not for everyone. Some people might not like CGI, some women might be offended that this film is very shallow, violent, and very degrading towards women.This is definitely the type of movie you'll either love or hate.My only problem with the movie is that the story doesn't seem fully realized If you want to keep me interested you will need a lot more than 20 minutes of fantasy CGI sequences sprinkled throughout a 120 minute trek However go in this movie expecting to have a lot of fun! Overall the movie has stunning visuals, great action scenes, and worthwhile acting. I definitely recommend this movie to people looking to have a good time.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Unique Film You Must Have A Taste For,"So, I'm not the biggest fan of this movie because of the, for the lack of a better term, steam punkish feel and the Bjork music. However, the story is pretty interesting, the acting was decent and the sets had a dark, almost gothic feel. It is a different movie, for sure. You will more than likely love it or flat out hate it. If you're searching for something different check it out. You won't be disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Honestly Full of Action But Lacking of Anything else,This movie was so pointless that I wondered why I was even sitting in the theater watching it half way through the movie and why I sat through the whole thing at the end of the movie. Maybe it was because I paid $15.00 to see it on an IMAX screen or the fact that I was so sickened by the movie and needed time to gather myself to leave.The movie was so incoherent and the majority of the movie had so little to do with the start and ending of the movie that if you left the theater and walked back in at different parts of the movie you would think it was an entirely different movie each time just casting the same actors and actresses. Definitely not worth the time and money of movie goers and may not even be worth watching it if it was to one day be shown on HBO or Starz one day.If you are the type of movie watcher who has a short span of attention then the movie will definitely seem great. If you however watch movies expecting that the scenes and the story of a movie should all tie in together then this is not your type of movie. The movie does a poor job at explaining what really happened to the characters in the movie and what exists only in the mind of cool effects and lots of explosions. The audience never gets a chance to learn anything about the characters' character because the movie never builds up any of the characters fully.If you've yet to waste your money on this movie then use that money to go buy yourself some dinner. If after reading this and you still want to waste your money then I have a few foundations that you can better donate your money to than the pockets of Snyder.,1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Modern cinema has reached a new low point,"A lot can be said about this film, but only when accompanied by clenched fists and a look of bewilderment. Wooden acting, one-dimensional characters, awful writing, boring and repetitive action sequences, a plot which is predictable in it's journey to no-where, a lack of meta-story, a horrible degradation of well-loved songs, evidently bad editing (which is a rare one)... All contributing to a pile of misogynist filth that makes you wonder why you still bother going to the cinema. This film characterizes everything that is wrong with modern cinema, emphasizing looks above content and a type of 'stylised' filmmaking which is long past its sell by date above common sense.

If I were only younger,"You have to understand what kind of movie this is to appreciate it.

I think this would have fared better in my eyes if I was about 5 or 6 years younger. I was much bigger into video games and comics even at that point in my life, but just haven't found the time for it as I've grown up, had a more serious career and family. Overall, I'd say that this a cool action, OK acting, better than average storytelling, and a fairy decent script (the best parts were all of the promotional trailers and cool concept art that have so frequently become the staple of a Zack Snyder Film (strongly hinting Frank Miller artistic vibes).",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A different Snyder movie,"I heard about SUCKER PUNCH since very long because it's one of Zack Snyder's first movies before he directed the DC comic book movies and also because it has tons of divergent reviews (some great, some bad and most in between). Last July I finally saw it and I ended up liking it, not loving it.The movie is set in the 1950s. Babydoll is accused of having killed her sister during a moment of madness and is taken by her stepfather in the institute for mental illnesses named Lennox House for the Mentally Insane for lobotomize her so that he can take her dead sister's inheritance all for himself. Five days before lobotomy Babydoll enters in her imagination in a burlesque game house and she meet other four dancers that like her want to escape. During a dance lesson by Vera Gorski (Carla Gugino) Babydoll imagines herself in Ancient Japan where she meets the Wise Man (Scott Glenn) that reveals her how to escape from the institute and she'll need five objects: after the dream sequence is over Babydoll has finished her dance and the director Blue Jones (Oscar Isaac) is pleased.Soon Babydoll, Sweet Pea, Rocket, Blondie and Amber find the objects and end up from battling a World War I battle to a dragon in a medieval castle and other adventures and fugues, up until we return to the instituion where the Player is none other than a surgeon (Jon Hamm) specialized in lobotomy and just practised it on Babydoll. In the meanwhile Sweet Pea is seen riding on a bus with the Wise Man as the driver that takes her despite she is ticket-less because they have a long road to go.If you go into this movie expecting a superhero movie you are wrong. Yes it's directed by Zack Snyder but it's a totally different movie for him because it was Snyder's original concept and it's good nonetheless. The acting was great, not surprising considering the cast members and the action scenes well coreographed. It's also unique because there are various moments that you just have to see them to believe them (like the aforementioned one of the World War I battle that shiftes with the dragon in the Medieval castle).Overall, an action movie capable of satysfing its fans and for everyone else, a nice time passer and a guarantee for two hours of fun.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Another Trip To Willoughby,"Watching Sucker Punch put me in mind of a great old Twilight Zone episode A Stop At Willoughby. Young Emily Browning has been committed to an asylum where apparently all the patients are young and nubile women who are played by Vanessa Hudgens, Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone, and Jane Chang. There seems to be a good reason for that as these women have to dance alluring dances and perform other services for high rolling customers. A way for the asylum to make some money.Like James Daly in the Twilight Zone episode who was a modern businessman under great job pressure looking for an escape, these women want to escape as well. He found an exit in an unscheduled stop in a town called Willoughby which looks like a set from The Music Man. The girls also want an escape into life beyond the walls of this place they're trapped in.More I can't say lest I divulge the secret of the plot. But Browning and Daly both want out of the life they're trapped in and each finds a similar solution. Scott Glenn has a mysterious and unique role similar to the train conductor in the Twilight Zone episode.Sucker Punch because a lot of it takes place in the imagination has a great show of special effects virtuosity. If you're not terribly concerned about story and plot as I am, this is the film for you. The girls are lovely to look at also and they have great fighting skills or their stunt doubles do.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"I'd like to punch all those suckers who say that ""Sucker Punch"" sucks.","Zack Snyder directs this very surreal film about girls in the Lennox mental institution for the criminally insane. Sucker Punch"" stars Emily Browning as Baby Doll, a supposedly 20 year-old girl whose mother, after her death, writes in her testament that all of her property would go to her two daughters. Baby's evil stepfather is outraged and on one faithful night, beats the crap out of Baby's sister, killing her. Baby witnesses this, grabs a gun, and shoots her stepfather. He lives and sends Baby Doll to the Lennox mental institution for the criminally insane. That's when the movie really begins.Upon arrival to Lennox, she meets with fellow inmates Rocket, Sweet Pea, Blondie, and Amber. All you Vanessa Hudgens fans, Blondie is played by her. It is then that we come to understand that Lennox isn't a mental institution, more of a bordel. We also meet Carla Gugino as Dr. Vera Gorski, the coreographer"" of the girls' dances, which they perform to men who eagerly expect so. Baby Doll befriends her fellow inmates and while performing for the first time, comes up with a plan to escape the facility. That's when all the crazy action sequences begin in the film, which is contrary to popular belief, actually pretty good.Most critics have panned this film. Richard Roeper gave it a D and it's received a 22% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. That's just 2 percent higher than what the site gave to Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen,"" so you know Sucker Punch"" should be bad. But movie critics aren't always to be trusted, and as much as I respect them, I've gotta say that I believe they're horribly wrong to rate Sucker Punch"" negatively. I've read reviews for the film and most of them say that the film never explains what the crazy action sequences are about. It actually does, but nobody ever pays attention to what's going on in an action film, and then afterwards they complain why they didn't understand anything that was going on.I don't want to spoil anything, so I'd rather have that you go out, see the movie, pay attention throughout the film, and then tell me whether you got it or not. I certainly did, or if the Snyder meant something else, then I didn't. Whatever I got, however, was enough to make me interested in the movie throughout.I think that the reason why many didn't pay attention throughout the movie, was because it was directed by a man who is primarily known for directing mindless"" action flicks such as 300,"" which is actually a very good movie. In 300,"" Snyder catches our (or at least mine) attention with gorgeous visuals, here he does the same. All the action sequences are masterfully choreographed and you always know where the enemy is, and the protagonists are.That said the movie does have its flaws. The dialogue is often a bit too corny, the film was perhaps a bit too stylistic, and it is definitely not to be compared with Snyder's masterful previous work. But in overall, Sucker Punch"" is whether you get it or not, an undeniable visual treat with a jaw-droppingly epic soundtrack, and if any of you dare say that it just looks like a video game, I'll reply: Well, I like video games.""Rating: 3/4",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
144 minutes too long.,"Opening in a interesting,imaginative fashion I was hooked. The use music and no dialogue was a truly inspired decision, but from then on, the film went down hill.The problem I have with this movie was the acting. Emily Browning delivered a lacklustre performance as 'baby doll', believe it or not, someone cannot create interesting viewing when their facial expression is constantly set on 'bambi'. Along with the other actress', Browning tries to portray herself as some sort of female bad ass, but just ends up looking like a toddler playing make believe.The graphics where stunning, and where one of the highlights of the film, along with Carla Gugino's turn as the doctor.To be honest, this film had a lot of potential, but failed to pull it out of the bag.

No one said a thing but you can clearly see what they were going through. Then it follows the sudden change of the movie setting. It started from the asylum then into a burlesque brothel. Then every time Baby Doll (Emily Browning) dances, she channels another world. A world where she and her friends; Sweet Pea (Abby Cornish), Rocket (Jena Malone), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), & Amber (Jamie Chung) kicks asses of Samurai-robot warriors, clock works, dragons, gores and robots from WWI to dragon lairs.

If your into Videogames and Anime - You'll love this!,"I just rented this one with some average expectations. Saw the trailer and was quite curious, since 300 is one of my all time favorites.For those CGI lovers, I guess the movie is awesome. From anime styled camera angles, to outstanding acrobatics, it really gives you the taste of state of the art sci-fi action.Without spoiling the plot, the movie sets the character, into several scenarios where she must obtain an item to escape her ""prisons"" in the real world. Typical video game cliché. She even has fantastic boss fight at each ""level's"" end. This actually works quite well because the subplots within the movie are simple and engaging enough to give purpose to all these sets. If you're a fan o games like Devil May Cry, Killzone, Soul Calibur or Ninja Gaiden you'll love this movie.I did find some flaws in it though. The dreamy worlds do not quite add up to ""reality"".

Nothing More Than a Pubescent Geek's First Orgasm,"Having viewed the trailer and reading the plot, I was very excited about this movie and had been for a good while. After the credits rolled, however, I felt like I had been sucker punched right in the wallet. This movie should just be called Sucker, for those duped into seeing this movie.There was barely a plot and no character development, I didn't care if they succeeded or not. All of the cgi fight sequences made no sense nor relevance to anything they were trying to accomplish nor were they revolutionary by any means. I have seen it all before in much better executed formats and films. It was simply put, empty and soulless. The fluff of eye candy tried to mask an underdeveloped storyline, but movie goers are not stupid and I totally called his bluff.I am so disappointed because I was really excited for this movie and the trailer totally mislead me into thinking I was going to see something well made...And another thing, the whole woman empowerment was utter b.s. You can tell that it was an afterthought of trying to think of a way to make women want to see this failure. Yeah, women will be empowered by burlesque whores dancing while they fantasize into an anime style fight scene revealing both cleavage and pantie shots. Whatever.This movie makes me worried for Superman, apparently his next big project. This movie is this year's Last Airbender and will surely rack up in the Razzie nominations.

Underrated...somewhat,"Really it's 6-1/2 if truth be told, but not sarcastically. I am a ""sucker"" for action/fantasy and though this has those disjointed over the top fantasy sequences it still works because this is after all an asylum and the protagonist has been tortured by events past and now present into forsaking reality. She does the best she can while immersing us with stunning visuals and and a good soundtrack. It even starts to make sense from an unreal point of view; and that reality distancing style of Zack Snyder's animation helps.

Pulp Objectification,"In a day when Hollywood craves good original screenplays, Sucker Punch proves that some filmmakers should stick to adapting great source material. An exuberantly bad pastiche of genres, Sucker Punch is the anti-Quentin Tarantino film. Zack Snyder's story is mashup of several different genres, none of which prove successful in the long run. The number of believable lines in Snyder's screenplay can be counted on two hands, thus providing very little material for the potentially good cast of women to work with. Snyder clearly doesn't know how to construct a visually disinteresting shot, but it all doesn't matter because the film trips over its own feet constantly.Sucker Punch is told from the point-of-view of Babydoll (Emily Browning), a young girl who is sent to an asylum by her father after she accidentally kills her sister in the bravado opening sequence. It isn't too long before Babydoll realizes that she is scheduled for a lobotomy. Her vivid fantasies cause her to realize escaping is her only way to survive. Babydoll enlists the help of the girls in her ward to help guide her through her intense journey out of the asylum. The supporting cast includes Abbie Cornish, Carla Gugino, Vanessa Hudgens, Jena Malone, Jamie Chung, and Scott Glenn. Look for a brief performance from Jon Hamm at the very end.What's good about this film is, indeed, pretty good, however there are very few things I can say in this area, unfortunately. Zack Snyder is a visual extraordinaire. His slow motion shots of flying weaponry and spinning girls are a wonder to watch. Larry Fong, the cinematographer for 300 and Watchmen, does wonders with the supersaturated blacks and oranges that create a moody contrast between fantasy and reality.The story is bizarrely fragment and surprisingly boring. Four 20-minute action sequences punctuate the storyline involving the asylum, which is unfortunate because that was the only one I was actually interested in. The beginning and end are worth seeing for their emotional intensity and surprising depth, however the war/samurai/dystopian/medieval fantasies are flat and plain, despite the action displayed on screen, which should be rich but isn't at all. Very often, the story sucker punches itself and doesn't every get back up.Sucker Punch is meant to be an action movie and yet its action sequences are the least interesting parts. Each one attempts to allude to a previous great film in its respective category, but each one is unsuccessful. Furthermore, the choreography of each fight is exactly what one might expect; there isn't a single thing that excites or creates any sort of reaction.Zack Snyder has clearly stated that Sucker Punch was supposed to be 18 minutes longer with an alternate ending. The question is, do I care? The answer is yes, oddly enough. Sucker Punch has the strange potential to be a classic. After all, how many films received negative reviews upon their initial release and ended up in cult fandom?One other shortcoming of this film that should absolutely be noted is the treatment of women. Although Sucker Punch wants to be a feminist movie, it actually turns out to be demeaning more than anything. Scantily clad women are sexualized throughout the entire film, and it is our job to be thrilled by the imminent danger of rape and abuse that so often happens in the asylum. It's scary to think that somebody let this kind of plot happen in this day and age.Sucker Punch truly hit me hard, but not in a good way. The objectified, stiletto-wearing protagonists stumble through the entire middle third, making the good beginning and ending moot. The cast is oddly bland, but Snyder makes up for it with his impressive visuals. Overall, Sucker Punch is an experience people shouldn't enjoy. It's a post-post-modern mess that will be remembered as a geekgasm, for now at least.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Sucker Punch — Be amazed, be struck by lightning, see this fantastical sci-fi","Sucker Punch is totally out there, and probably the only way to combine so many different things in a single story.The story telling is incomplete, in itself, but not the story. Most of it is told metaphorically. You get to imagine the rest. An easy thing to do is to dismiss the movie because of the beautiful women, or the intense and fantastical action. That is a grand mistake. The story is poignant and very sad, yet wrapped in a beautiful cinematographic cocoon. It's breathtaking. I kept wondering when the hammer blow of bad poorly constructed elements would descend upon me and disappointment, break my heart. It never did.The dialogs might look simple, and the story line really quick, but their complementing information is in the magic of the metaphors. It's an incredible ride led by the excellent acting of those gorgeous creatures and genius directorial mind, as well as the superb editing and CGI.Ride the wave, shed a tear, see it.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Good, but there's a catch.","There are many aspects of Sucker Punch that reaching dizzying heights. Yet so much more seems to fall flat.Sucker Punch is all about reality and escape. It features different formats for these themes that happen in reality, psychologically and metaphorically.The action, that I am sure brought us to this movie with it's fantastic trailer, was spellbinding. The director once again uses his own kind of graphic style that adds more depth to the action scenes. They're not as bland as many notable Hollywood offerings. So a big thumbs up for the action and graphics.The acting was very good. The real star for me being Abbie Cornish, who is a joy to watch in every scene she appears in. Particularly the action scenes. She is one actress who really listened to her trainers and worked hard at on what she was told. I swear if I had not known she was acting I could easily believe she had military training. The rest are a good bunch. Apart from your own aesthetic preferences, you would find it hard to choose between the rest of the cast, as they all performed well and suited their characters. So thumbs up for acting and casting on all counts.The overall story and script were, unusually from this director, quite weak. Perhaps editing killed some of his vision, but I can not see what more could have been added to make you buy into it any more. The story and script where poor in comparison with the rest of the movie. Not poor as in the laughable, cringe worthy and unwatchable kind. But, when compared with the stunning eye candy that doubled as pretty fine actresses, the grandiose and stunning action sequences and the music and general graphical feel of the movie, it fell pretty short in this area. Thumbs down unfortunately for script and story.It is this last part that makes this movie a bit of a Thorny Rose. There is so much you will love, there is so much you will hate. I guess the diplomatic rating then would be a 5, but I am slightly leaning on my fence and give it a 6.Good movie, definitely worth a DVD rental for a Saturday night.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not sure what went wrong with SUCKER PUNCH,"Zack Snyder is an interesting director. I definitely think he's a very talented individual with a very good eye for the craft. 300, WATCHMEN, GUARDIANS and SUCKER PUNCH all have a very unique visual style and are all very well made films. However, SUCKER PUNCH is going to make me question anything he has a part in that involves him putting a pen to paper.I love the whole idea and concept of SUCKER PUNCH. However, ideas and concepts can only go so far. SP is a story about what someone is willing to go through in order to cope with the struggles and obstacles in front of them. How sometimes you have to resort to your imagination just to pull through. And within these imaginary worlds they're able to do anything they want. I like the story, but the entire time I found myself not giving a crap. Snyder fails to do the most important thing when making a story like this, and that's bring the emotion.It's not the actors' fault either. Every single person on screen brings everything they've got. Even Vanessa Hudgens is good, which feels really strange coming through my finger tips, and Jamie Chung is actually convincing. Everyone really does a fine job. Aside from action, Snyder knows how to work with actors. Unfortunately I can't say the same for being able to write characters.One thing Snyder has proved in his career is that he's got an eye for action and style. Each set piece is brilliantly put together and visually stunning. Within the imagination of Baby Doll (Emily Browning) everything is amazingly surreal. It's chaotic and really the most impressive part of the entire film. The fights, whether they be gun fights, sword fights, a dragon chasing a plane or 3 girls on a train full of robots, are well choreographed and everything is shot so you can see what's going on. I do think Snyder is a little too obsessed with slo-mo and it occasionally gets to be too much.What's unfortunate about all the effort and hard work that went into these brilliantly staged set pieces is that I just didn't care. Because of the nature of these scenes, being inside of an imagination, there wasn't much at stake. Characters weren't in any real danger of dying and the lack of emotion had me a bit bored despite how pretty it looked. When I was watching it I was thinking ""damn, that was cool"" but at the same time I didn't feel the urgency the characters supposedly felt. And after a while the aesthetic of the eye candy wore off and I became fairly bored.I'm not sure what went wrong here. I usually dig mindless action as long as it's well presented. SUCKER PUNCH is definitely one of the best presented mindless action in years, but something stopped me from really enjoying the movie like I wanted to. It's got everything I could have asked for: Hot girls in little clothing, dragons, sword fights, gun fights, mechs, robots. Everything except emotion. I don't think it was from lack of trying either. It just felt lost somewhere, buried beneath all the ""cool"" of the movie.It's hard to say whether I'd recommend SUCKER PUNCH or not. I'm leaning towards a no because from other people's reactions they didn't enjoy it as much as they hoped. It's great eye-candy, but when it's done you'll be craving something more filling. Zack Snyder I still think is a great director, but I don't think he should play around with story too much anymore. I want to see him direct something where he had no hand in the writing process and keeps the story close to the original script. I guess we'll see what happens when SUPERMAN comes out.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Snyder's misunderstood fascinating masterpiece,"An impressive and inspiring fantasy movie with impressive visuals and impressive cast, a fascinating movie that tried to speak to you outside of reality, a movie that inspires you to dream, to live in a reality where you can control everything, a movie that deserves to be called a masterpiece, a movie that teaches you that it doesn't matter where you are the mind will always be our home sweet home.Strong and solid performances in the movie, worth to mention Emily Browning as the lead character that connects with the audience and Abbie Cornish as the fascinating strong headed deuteragonist, Carla Gugino outshined half of the cast with her solid performance as Dr. Vera Gorski, but Scott Glenn and Abbie Cornish are the ones that truly shine in this fascinating movie with strong and solid Golden Globe worthy performances.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Disappointing Movie (Considering Zack's Previous Achievements),"Just got back from the midnight premier of Sucker Punch and I can say that I am disappointed. Being a huge fan of Zack Snyder's films since Dawn of the Dead, I was expecting another classic. The first 10 minutes or so of the movie are a slow mo montage intro which he seems to think is his ""trademark"" now. I thought, hey this looks incredible. And it does. The film itself looks visually amazing. The problems arose when people started speaking. THE DIALOGUE IS AWFUL. I laughed at literally 80% of all the lines said in this movie. I couldn't tell if the movie was serious or if it was more of a Sam Raimi style film on Comic-Book style movies. What I couldn't understand is, after watching all the excited interviews with the cast and crew talking about how great it was, how they even thought they were making a good film. Maybe the script looked really good on paper, but the movie itself was just all over the place. I wont get into the details about the alternate realities and such that people have already described, rather I'll talk about what I think lies at the heart of the problem.This film is pretentious. This is Snyder getting too powerful with all of the money he has brought in doing what he loves. EVERYTHING in this film is in his head. The job of the director, however, is to communicate a story to the audience. The story itself made no sense, at least in my mind. The only redeeming thing about the movie was its visual effects which, while stunning, were not good enough to fill the gap left by all the shallowness of the movie.The whole time I kept thinking, ""God, Zack. This better be a joke."" And maybe it was. I can picture it now. Zack and his producers sitting around a table. ""I'll make you guys a bet,"" he says ""that we can make the silliest, worst movie ever. Put my name on it, add in some slow- mo sequences, and it will make back its budget and then some. What do you think?""""Well, what did you have in mind Zack?""""I'm thinking Alice in Wonderland...Only with guns.""Dear God, Zack. How you got a studio to produce this film i will never know. The thing that bugs me the most is that Zack seems to be a talented director. He certainly is one of the most visual directors in Hollywood. I had really high hopes for him. The problem is that he can't write a story. He may be able to direct it, but he can't write it. And that's where Sucker Punch falls flat: The writing. You can't really tell a good story if the story is sh*t to begin with.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Maybe Works for 13-18 Year Olds under influence of.....,"The first 5 minutes of the film, is maybe the film itself, and maybe the reason to pay the money and go see this movie....maybe not.This film has no artistic value as compared to '300', so fans of Snyder going to see this because of '300' masterpiece. don't go, it is not.The film probably can be appreciated by teenagers under the influences of various substances, because that is probably the only way, the only correct way to appreciate this film to some degree. Probably comparison to movie 'speed racer' can or should be made.Acting does not exist in this film, special effects are poorly done as well as the soundtrack to them, and in general almost all of the scenes are absolutely pointless and tedious. Again for teenagers maybe they are less tedious, hard to tell.The core of the film is the message that Snyder tries to express. This message is obvious and understandable if you looking at this movie from the right perspective. The problem is that I don't know if the kids will understand this message or if this message was openly conveyed to them.The 'grandiose' ""plot within a plot"" is that he describes a Strip Club and the inner workings of it, the psychology and the circumstances of the girls who are trapped in this lifestyle. He describes girls, who had bad parents or were abused and ran away from home, and the only way to support themselves became a money making machine of Strip Clubs, then he describes all the internal struggles and hell that many girls are internally dealing with while pursuing this profession. Then, he describes the coping mechanisms to this torture, as for girls to resort to various substance helpers for them to escape their reality or to distort it, and finally the ultimate coping mechanism is to totally stop caring, detach yourself from the horrible reality, and to become a so to speak ""living zombie"", a living dead, a mental suicide of sorts,""self-lobotomy"", the body is alive but the ""soul"" is dead.Snyder's point at the end is that this is not the way to go, there are other ways to deal with harsh life realities, find a map(goal in life), find a key(a way to attain it), a lighter(a spark within yourself to do it), a knife(fight for your goal) and finally ""the missing element""(yourself). If you will be able to find these, it will set you free, you will attain financial and emotional freedom.So if the teenagers who will go to watch this movie will grasp the messages that Snyder is trying to convey, then this movie has some value, if they will just go under influence and watch it like a very long, not that interesting video game, then it's just another pebble in the graveyard...",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Don't miss the punch line,"I've read a lot of bad reviews on this film but feel that perhaps people are missing the point.Yes- the movie is chaotic and confusing.

Is she in an institution for juvenile delinquent girls, a French finishing school for rich young debs, a child brothel in Eastern Europe, an American mental asylum or none of the above.It doesn't matter.

A winner on several levels,"I recently saw Sucker Punch at an advance screening and thoroughly enjoyed it. To be honest, I am the target demographic here. I'm a guy in his twenties who plays video games and enjoys fantasy movies and action.... but this is a decent film overall. It appeals to my ""sensible adult"" side that appreciates a good, well written film, with great directing, great acting, and overall good cinematography. It also appeals to my ""twenty-something male"" side that loves sexy ladies, guns, killer robots, dragons, samurai and swordplay. The abundant CG is stunningly beautiful and doesn't feel overdone or become visually exhausting like some movies. This movie gets me. and I know that there will be a good number of people who dislike this movie, dismissing it as juvenile, or stupid. who dislike the amount of CGI used in this movie.

We get sucker punched!,"I went into this film expecting a fun, over-the-top action-packed movie with an okay story. I was very curious about this movie and I wish I never sat down to watch it.The storytelling was terrible. First off, our main character is somewhat established as we see she has a brutal relationship with her stepfather...only it is done in a music video sort of fashion. Right there, you instantly don't care for the character as much because you don't feel her pain. There's no real dialog or emotions that happen. Instead, it was like a music video as it glosses over her background. The rest of the characters aren't well established, and neither is the rest of this story. We have dancers, who dance to impress men. We then enter the mind of our main character when she dances and all of a sudden, this timid girl knows how to fight and kick ass with all kinds of weapons? She is now the leader of the pack? This movie was like combining Black Swan and Inception, and just ruining both stories! There was a lot of pointless action with tons of CGI effects that weren't worth the hype. I felt like I was watching a dumb video game on the big screen.This movie was pointless and it was very dull as there was little suspense and some very not so intimidating antagonists. Zach Snyder has had some solid movies in the past, but unfortunately, this movie was a black eye. We (the audience) get sucker punched when watching this mess of a film.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Possibly the worst film ever created,"It is possible that this is the worst film has ever been made. It is almost certainly the worst film I have ever seen.Its difficult to spend the required 10 lines to describe this film because the script could probably be written in that little text. As far as I can tell this film is designed to appeal to the video game playing teenage boy who cant get a girl friend. The film shoves some nice looking girls in some stockings, give them guns and get them to shoot stuff. In principle this sounds fun but then they ruin the boy pleasing element by getting them to cry quite a lot, and the action bit is nothing particularly special anyway. Tedious.In conclusion, as far as I am concerned, its two hours of my life I will never see back. Save your money and watch the Matrix on DVD instead.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Now this is the rabbit hole,"The introduction to the story reveals a young girl, institutionalised in a mental hospital by her abusive step father. Her imagination fortifies a paranormal world in her mind as both a means of survival and strategy for escape.This film is very abstract in nature.Initially, the plot's direction is obscure as our protagonist appears to transcend three worlds: The first where she is institutionalised in an asylum for the insane; the impression denoted by this world is that it is reality.In the second place, she is slave to the desires of a high-class brothel; it is not clear in the beginning whether this is her subsequent venture from the asylum or her imagination.The third is a land, depicted as a place in her mind – a world where anything is possible, from gravity defying Martial Art skills to supernatural antagonists. The music used during transcendence into this alternate universe is unusual, but addictive. The scenes are action- packed and intriguing as the audience is brought to question what this world represents.Arguably, this film script forms a unique version of the famous Alice in Wonderland tale. It is an enigma throughout the duration, it sustains suspense regarding the conclusion and the ending is a valuable lesson.This is not an amazing film, but I would definitely recommend it for its enjoyment factor.By Stephen Leslie France",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Incredible visuals; imagery that will stay etched in your mind for a long time,"""Sucker Punch,"" the latest barrage on the senses from writer-director Zack Snyder (""300"", ""Watchmen"") is his first film that's based on his own source material. And it proves to be quite stunning definition of pop filmmaking. In a triumphant marriage of style and tone, Snyder has created his own ""Kill Bill"" by going deep down into the rabbit hole. A glorious pastiche of colour, CGI and kinesis, ""Sucker Punch"" even through its obvious flaws, has set a new bar for graphic storytelling that attempts to transplant the purity of imagination onto the cinema screen.Essentially cohering around a simple premise -- hot chicks kicking ass and taking names, the film's bravura opening charts Baby Doll's (Emily Browning) institutionalisation by a wicked stepfather after her mother's death and her introduction to the asylum where damaged young women are sent to be kept away from society. She meets the people-in-charge, Blue (Oscar Isaac) and Dr. Gorski (Carla Gugino) as well as the other girls in the institute: Rocket (Jena Malone) and her sister Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish), Amber (Jamie Chung) and Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens).The story that follows Baby Doll reveals a larger canvas of a clever narrative conceit that coincides three realities together (""Inception"" comparisons, tread lightly); the first being the asylum, the second is a burlesque brothel run by Blue and trained by Gorski and the final and most resplendent one is Baby Doll's hyper reverie focused on destroying the forces of evil -- be it shogun titans, zombie Nazis or killer androids. The darker the reality preceding it, the deeper and more risky the wormhole of fantasies go. There is a real sense, despite its tremendous parade of visual set-pieces that Snyder wanted a narrative strong enough to endure the weight of spectacle, and in many respects he has. He uses the age-old device of character quests to propel the plot, peppering it with familiar consequences until he doesn't. The flow culminates in an intriguing final act that sets it a mark higher than anyone would have expected, or even needed from a film that already proudly wears its stripes as pure escapist entertainment.Snyder goes the way of Tarantino in appropriating and amalgamating artistic and stylistic influences from the most conspicuous of genres and mediums. Within the real world or whatever the relative equivalent of what exists in this film's dark and twisty tone, the film uses templates in the vein of sexploitation female prison grind-house features from the 60s and 70s like ""Love Camp 7"", ""99 Women"", ""Caged Heat"" and the grandmother of them all, 1950's ""Caged"". As the film progresses into its action-oriented enterprises, it quickly recalls the dizzying array of cut-scenes from video-games and punk anime-style design in how it encompasses the digital environment. Snyder's thematic goal is to situate the idea of imagination as a coping mechanism for terror, a concept seen recently in ""Pan's Labyrinth"" and ""Tideland"". The landscape of the mind is uniquely realised here by Snyder, who etches a remarkable amount of detail into each CGI frame, an hyperbolised celebration of artifice and invention that is at once magnificent and exhilarating as it is compelling and spellbinding.Werner Herzog once posited that the dearth of new and unique imagery that do not reflect the times we live in will be the death of civilisation. If anything, ""Sucker Punch"" truly defines the generation of filmmaking we exist in -- a sophisticated and passionate emblem that delivers an overload of sugar high through the ideals of creating and maintaining a creative medley of pop-culture influences, bridged together with keen commercial sensibilities. Suddenly, Snyder holding on to the helms of the next Superman film makes more sense than it ever did.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

very good movie,"Sucker punch is a very good message movie cloaked in a scifi movie with hot girls. I will not spoil the plot I will just let you know that there is hardly any cussing, the violence is done in a non gory/ classy way. The movie is a very good movie for a teen with a positive message while it still being what movies were meant for entertainment. Just like his movie 300 which although gory and action heavy had good themes of self sacrifice and not taking the easy road this movie also has a positive message and is more teen friendly and if you are a parent I would not have a problem with my teen seeing this one.Hopefully it will do well so that more directors will make inventive movies like this one rather than cashing in on the lame comedies that for some reason always do well.Also the special effect and locations were amazing and the acting was pretty good. Great story that flowed well even though it had a reality and a fantasy it still made easy sense. Not like that mess of a movie inception. Suckerpuch had a director with a clear vision of what he wanted and I feel it flowed well on screen. First movie I've seen in a theater this year and even though good movies are rare anymore, it makes me appreciate them even more with all the lame ones pushed out each week.Kevin",,Anonymous,Fantasy

No Excuses,"In the past, one could've been forgiven for thinking that Zack Snyder had a measure of talent. His remakes and adaptations had been enjoyable movies at the very least, even his polarizing big screen version of ""Watchmen"" could be admired for its effort and faithfulness. Without seeing what original ideas could spark from his imagination, Snyder fans could always argue that we've yet to see his full potential. Now we have.Sucker Punch is very light on words. Its first line of dialog is heard fifteen minutes after the opening frame and the characters don' talk much for the first half hour. Thank God for it because once you hear that first line, you'd wish Snyder had stuck to making this entire thing a music video with explosions. I'd offer examples of the gems that are sprinkled through this work of cinematic genius, but after eight hours my brain's gone and erased every memory of the few spoken lines in order to preserve my sanity. Suffice to say that Snyder appears to comes from the Lucas school of screen writing. Step 1) State the obvious. Step 2) Make everyone talk like badly translated manga characters. Step 3) Squash all ambiguity so the silly audience won't be confused.The horrific dialog is the most obvious sign of an incompetent writer, but that's not the only problem. A bad writer with a bad idea will never get made. A bad writer with a good idea will get re-written. A bad writer with a good idea who also has money to produce will get his script made as is, to hell with any criticism. Because it's a BAD writer with a good idea, he or she will magnify every flaw with poor or stereotypical execution and corrupt any good by being too obtuse. Such as the case here. The story operates on three levels of reality, the insane asylum, the burlesque club, and the violent world. The first is absolute reality, the third is the protagonist's imagination (I think), and the second is never explained.In fact, for those who thought that ""Inception"" was confusing, at the very least it jumped between three levels of reality without confusing us as to why they're there. ""Sucker Punch"" in the meantime, lost me on its very first dive and then keeps diving, hoping that the endless amounts of skin and stylized action would make me forget the lack of explanation. It didn't work. By removing the context of what the main character is doing and by never explaining whether her friends are actually insane, we don't whether or not to root for her. In fact, in the very act of NOT explaining, Snyder's managed to make all of his fantastic actions scenes utterly meaningless. Why do we care that she's fighting?Sucker Punch could've been something great. Not Oscar worthy perhaps, but with little effort it might've been the most entertaining film of the year, raked in at the box office, and become a fan classic. It still might rake in at the box office, but it will never see the light of day again. Zack Snyder had all the money he could've asked for, a great cast that wanted to do something good, a production and effects team that wanted to do something good... and instead he made this. An incoherent, overblown, excruciatingly cheesy fallacy of a movie that fails at the most basic aspects of storytelling. No excuses, Snyder.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Stupid Pinch,"""Sucker Punch"" is basically disappointing but also obviously gonna fail because it was directed by Zack ""The Slow-Mo"" Snyder. Well Snyder is only good at visuals. This movie is not an adaptation. He created the story to make his visual talent more useful. The story can be interesting but this fantasy/video gamey world was pointless although it was the whole point of the movie, the reason why we are attracted to this. His directing is still slow and messed up. The action is slow. Everything is slow. It's just sad.The first act was like a playlist of music videos. It's a good way to start the film. The second act started to become pointless until the end. They're coming to this imaginary world without any sense or any connection to the reality until the last visit. Like I say this movie's existence is for the visuals but it's clunky to the story.If there is something that I liked in this movie then it's Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone, and Oscar Isaac. They are the only ones who had a decent performance. Carla Gugino was also good. The other cast, Emily Browning is like Bella Swan holding guns and swords. Vanessa Hudgens doesn't have the guts to be tough. Scott Glenn needed more scenes.The other thing that I liked in this film is the visual effects of course. But this eye-candy merit was slapped by Snyder's directing style called Slow-Mo. His slow-mos are just senseless and boring. Ninjas, zombie Nazis, dragons, robots, and hot chicks in one movie can be fun but their mixture in this film is just nonsense. The movie is nonsense. It's not imaginative. It's just a mess.""Sucker Punch"" is like ""Scott Pilgrim The Movie"" in a bad way. At least the absurdity of ""Scott Pilgrim"" had a lot of sense, but this in a realistic serious world meets preposterous is strangely mismatched. I think a video game fan and a kid will enjoy this (or not). Overall ""Sucker Punch"" is a turtley fantasy mess. They say it's ""Alice in Wonderland with machine guns"".

I guess I'd have to say that I actually like two thirds of it; which means that if you like it I can I'm with you, and if you don't I understand. From the time Baby Doll gets her weapons the film really came alive for me. I enjoyed the action sequences (loved the dragon), and the hot outfits. You may have a difficult time trying to figure out which of the girls is the most attractive (I settled on the Amber character). But for many the plot will be confusing and hard to follow. So if you must see it on the big screen let me know your thoughts, otherwise if you are unsure I would suggest waiting for DVD.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Where Do I Even Begin...,"Let me start out by saying that 300 was great. Intense, graphic novel style that was beautiful and entertaining to watch. Zack Snyder's Watchmen was an amazing movie that really developed the characters while still retaining a great plot structure and fantastic visuals and directing style. Sucker Punch, however, fails to appeal to anything other than those looking for scantily clad teenage girls moping with the occasional linear CGI cut scene.So why does Zack Synder fail so poorly? First of all I honestly think he cannot write his screenplays. Both 300 and Watchmen were not written by him. He also had a series of graphic novels to look at to help develop and hone in on the stylistic portions of the movie. Sucker Punch was written by yours truly, Zack Snyder. The story is ill conceived, predictable, and leaves nothing to the imagination.The biggest problem of the entire movie is the soundtrack. The film totes remakes of 90s classics all set in a more melodramatic fashion. This is fine, but the soundtracks picked for each individual scene describes exactly how the central character at that point in time is ""feeling."" On top of this the scenes have numerous slow motion techniques and they also drop all in scene audio. All you can hear is the soundtrack playing. The end result is a movie that feels more like a long and boring music video. A hint for Zack Snyder; good movies do not pick random hits, they usually develop their own orchestral track. And when you have a $150 budget, I think find room to do that.Besides this, the CGI scenes are all rather cliché and boring. Baby Doll must get item X which leads to CGI scene X. They are all linear and leave the viewer wondering when the scene will finally end. Worst of all the viewer realizes that they must watch a numbered total of these same exact linear scenes that all resemble video games or past great movies. In other words, the scenes basically stole from other popular fictional universes.If you are not an avid fan of anime, or 12 years old, then do yourself a favor and take a pass on this movie.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Imagine a collaboration between Quentin Tarantino, David Lynch and Paul Verhoeven...","...but instead of a script all they have to work from is the doodles at the back of a fourteen-year-old schoolboy's notebook.It's very strange to see so much money wasted on such a weak premise: the plot, if that is what you can call it is as follows: misunderstood adolescent girl is incarcerated in a mental asylum by her wicked step- father, but ""escapes"" by imagining she's a misunderstood adolescent girl incarcerated in a brothel. Where she does interpretative dance while fantasising that she's part of a crack team of scantily-clad steampunk commandos.Why? One can only surmise that Snyder wanted to make his steampunk- pole-dancing-commando movie but couldn't come up with a plot to fill in between the action sequences. So they were inserted into the brothel scenario, which was then inserted into the asylum bit to make it all look really ""deep""--to anyone who was stoned enough.I'm sure I've seen worse films, but never one that was so pointlessly well filmed.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A video game without the controller.,"Visual artist and director Zack Snyder brings us the latest in his unique filmography of stylized violence following on from recent works such as 300 and Watchmen. If you believe all the negative hype utterly rubbishing this movie, you might just (as is the case with most movies with preconceived low expectations) be pleasantly surprised. Because while Sucker Punch is no masterpiece, it performs admirably in the action department, coupled with a frenetic pace; all but overwhelming its weaker attributes.Young adult Babydoll (Emily Browning) has lived a life of abuse under her stepfather, until she finally cracks in an unsuccessful attempt at murder. The authorities lock her away in a mental asylum for her crime, but she soon learns it merely acts as a front for a burlesque theatre run by the power-hungry Blue (Oscar Isaac). Determined to escape the facility, she enlists the help of several other detainees when it becomes apparent that her dance leaves all the orderlies in a state of trance, while transporting the inmates to a fantasy world where they must face monsters conjured up by their own mind, and where their actions in this parallel universe mimic ramifications in the real world.Okay, at the risk of pointing out the obvious, the plot is bizarre to say the least, but don't be turned off by its outward nature. The director makes it very clear that this film takes place not in our world, but in the Snyder-verse, which abides by different laws and powers to ours. Hence, it becomes contextually easy to suspend disbelief throughout. In fact, while the whole notion behind entering different worlds through the mind has been touched on by a whole host of earlier films, the idea that both fantasy and reality are eerily related, as in Sucker Punch, offers some food for thought, even if it isn't delved into as much as you might hope.The few scenes that occur in the real world that involve the girls planning their next move only serve as some sort of plausible link between one exuberant action scene and the next. They almost feel like cutscenes to a video game before the actual level starts, and the fact that they must collect 'five items' to complete their plan of escape does little to dispel that illusion. And make no mistake, each new mission, although entertaining and visually spellbinding, is a conglomerate of fan-serving stylized madness including, but not limited to, robot samurai and zombie Nazis. So beware if you don't consider yourself an over-the-top action kind of guy.A film that opens with such a compelling scene (and an excellent example of how to tell a story just through pictures alone) disappointingly falls into a fairly formulaic series of events from that point on. A dull script and occasionally wooden acting don't help either, and although I admit that the ending could have been a lot worse, it is a case of the filmmaker trying to do too much with his subject matter. Questionable character motives, as well as the casting of Jon Hamm as two polarising characters casts doubt on the authenticity of the story; an unnecessary add-on that fails to remain in line with the rest of the film's tone.However, as mentioned, the positives of Sucker Punch do a decent job of outweighing the negatives. The voice-over narration is used sparingly but effectively for the most part, and the soundtrack may just be the film's biggest highlight in any way that doesn't pertain to magic dragons and flying robots. It's a unique piece likely to differ from person to person more so than most other films would, but I felt it was by no means a bad effort.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.*",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Sucker Punch is for Suckers,"Sucker Punch is a pathetic attempt by over the hill producers at a cash grab by throwing every cliché that hooked them as kids into a random hodgepodge with no pretence of connecting them to make any sense or reason. They even throw in a gratuitous steam punk reference, because they think that's still cool. It could have been another Heavy Metal for the Zoomer generation if they'd bothered to pay for a soundtrack. Instead they throw in covers of tired old hits, like K-Tel records did to squeeze every penny out. They don't even budget a costume change for each number.They get everything wrong, not by trying, just from not even caring. Admittedly this makes it one of the good kind of bad movies. A few of the ideas they steal could have been cute on their own, like flint and steel in a dragon's throat. And the monorail to Jupiter could have been funny except they put regular tracks on what was otherwise an obvious monorail, and the planet didn't work.Clearly set in 1950's New York, no wait 1800s Paris, or is it 1970s Germany? When did flappers use photocopiers and Japanese Gundams to fight dragons to escape polyester suited pimps? Dream sequences aren't sufficient excuse for this. At least there's no way to pick on continuity errors when the whole movie is one big continuity error.It's wrong that it's socially acceptable to go out in public to see a movie based on a comic book when you wouldn't be caught dead reading a comic book on the bus. Only watch this movie at home, secretly, with a riftrax MST3k style running commentary. Better, re-read Tank Girl while watching it again instead.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Review: Sucker Punch,"Sucker Punch is Zack Snyder's (300, Watchmen) interpretation of an Alice in Wonderland situation. Upon the death of her mother, Babydoll is locked away in an insane asylum by her vengeful, greedy stepfather. He has arranged for her to receive a lobotomy in five days. Seeing as how such a place can put a price on creating vegetables, it isn't the most comforting of facilities as Babydoll and four other young girls are constantly threatened with beatings, rape and death.Babydoll resorts to finding comfort within her own mind as she drifts into a fantasy world filled with giant samurai, zombie Nazis, and even dragons as she battles through the demons she faces in the real world. Blurring the line between reality and imagination, the 5 girls hatch a plan to escape from their prison by any means and slow-motion battle necessary.The most brilliant decision Snyder made in this movie is truly the opening. I'm not referring to the opening scene (which may have been the best storytelling sequence of the film), but rather the cold start involving the WB logo. As the theatre darkens and the silver screen brightens, a gritty stage is shown with the WB logo printed on a curtain. The camera slowly moves towards the stage as the curtain pulls away to reveal the opening set; Babydoll sitting in her room staring into her mirror. Finally, the camera makes its way onto the stage and we are now brought into the story. This makes a very great and obvious argument that what follows is not meant to be grounded. Even the fantastical vignettes of battle royale are still ridiculous in their own world from physics to even visuals, but that's OK: this is the theatre.Still, these vignettes are nothing without plot. The series of 4 or 5 visually exciting dream battles are tied together with a weak story that these girls must find 5 items (map, fire, knife, key, secret) in order to escape from the Great Deku Tree – oh, sorry. I was confused with The Legend of Zelda. And each time they try to take one of these items or are threatened, Babydoll drifts into a dream world of sexualized violenceWhich is where another issue arises. Its no secret that these girls are all thigh, stockings, and boots. As a man, I can appreciate that. But there really is a depressing message that seeps forth in between every action sequence and that is ""Girls, if you're about to be raped/traumatized, just go to your happy place."" It's uncomfortable to say the least. The reason this review keeps coming back to it is because the movie does too.Does Sucker Punch entertain? Parts of it do. As a series of stylistic, slow-motion oozing, action filled shorts, yes. Very much so. As a film with interlacing plot-like elements? Expect less there than you already do.2.5 Creepy Thin Mustaches out of 5-MovieFloss.com",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Entertaining!,"Even if we keep aside the allegrological implications, this is a pretty entertaining movie with Snyder's stylization and his trademark production value at the forefront.I have kept a blank slate without any hopes or expectations, and I'll admit I am surprised. The action was engaging, and the storytelling was inventive, but it never takes itself too seriously and confuses its viewers and it rather straightens things up by the end.The protagonists are likeable, and the slew of antagonists (particularly, Oscar Isaac) play their parts well. Had the editing been crisper and those 'dream sequences' (I think those can be deemed as dream sequences, correct me if I'm wrong) provided more in terms of their visual flair, I would have been more glad.Regardless, it is recommended, especially to those who crave 'Women Empowerment' in a different form and shape.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Put your thinking cap on,"I have been absolutely pumped for this movie since I first saw the trailer for it last summer.

But be open to the fact that it will almost certainly not be exactly what you expect.

"With everything turned up to 11, you kind of wished the delivery of the concept was the same way","What's not to say about director Zach Snyder? So far, he hasn't missed. He pulled off the impossible by remaking a classic horror flick. He revolutionized the film industry with his amazing slo-mo techniques and incredible set designs in ""300"". And he helped recreate one of the greatest graphic novels of all time on film. Whats left you ask? How about an idea of his own? Sure he has the ability to glorify someone else's....but can his own concept match his eye.Well one things for sure, this certainly has the look of a Zach Snyder picture. By that of course i mean the action, which is next to flawless. You have your amazing slo-mo fighting sequences with hot baby doll ninja's and dragons and robots and nazi zombies.....it's any living man's virtual dream world. Combine that with beautiful set designs, pitch perfect sound mixing, absolutely amazing visual effects and an epic musical score that will rock the brain out of your skull.....it's almost too much to handle. You literally leave each action sequence as if you just got off a roller coaster.But Mr. Snyder has done all the action before, we all know it was going to be fantastic. What about the story? Well.....the overall concept really is great. The way they attack it is good.......but that's the thing, with everything running at full throttle, you kind of want the story to be right there with it. It's almost as if they knew they had a great concept, but decided to focus on the action sequences with more precision.You can also tell that they didn't pour that much heart into developing the story because aside from all the leading ladies being mouth watering, they all seemed at tad flat. There wasn't much depth to any of them, other than the fact that they are all locked in a mental facility and they can kick major ass with awesome weapons.Bottom Line......to the eyes and ears, the movie really is something to marvel at. It is beyond stunning, a visual wonder. The story is good, but the delivery is not on par with it. It's not an overall disappointment. I thought it was pretty good. But, if you are like me, and you eat your eggs with salt, here's a quick comparison. Imagine you have your eggs for breakfast, but there is no salt. No salt, that's okay, i'll still eat em', they're really good.....but, they would have tasted a lot better if it had salt. Same thing with Sucker Punch.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Disappointing ... a torture porn action video-game movie,"First of all, let me say that this movie makes no sense. The movie plot is as explained in the trailer and very little more except that it adds a PG13 ""I Spit On Your Grave"" style torture and characters. As from the trailer, it's a quest for the four items; the fifth item being a mystery - each quest prompting a grand video-gamesque action sequences.The movie starts off fine, though without explaining much, and devolves so quickly into meaningless flashy sequences devoid of any tension or meaning that you catch yourself feeling jaded of hot chicks in skimpy clothes with machine guns fighting zombie Nazis. To compensate, the movie veers into cruelty, misery and sadistic sequences; a move that offers no payback or for that matter entertainment.The anachronistic mad-house or battlefield with music from the all the decades oozes style but the poor story really brings down the quality of the movie and is a huge disappointment and more than that, it's not even good entertainment.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Defending the misunderstood film that is Sucker Punch.,"What is likely to be the most underrated movie experience of the year, Zack Snyder's barrage of girls, gun and giant samurai is a misunderstood effort from the man behind 2009's excellent adaptation of Watchmen. Yes it's not without flaws, yes it can be predictable (especially the ""5th item"") but it doesn't mean that it isn't everything that most films seem to miss these days: fun.Fun isn't usually associated with child abuse and an asylum but that is where the curtain opens the audience at. An opening silence gives great anticipation, a tragedy occurs and protagonist Baby Doll is shunted into an asylum by her step-father, where she awaits lobotomy in five days' time.It should be said at this point that this review is coming from someone who openly loathes the style over substance limbo of an era in which we live, what with CGI and 3D being used as an excuse for anything considered a showcase for this technology.Sucker Punch boasted a similar exercise course of stylish nonsense yet the finished result left this reviewer in a state of pleasant surprise; the concept was highly original – though sprinkled with an influx of other influences which ultimately could have been the films downfall had the context they been used in feel more of a parody than a series of dream sequences. Orcs, dragons and robots have never been more refreshing out of their native genres.As the visuals go, there was never going to be an issue there. It's easily Snyder's best looking film to date, and for a written debut the plot is on par with the heavily –action orientated 300 in that it takes a back seat once the films' issue has been established. It's only noticeable dent in its armour is the characterisation, or rather lack of characterisation. For a film nearing the two hour mark the audience are relatively unrewarded when trying to relate to any of the five heroines' of the story.It may be great to see that Baby Doll, Blondie, Sweet Pea, Amber and Rocket haven't been assigned to overused archetypes – that would be taking the easy route, yet there's not even been a road taken here. The characters as such remain relatively hollow, being left as shell-less, albeit undeniably attractive characters.There's not even, what you could coin as a 'Fenster' wherein a character with next to nothing about them can morph into something noticeable, even memorable. They are what could be the fully-fledged realisation Pulp Fiction's Fox Force Five, each an assassin with their own weapon speciality; perhaps this is how the audience is supposed interpret their personalities, each instrument being reflective of the character using it.That is my only complaint, everything else did, as Big Daddy put it: ""Knock(ed) me for a loop"", with three particular, but unspoiled scenes, breaking a monotony that had infected the infinite amount brainless action films that have preceded Sucker Punch – and sadly continue to follow after it. While the scenes aren't anything ground-breaking they play to Zack's strengths – detaching from the action so it does not cease to stand impressive next time round and focusing on the realism that confronts them back in the reality.Critics have mauled it, calling it ""dull"", ""senseless"" and even ""plot less"" yet the fact many fans have interpreted it as having meanings on a deeper level, particularly the importance of Sweet Pea's character, suggests there may have been a certain naivety from critics - a definite contribution to its growing cult status (there is an excellent interpretation on the IMDb Message Board that is worth a look). You could also throw weapon argument mentioned above into the mix for further evidence of such ignorance - I also stand guilty of missing this possibility.The film has also been accused of being overtly sexist, but drawing another parallel to 300, 300 men are seen topless and not a single complaint is raised. But five scantily-clad women and one imaginary brothel are seen and all hell has broken loose. 300 got a reasonable 60% on Rotten Tomatoes and Sucker Punch just 22%; both are relatively balanced in terms of their stories, character's and direction yet the reception of each is hugely unbalanced. It effectively asks who the sexist ones really are.Sucker Punch is misunderstood, not question about it. It's not the genre changing cult films that Blade Runner or Donnie Darko are, but it certainly deserves the fans that it has generated and I for one eagerly anticipate the Extended Cut to see what else it has to offer.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Viewer: Sucker Punch to the Face,"Director Zack Snyder's (""300,"" ""Watchmen"") latest film, ""Sucker Punch"" can be described by one word: bummer. Snyder is known for making films with very detailed, enthralling visual splendor. However, he proves that visuals are not enough to successfully create a good film. Starting with a brief back-story of a girl known as Babydoll (Emily Browning, ""The Uninvited"") and ending with an attempted metaphorical message, the plot is lost in the midst of action. Babydoll's story takes place in 1955 with the death of her mother leading to the attempted rape of Babydoll and her sister by their Stepfather (Gerard Plunkett, ""2012""). In order to stop her father from succeeding she tries to shoot him, but accidentally misses shooting her sister instead. She immediately drops the gun and begins running, however, she cannot escape the clutches of her Stepfather. After the police come she is taken to an insane asylum for girls known as the Lennox House. Her Stepfather pays off one of the orderlies named Blue Jones (Oscar Isaac, ""Robin Hood"") to forge the signature of Madam Gorski (Carla Gugino, ""Watchmen"") to have her lobotomized by the Doctor (Jon Hamm, ""Mad Men""). While in the mental institution, Babydoll meets fellow inmates Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish, ""Limitless""), Rocket (Jena Malone, ""The Messenger"") Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens, ""High School Musical""), and Amber (Jamie Chung, ""Grown Ups""). Immediately following, Snyder takes the audience deep within Babydoll's mind creating an ""Inception-like"" mental design of three layers. In the second layer Babydoll transforms the mental institution into a cathouse where her and her companions are just a group of entrapped prostitutes. In this mental state Babydoll is taught to dance by Madam Gorski, taking her one level further for the duration of her dance. In the deepest level she is given a mission by a Wise Man (Scott Glenn, ""Secretariat"") leading her to escape the mental hospital. Together Babydoll and her fellow inmates complete a set of five tasks in hopes of escaping before Babydoll is given to the High Roller (Also Jon Hamm) in the brothel synonymous with her lobotomy in reality.It goes without saying the only reason anyone should see this film is to see Snyder's renowned graphic grandeur. Snyder mixes of light and dark with vibrant colors to distinguish the inner most layer of Babydoll's mind from the blandness of the rest of the film. Here Snyder creates entertaining action sequences in the backdrop of his graphic effects and has a little help from Jena Malone and Scott Glenn's performances.""Sucker Punch"" is synonymous with a rolling ball of flaws attributed to a variety of different shortcomings. The film starts with very weird character development as Babydoll acts as nothing more than a mime until she finally speaks 30 minutes into the film. The viewer is also hit immediately with an over the top soundtrack playing a different song every five minutes undermining the integrity of each scene. The casting for the film is almost as random as the soundtrack with a wide range of B-list actresses coming from a variety of different backgrounds. Exhibit A: Vanessa Hudgens. What were you thinking Snyder? ""High School Musical"" to ""Sucker Punch""? Need I say more? While, along with the fact that Emily Browning and Jamie Chung may as well be labeled as unknowns, Oscar Isaac and Carla Gugino are out of place in this film. Also, it really is sad that the best actor in the film, Jon Hamm, is only in the film for a minute or two. This combined with a very poorly written script massacred the film creating horrid situational clichés and predictable outcomes.One-dimensional characters and an ending reaching for metaphorical meaning vastly overshadow Snyder's special effects. Therefore the only special thing about Snyder's latest film is the fact that the viewer gets ""Sucker Punched"" in the face as the film goes down as one of the greatest letdowns of 2011.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

One reason for the dullness to me is because the girls wasn't delivering enough bad-ass-ness(but are still hot). The added touch of the ultra-tough body physics which you see in anime or manga was quite interesting and different.Despite the cliché dialog and redundant guns and katana fight scene that you see ever so often these days, Sucker Punch is still quite joyful to watch, because of all the things guys can't resist liking.

Interesting Concept. Uninteresting Execution.,"How Sucker Punch manages to be such a dull, tedious & unstimulating adventure despite its wacky premise is beyond me! The film takes an interesting approach to explore its seemingly ambitious ideas and is also brimming with style & eye-candy visuals yet its plot & characters are so poorly carved & lacking in everything that the story never for once manages to create any sort of intrigue whatsoever.Co-written & directed by Zack Snyder (300 & Watchmen), the story opens with an instantly captivating prologue that expertly illustrates Snyder's visual splendour & stylistic flourishes. However, once our young protagonist retreats to an alternative reality, things start heading downhill thereafter. Even the fantasy within the fantasy realm fails to reignite any interest in the outcome, for the characters are never compelling to begin with.The story offers nothing for the viewers to latch on to. Events unfold with such blandness that sitting through them becomes a chore after a while. Its over-the-top action has a video-game quality to it but no sense of threat or danger to make the segment even remotely entertaining. Performances are serviceable at best, with only Oscar Isaac leaving some kind of impression. The musical choices are rather obvious, and the film's CGI has dated severely over the years.Overall, Sucker Punch probably knows what it wants to say but is completely clueless about how to say it. A dry, lacklustre & convoluted mess that attempts to steer itself past the finish line solely on visual thrills, this action fantasy is marred by insipid writing & shoddy direction, and remains an emotionally distant fare for the most part. While there is an arresting appeal to its imagery, much of it is still hollow from within. In short, an utterly mediocre & uninspiring genre offering.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

Also got horribly flat acting, extremely bad dialogue that makes fast and furious movies sound like the king's speech, sporadic action scenes where everything is shaky cam intertwined with fast cuts to hide bad choreography, absolutely no character development, a dream within 2 dreams only 1 of which actually has an ""intro"" that identifies going in and out of.Now for the jist of the actual plot vs what actually happens on screen. Main character goes to asylum and immediately imagines it being a ""gentlemns"" club without any sort of transition into this dream state interpretation to let you know its started. Then when she supposedly starts dancing she is so ""raw"" that she mesmerizes all the men watching her while in the mean time her mind wanders around and we see 5 minute displays of nazi zombies, lord of the rings and i robot in her different dream sequences. The problem here is they also show no dancing, she just swings 2 centimeters left and then right and the dream starts...When she comes to from those dance-dreams, absolutely every scene has girls crying in it and comforting each other, there's no difference to move the story forward.Lastly i saved the visual effects for last because i love movies alone based on them, like 2012, even if its weak in other parts. There are very few movies that come to mind that have this bad and blatant CGI that i've seen. People saying its supposed to be a ""fantasy"" setting don't understand that fantasy is not a way to describe ""bad"".Also, just as a side note for guys who thinks there's eye candy in this worth it enough to see, get your ticket money and go buy a calendar with random girls for each month. You'll get more out of it.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"If you're going to see it, see it on the big screen... (or a big telly!)","This is one of the most surprised I've been by a film. Whether that's in a good way or a bad way I'm yet to decide.One thing I will say... this WON'T be what you're expecting. Any synopsis you read will be true, but vague. Expect the unexpected.Without spoiling it for anyone, the story of 'Sucker Punch' takes us on the journey of ""BabyDoll"" an abused young woman put into care by her evil stepfather. What follows is a very enjoyable (if VERY strange) action flick. If you like guns, monsters, and girls not wearing much for an hour and a half, then this is a film for you.The thing that gives this review an undisputed 7/10 in my opinion is the visuals. Every sequence in this film has something about it. Whether it's the way the moonlight is caught shining through babydoll's window in the very first scene, or one of the vast landscapes during the action scenes, there will be SOMETHING that takes your breath away.If you buy the DVD, and watch it on a portable TV, I don't think you'll enjoy it.Watch it on the big screen, this could be a big success!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This film is everything that's wrong with Hollywood these days,"Lots of flashy visuals, Snyder's 'trademark' slow-mo fights, big robots, dragons, improbably attractive women.. The comic book genre has become an excuse to churn out complete vacuous films with no depth, minimal dialogue and a total lack of direction.I won't even bother spoiling the plot for you, it's just an excuse to show some flashy visuals anyway. For the good of the film industry, people need to stop lapping this s**t up.Hmm, I can't even fill 10 lines of text talking about this film, that's how empty it is!

More than expected,"Well, at first i though ''another naked warrior girls movie'' but this is way too far from my point of view. It's really great talking about effects, really good they are! The performance of the actresses is credible and well done. You know and believe they're suffering for something... and the trials to scape are really an effort for them. I think they have really good scenes, but in some parts they abused with that ''Matrix'' slow motion effect. But in all the other ways is really worthy to be seen. Is not only meant for men, but for everyone, because it has good performances, credible characters, almost perfect effects, really outstanding music (a lot of them are remixed songs, really gorgeous!) and a lot of action mixed with drama everywhere.

"Movie patrons ""suckered"" into seeing ""Sucker Punch""?","""Sucker Punch"" could have almost been a career-ender for all the talent involved in making this well shot but poorly written film. It's the perfect example of when bad writers get a hold of a good director and do too many mind altering narcotics. The talent brought to the table as far as CGI, direction and even mild to potentially promising acting all couldn't have saved this film.If the media blitz for Sucker Punch wouldn't have been as good as they were, this film would have been a catastrophic loss and packed the bags for a few folks tagged to this film who wouldn't have the means to survive it. Unfortunately, Sucker Punch is a $10 script with a $10 million dollar backing sadly. The previews did what they could to sell the little action in the film, but I don't see it doing well in retail sales once the pitch forking reviewers and those unlucky souls that saw the film get done stringing it up in town square.I feel badly for the actresses, stunt coordinators and even the director that put a lot of hard labored attention to detail into the film that was all built on a poorly written script. The plot transitioned horribly from reality to the fantasy realm and could have been done simpler and easier with just a bit more thought about how they were going to go about it. The other was era issues. The era originally started was that of maybe the 50's. Then in the fantasies, we are hit with a modern arsenal of weaponry and then thrown back into medieval weaponry and then forwarded into robots. And I get it, it's a fantasy so anything is possible. But if it's the 50's, should a cute girl in a sexy cosplay outfit be holding a laser sighted auto magazine AR15 with a silencer? Just saying, stay within a realm of illusion. If you are going to jump all over the place with it, make it within a usable and believable setting.The direction I would have gone in writing the films was to pull the characters into a dream world and stay in that world until completion of the film and only hint back to the original reality based one. Movies that do an alternate realm of reality really tread lightly when doing this to make it seamless. You see this in well written fantasy sci-fi like The Matrix, Tron... hell, even those dumb ass Narnia films can pull it off.Lastly, the dialogue and setups in the reality world were just too damn long and drawn out. You sit there for almost an hour before anything good really happens. I am sorry, it just took too damn long to get too damn little CGI payout. The music was all just re-hashed out music from the 90's that for some reason, ended up in a 50's genre movie. I did love the fighting scenes and choreography, which is what kept me from ripping it apart fully. The film is shot in perfect light, great use of shading for characters and amazing setup for the backgrounds of the fight scenes but the film plot is just worthless. Would have made a great films though. Pity, I had high hopes for this one.Sadly, ""Sucker Punch"" is unfortunately a huge let down as a big screen sizzler. It would do best as a rental but not a purchasable DVD until it hit the $2.99 bin. Maybe they should have tried to make a ""300"" Part 2 or something and saved everyone's time as that was what folks were expecting, in all honesty. Maybe next time, maybe next time. Till then, will you be a ""sucker"" and see this film ???",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Sublime and unexpected if you stick with it,"I recently came back to this film, after it made an impression the first time around after it's initial release.It it one of those films that is quite hard to get into if it is not what you are expecting. In particular it is somewhat art house, but frankly there is a lot more to it than first seems, an abrupt adjustment of expectations may be required however.An important thing to mention I think is that the film is in my view a series of metaphors, which only becomes apparent at the very end. It is a bit of a puzzle, but it is also not quite akin to such films as 2001 that may leave you hanging for an answer.I won't want to say what happens, I think it deserves a watch, but some pointers are usefulThe film starts out, essentially in reality, in the portrayal of a girl who is sent to an asylum. The film then quickly enters the realm of metaphor, and a series of trials in an attempt to find escape. At the end of the film you find yourself grounded in reality again.The problem with the film is perhaps this unexpected sudden shift, into seemingly unbounded art house / music TV style, and the un-aware viewer may be left wondering what is going on, or feeling it may be self aggrandizing.If you make it half way though the film then it becomes clear what the intent is; in that the story is a series of metaphoric struggles for freedom, and quite frankly, when, and if you appreciate this type of work then it is quite a sublime watch, the likes of which you may not see again.There is an incredible amount of detail and work in this piece which makes it all the more immersive, once you have overcome the jolt that propels you into it's other worldly nature.In honestly it's really very good, the only thing that lets the film down is the lead in to the fantasy played out. I would recommend it as a solid film though, better than many in the somewhat 'off beat' category if you will.The ending should not let down, it may not be entirely unexpected, and makes sense, but it is well executed, and keenly poignant.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Be unprepared,"In it's entire, the film is great to watch. However I did expect more from Zach Snyder. The slogan 'You will be unprepared' didn't apply to me since I've been waiting to see this since I saw the teaser, which was about a half year ago, so I expected a lot from it. So maybe I was too prepared and was therefor disappointed after wards, the same feeling I had with Watchmen.Furthermore the film tries to send a message that, with me at least, didn't come through. The magnificent action-scenes make me forget that there is something more to the film. You have to remember the storyline and pay attention to every word to follow the plot, which can be hard with all that shooting.You should see the film if you like Snyder's work, if not you should go for the action. Go see it unprepared, with not the highest expectations, and you will enjoy it more than me.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Imagination Can Be Your Guide,"At least that's the case with Baby Doll in ""Sucker Punch"". Being housed in the Lennox House which houses the mentally insane, she plans to escape the facility with four other girls. In the process, the girls need to collect five things: a map of the entire facility, an item that can start a fire, a knife, the key to all the doors in the whole facility, and a mystery that only Baby Doll can retrieve.What's appealing about the movie is the visual effects and the action scenes. I enjoyed these scenes thoroughly. Ninjas, machine guns, bombs, even dragons are all here to create some noise. The rendering of the alternative world and all the sets are amazing. These two things are definitely the key points of this movie.However, everything else was average, to mediocre, or even to poor.The plot was quite simple and I believe that the filmmakers could have done a better job on that. The film opens with a teenager nicknamed Baby Doll (Emily Browning) crying with her sister over their mother's death. Because of that, they have to live with their cruel father. After the sisters' father read his wife's final will and testament, he gets angry and kills Baby Doll's younger sister. Later, Baby Doll is accused of being her sister's killer and is later brought to the Lennox House with her father claiming that she is mentally ill. Baby Doll later meets four other girls: Rocket (Jena Malone), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish), and Amber (Jamie Chung). The five girls then plan to escape the facility. Here's the strange part: the girls later enter their own imaginative world where they fight against the ninjas and others to obtain the five items in the alternative world, as well as in the real world.Bizarre and simple the plot is, the acting and the script were also cheesy. The acting was unconvincing sometimes and the script sounds awkward in some parts of the film.The characters also got ridiculous names. I know it's their nicknames, but, a fighting warrior whose tough is named Baby Doll? What? That's not all. Sweet Pea? Amber, Rocket, and Blondie still sounded better than Sweet Pea and Baby Doll.To point out, there were several unanswered questions that struck my brain through the movie, with answers I'm very curious to find out. Whenever the girls want to go to the world in their heads, Baby Doll must dance to a rock song (I guess) before they can go in and kick ass. In one scene where Baby Doll dances the routine for the first time, she enters the world in her head and fights against three 10-foot-tall ninjas. She jumped around, ran around, screamed in pain, sliced her enemies, and dodged attacks. When she's back in the real world, she received laurels from everyone for her ""amazing"" dance. The question is, how did she dance? Could she be really slicing the air, jumping around the room, and screaming around in her dance?That's not the only one. There are more. Another one is that when the girls visit their imaginative world for the first time, why didn't they feel amazed? I know it's their imagination, but, a little ""wow"" or surprised look. Instead, they look like they've been into their world for a thousand times often.The last one I want to point out (but I'm sure there are still others in the movie still yet to be discovered) is that how in the world did Baby Doll fight against the ninjas in her imagination, winning the fight, when she's fighting using high heels? If you observe, she fights around using high heels, dodging the opponents' strikes and attacks. I mean, I've never seen a person, fight and dodging attacks with high heels. Imagine Alice from ""Resident Evil"" running around shooting zombies, escaping from the zombies using high heels.That's all to discuss about the movie. Overall, ""Sucker Punch"" is a winner in terms of action scenes and visual effects. However, the acting, script, and the things that made me confused were mediocre to poor. The film would've gotten a low score if it weren't for the visual effects and the action scenes. But because of the two, the film was desperate enough to earn a 7 for me.In terms of recommendation, ""Sucker Punch"" is recommended for those who look forward to action scenes, great visual effects, and (possibly) hot girls. I don't think this movie would be suitable for kids because of the violence and the prominence of the girls. But it's up to you parents.In conclusion, ""Sucker Punch"" is an entertaining two-hour adventure of stunning visual effects and action scenes, with everything else mediocre to poor.Prince AJB's Score: 70%",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Film Designed to Punish its Audience,"After ten minutes of this film, I walked out. I had some doubt about  this decision until I read on ComicBookMovie.com how the  writer/director Zack Snyder explains the meaning of the title:   ""I think sucker punch sums it up for me. Look, literally it's like a  mechanism in the film that kind of brings us back into reality I think.  But I think on the other hand, because the movie is a slight indictment   it talks about geek culture and pop culture, it talks about the why  of the action cinema and stuff of that nature  it's also a sucker  punch because I kind of designed it that you go to this movie for  entertainment and you get a little bit f*cked up by it, hopefully.  (http://www.comicbookmovie.com/fansites/BrentSprecher/news/?a=33931)""  In other words, the whole point of the film is to punish people like me  who go to see action films.   He goes on to compare action films to brothels and to compare those of  us who watch them to leering men who visit brothels. This makes me very  angry. If I had known about this as I walked out of the movie, I would  also have asked for my money back. Maybe I still will ask for my money  back. Maybe I will go back to the theater with my ticket and my receipt  and demand my admission fee.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Sucker Punch packs a lot of punches,"Zack Snyder, the director 300 and Watchmen, has been finally given a chance to do a film based on his original creation. When I first heard of the movie, I knew this will be something special. It would be both a beautiful looking film and an insane thrilling ride.It's hard for me to sum up what the entire film is in a nutshell but I can say this. This film is the collection of all of Snyder's films put into one. The visual look of Watchmen, his female warrior version of 300 (minus 295 of them), the slow motion technique in all of his movie and finally topping it all off with his own creative world.This is the first film I seen in theaters in a long time but I can simply say that while Sucker Punch may not be the best film of the year or the greatest movie ever made but it will be on my best film of the year list.Author's Note: I gave this film a 10/10. To be honest, I don't rate a movies with a 10 because its too high of a number to rate a movie. So if I had to rate Sucker Punch out of 4 stars, I give it 3 and a half stars.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I really did want to like this...,"... but I just couldn't. Escapism? I love video games, fantasy, comics and all number of geeky things(including mindless viewing of naked women), but just couldn't escape how nothing really connected at all. One massive discombobulation! I was constantly being slapped in the face with reasons why almost every scene just did not work. Visually? yes pretty stunning, but when I realize what I'm seeing, its just irritating. The sound and dialogue were the worst next to the story telling and acting. Except for the Kid Rock(ewww)& Queen(yay) song mashing collaboration, all of the other numbers picked for the score were really good, originally recorded that is! These are some of the worst song covers I can remember, some of which were sang by the protagonist as well to insult your ears.I'm sure fans of this film will think that I just don't get the concepts, but the concepts are very very obvious.... impossible to even try and ignore, so its definitely not ""over my head"" or anything. This is Eye candy, a visually overwhelming disaster that sounds like .... uh... whatever you don't like the sound of! Wish I could have just turned off the stereo at the movie grill and tried to enjoy it in silence.Surely individuals concerned about gender roles and sexism will be thoroughly insulted by this stew pot of total over sexualized murder, rape and abuse.PS its always a special tragedy when a great Beatles song is butchered, in my worthless opinion.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Vapid Rubbish,"Sucker Punch takes visual sophistication to its extreme and fails catastrophically. The weak plot is little more than a pretext to shove as many nonsensical CGI action scenes into the movie. One cannot help but think that Sucker Punch is a teenage video game addict's fantasy, with scantily clad women battling extraordinary beasts with big guns and swords.Sucker Punch's visuals quickly lose their charm too, as the confused spectator will begin to wonder if the onslaught of CGI and cliché action scenes have any actual purpose.

Oscar Isaac gives the best performance by far, a completely unhinged, intimidating and unsettling performance.Zack Snyder's direction is ridiculously stylish, full of epic action sequences that are mindless fun with his trademark style intact. The music by Tyler Bates and Marius Devries and the song choices are both really good, enhancing all the action set pieces with even more style.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Action packed with great CGI and gorgeous girls.,"""Sucker Punch"" is a visual treat from start to finish. There is no deep meaning that people on the IMDb review boards keep trying to find. It is simply made up of action packed segments, dominated by excellent special effects and the sort of girls you'd love to have on your arm (unless you are a girl).This is style over substance. The acting is ordinary. The dialogue is average. The operational brain cells required to enjoy the chaotic spectacle going on in front of your eyes are virtually zero. It's loud. It's fun. And at the end, you may feel sucker punched. I was certainly bruised.Funnily enough, the best portrayal comes from Scott Glenn who plays the mysterious guide. He is brilliant. His role is small, but he more than makes up for it with a consummate performance. He captures the mystery of the character to perfection. His cool, assured demeanour is in sharp contrast to the perilous situations that the girls find themselves in.The film got poor reviews but the critics failed to see it for what it really is - brash, almost pornographic, nonsensical chaos that enlivens the senses and blows your mind. When Zack Snyder made ""Sucker Punch"", he filled the special effects tank full of gasoline and slammed the pedal to the floor. He wasn't interested in script or characterisation so don't expect any.The poor worldwide box office can be put down to ""Sucker Punch"" being too action packed and violent for the girls and because too many men still have a problem with watching gorgeous scantily clad women kick ass. Okay, this isn't as good as ""300"", but it isn't that far off either. The worldwide total of less than $90 million is a travesty.The girls are undeniably gorgeous and the storyline is undeniably thrown together without any thought whatsoever. However, it is the CGI and the soundtrack that are the stars of the show here. Lots of noise, plenty of anger, a high level of violence and a whole lot of breath-taking action. Oh and I hope I didn't forget to mention the gorgeous half-naked ass kicking girls.If you expect anymore than the above, you will be sorely disappointed.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

Exactly what the trailers promised,"If you thought the trailer and plot summary seemed silly then by all means listen to the critics and don't go see it, but if you were excited by the trailers and thought the story might be interesting then I advise you to go see it.The first and third trailer and part of the second were not your average trailer, they had barely any dialog and you basically got that sick action to the sound of some wicked music. That's exactly what's in the movie, and frankly talking would just have ruined it, the action and music are all you need.From the trailer we can tell that Scott Glenn says the cheesiest lines and it's so cheesy compared to the other characters that there's just no way it's not intentional, but he actually does it quite well, the guys in the Expendables movie wish they could say cheesy lines so well.Like I said, the other actors are nothing like Scott Glenn's character, who resides in the imaginary, they are all flesh and blood and have deep emotions. The middle section of the movie is quite intense and I dare anyone to say anything bad about Oscar Isaac's performance, he was great throughout. The girls are very good too and honestly made some action stars look bad in comparison.Now I really have to mention again that the middle portion of the movie, that takes place in the train with the robots and what follows, is the highlight of the movie, if the rest of the movie had matched that part critics would be seeing the movie in a much more positive light. It features the best action, the stakes at hand are tangible and an already intense scene gets even more intense when Blue lays down the law, again incredible performance by Oscar Isaac.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Zack Snyder on autopilot.,"This is by far, Zack Snyder's worst movie until present time. However, it is still a ravishing visual spectacle, guided by a magnificent feminine bombshell cast and accompanied by an electrically dynamic soundtrack.The problem is that these elements are unable to delete the sensation of a story sometimes told in a 'videoclip' manner and the ''300'' director on a autopilot mode, only concerned with the film's aesthetic outlook.Despite that narrative ellipsis, this is a perfect Sunday afternoon popcorn flick, presenting itself as a delirium 'video game' crossing between ''The Matrix'' and ''Charlie's Angels''.

"Suckered, Punched","This film encapsulates almost everything wrong with the state of high-concept, blockbuster, CGI-laden filmmaking these days.To wit: bad writing, bad acting, nonsensical story, bad mixtures of fantasy and reality, over reliance on computer graphics.But hey, the music was cool! Not even sure if this film could have been saved with better writing, better casting, better acting, better directing. The whole idea is just so flawed at its foundation.Fantasy sequences, within fantasy sequences, within dream sequences. Muddled to the point where, honestly, who cared? If the ""reality"" sequences in the mental hospital, the first few scenes, had been a little less stylized, I might have bumped it up a few points. Reality can be drab, and should be somewhat drab especially in a mental hospital in a non-specific past time. However, the drab reality of the mental hospital setting was equally stylized and comic-book like as the ballet school/jail/nightclub/whorehouse, or whatever it was supposed to be.And that just turned the whole movie into a mess.And what does the title even MEAN? It could have been called FLIGHTS OF FANCY, or HELL HOLE, or BRAIN DRAIN, or FIGHT TO BE FREE, or YOU HAVE ALL THE WEAPONS YOU NEED, or any one of many other titles that would have been WAY more appropriate.But I will give it a 3 for the extremely competent CGI work and the great music choices. The fact that those choices were in service of a really bad idea means that I can't possibly go any higher than that.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"You can't spell ""Sucker Punch"" without ""suck""","Wow Here I was, thinking I was going to get to see an awesome comic- like film about a group of girls kickin' a whole lotta butt surrounded by mind-bending fantasy scenery.Technically, I was right But only technically. Sucker Punch is like Chinese food. You can eat three plates and it will still leave you feeling hungry. It's a great deal of empty calories, is basically what I'm saying. Substance? Nah.Let me just get right into it. What's wrong with Sucker Punch is the screenplay. Not the actors, not the director, just the story. This story revolves around a group of five girls in an institution for the mentally insane, in a fantastical, steampunk-wannabe 1940's (my best guess) setting. They are treated horribly and their lives are miserable, and to cope with it all, the main protagonist Babydoll, escapes into her fantasies and in this trance-like state, devises a plan for them all to escape.The concept is not bad. It might have even been really exciting, had it not been executed so laughably unrealistic. And by 'unrealistic', I don't mean the fantasies themselves. I'm referring to the fact that these fantasies were so obviously not dreamed up by an actual teenage girl, but rather they look like the perfect fulfillment of the wet wishes of a horny teenage boy. It is very likely that a teenage girl WOULD dream of being able to wield a samurai sword and beat up every monster, dragon and every other kind of bastard who crosses her path. She WOULD dream of coming out of every battle completely unscathed and with every hair on her pretty head still perfectly in place. She would NOT, however, be doing all of this scantily clad in sexy lingerie wearing fishnet stockings and high heels I am a girl, with very vivid imagination. Trust me on this one. It was, in one word, ridiculous.Another thing that really bothered me was the way these characters were worked out. As obviously miserable as their personal predicaments were, I could not relate to a single one of them. They were all completely 2- dimensional and just flat-out uninteresting. I didn't care about what happened to a single one of them. I don't believe all of the blame for this falls on the actresses (although theirs weren't exactly Oscar winning performances...), again, I chalk it up to poor screen writing. The only one who was able to make her character slightly more than moderately interesting, was not even one of 'the girls', it was Dr. Vera Gorski, played by Carla Gugino. At least she was interesting to watch, and she was even somewhat of a scene-stealer, taking much thunder away from the girls simply because she (both the actress and the character) had the biggest personality. All the others, I felt were mostly just going through the motions, because they had zero character development and no interesting dialogue to work with. And that's bad when you're talking about the characters that are supposed to carry the story. A pleasant (and much needed surprise) came in the form of Scott Glenn, who only appears in the fantasy segments as several different versions of a wise man. That was a nice touch.However, the one thing that really stood out for me as the true axis of failure that sums up Sucker Punch, was the feeling of total confusion that was present from the beginning and never cleared up. I'm not saying I didn't 'get it', I'm saying it was a hot, incoherent mess. And I usually don't mind being thrown back and forth and to and fro throughout a film, I don't mind playing guessing games and wondering what it will all lead to. I DO mind when the roller-coaster ride is over and all I feel is queasy. Some people have suggested that this is a really deep and complex film, but honestly, I think they're just reading too much into it. The stupid thing is, for the most part it was completely predictable, and STILL it lacked structure and decent storytelling. That may seem like a paradox, but there's an easy way to explain it. In the words of the great Roger Ebert: ""Now that's bad filmmaking.""The only element in Sucker Punch that was somewhat redeeming, were the visual effects. I must say, it was all very gorgeous and eye-pleasing. Also, the soundtrack was excellent, filled with very well performed covers of well-known songs and some perfectly chosen originals. Emily Browning, who plays Babydoll (and also sings a few songs on the soundtrack), was a good choice for the lead role, but I must say, in all honesty, that was mostly because she was visually very appealing as the main protagonist. More simply put – she was very pretty. Still, I'm not sure that's enough to carry a film.All in all, I'm left feeling – Zack Snyder Dude. What were you thinking. You can do so much better than this. I guess I just finally have to come to terms with the fact that everybody's human and is bound to make one big mistake at least once in their lives. Zack this is yours.Sucker Punch sucks.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Who is getting the sucker punch?,"I enjoyed many movies based on comics and novels. But definitely feel like I got sucker punched when I came out of the theater.

Costume and shoes change constantly throughout single action scene makes one's head spin. With all the CGI at their disposal, why am I staring at the hole on Browning's face which seem like a recent blackhead removed? Just wait for rental if you really like them girls. 2 out of 10 because there are girls in scanty outfits. I think I'll avoid Zack Snyder's movie from now on.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Just as you thought, you are unprepared- a film about the awesomeness of what is Action.","I attended the midnight showing of the film last night and here are my two cents:Let's start out with the fact that I really enjoyed the movie. It was no forest gump, but looking at the Director's history, no one should be expecting that anyway. Having previously directed Dawn of the Dead, 300, and Watchmen, this one fits in pretty well in the mix. The style is more Watchmen-esque than 300, but man may there be violence, and much appreciated! Oh, and the costumes are just what the demographic ordered. Though from the previews I may have been predisposed to expect a more straightforward storyline, kicking and fighting it's way to a climactic finish (possibly a little twist thrown in there); I was happily dazed enough to enjoy myself.As I write this I am still trying to piece together the understory and back goings of the film. When I initially left the theater, though stunned in a sense of sheer awe, I was quite sure that I ""got"" the whole idea: Pretty straightforward, classic Indie-esque Hollywood action film. Wrong. But as I lay in bed earlier this morning trying to gather my thoughts after waking up from a Sucker Punch of a dream, I realized that I had missed something: The morality of the film. It was deep, and the more I think about it the more I realize it. This film had more guts than I realize. It wasn't only great slo-mo, poster/wallpaper-worthy brilliance (Though that it was). It had real soul. In fact I'm toying with the idea of a second watch, sort of how you rematch the Matrix Reloaded just for that epic car chase scene; but hopefully here to also flesh out some of the ideals behind the whole thing.It was an epic struggle between hot chicks and bad guys, and worth the dollar for the big screen. And to boot, the film is on its way to passing my test: ""Occupies my thoughts for the next couple days"". And therefore I give it a burn-out and beat the Mustang-driving-teenager-in-the-lane next-to-you green light. If you liked Mr. Synder's (the Director) past films, you like action, or you like girls, or you're just a man; this is a good one. Go see it some night after your boss makes you sit through a two-hour meeting on Synergy. ...Then go home and change your wife's wardrobe for her. A",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastic CG. Game fans will love this,"Coming from the director of 300 and Watchmen if you expect anything less of action and CG from Sucker Punch, you are dead wrong! You will be instantly blown away by the visual effects and the sheer amount of mind blowing action throughout this flick.The plot is not complicated yet when you watch it you will definitely be lost here and there. The story is about a girl (AKA Baby Doll) who is abused by her stepfather and then condemned in to a mental asylum. While she plots to escape from the horrible place she gets the help from few other girls. With her buddies and borderless vivid imagination she set up a plan to get away and set to execute it step by step.Sucker Punch is all about visual fantasy than being a hard hit story line. Sexy set of girls wearing tight pants and skinnies shooting and kicking the butts of weird creatures and robots and Hitler's mechanic army doesn't sound realistic at all. But when the movie rolls out each of these scenarios becomes practically extravagant with minute and breathtaking detail. Some of the action sequences like the attacking of robots in disarming the nuclear bomb (AKA kitchen Knife) are totally amazing. The work done for CG, live action and set creation is maybe one of the best which I have seeing in recent movie making.Thought The plot is weak it's not entirely bad. From one angle it's a psychological thriller. From another it's a fantasy. Put them together it's a thrilling movie about an escape plan made uniquely than any other. And the fantastic sound track consists of heavy metal and soft rock music just purely adds up to the thrill. And the first 5 mts of the movie is purely a ground breaking start with a touch of a music video. Fantastic!More at flickshout.tk",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not a Fun Action Movie,"To start off, I like dumb action movies, I even liked 300 and Watchmen. But this is a terrible movie for two very good reasons. One is the characters, which is to say there are none. Nobody has a personality in this movie, you could swap the main character for any one of the other girls and it wouldn't make the slightest bit of difference, she's just 'special' because the plot demands it. Yes it's a dumb action movie, but I still want the characters to be likable, to actually be interested and care about them. Leonidas was a badass warrior, Rorschach was an insane vigilante. The main character here is...a pretty girl. That's it. I dare you to find another personality trait on this chick because she does not have one and shows zero emotion during this film, she doesn't even look like she's having fun making a cheesy movie like Ahnold might be able to bring to a dumb action movie. And lets not forget the main villain is a weaselly dude that most of the girls tower over, so don't expect to find him menacing either.So that leaves the action to save things. And it doesn't. The movie doesn't have the visceral gore of Snyder's other movies since this is PG-13, so the CGI battles are all bloodless gun battles and chopping up CGI effects. And what I said about characters hurts things here too because there are no standout baddies to fight. Only the first fight of the movie features any sort of trouble for our hero, after that it's just mowing down hundreds of faceless dudes which gets boring surprisingly quick. There's no Agent Smith, no Darth Vader, no climatic battle where our heroes have to summon up all their strength to defeat the main villain. Just chop chop, shoot shoot, done.You wanna see this movie? Watch the trailer, guess how it ends. You just saved yourself some time and money. The only positive thing I have to say about this movie is the girls are quite nice looking, but this is the Internet, finding pretty girls to ogle isn't terribly difficult.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Better, and smarter, than they say","I think you should know, that actually these types of things happen a lot; corruption in state or federal funded facilities, coping strategies/defense mechanisms. But one thing that is very rare, is a young person (the antagonist) having as much power and influence as the dude in this movie had. That is unheard of. I am sure the writer of the movie has just never been in the system before, or just knew he had to make the character young for the movie to work.As u know, the girl has fantasies as a coping strategy as she decides to escape the looney bin. The story alternates between the fantasy viewpoint of her escape, and the real life version of the escape.The movie is just strange. I get it, but I think the fantasy view was just too far fetched and irrelevant. The fantasy also left some questions unanswered. I think the general idea of the movie had potential, but it got lost somewhere in production.This movie is better than people say. I think most people also aren't aware of how common psychosis and defense mechanisms are. That also played into why so many people didn't like it.Give it a chance, it was worth watching, but there is merit to the criticism you have heard.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
a sucker,"I voted 6 stars for 2 reasons only, the CGI and the soundtrack... if it wasn't for the mentioned above reasons, the film would be unwatchable, the story is lame and predictable.The first 10 minutes of the movie were very very promising but unfortunately it took a turn to the worse. Started out as a dark movie with a complicated plot, which turned out to be an extended PS3 gameAnyways its worth watching once. The fight scenes are nice though, exactly like video games with ""easy mode"" on, killing thousands and left unhurt.4 stars for the story and 8 for special effects and soundtrack.. an average of 6 stars for the whole movie",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Great cast, entertaining plot","I remember when I saw it for the first time, I wish I could watch it again and have the same feeling.It's a movie that absorbs you from the first moment, the choice of actors is excellent and the plot is well thought.It has a lot of adventures and different sets that allows the viewer to inmerse himself and relate to the girls inside the house.We know is not based on a true story, giving the movie a fantasy touch; but it has real life hard moments. The villains are real life villains and they have their counterparts in those fantasy worlds.The movie is displayed most of the time like it was anime, and that is benefitial for those who like it, but not in my case.Even so, the movie is entertaining and when the final strikes, It gives you the need to be there and do something or just be one of the girls inside the house.I liked the final though.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
style over content,"I feel almost ashamed having paid to see this movie. And I even brought my thirteen year old son and his friend. Needless to say, we were all bored beyond words.This is a catastrophe of a movie. A true example of a director with no sense of emotional storytelling and who instead relies completely on his talent and love for special effects and CGI.It's a disgrace to the audience.It's pointless.It's boring.During the screening my son leaned over and whispered ""Dad, they should make a video game of this movie.""The director may have brought us the original 300, but this shows us that he has a lot to learn of the masters.

Zack Snyder's cruelty once again finds it's audience,"Listening to Emily Browning's adaptation of Eurythmics's Sweet Dreams, i must say i found some decisions in the movie-making process very bizarre, decisions made mainly by Zack Snyder, coming right out of the blue.For example, he wrote the script directly as a PG-13 movie, something very untypical for him.In an interview, he stated, that the movie was already to cruel and the story itself was too hard on viewers for him to make it an R-rated movie.So he did it directly for PG-13.When does that ever stopped him to do it.In Watchmen, there were some pretty intense and gross, so to say, scenes, that it was hard to bear.And in Sucker Punch, the opening scene was intense, full of emotions, so was the ending as well, but that's not a reason for Zack no to do what he's best at.So that was a sucker punch for the audience, and as well a reason for the movie not to fit in to the frame of most Zack Snyder movies.Even his remake of Romero's Dawn of the Dead was performing better at the domestic box office in it's start, not to mention Watchmen and 300.Besides that, there are some plot holes to be seen here or there, acting to be improved and some other details, that need to be touched to be perfect.So saying all that, i shall explain why i'll rather give the movie the full note than apply those weaknesses to the note.Zack Snyder has those skills, i personally think no other director has.He has the ability to speak to the audience with his style with what we see on screen, combined with the powerful soundtracks and songs he and Tyler Bates, the composer, use.He lets his visually rich and upgraded style speak for himself, and that's very unique for him and for the movies he make.There literary is no dialogue in the first few minutes of the movie, he allows the viewer to see and be a part of the experience, of those frames.The feeling in the viewer is stronger when it's all shown, rather than spoken of.Actions are stronger than words.And Zack Snyder knows that.With him words are not necessary for the strenght of a movie.And that he makes perfect good use of.That's what's impressive with his work, and that's why i'll give the full note to the movie, as i did to 300 and Watchmen despite some flaws and holes.Otherwise, the CGI was great, the movie as a whole is a visual masterpiece and people will see that a lot of effort and commitment is sacrificed for the quality, the movie has.The crystal clear shots, made a little 60s like, are great and the fight sequences and than the train and castle sequences in the imaginary world, that Babydoll's in are great.So there can't be any complaints about that.The acting was something that could've been up a little bit.Emily Browning is very lovable and convincing in her role as Babydoll, a young girl, who experienced the death of her mother and sister, and her stepfather, involved in it.He institutionalizes her and she reprises this part of her role almost perfect.She has the needed experience from her last movie, The Uninvited, where the role is very similar to this one, at least most of it.Shid did a perfect job with the other part of her role as well, being a somewhat silent but very skillful and good looking deadly warrior, killing everything in her way to survive in the imaginary world she creates, in the brothel and in the mental institution she's at.Abbie Cornish was also solid in her role as one of the girls in the facility.Vera Gorski and Blue Jones, played by Carla Gugino and Oscar Isaac were good as well, although his role is very unpleasant so to say.So the acting was good and it's obvious, that the cast had a great time together.That's mainly because of another great choice Zack Snyder and Tyler Bates've made.They let Emily Browning, who, aside from her acting skills, is obviously a talented singer as well, perform some of the songs, for example Sweet Dreams and Asleep, both of witch were reprised and remade perfectly for the film.The voices of the other actresses can be heard in the background of the songs.So that made a great bond between the actors and what helped to improve the movie.So with some great decisions from the team and some great performances from the cast (mainly Emily Browning pulling the movie forward), the movie ended up as a very entertaining movie-going experience, sad and intense at moments, breathtaking and cool in others.All in all, it could've been better but i liked it like that as well and in order to get some things straight, i'm ready to see it once more.I liked it, one of the first movies a really liked this year, and although this wasn't Zack Snyder's best effort financially, the movie definitely has it's fans, and so it marks the true beginning of the movie season.Not Zack Snyder's best, but i'll give it the full note anyway.Bring on Superman:Man of Steel!10/10P.S.There are tributes to some classics in the movie, classics such as LOTR, i'm sure you'll notice them :)",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Youth Art,"Complaining about this movie is like complaining that a Monet is blurry, or that Memento is confusing. This isn't a linear allegory where each thing exactly represents something, and the construction isn't linear. It creates impressions, like abstract art, and it's point, I think, is the power of fantasy in marshaling one's will to accomplish and be free.It isn't genius-level, like Monet or Memento, but it is definitely good youth art, and visually excellent. Despite being a retired gentleman, I'm a film buff and could admire and enjoy it for what it is, instead of wishing it was something else.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

an under rated gem that doesn't get enough attention,"A dazzling stylist gem of a fantasy action jam pack of a film that takes you to a world where when you day dream you can be anything you want it to be to escape the harsh reality, that's what director Zack Snyder done with this visionary epic film ""Sucker Punch"". The premise of the film was highly well understood and the visuals were phenomenal. The sequence of what the basic premise is all there the highly action , the story and the dynamic entity of the main character who takes you on a glorious joy ride of none stop action from the very beginning too the very end of the film, with an all stunning supportive cast of amazing actress that gave each character a magical moment that was brought to life. The idea that the film was Zack Snyder's original idea came to life with a beautiful setting a simple idea that was easily understood of what he was going with it. Love it or hate it is still a fantastic film that truly delivers its magic moment , definitely a top 100 films of the 2000's era.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Sucker Punch is an offensive piece of garbage.,"This film is the biggest slap in the face the movie industry has ever experienced. I actually found this movie offensive. I came out of the theater to find myself highly frustrated with my experience and I wondered why. Here are the reasons:Sucker Punch does not try to be a movie. I've seen worse acting, screenplay, direction, soundtrack, etc. in other films. But those were entertaining! They were humorous because somebody tried to make a movie and failed miserably at it. It was funny the same way Americas Funniest Home Videos is funny. Snyder, on the other hand, did not try. He deliberately threw enough money to feed a third-world country for a year at a collection of high-tech YouTube videos and then gloated when the revenues from idiot moviegoers like me kicked in. At least for that, I want to punch him in the face.Yes, the visual effects are alright. The women, while definitely not the hottest on the planet, are relatively attractive. But the mere fact that this was a piece of eye candy with no intention of being anything else is disrespectful. If this paragraph is making the reader think ""Hey, hot women and cool visual effects, I should watch this"", I have a piece of advice for you. Play World of Warcraft and then watch some porn. These things are much more fulfilling separately, when developed for what they are meant to be. Snyder mates the two to produce a retarded, disturbing child called Sucker Punch.I feel no need to go into the plot or the quality of the acting in great detail. The plot seems to have been conceived by throwing every single thing that is defined as ""cool"" by moviegoers with an average IQ of 35 and sprinkling it with a disastrous attempt at being inspirational to the 14-yearold emo girl audience. The acting made me feel like the movie is a trial to see how long I can last before throwing something at the screen. I failed that challenge about 35 minutes in.Finally, I'll mention that this movie had absolutely nothing original about it. No, I don't mean that it didn't tickle your brain in a particular way or that it didn't make you reanalyze the point of your existence. I mean that every single darned concept of this movie has been done somewhere before – and done much better. Sucker Punch is the cacophony of film.In short, Sucker Punch is pure garbage. Please, don't watch this film.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The sole survivor of two abused sisters uses her impenetrable imagination to plot her escape from an insane asylum!,"Director Zack Snyder has been compared to a lot of classic filmmakers since his steady rise to the top of the Hollywood list. His most memorable blockbusters up until now, as you will most likely remember are the 2003 'Dawn of the Dead' remake, Spartan war fantasy '300' and the all comic-book movie shaming 'Watchmen.' Yes, I am a fan of his work but no I do not argue the man's genius in every case.'Dawn,' I felt was a hastily put-together feature that failed to capitalise where modern filmmaking methods could have improved the original version and the only similarity was that both films had a shopping mall. Still, I like it. What he did improve was the sense of excitement, even though the story had been drastically simplified as an apparently necessary sacrifice.'300' was not a great film in my eyes and I hated the use of almost two-dimensional looking CGI to portray a historic tale although he had his reasons for making it that way, particularly the influence of comic-book legend Frank Miller. After being treated to Troy, Kingdom of Heaven and the likes, I was left feeling sold short.Then came 'Watchmen' and Snyder's true colours shone; a true talent for storytelling, a big appetite for character and plot twists and a gift for transferring a sense of sentimentality from studio to audience. In my eyes, this last title was a perfect display of lessons well-learned and skills well-matured.'Sucker Punch' is literally a return to original form for the director and with all his perfected skills and impeccable eye for detail in tow. Here he tells a seemingly simple escape story, one that allows the audience's imagination to overstep the mark as the film unravels into an immensely complex trip through the daydreams of a tragically oppressed mind.Baby Doll and her sister are child victims to an abusive step-father until one night, he crosses the line. So afraid for her sister, Baby Doll escapes imprisonment to rescue her sister only to find her dead. Refusing to take out violent revenge, the step-father blames her for her sister's death and has her imprisoned in an insane asylum. She immediately begins to withdraw into the limitless depths of her imagination to escape her grim reality, destined for the lobotomists operating chair, and hopefully to escape in reality.But she recedes so far that she suddenly finds herself imprisoned in another reality where she is taken in by a group of captive women also looking for a way out. With the aid of a mysterious mentor (portrayed by legend film veteran Scott Glenn) they set about finding the means to escape their captors and tormentors through mind-blowing ventures into fantasy wars where the band of women fight with all the rage they've ever known.Spending a lot of time entering these dream worlds and fighting side by side to go on with their secret plans, the film occasionally comes back to the second reality where the seemingly primary plot and narrative unfold bit by bit. But it is only towards the end that the story crashes back to reality so abruptly that, with all the plot points in place, we are dragged back to the feature's very title and literally sucker punched over and over again. This review needs no spoiler, it does what it says on the box, yet it generously offers so much more to the open mind and the sympathetic heart.Snyder's 'Sucker Punch' is so many things at one time yet these things work harmoniously. It's a psychological drama and a chick-flick set inside a man-boy's video game.Visually, you are inside a video-game of the highest calibre, in fact a mix of the very best there has ever been. But the drama within and around the octane-soaked action scenes and all this leading up to the jaw-dropping conclusion is enough to make even the most emotionally devoid man shed even a single tear. Try to figure out what it all means after you've seen it once or twice and the possibilities keep jumping in your face long after.Zack Snyder has plenty years of cutting edge filmmaking left in him before he joins the distant-minded and long-past glorious Hollywood crowd but if he can ever top this one with something even more mind-blowing, I'll have to lobotomise myself just to be able to cope.Accept no imitations!",,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Zack Snyder Frenzy Deluxe! (Extended Edition),"Zack Snyder nails the soundtrack, visuals & action sequences impeccably. Another film for the history books where the 'so called' critics got it completely wrong. So, here's a quick summary;The character baby doll suffers a traumatic experience at the hands of her father, who is also responsible for her mother's death. As an act of desperation, she tries to save her sister from the abusive father with a gun, but accidently shoots her sister instead. As a result, baby doll is sent to a mental institution. The father pays off a corrupt worker, in the hopes of forcing a lobotomy.This is where the story starts to get trippy, baby doll starts to go crazy by changing her perception, where she imagines being left in a whorehouse (metaphor for the mental institution). In order to escape the whorehouse, she must dwell further into her imaginations, where she meets a wise man, who tells her to collect 5 items in order to escape.These 5 items are collected by baby doll throughout the film. When the plan fails, baby doll creates a distraction to help sweet pea escape, who later meets the wise man driving the bus.The ending of this film makes you question whose point of view the story is being told. Baby doll, sweet pea or the bus driver? This film is a commentary on how some people in the gaming and geek culture tend to view woman.In my humble opinion, this film should have been a hard R instead of its PG rating. This would have allowed Zack Snyder to make this film a lot more brutal & disturbing. Overall, the film did an excellent job in showcasing strong female leads who can kick ass without being woke.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
My Bad Review,"I give this a 2, only because of the hot babes. But I will not recommend this movie. If you are a lesbian, you may enjoy this film because of the mental capability women can have when they use both sides of there brain, in which they can, especially under stressful environments as in this movie. But the previews are misleading. I saw this movie tonight at Regal Streets of Indian Lake., and what makes it bad is there in a mental institution, and all of a sudden a fantasy world fighting creatures and, wtf?It was pure garbage, the story was non sense, I hate it. Sorry but I really want a my 10.50 back for this, or a free movie ticket to make up for my lost money I worked hard for to pay for this bullshit.

Wait for Sucker Punch:  The Extended Director's Cut (with an extra 18 minutes),"I saw Sucker Punch last night at the theater and while I was impressed by what I saw, I couldn't help but feel that something was missing. Parts of the film seemed rushed and what I felt was the best part of the movie, the character development and interactions in the brothel and even the earlier part in the insane asylum seemed unnecessarily brief. Also in the credits at the end of the movie we got a glimpse at dance numbers that seemed rather elaborate and where obviously meant to be in the film (you can also see parts of them in the movie trailers).After getting home I decide to do a search online to see if there was any plans to release an extended director's cut on Blu-ray, and to my (not so) surprise, yes indeed there are. Before the film even came out there was plans to release an extended director's cut (with an extra 18 minutes) on Blu-ray and DVD.I saw a couple of interviews with the director Zack Snyder, where he talked about a director's cut on Blu-ray, and the trial and tribulations of getting the film released with a PG-13 rating at the theater. I also saw a comment from Deborah Snyder (producer) that states specifically that there will be a extended directors cut on Blu-ray and DVD. From there comments I also got a sense that all the extra scenes that I wanted in the theatrical version will be in the director's cut (including more action).So my suggestion is if you want to see the definitive version of Sucker Punch wait for the Extended Director's Cut and even if you where less than impressed with the theatrical version I would suggest checking out the Extended Director's Cut when it comes out.The theatrical release I give a 6 out of 10, but I believe that an extended director's cut will more than likely get a 8 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Sucker Punch is a must.,"This movies is a hit, I did enjoy every part of it and Zack Synder is Back everyone.Screenplay was very good, casting wasn't bad at all, Visual effects and sound effects were outstanding along with a new Cinematography techniques that I witnessed some of them during the movie for the first time, But what really made this movie special beside the great action scenes that you will witness, is the recomposed soundtracks that were chosen and re-made in a genius way to be within the context of the movie to let you enter a true fantasy each time baby doll starts dancing.What's really great about the movie, is that each time when Baby doll starts dancing you don't actually watch her dancing, but you can actually feel the doing her magic through the music and the fantasy being created during each segment.Finally, I'd like to outline a great point the movie was trying to point out all the time, it's that we all have the weapons to stand for our causes, but......... Are we gonna stand for them or not ? Great movie.... It's a must.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great if you're opened mined and don't expect Inception,"***May Contain Tiny Spoilers***As a Zack Snyder, I was thrilled to see him release an original piece of work. I watched this movie opening day which I've never done before just to support him. So was my time wasted? The movie follows Babydoll, as she bands with four other girls in a plan to escape the mental asylum her evil step father sent her to. The girls have five days to see through their plan before Babydoll is lobotomized.Okay, this movie is no Inception but I can see why some may think of it when watching Sucker Punch. To escape her unfortunate reality Babydoll escapes into a dream world set up like a high class brothel which she uses dance to escape into other branches/levels of reality where the girls fight fantasy creatures in search of the five items they need to escape.Well this is a Zack Snyder movie, so if you will complain about anything in this movie it shouldn't be the graphics. Cgi is top form in Sucker Punch and is breathtakingly beautiful and full of detail. Other than the amazing cgi, and saturated colors, it wouldn't be a Zack Snyder movie without the epic slow-mo. I wouldn't say the movie had an abundance of unnecessary slow-mo but their were more than a few. I think the scenes were spread out well. In one particular scene towards the end, the slow mo kicks in full gear and what results is one of the most amazing special effects fight scene I have seen in awhile. All the fight scenes in general worked very well and look like effort was taken into making them. It is definitely a film highlight. One thing I really enjoyed about the movie was the soundtrack. The music choices fit perfectly with the setting and kept my head slightly nodding throughout. Some people might call these scenes too ""music video like,"" but I think they worked well. The acting wasn't too shabby with stand out performances from Jena Malone aka Rocket and Oscar Issac aka Blue Jones.All in all. The movie had several twists and turns that will hit you like a ""Sucker Punch."" You won't expect some things. The movie actual has a pretty good message about stories and if you pay attention you should get it. This movie is not over complicated but a lot of people might not understand exactly whats going on. It is another good effort from Snyder but a movie that the majority probably wouldn't like which might hurt him. Overall, if your looking for an entertaining ride that makes you pay attention, and starring hot girls, this just might be your movie. If your expecting Inception or Kill Bill or whatever then this probably not you movie.8/10 from me.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Eyecandy material,"Me being a fan of Zack Snyder's movies, I went into see Sucker Punch with the correct level of expectations and I came out happy. The movie similar to other Snyder's movies, is fantasy based and high on style with stunning slow-motion action scenes and a pulsating background score. If you expect a classic cinematic masterpiece, give this one a miss. This movie needs to be seen as a out n out commercial entertainer. Girls ruled the movie and they looked hot(particularly Jamie Chung). Great art direction and good editing.

Epic Fail,"i saw this movie few months ago, but writing review now just because i am surprised to see IMDb rating for this disaster still sitting at 6.4 mark. there must be many studio trolls' reviews here, can't explain it any other way..honestly, if i could give this movie a negative rating, i would..i liked Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead, 300 and Watchmen, he is definitely a good director, when it comes to directing something written by others, that is.. however he apparently has no fricken clue how to write a decent screenplay, one that not only makes sense, but at the very least devoid of ridiculousness..somehow Snyder managed to construct an action movie in which the audience does not even a tiny bit care what happens to the main characters..more depressing thought is that Snyder perhaps thinks that this is how much we, as moviegoers, are worth, this is what we apparently supposed to find acceptable and enjoyable.. if so, this is insulting..not going to tell you not to see this movie - instead go see it, but remember - if you like it - you don't understand anything in movies and any hopelessly idiotic plot married to semi-pretty visuals will get you excited..Zack, direct, but don't write... one more Sucker Punch, and you will suckepunch yourself out of movie business..",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Where do I start?,"So, where DO I start? the ""meh"" effects? the awful story? the unreliable characters? the horrible acting? So many choices, not enough words to fill this review, so I'll summer it up for you:Sucker punch, is a mix of a few successful video-games and epic movies, mashed together into a high budget, effect packed, waste of your money.We had some Lord of the rings, a bit of matrix, a bunch of Call of duty, Devil may cry, Bayonetta, and I definitely got some Memoirs of a geisha vibe every other scene.Now, you might think for your self: ""Well that sounds like fun!"", but no, you are wrong, oh, so wrong.When there is too much of everything, everything smells funny. you can't cover up the stench with so many effects, it simply doesn't work. the story was so lame I simply lost all interest half way through, I just waited for the effects to save the day, which they didn't. at some point I lost hope and just waited for it to end, which (it felt), didn't.The trailer was so promising, that I just had to see it for my self, and as you might realize, if you got all the way here, it disappointed me to say the least. I don't usually rate movies, I just move on...But I just had to share my disappointment with the world, or else I'd have problems falling asleep tonight.I felt as if I was being laughed at my face, when one of the characters said: ""Don't ever write a check with your mouth you can't cash with your ass."" true, so true.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Fascinating, Frustrating, and Hard to Shake","Several days after viewing it, I have come to the conclusion that I like ""Sucker Punch."" I *think* I like it, anyway. At the very least, I have been unable to shake its alternatively bleak, exhilarating, and brazenly energized imagery from my frontal lobe. Coming from director Zack Snyder (who co-wrote the original script with Steve Shibuya), the notion of calling this film a vanity project is redundant, as Snyder is the whiz kid who gave us Green-Screened visual feasts like ""300"" and ""Watchmen"" (graphic-novel adaptations that, in the case of the latter, came very close to perfection) -- films that gorged themselves on a unique kind of visual beauty. The difference between a technical auteur like Snyder and the soul-dead commercial hackwork of, say, Michael Bay is a reliable core of character and plot to push the visuals along with a sense of purpose, no matter how disparate. Which is what makes the initial machinations of ""Sucker Punch"" somewhat jarring -- set in an anachronistic, parallel-universe America, where Babydoll (Emily Browning) is sent away to an all-girls asylum after attacking her grotesque pervert of an uncle, she is covertly signed away (by an equally lecherous orderly) and set to receive a trans-orbital lobotomy at the end of five days, thus setting into play an imaginary world that may be her only chance of salvation. Old-world notions of psychiatry, patriarchy, and the role of women in such a repressive society is not where Snyder's interest lies, though he does create some distinctive (if not particularly well-drawn -- probably the film's biggest flaw) female ass-kickers, literally battling it out against unfathomable odds. Like Terry Gilliam's oeuvre on a dose of David Lynch mindbender, ""Sucker Punch"" is a largely self-indulgent work -- frequently chaotic, but mostly fascinating; Snyder's interest in cohering the various combat sequences (which run the gamut from a steampunk vision of WWII, a Medieval siege, and a futuristic train populated by android assassins) into a consistent narrative is minimal at best, instead opting for an epic, ""bigger is better"" mentality that reinforces the film's ""against all odds"" schematic (it may not be subtle or original, but the driven vision of it all makes it fly). Like Gilliam's undervalued ""Tideland,"" ""Sucker Punch"" is destined for cult status -- and, unlike Tim Burton's lame interpretation of ""Alice in Wonderland,"" is never boring.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Suckerpunch in the stomach!,"Review Two: SuckerpunchA popcorn flick with far too much between the part that makes it popcorn, and too little substance to be anything but. ""The film achieves exactly what it wanted to and does it well, the issue lies within the fact that the film exists!""Zack Synder played one too many video games while writing what could be the best popcorn flick of 2011. Is that really enough though? The film contains World War II Zombies (Call of Duty), Dragon's, Castles, Battle Mechs, Girls in skimpy clothing and non-stop action. The comparisons to video games aren't wrong, and sometimes there is a feeling of watching someone play a game. This isn't a bad thing, and even non-gamers can find appeal in this film.However, amongst the midst of the action and fun comes the brothel scenes, which essentially are tediously boring. Essentially, this isn't because the scenes are bad, but the sudden contrasting after getting so hyped up leaves a lot to be desired of the brothel. The whole film revolves around a 'dance world' and the reality, but the transfers make little sense, and is just an excuse to throw in some entertaining action sequences.People say the film is overly sexual, to which is disagreeable. The characters costumes aren't overly revealing and are somewhat artistically appealing. It's also said to have an awful story, of which I can agree to. The story is made out to have extreme depth and meaning, but truly people think way to much into it. An unreasonable twist somewhat defeats the purpose, and the film as a whole, while it does have an interesting story, the way we receive it is awful.Audiophiles will be stunned at the quality of the music and sound effects, from covers of Sweet Dreams (Eurythmics) to 'Where is my mind?', you'll find yourself immersed in what could be classified a musical had the music have more involvement than just audible connection. Would I watch this film again? Only for the action sequences.Ratings: For Gamers: Six out of Ten Nazi Zombies. The appeal is there, the execution is not. For mindless action and graphical excitement: Eight out of Ten Dragon's. For those looking for a good narrative and/or are intrigued in film as an art: 2/10 SOLID RATING: 4/10. This film isn't classified as good, but nor is it bad. I recommend viewing it, but only for the action sequences which are extremely well done.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Sucker Punched my Birthday to Smitherines,"It's my birthday. Had a great meal with my family then we went to see Sucker Punch. I've just back in from seeing this steaming pile of mess. My review is simple.. THIS MOVIE SUCKS! The Plot. Decent beginning then quickly became a nonsense of metaphors that you could only find in an Anime. The Action. A CGI driven child's fantasy that MADE NO SENSE even for fantasy. The fight sequences (accompanied by woeful soundtrack) quickly became tedious, boring and pointless. The acting was OK for this kinda of movie (I have seen worse) but the script and dialogue were poor..Fans of Final Fantasy will love this movie. The other 99 percent of the planet will hate it.People walked out of the theatre after the first fight sequence because it was clear where the film was going at that point.. NOWHERE.

After the movie, I was talking my girlfriends ear off like a little kid about how awesome this movie was, and the only other movie that had me doing that was the great Avatar. This movie is absolutely breathtaking, to the surprisingly good acting involved, to the great script (i think), and of course, the amazing CGI. The scene with the dragons...wow. I wont spoil it, but if you haven't seen this, please, do your self a favor and go see this as soon as possible. And don't be a cheapskate, spend the extra 3 or 4 bucks to see this in imax. Trust me, it wont be a decision you'll regret. I think that afterthis movie, if Mr Zack Snyder isn't considered one of Hollywoods top tier directors, then there's something going on there, cause he obviously is a master at his craft.

You will be unprepared for the effects and Zack's imagination,"Got the privilege of watching the Indian premiere of Sucker Punch yesterday and my excitement was through the roof (afterall, this is the guy who gave us 300 and Watchmen). What made the screening even more special was it was on IMAX screen. Yesterday was the first time I have ever been to a film premiere and I will remember this for a long time. Zack has done justice to his reputation. You will find plenty of his trademark slow-mo fight scenes and close ups. I can't talk more about the fights without revealing more, but I'm positive the first fight scene will take your breath away. What made the experience jaw dropping was the ""IMAX effect"". Try and catch this film on IMAX if you can, and I'm sure it will have leave a different impression on your mind than a conventional theatre would. It features an ensemble female cast, Emily Browning(Babydoll), Jena Malone(Rocket) and Abbie Cornish(Swea Pea) played their part well whereas Vanessa Hudgens(Blondie) and Jamie Chung(Amber) were a distraction at times. But I wasn't impressed with Oscar Isaac as Blue, maybe he tried too hard to be a memorable villain. The core of the film however is the other(fictional) world (this is where we see Zack's imagination in full flight). The visuals are amazing, set-pieces are jaw dropping and epic in every sense. In short, Sucker Punch is visually enthralling action fantasy that will blow you away. Well done Zack!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Great visuals... not so great script,"First of all, I will freely admit that SUCKER PUNCH looks great. There is a seamless mix between physical sets and computer animation, and both combined manage to give us various worlds that look spectacular and unlike anything you have seen before.Unfortunately, I don't have as much enthusiasm for the screenplay. For starters, there is barely a story here - most of the movie consists of the female protagonists looking for stuff on a list. And the characters aren't that well-written as well. All of the female protagonists pretty much come across as all the same, with only their physical looks differentiating them from each other. Scott Glenn, an actor I've admired in the past, is pretty much wasted here.While I wouldn't call this a TERRIBLE movie, I do think it's kind of disappointing. If the movie had a richer story and richer characters, it would almost certainly have become an instant cult classic. As it is now, there's no compelling reason to seek it out. If you do watch it, pick a time when your expectations are not high and you are in the mood for visual candy.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
This sucker feels punched,"You will be unprepared..... for this boring ride. I'm sorry to say it, but Zack Synder really dropped the ball on this one. I'm (well, I USED to be) a rabid fan of Snyder since Dawn of the Dead. I knew he was special because that movie just blew me away and really reinvented the genre for me (like 28 days later also did). It was something different and unexpected. I love it when a movie exceeds your expectations, which is so rare in this day and age with Hollywood (I generally go with the International scene if I want my mind blown nowadays - Japanese oldies like Crow 0. some good ol' Korean flicks and Euro horror generally satisfy now). Anyway, so I basically own every Zack Snyder movie on DVD AND Bluray since that point (except for Owls....but I seem to sense a trend ... and it ain't a good one...).Suckerpunch fails on several levels - mostly on writing and acting. I love the worlds that he created - they're pretty lush, though the CG world of the dragon looked a little too fake in some fly-by scenes. What failed was the story that held it all together. There was no glue between each of the separate fight sequences. What you see in the trailer is what you get. Literally. Basically ""You need these 5 items... now go forth"" - ""Wow! That's great. I will collect them and ask no questions and not have a plan. Yay!"" *Clap hands excitedly like a little school girl*. All resistance is also quelled with the declaration that the plan only requires these items. Um.... really? You're not even going to try, Zack? If he had even tried to string it all together, I would have gone with it. One really cool idea, though, was the usage of steam to emulate blood. What a great PG-13 tool - though it was brilliant on its own merit without trying to mask blood.I love the different worlds he created, but the world she created in her mind (the Dance world) was incredibly boring. B-O-R-I-N-G. That's because it relies on Synder's ability to tell a story, write dialogue and the girls' acting abilities. Cornish and Malone were the only competent girls, though Cornish's accent kept fading in and out. Cornish was tough and beautiful and I loved her knight costume with the hood. Babydoll has the most incredible look, but that's all she had going for her. She is stunning with zero substance. She relies on her looks and her eyes more than anything else, and just stands there most of the time. None of the girls were seductive. I don't know if this was a case of PG-13 affecting the movie, but there was this pseudo lesbian scene that I'm assuming Zack wanted to make hot, but it fell completely flat. Competent actors could have made it work - Hudgens.... let's just say I've never seen High School musical that made her famous - and I'll bet Sucker punch won't be her ticket to the big leagues either. Chung is cute and really doesn't do much else except be cute. She has the acting prowess of those import car models, without the sultry sexiness.I don't know if it's because I walked in there with such high expectations - I was waiting excitedly since it was announced - but I was hugely disappointed. The movie is one big trailer, and though that's not a bad thing sometimes, it is in this case because I thought maybe he'd insert a story somewhere. My bad. The dialogue was really weak as well and the girls weren't competent enough to save it. And the most nauseating scene is the lighter scene in the change room. When you see it, you'll know what I mean. It defies classification - it's something a high school project would have come up with. The intro - it was a high point. If the movie just stuck with that pacing (love the Soundtrack by the way), it would have been another groundbreaking Snyder film, like 300, Dawn, and Watchmen... but it could have just been because there was no dialogue and it relied on Zack's forte... stunning visuals. And then they spoke....Zack: I'm disappointed with you man. I love you. I did love you. I just might have to retire you next to my old fallen hero, James Cameron who failed me with Titanic and followed it up with some more boring Blue crap.My personal score for this movie would be much worse, but I'm rating it according to IMDb scores, and they tend to be more generous than I am. If you're a Snyder fan, you'll be unprepared.. for this crapfest. This movie isn't going to make anyone rich. I really hope Snyder gets to still do Superman after this... his star might have fallen really hard after this opening weekend. Maybe Nolan can save him (though... I have my doubts with his writing after seeing the over-hyped Inception... good movie... but not that good, nor creative.)",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"No story, but hot chicks and great visuals","First of all I have to say that I liked the movie. The story was too flat, and too desperate in trying not to be flat. The moral of it felt forced to me, and the multiple layers of reality made it look like a crappy version of Inception. Yet the fight scenes were incredibly well done, and the visuals were very impressive as well.The story is kind of stupid. A girl (Baby-Doll) is moved to a mental hospital because she kills her sister instead of her abusive stepfather. There she imagines that she is in this whorehouse and she has to dance for the High Roller. Whenever she dances her mind takes her to these fantastical worlds where she has to find these four objects to escape from the asylum. It's too complicated, it would've been a whole lot better if the story was only in the fantasy world. This ""the whole thing is just in your head"" crap wasn't needed.The action sequences in this film were absolutely remarkable. The WWI fight scene with the bombed Notre-Dame and the steam-powered German zombie soldiers was amazing. These fantasy worlds Zack Snyder created were fantastic, he just should've executed his whole story in them, reducing the layers of reality to one. He is one of the best action directors, but he shouldn't be writing his own scripts.All in all, Sucker Punch isn't a good movie, but it is well made and quite enjoyable in some parts.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The punch lands far from disappointment.,"So I watched this because it's a Zack Snyder film, but I kept my expectations very low, as I had heard that this movie isn't that special. But when I watched it, not lying, it was awesome. The movie actually gives the power to the viewers. It never gives the viewers a definite answer to what is real and what is not. It is strictly kept in the hands of the audience to draw a conclusion. The story is quite weak as compared to other Snyder's work, but its visuals and screenplay is Oscar worthy. And can't forget the fight choreography, it was top notch. The movie never spoon feeds us at any aspect of the story, it forces the viewers to think and analysis the scenario and they themselves have to draw a conclusion on what is actually happening and what is fantasy. I'm neither going to discuss the story, nor my POV on the real and imaginary thing. This movie can't be compared with 'Joker', 'Sucker Punch' is way ahead of 'Joker' in terms of creating a mixture of real world and fantasy.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I could not keep track of what imaginary world the character was in, the more it went on the more confused I was.

"Great Visuals, Bad Story!","Zach Snyder, the director behind films such as 300 and Watchmen is back with his new live-action movie, Sucker Punch. This movie has impressive visuals as all his films do, but sadly this movie lacks an effective story. It has a great premise and all, but the screenplay should have been written much better. Zach Synder needs to learn a lesson on how to properly tell a story but other than that, I did have a somewhat fun time watching this film.This movie is about a girl who is submitted to a mental ward. She and a couple of other girls are forced to dance. When they dance, they leave reality for fantasy and they try to escape that mental asylum.The acting is okay nothing worth commenting on. The characters are not that memorable even though the lead actors are quite beautiful. I do wish to say that Emily Browning has grown up a lot since her last big film, 2004's A Series of Unfortunate Events.Overall, this is a movie that could and should have been much better. If the story was there, this would have been a great movie. I also really disliked the soundtrack. I could not stand the heavy-metal, headache-inducing music.

Titillation can only go so far,"** out of (****)After Snyder's inexactitude movie productions such as ""300"" and ""Watchmen"", one should be skeptical of how Zack's titillating eye-candy spectacle will pan out. With the plethora of negative critical reception, it's easy to say this project will not be a satisfying one. While that is true, ""Sucker Punch"" may be the most underrated film of the year so far. Granted, it's not a good film, but there's no way it's deserving of a ""1"" or even a ""3"". Despite the film's main selling point being the sex dolls gracing the silver screen, there's a little more meat on these bones. Snyder's first self-written screenplay attempts at a more meaningful, complex world. However, great ideas don't always guarantee a solid execution. ""Sucker Punch"" is a pitch perfect example.""Punch"" revolves around Babydoll (Browning), our fragile protagonist who is verbally and mentally abused by her stepfather. After a horrible incident, Babydoll is sent to a mental institution, and is expected a lobotomy in a matter of days. However, while serving her time at the place, she dances for others, and is the best of the bunch. Although, when she dances, she's mentally, inside her own world. The others join her in her little fantasy, with a hope to escape. There, the line between reality and fantasy is drawn. Will the girls escape?First of all, the acting is just decent. Browning is the best of the bunch, but then again, she doesn't have too much to work with. Anyone can bat their voluptuous eyes, and carry a melancholy attitude. Malone is the charismatic, inspiration stereotype. Here she does her job, but doesn't add too much for the camera. The others are pretty much either insignificant or nothing note-worthy of a performance. How's the story? Surprisingly, I think the story fits despite what others say. One being the film's incoherence. The film ties everything up pretty nicely, and has a few twists and turns.The action? Nothing short of awesome. Snyder has a nice eye for visual entertainment, and he brings it here. The babes? Pretty, but they never bring their expected sex appeal to the screen. Is the film too long? Not really. The film, despite its lengthy running time, doesn't overstay its welcome too much. It's pretty straightforward. Also, not to mention the cinematography is just gorgeous. Snyder is like God in that department.Now onto the bad. This film just does not work. How can you enter the fantasy world by dancing? Won't that cause distraction, especially since those hot sweaty pedophiles are staring at you. Also, are they that stupid not to realize stealing things will be suspicious? That's a non-spoiler by the way. It's partly shown in the trailer, and happens early on in the movie. These factors kind of got to me. Also, while this is a lovely film to look at, it leaves you in the cold. It really doesn't have any emotional depth and character study, when that's what the movie promises.All in all, ""Sucker punch"" isn't a complete one to the stomach. The film doesn't rely too heavily on gratuitous nature, but when it relies on characters and story, it gets lost in a way. This film, while flawed, isn't half as bad as the critics say it is. It just isn't as good as some people are saying it is. Stick with a matinée.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Almost felt suckered... would you?,"There were lots of punches. There was a sucker (lollipop). I wasn't sucker punched by surprise but I almost felt suckered for paying full price at the theatre. Let's start by saying that I loved all of Zack Snyder's previous films but this one left me perplexed. The story has 3 layers of ""reality"": 1) Our heroine is placed unjustly in a mental institution 2) She's stuck in a cabaret club/whorehouse 3) She's a super-powered fighter in a wild mix of settings involving giant samurais, steam-powered Nazi zombies, dragons and robots amongst others. Yes, it's a bit like an unholy mash-up of different films: Inception/Brazil/One Flew Over the Cuckoo' Nest/Moulin Rouge/Kill Bill in certain ways but less complex and particularly less emotionally involving. Our main heroine flees her unbearable situation through imagination, a theme I certainly love in movies, but I certainly wish the ""visions"" had been less superficial.Weirdly, I found the first ""reality"" (asylum) the most gripping (especially the intro) but it's the one where we spend the least time. For me, it seemed that the deeper and more spectacular the setting was, the least I was involved. Those settings in the third layer were mostly action-oriented, extremely simplistic (like missions in a bad video game) yet visually spectacular. They were like a crazy mix of pulp/genre archetypes that are not usually combined. To be honest, it was like nothing I had ever seen before. Those action scenes/special effects were expertly done, but somehow left me cold and uninvolved the longer they ran. It's as if I didn't care. They felt ""hollow"".This brings me to perhaps the biggest problem of the film. The characters are not developed or characterized enough making vicarious identification difficult if not impossible. The sense of danger or the losses were not really felt, at least for me. I liked Rocket well enough (probably because of the actress' performance) but 2 of the female characters (Blondie and Amber) were cardboard-thin and the others weren't that great. At first glance, the story itself seems complex but is in fact rather simple (not bad in itself). It's just not particularly well told. I saw the ""sucker punches"" coming a mile away, either that or I didn't really care one way or the other.The main villain lacked a certain something to make him truly special or threatening, which is a shame because this movie begged for a villain we could truly love to hate. The sensei, who could have been played by David Carradine, was the only likable man in this pic but his involvement was limited mostly to story exposition. I didn't care much for the washed-out color schemes in the different layers but it's a defensible stylistic choice. The cinematography itself is quite stylish as usual for Zack Snyder. You certainly recognize the director's signature touches although he overindulges in some of his favorites moves (witness: when the girls land on the ground).For 2 different recurring elements, he intentionally hides what's happening (the dance and later the face) and I found that rather clever and mysterious in a good way. The soundtrack consists mostly of known pop/alternative songs, either cover or original, and they fit tremendously well giving a real ""punch"" to the scenes. However, a little more than halfway through, the choices seemed less inspired, not bad per say but not great as before.Should you watch Sucker Punch? Probably not at full price in the theatre but just for the amazing visuals later on, yes. Especially if you're a fan of the director's previous works. The story and characters will likely disappoint though.Rating: 5.5 out of 10 (average-good)",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Underrated,"This movie deserves way better than what people give it. It is absolutely the best Zach Snyder movie to date (and probably the best he'll ever make). But come you people, this movie absolutely rocks! Great story, great visuals, great soundtrack! This movie has it all! It takes you from. The cast is also great, just look at them! This is absolutely the best Zach Snyder movies ever. If Netflix was smart, they would give Zach the budget of Rebel Moon to make a sequel. Or just give him a blank check and let him make a whole movie universe out of this. This is just absolute cinema and we movie junkies should rewatch it multiple times a year, not for it to gain cult status, but to give it the respect it deserves!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Great Concept, Shaky Execution","I really don't know what to think of this movie, but based on gut instinct I'd say I liked it. Just wasn't really what I was expecting. It was a lot more dark and depressing than I expected or was led to believe. That's not a bad thing, but it definitely took me by surprise. It's one of those movies where every little thing means something or is symbolic. Some are so obvious it's cringe-worthy, and others that you really have to think about.I'm glad there was a fair share of character development to go along with all the action. Really got invested in their stories which was nice. Babydoll, Sweet Pea, and Rocket were the real leads. Amber and Blondie have a few nice moments, but mostly stood around unfortunately. Blue was just repulsive. Acting was strong. The supporting cast, especially Jena Malone and Abbie Cornish, stood out the most. Vanessa Hudgens surprised me. Emily Browning wasn't as strong as I'd hoped, but was still pretty good.The action scenes were pretty hit or miss. There was one that was one of the best I've seen on film, another that was just plain awful, and the others were must 'meh'. Very style-ish. Sometimes a little TOO much style though.So yeah, Sucker Punch is good. The concept is excellent, there's a lot to think about, some good characters.... I just wish the execution was a little bit stronger.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Was rather mentally disturbed....,"Its become a trend for Hollywood movies to plant a psychological theme in their films, be it Inception, or The Invasion etc; every other film questions life and its 'meaning'. In films like 'American Beauty' the message is too clear, while its covered more subtly in others. Sucker Punch takes an aberrant route, and fails miserably in both the clarity and impact of the movie. The main problem is the jarring action sequences, which I happily skipped towards the end because of the inanity of the guns and the machines.The plot itself is convoluted, flabby and sloppy. Baby Doll lands in the asylum, where she is to undergo lobotomy. In order to 'escape', she needs 5 items, and for this she has to dance like a stripper (in her fantastical world). This dance takes her to another realm, where she and her b----es fight ugly contraptions. Whatever.The unwatchability of the film is its main flaw. There's so much going on and its all stupid. The mental asylum and the go-go girl story would have been fine, but then there are Arnold Schwaggeneger routines too. Seriously, I would've been fine with the sensual dance itself. The acting is good, but I really could not take anyone seriously. All wanted to sound as if they were in some art film, especially the Russian psychiatrist. But I seriously question the 'art' behind the film. The end seems too clichéd, like some eighties' movie with Linda Blair.Sucker Punch to me is a sucked out punch that barely lands. It's a bad film that's taking itself too seriously. To me, it would've been a whole lot better sans the lengthy action scenes. 2/10",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
xploitation + game cutscenes x anime style / bad direction..,"Wow, what can I say? The first 5 minute of Sucker Punch draws my blood rushing to my head. ""Oh My god,"" I said. This might be the coolest intro I've seen since Pulp FictionThe imaginary scene in this movie are spectacular, worth the ticket I must say. Expect many games and anime type cool factor and bad-ass-ness.Sadly that's all good things I can say about Sucker Punch.My friend told me that the title is a pun by itself.as I leave the theater I can't stop thinking that perhaps I'm watching a movie with 3 different directors working 3 separate part.1. The videoclips; full of MTVesque slomo visual with killer tunes.2. The imaginary visuals; superbly crafted cutscenes inspired and adapted from many games and anime.3. The boring talks; doesn't add much to move the the movie convincingly. Blah blah blah, mumble mumble, sob sob.. what's wrong? It's too boring that they don't even add any background music as courtesy to the audience.All three part of the movie contrast greatly. I have no idea what they were thinking when writing this movie. The reason (if there any..) behind the disjointed reality are too shallow it insulted the audiences.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"The effects will ""Sucker Punch"" you into oblivion...","If you have seen any of the trailers for ""Sucker Punch"", then you should already have a pretty good idea what you are in for before you sit yourself down to watch this movie. Because this is going to be a treat for the eyes and easy on the mind. True enough! It turned out to be exactly that...""Sucker Punch"" is phenomenal in its splendors of CGI effects and wow effects. There is spared no expense when the dazzling effects are allowed to unfurl on the screen. And it totally blows you away, because it looks so amazing. From the very beginning till the very end, you are in for a very visual treat, CGI eye candy indeed. And if for nothing else, then the movie is well worth watching for the effects alone.And sad to say, the effects galore is what carries most of the movie. In between the dazzling CGI effects and mind-blowing action sequences, the movie feeds you a rather dull and uninspiring story of girls locked away at a mental institution, where they plan an escape. An escape that can become reality because of Baby Doll's dancing. Stop! Are you kidding me? This is as far from any story with any depth as it can possibly be. But hey, if you have a serious case of hangovers, then the movie is right up your alley, because you need no brain to keep up with the storyline.Moving on to the characters in the movie. Well, you have five heroines that are clad in fairly interesting clothing most of the time. And it being five attractive women at that, helps along to appeal to the male audience. Sure it looks good, but it just helps to throw fire on the fuel of a no-brainer movie. Now, I am not saying that Emily Browning (playing Baby Doll), Abbie Cornish (playing Sweet Pea), Jena Malone (playing Rocket), Vanessa Hudgens (playing Blondie) or Jamie Chung (playing Amber) were doing a bad job or that they are not good actresses, far from it. But it is clear to everyone why they are in the movie... Moving on! It was interesting to see Carla Gugino (playing Dr. Vera Gorski) in this movie, and her role was quite interesting. And Scott Glenn (playing the Wise Man) was a good touch to the cast list.My 7/10 rating for this movie is for the extravagant CGI fest and action alone. It has long been since I have seen anything of the like as in this movie. I was totally blown away by the effects, and it is what immediately stuck with me. The movie is well worth watching for these two facts alone, because the storyline is weak and quite stupid really.""Sucker Punch"" came as no surprise to me, being what it is, and living up to what I had believed it to be. But still, it is definitely a movie that you would not want to miss out on. This is hardcore CGI effects candy for the eyes, hard-pounding action, hot women and a ""click off your mind and enjoy the ride"" movie for men of all ages.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Sci-Fi Guilty Pleasure which could have been much better,"Zack Snyder's latest venture is surely something to look at. It seems that he did an internet poll for gamers, sci-fi fans, geeks etc and then made the movie tailor-made for them. Its got steam-punk, ninja warriors, dragons, planes and last but not the least babes. Action is just breathtaking in some scenes. For a gamer like me there are hints of Mortal Combat and Unreal Tournament and everything else I wanted.Story idea is decent. The main protagonist is Baby Doll who is a mental patient in a facility. But she imagines it as a kind of sleazy club where girls dance for the customers and then the customers can use those girls. And when she starts dancing she imagines it as elaborate fight scenes in a different world. So it is a fantasy with in a fantasy, and the three layers overlap.Now for the cons. The only thing missing is a strong connection between the actors and the audience. We see them going through the motions but we never root for them. We just love some action scenes and the rest seems like background noise. Sucker Punch works more in parts rather than as a whole. And the disappointment you feel is more because of missed opportunities. With a better script and better actors it could have become a sci-fi classic. Instead it is just a summer blockbuster.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Comic Book To The Extreme,"""Sucker Punch"" is a very underrated movie. Moreso for its construction than its storyline. To be fair, there is a very thin one. A girl is thrown into a mental institution after the tragic death of her mother only to be accosted by a lecherous step-father. Which leads her to this institution which forces her to go through a type of therapy which also connects itself to lecherous crime bosses who shop for them in some sex slavery pit.I understand the content itself is very salacious. But the execution gives it some unique quality when it comes to mood and atmosphere. This isn't a flick that gives you clean answers. And the result is dark and grim. Much like ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" (1975) it resolves itself to embracing freedom as a state of mind rather than a physical one. Which, judging by all involved, this may be the better option.What becomes muddled is when you add too many characters. While the actresses are unique, sometimes it does get confusing. Their relationships and their motives are exactly on the surface. It isn't until the last reel where you get the emotional gut punch.""Sucker Punch"" if it were made today, would definitely garner a trigger warning for those who have been sexually assaulted. Perhaps director Zack Snyder was making something for young women to see that their suffering is seen and heard. There are two ways to exit this world, and his presentation of either isn't exactly heart warming.What is the message here? Hard to say. Perhaps it's that your mind is what frees you. Which is true. Pain, trauma and anger is adjustable to how you want to process it.We're 10 years out from this film now, and I think it is a movie that has and will continue to gain more cult followers. It's really a well constructed movie past all the noise and mayhem.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I yawned but got the message,"I caught myself yawning couple of times. Like Watchmen (which i enjoyed for its deep messages), Sucker punch contained deep underlying messages which I honestly JUST got right at the end. CGI was OK, I liked it how they sneaked in couple of cute images. But I was tempted to walk out couple of times. I was actually fidgeting a lot. Overall, I wouldn't recommend it. Its very difficult to mix and match deep underlying messages and brainless visual scenes.I personally think they cast the wrong girl, my 1st impression was- gee shes tiny, 2nd- ...is she on botox? Couple of cliché scenes made it look like it was from a Manga. Didn't think it worked.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"awful movie , sucker punch","The main character gets confined to a mental asylum for reasons that stop being important once she is inside (for the rest of the movie). There, she flashes a weird burlesque world slightly related to the real world. and there, she flashes another world which is pure fantasy. This flashy third world has the cool action that we want to see. sadly it doesn't work at all, since nothing there makes sense. She finds suddenly turned into a super powered chick who fights robots, Nazis, dragons and samurais. Who are them? nobody. Why does she fight them? No reason. What if she loses the fight? We don't know. Who gives a damn then about them? Well, not me. Of course, after we start to see that her actions there mean something in the real world (actually it's not the real world either) but it's already too late. We see the first fight without caring about it since it doesn't have a background at all. And that transfers to all the rest.Some of the actors were good but many of them have the problem of having to act a scene that makes no sense at all and that hurts their performances really bad. The perfect example of this is the doctor that lobotomizes her, having to repeat the ""there was a creepy look in her eyes"" speech like 5 times to make the audience believe it.It's sad that all those good action scenes fell flat for the lack of story. When I saw the first action scene versus the samurais (the best one by far) I thought: ""Man!! if I had this one action scene alone at the end after a great movie with good characters I'd been totally happy. No need for more action than this in a well constructed movie."" of course, I was able to think that so early cause the fatal flaw of the movie was all exposed already.the movie is very bad, not wordy off your money !!!!!!!!",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Powerful and Personal Journey with Sucker Punch,"I've watched Sucker Punch over 10 times since I was a teenager, and it continues to resonate with me deeply. This movie is more than just entertainment; it's a powerful escape and an emotional outlet. The film's themes of fighting through trauma and taking control of one's own narrative speak to me on a personal level, as it mirrors struggles I've faced in my own life.The visuals, action sequences, and symbolism are stunning, but what stands out the most for me is how the story uses fantasy as a form of survival and resilience. It's not just about the action or the battles-it's about finding strength within when everything feels hopeless. The soundtrack is also amazing, amplifying the emotional intensity of each scene.For anyone who's experienced tough times or is looking for a movie that goes beyond the surface, Sucker Punch delivers on every front. It's a film that I'll always hold close, not just for its artistry but for how it helped me process my own journey.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Movie that could have given so much, but failed to deliver.","After seeing the trailer and previous Zack Snyder films, I was really looking forward to this picture. The first 10 minutes were amazing and I felt, that premises for a great movie was set. However after leaving the theater, I have to say that I was having mixed feelings.Plot itself was quite easy and hopefully you have already read the synopsis, so I won't rewrite it. I can't say that there was anything particularly wrong with it, however I kept having the feeling, that firstly, they would have worked much better as short films, secondly all the episodes have already been used in other pictures as Batman Begins, All Quiet On Western Front and Lord Of The Rings. Storywise I was constantly waiting for something more, something what was just handing in the air, but never delivered. Thirdly, the characters never grew to their full potential. We didn't learn anything about Blondie, Amber, Blue and Dr. Gorski. Rockets and Sweet Peas background felt also incomplete. What I want to say, was that I never got the chance to grow into any of the charters.On the other hand, visuals and soundtrack were solid. Zack Snyder knows how to manipulate the picture and bring every single detail to our attention. CGI and camera-work were great and unforgettable. Even if you did not know who was the director, colors and eerie atmosphere definitely had Snyders signature on it. Soundtrack was great and considering that music played a big role in the movie, was well chosen. In addition, bound with visuals, soundtrack created a memorable world. All in all, unfortunately this movie will be remembered by its visuals just like 300. Like my friend said, it was like a meal, that looked delicious, but lacked the taste.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Hmmm, why PG-13","This movie should be rated R. Don't take your teen.Very warped. I worry about the type of people who enjoy this film.If you are warped and like the idea of abusing females, you'll like this movie. If that's a turn on, you'll love it.For everyone else, there are far better examples of this sort of cinema available. The themes of going with the main character(s) reality, and then getting glimpses that they may not be in reality, but that character's hallucinations is a popular addition to many plots now. Most people think the Matrix is what launched this wave of popularity. That movie was done with class though, this movie is just plain warped and tasteless. Again, I really think the appeal would be for the abused, mentally tortured, and sexually abused females. I personally think that's warped, but obviously that's popular in cinema and our culture. If that's not your thing, you most likely won't get much else out of this movie. It seems pretty clear that the producers of this film are people who that is their turn on, and they wanted to waste everyone else's movie going experience to cater to those who share their sick fantasies.If you're mentally healthy, skip it!

"Spectacular production and women, but so-so story","I've seen 2011's ""Sucker Punch"" twice now and it struck me the same both times. Like I said in my title blurb, it is a spectacular production with absolutely stunning women, particularly Abbie Cornish and Emily Browning, and it is entertaining in many ways; unfortunately, the story is only moderately interesting.Browning plays ""Baby Doll"" in the 1950s, whose wicked stepfather takes her to a mental asylum to receive a lobotomy. He wants to shut her up to hide his crimes, of course. She resorts to fantasy to escape her predicament, imagining herself and the other people at the asylum in a mob-owned brothel. When she's forced to dance at the ""brothel"" she withdraws further into wild fantasies involving feudal Japan, World War I German soldiers, a dragon and an assortment of other bizarre imaginations.There's some depth here. The film's not all hot babes in lingerie and CGI-laden action fantasies. But I'll have to watch it a couple of more times to figure it out. The multi-layered nature of the plot -- reality turning to fantasy and then fantasy within fantasy -- is somewhat off-putting and tends to take one out of the story. As it is, the entertainment value is pretty much limited to the women and the outlandish action sequences. The story of the girls trying to get out of the brothel or asylum is only mildly compelling. Still, it's not bad and I may upgrade my rating after future viewings.The film runs 110 minutes and the extended cut 127 minutes (I own the shorter version and that's more than enough for me).GRADE: C+ or B- (but the women are a definite A+)",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Sucker Punch Review.,"Did I just watch a film or a music Video?After giving this film some time sync in, I still find myself highly conflicted towards Sucker Punch. On one hand it's a well made action fantasy film. On the other I have serious issues with the story and it's blatant, poorly conceived foreshadowing that constantly took me out of the film.Sucker Punch tells the story of a young woman(Babydoll the name given to her) played by Emily Browning whose father has recently passed. She and her sister have inherited his fortune, much to the anger and jealousy of her abusive stepfather. After a fatal accident she is blamed for her sisters death and put into an asylum where she is scheduled to have a lobotomy in five days time at the behest of her stepfather, who's trying to cover up what really happened.The opening ten minutes where all this plays out like a video game cut scene was frustrating. Whilst I appreciate dialogue free visual storytelling it's filled with every annoying visual motif in Zack Snyders locker. Slow motion, crane shots, colourless pallet and rock music that was distracting and didn't fit the tone of what was happening on-screen.As the film progresses to the asylum we are Introduced to Oscar issac who plays Blue Jones the head guard, and the one that's essentially running the asylum. I burst out laughing when I initially saw him. He essentially looks like a pimp that has escaped from a 1970's Roger Corman film. After getting myself accustomed to his unique costume design, he's one of the strongest parts of the film. He gives a terrific menacing performance filled intensity and a certain amount of instability.Emily Browning plays the lead character of Babydoll in the film. Once she's at the asylum, she is sent to what is essentially a brothel section of the asylum. Here she has to learn to dance for the patrons of the establishment. We are then introduced to Dr. Gorski whose the madame of the brothel, played by Carla Gugino. With five days till her lobotomy and the horrors of the asylum, she decides to plan an escape with help of a group of other inmates.The first thirty minutes of the film I found to be Incredibly dull and infuriating. The story plods along without much interest, except for when the camera spends extra long time on what will be key items for the escape, that will then be revealed later in the film. No prizes for guessing what they are when you watch the film, as Snyder makes sure to insult the audiences intelligence, and make sure that everyone knows what they need to know without giving any credence to subtlety.At this point of the film I had lost most of patience and was getting close to turning the film off. However when Babydoll goes into her first dance routine, the film completely changes gear. She mentally transports herself to other worlds/settings. When this happens the film springs into life, and becomes an utter joy to watch. The best part of this film is the second dance sequence where Babydoll and her friends are transported to steampunk version of World War 2. The girls have to fight through trenches filled with steampunk Nazis that look like a cross between mad max and Wolfenstein. This set piece is really well shot and edited. Zack Snyder knows how to frame and execute excellent, choreographed action sequences. There are also many great nods and tributes to fantasy cinema in this film.This makes the film all the more Infuriating. There are moments of cinematic magic filled with breathtaking set pieces, that are engaging and a joy to behold. When the film is focused On these moments it works brilliantly. However there are long periods of this film, especially the first half that are dull and fall flat. This is an original film which I'm always happy to see Hollywood produce. The execution however let this film down. Some of Snyder's choices left me scratching my head, the music in this film is terrible save for the one original song, it's all made up of pre-existing rock music that clashes tonally with the film. Plus another issue I had with the film, was the poorly thought-out juxtaposition between the grey dull hospital scenes and the colourful fantasy world, and leaves little to the imagination as to where the film is heading.There's a lot of fun to be had with Sucker Punch. I went into it with no expectations, and I was pleasantly surprised by the film. It has excellent action set pieces, and the film shines when it's focused on these sequences. Unfortunately it doesn't out-weigh the dull and poorly executed first act, and the ill-conceived tonal shifts. Despite the films flaws there is a fun time to be had with this film, which in time has cult classic written all over it.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Sucker Punch = Frontrunner for worst movie of the year.,"Well, April is often known as the time of year in film where truly great movies finally start to appear into the mainstream... so it's only ironic that I should be dragged along to the claptrap March release that is Sucker Punch.The film centers on BabyDoll (Played by Emily Browning), a girl who is framed for murder by her evil stepfather, and sent to an insane asylum to be lobotomized in a matter of five days. She concocts a plan with four other inmates (Played by Jamie Chung, Abbie Cornish, Vanessa Hudgens and Jena Malone) to find five items to help them escape through the asylum's dance underworld, and imaginary worlds so anachronistic and ridiculous in explanation, you'd swear I was shouting deleted paragraphs from The Divine Comedy.The film is directed by Zack Snyder, the man best known for mediocre action films such as Watchmen and 300, he also co-wrote it with a friend of his named Steve Shibuya. The film is an obvious ploy to objectify women masked by half hearted empowerment submorals, but I was hoping the film could be as interesting as it's somewhat clever five minute opening... but, to bring up Dante again, Abandon hope, all ye who enter here. I like to watch whole movies before passing unfair final judgment on them, but had I known what I know now, I would have walked out after 35 minutes.It's easy enough to blame awkward pacing, and a nonsensically sloppy screenplay, but what's most disappointing is the performances. The film has a talented collection of attractive twenty-somethings performing as its five main characters, but they all can't get past being unexpressive robots, except for Jena Malone, who plays Rocket, the only character in the film I even cared about. It also wastes the older talent, such as Carla Gugino speaking in an inconsistent Polish accent as Madam Gorski, and Scott Glenn as the Wiseman, the wisest filler character to ever grace the silver screen.Even the technical standpoints are lacking. Snyder's signature ultra slow motion shots grow from tedious to unbearable halfway through the film, the sound mix and design is overly bombarding, and even the visual work on the creatures and environments in the imagination sequences are garish, sub par exercises in effects animation.With a final rating of * out of ****, Sucker Punch is the current frontrunner for worst movie of the year.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Sucker Punch doesn't deliver the 'punch' of a typical Zack Snyder film,"The story of a teenage girl who gets institutionalized by her abusive stepfather and retreats into an alternate universe.. a fantasy world.. to cope with the recent events in her life and upon doing so envisions a plan that will help her and some of the other girls escape the mental institution didn't exactly get me too interested in the film; nor did the trailer. My mindset on the film also started to sway rather negatively upon the films release when all I heard was negative feedback.However, I try not to listen to the critics and just see the film myself to properly assess the material. I decided to await the movie's DVD release and finally sat down to watch it recently. I hoped for only the best because I'm a big Zack Snyder fan. He is responsible for writing and directing some of the most visually striking and masterfully crafted film adaptations, i.e.: 300, Watchmen and Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole. I began to worry, though, when I found the stylized action sequences in this film to be dull.To me, everything just felt like it was so quickly thrown together. The CGI was very messy, as if it were rushed, only the close-ups seemed to pay particular attention to detail, and the writing was, for lack of a nicer term, horrid. There was little story or character development, just harsh, dark scenes set in reality with glimpses of a corrupt and action-packed parallel universe. The casting was also very off as only Jena Malone managed to deliver a good and believable performance, but I guess not much is to be expected from a film starring Vanessa Hudgens.Aside from Jena Malone, the only other thing I truly enjoyed about the film was the fact that it was a showcase for some magnificent cinematography. For me it felt like that was Snyder's main focus, rather than to tell the story, was just to please his audience visually. And yes, my eyes were entertained, but as a movie lover who also needs to have all the other elements in a film (good writing, casting and a decent storyline), I was not so pleased.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Guilty pleasures be guilty pleasures...,"I'm going to risk sounding cliché, but when a film's main focus is great visuals, somewhere down the line the ball is dropped in exchange, and naturally, the victim that receives the most gouging is the film's potential to tell a compelling story. And in some ways, it can be argued that director and first-time writer Zack Snyder attempts to tell such a story in which a girl is wrongfully placed in a mental institute for girls and plans to break out. The problem is, however, whatever Zack Snyder is trying to convey through the story's premise can suddenly be thrown out the window when audiences watch this same girl suddenly go into flights of fantasy in which she is an ass-kicking, katana-wielding babe in a skimpy sailor outfit, duking it out against giant stone samurai toting mini-guns, re-animated ghoul Nazi soldiers, and robots straight from the iRobot movie reject, but less lame. Of course, these are dreams within dreams, much like Inception, except the girls imagine they are harlots forced to entertain in a burlesque house instead of a looney bin, while still having the other illusions of fighting in worlds straight from a video game. Trying to make sense as to how girls in 1940s-ish could imagine combating robots, let alone piloting steam-punk mecha, could prove fruitless.Does the film fail because of this? Not necessarily. But it leaves some missed opportunities to build these characters, at least care more of their plight. There are some intriguing characters present on the stage Snyder has created, but we never get past their limited dimensionality. Most wooden of them all, Baby Doll, the aptly named protagonist, is easier on the eyes than her performance on screen.Aforementioned, if Sucker Punch does a few things right, one is the combat dream sequences, which illustrates a dance Baby Doll and company use to distract their captors and collect items needed for their grand escape. These scenes are full of high octane, kinetic energy. But the film isn't afraid to slow things down a little, figuratively and literally, and is not without some of Snyder's signature revving into and out of slow-mo that could make The Matrix blush.The Bottom Line: Those expected more from Sucker Punch than a sequence of sexy girls kicking the tar out of mutant samurai, ghoul Nazi, and robots, with some story sprinkled of a breakout from a mental institute, will be sorely disappointed. Otherwise, Sucker Punch is a visceral visual kick in the teeth.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Didn't even meet our low expectations,"This movie is not as complex as some would like to make out and it's metaphors are not hugely deep and multi-layered. It's all fairly obvious and entirely tedious. Me and my friends were bored and fidgety throughout but we still didn't need to be fully focused to keep up with the plot - comparisons with Inception are totally overblown.If there were any points where I thought, ""oh, I should pay attention here and listen to what they're trying to say"", I quickly remembered that I didn't actually care at all and wasn't interested in figuring out the meaning of their trite, ridiculous voice-over pronouncements of faux-wisdom. I didn't care about the characters, didn't care about the plot and so I couldn't bring myself to care about even the supposedly good bits in the form of the fighting. It was all tedium, all the time.Not wanting to spend hours thinking about the ""depth"" and ""messages"" of this movie is not a result of my laziness, it's because of the film- makers' laziness.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I love the gradient colors, stunning CGI and video game based hack and slash stunts. Plot is simple, but the execution is tough. Zack had done a beautiful job in presenting this movie with his own glamor style. Emily does justice to the character with her cheesy looks and decent acting.

"More than a popcorn flick, but far from perfect...","For the most part, I enjoyed SUCKER PUNCH. Visually, the film is amazing, as Snyder's films always are, but I feel he's getting a little too comfortable with using his ""trademark"" slow-motion/bullet-time effects in EVERYTHING he does. I really would like to see him do something without that as a creative crutch. It worked well in 300 since it was primarily an action film, and WATCHMEN was long enough that these effects were merely occasional artistic flairs, and made sense. In SUCKER PUNCH, there's too much of this and it stands out, primarily due to the back-and-forth nature of this film's narrative structure, jumping in and out, from reality to fantasy, whereas these effects only appear in the fantasy segments. Otherwise, I liked the story (a positive message told through a very down beat story) and the film also benefits from a good, throwback, high energy, edgy pop soundtrack. The narrated bit at the end, however, was a tad heavy-handed.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Pretensious, incoherent, hypocritical trash",Zack Snyder's Sucker Punch is the kind of film that was designed purely to fulfill the fantasies of the G4 addicted gamers that creamed their shorts when they first saw sneak previews of it at Comic-Con. The film itself succinctly highlights a disturbing trend among the ever-popular subculture of geekdom: its rampant sexism and utter lack of imagination. This is one of the most unintelligible and brainless movies of recent years. The screenplay seems to have been constructed out of the fragmented thoughts and suggestions of a fifteen year-old video game addict with ADD.

horrible movie,"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE MOVIE!!! Absolutely awful. One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Zach Snyder is a fantastic director and I'm a fan of his previous work, but this movie was terrible. Their was no character development. Every character was flat. The story line made no sense and the general sense of realism and verisimilitude was non existent. People think that because special effects look cool, that it's a good movie. The ridiculous special effects and pointless action was almost unwatchable. I guess if you like dumb movies where you can leave your brain at the door and sit around like a brainwashed robot and look at visuals for 2 hours then this is your movie. If your actually into ""real"" intelligent movies that actually convey story, mood and emotion, then don't see this movie because it lacks all that. The only thing this movie had was cool visual effects, but even the effects didn't fit with the wildly incoherent storyline. This movie along with other recent contemporary movies have really made me questionable as to where the future of the film industry is headed? Movies seem to get dumber and dumber as the years go by, it's a shame.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"If you are looking for action, fantasy worlds & beautiful girls","First of all, let us have a quick review about the director Zack Snyder, Zack is the director for both hits ""300"" & ""Watchmen"", regardless both story lines, the direction was a remarkable trademark for Snyder's slow motion action & camera angles. This is what is happening here in Sucker Punch, the movies contains beautiful girls with big guns & acrobatic abilities to deliver memorable action packed sequences in a number of fantasy world created from the main character's ""Baby Doll"" imagination. but thats that... The story you'll either OK with it (not love it) or totally hate it. as it seems that Snyder (also screen writer) created the action & fantasy sequences & still haven't finished the main plot idea to back up the sequences. overall, if your are looking for girls with big guns, that's the movie.either than that just avoid I personally enjoyed the movie as I knew what I was getting into.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Uninvited meets steampunk and acoustic rock in the alleys of Snyder's mind!,"What a movie!!! Before I move on to praise it to bits, it must say that it is a love it or a hate it type of a movie and I very clearly loved it.Trying to describe this movie for me is akin to a synaesthete trying to describe colours to a blind person. The sheer imagery defies words. The execution of imagination is brilliant.Like it was said in many reviews, there isn't a strong script and this is one of those movies which does not need it. The music, the dark visual style, the steampunk action sequences will either make you groan or make you sit up and dig deeper and deeper into your popcorn bucket.Every last pixel is well imagined and the visual tapestry that is a result of Snyder's imagination and astounding vfx will blow everything off into the background.Imagine the best fight sequences of LOTR mated with the slo-mo of matrix and the mood of 300 you will have a very slight idea of what this is all about. Go watch the movie with this expectation and it will still blow your mind.Okay, my conscience wants me to say something more, but feel free not to read this - makes no difference.Emily Browning's deadpan expressions are a slight drawback, but then with Cornish, Hudgens, Zepplins, Monsters, Katanas and the rest on screen, you barely get to notice Browning's shortcomings.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Dark Story, but with Redeeming Cinematography","For a mildly interested Zach Snyder fan, Sucker Punch introduces you to get another version of his wildly cinematic and heavily CG slow-mo worlds.

Where is the weight of a story such as this if it all exists in someone else's head?But all that to say, the performances by all we're very well done alongside a compelling soundtrack and over the top effects. The underlying dark story reaches some level of redeeming quality and it's one of those films where you watch once and respect the ambitious nature of such a project.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Big-budget, steam-punk flavoured junk.","After attempting to shoot her abusive stepfather, but accidentally killing her sister instead, blonde hottie Babydoll (Emily Browning) is sent to a home for the mentally insane where dear old step-daddy pays a member of staff to organise a lobotomy for the traumatised girl. In the five days leading up to the operation, Babydoll plans to escape with the help of several equally attractive female inmates (played by Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone, Vanessa Hudgens and Jamie Chung), but repeatedly retreats into an elaborate, make-believe realm to help her cope with her situation.Director Zack Snyder was the man responsible for the historically inaccurate, CGI-laden, homo-erotic movie adaptation of Frank Miller's '300', which bored the hell out of me thanks to an over-reliance on CGI effects, the absence of anything resembling a decent plot, waaay too much slow motion, and the fact that buffed-up Spartans really aren't my thing.Sucker Punch thankfully replaces the lightly oiled pectorals and abs with tantalising shots of scantily clad babes (an exposed thigh here, a bare midriff there), but still suffers from a glut of digital trickery (to realise Babydoll's amazingly detailed, steampunk-styled, imaginary world), a total lack of substance, and Snyder's continual misguided belief that playing out matters at half-speed (to the strains of a dreadful emo-goth-pop soundtrack) somehow lends emotional gravitas or dramatic intensity to proceedings. Also a major detraction is the fact that at no point during the film are the girls ever in real danger, all of the incredible action—the battles against stone samurai, zombie Nazis and fire breathing dragons—only ever occurring in the mind of Babydoll.But perhaps most irritating thing of all about Sucker Punch are Snyder's desperate attempts to disguise the film as anything other than the masturbatory fantasy it so obviously is, the thin veneer of female empowerment, confusing 'dreamworlds-within-a-dreamworld' set-up, and emo-friendly themes of sacrifice and redemption not fooling this viewer for a second.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""Sucker Punch"" tries to hit you with its best shot.","Baby Doll, Sweet Pea, Amber, Blondie and Rocket all must band together to fight zombies, giant samurais, dragons and robots to find five objects in order to escape the mental institute. That must have been as much information Zack Snyder (director of ""300"" and ""Watchmen"") was able to fit on his cocktail napkin as he drafted the screen play for ""Sucker Punch."" Snyder's original concept could be either an expansive epic tale with lots of eye candy for the fan boys or the plot to a late night Cinemax adult film. Take out the action scenes then add in a few ""adult situations"" and the story is basically the same.We start our journey with the main focus of the five heroines, Baby Doll (played by Emily Browning). She narrates the opening scene telling us that we all have guardian angels watching over us. She then offers some psychobabble about how sometimes the bad things can also lead to good things.In an opening sequence with very little dialogue, we see her mother die then there is a terrible accident that forces her evil stepfather to commit Baby Doll to an insane asylum. Once in the Asylum Baby Doll has five days before she is given a frontal lobe lobotomy.From this point forward, the viewer should really shut his or her mind off and enjoy the ride. Nothing more is explained on how things work or even why they work in Snyder's world. This is a pure gratification film from the aesthetic viewpoint.Baby Doll immediately learns how to use a cerebral performance to escape the asylum even if it is only in her mind. But where would a 20-year-old orphan escape to if she had the choice? Of course, she would choose to escape to a burlesque house. Yep, that's right, a place worse than the asylum. Now she has to run away from a sleazy pimp (played by Oscar Isaac) and his filthy clientele. Also, in this alternate world, she will also choose to wear scanty lingerie (hey, I'm on board with it).Baby Doll soon finds that she can be a persuasive exotic dancer. While dancing she holds her viewers captive so that she can visit alternative realities. In her first trip she meets up with a wise sage (played by Scott Glenn) who gives her instructions on how to escape from her asylum/ burlesque house. He gives her a samurai sword and a fully loaded hand gun. Similar to the plot of many Xbox video games, she is given a task to do and each level becomes progressively harder. Luckily she bands together with four other girls who don't like wearing a lot of clothes either.The plan is simple: Baby Doll dances to distract her captors while the four girls gather their needed objects to escape. Her dancing is so hypnotic that we, the audience, aren't even allowed to see her dance. Instead we see several extremely articulate action scenes all held together by a soundtrack with cover songs from The Beatles, The Pixies and Jefferson Airplane. It's a fair trade.Should you see this movie? Only if you like action, fantasy, and young girls dressed in various seductive costumes (you know who you are).The bulk of the film is an action fantasy that would make perfect sense to die-hard gamers, steam punkers, sci-fi geeks, and almost any dude under the age of 25. Right before the credits roll, we hear the message of why we were watching this orgy of guns, swords and cleavage for the last hour and a half. With that, Snyder mucks up a perfectly good visually amplified film by trying to add a deep meaning to it. I did feel sucker punched because of that effort.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I Don't Why People Hated This Film-- It's Good!,"I am glad I did not simply fall for the bad reviews against this film ""Sucker Punch."" Actually there was unbelievable hype going for this Zach Snyder film building up to its theater debut. However, as the movie opened, bad reviews unexpectedly started to pour in about how bad it was! I almost was not able to watch at all in the movie house, until this week. And I am glad that I did catch it.While it may seem that the target may be the young male audiences because of its cool look, sexy girls, big weapons and violent scenes, the deeper message of the entire movie would seem to target the young females. The film exhorts young women to stand their ground and fight for their rights. However, it also sends the not-so-subtle message to these young ladies that this would not be an easy task in this world, as our heroines needed to escape into their dreams in order to escape their harsh realities in a world of bad men.This type of movie has to be seen in the big screen to appreciate its full effect. The CGI is awesomely executed in that cool anime style to bring us to diverse locales, from asylum to brothel to Oriental temples to WWI trenches. There is even a fire-breathing dragon in there somewhere. While the female leads are young, pretty and sexy, although acting may not really be their top suits. The plot is very intricate where there are multiple layers of reality and fantasy which involve many characters, so much so that the ending is very open for interpretation. I do not know exactly why people hated this film. I think it does its job very well. It is actually quite entertaining and delivered in a very artistic cinematic style.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I was completely immersed in the story from start to finish and felt deeply about the characters. I thought the action was great, the CGI wasn't incredible but whatever.I think this film gets a bad wrap because it is overwhelming in nature. The fantasy action sequences which seemingly happen within our protagonist's mind are kind of random. However, i think instead it was an incredible showing of how strong she was as a character in spirit. Instead of watching her dance (presumingly sexually) on front of paying men, we watched her defeat fantastical enemies in her mind. Metaphorically I think she was defeating the inner demons of her mind.Completely underrated film, would highly recommend. Your motto when watching this film should be ""just go with it"".

I usually recommend watching movies completely to get a full sense of the film but this is one where you forward to right when she's starting to dance to see an action sequence. The film should've been made up almost entirely of the action sequences and shortened to focus on that. The fight scenes are very well done and the animation is actually really good especially for being from 2011. 4 stars for the action scenes. Barely a star for the rest of the film.

"Good concept and visuals, bad movie","Sucker Punch is the story of a group of problematic teen girls (Baby Doll, Sweet Pea, Rocket, Blondie and Amber) trying to escape a mental institution for girls where they are abused and exploited by its director Blue Jones.The start of the movie is very promising. It tells the story of how Baby Doll, the leading character, gets to the mental institution. It has a good narrative and terrific music, and, in fact, looks very much like a well-made video-clip.This being a Fantasy film, you expect the unexpected and you are already open to unbelievable things to happen; however, to swallow the lot, the story needs to have an internal logic that makes it organic, and you rarely find that here beyond the opening sequence and the thin line connecting the different day-dreams. The day-dreaming scenes, are very entertaining, because, well, they are supposed to be day-dreams in which anything is possible. However, once again, thee whole seems like an extended video-clip pastiche, one moving to a different one.The movie has a great concept and succeeds at creating an unique an bizarre Universe that mixes themes and aesthetics in vogue in modern pop culture (a mix of early medieval, Gothic, traditional Japanese, the 1920s and 1950s aesthetics). The special effects are great,and the action scenes are terrifically filmed, and always powered by a terrific music. However, the script is so thin, the characters so superficially drawn, the nonsense so obvious, and the pretentiousness of some scenes (the end for example) so patronizing that you cannot ignore them.The acting was good on the part of the always convincing Oscar Isaac as Blue Jones, John Glenn as the Wise Man, Jena Malone as Rocket, and Amy Cormish as her sister Sweet Pea. The rest of the cast is OK: Emily Browing as melancholic Baby Doll, Vanessa Hudgengs as Blondie, Jamy Chung as Amber, and Carla Gugino as Dr. Vera Gorski. The rest of the cast seems to be more a group of extras passing by, despite the cameo of Jon Hamn.I loved the soundtrack, but there is barely a rest from it. Although the lyrics of the songs are directly related to the story, the intensity of the music is overwhelming and numbing. This is a movie and you expect the music to be at the service of the story, not the opposite!The fleshy flesh wasn't necessary in the story, to be honest, and it is a bit of a perverted old man's fantasy. Sorry Snyder! I found unnecessary the characters being dressed in sluttish dresses the whole time. They could have carried on the story with the girls wearing jeans and t-shirts outside their dancing areas. Insulting are those moments in which the focus of the camera goes on some of the girls' bottoms!At the end of the movie I felt that the great imagination, potential and actors have been wasted by a poor direction and that Snyder is your man if you want to get a super-duper video-clip not a movie.The DVD has a bonus of 4 animated short films directed by Ben Hibon (Feudal Warriors, The Trenches, Dragon and Distant Planet), which complement the day-dreaming scenes. They are good visually, full of potential, but too hurriedly done, and with paper-thin plots provided by the same director, not by the animator. You can have wonderful animation, but if you have a poor story, the rest is a waste of time, money and talent. If you cannot do something well, don't do it at all.An action packed film full of fantasy, big fights, silly stories, and girls in sluttish dresses. A movie mostly for hormonal teenagers.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Stylish, entertaining graphic novel adaptation","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningA young girl (Emily Browning) who comes to be known as Babydoll, finds herself institutionalised in a mental asylum by her wicked step father, which is a front for a gentlemen's club, run by the slimy Blue Jones (Oscar Isaac), where girls are forced to perform erotic dances for the amusement of rich men. After being put on the spot to perform her first dance, Babydoll finds herself transported to a mystical fantasy world, where she finds herself under the tutelage of the Wise Man (Scott Glenn) who teaches her to place her mind where her body isn't. From here, Babydoll hatches a plot to break herself and her fellow dancers free.The graphic novel adaptation craze, started by Robert Rodriguez with 2005's Sin City, is still alive and kicking, as evidenced by Zack Snyder's Sucker Punch, which from the opening already appears slightly lost in a case of style over substance, with the blurry, grungy cinematography and deep, heavy goth soundtrack not promising much in the way of an engaging story. But stick with it past this little hurdle and there's a more enjoyable, traditional action thriller to wit here of a group of heroes, here quite pleasantly in the shape of some sexy girls in kinky outfits, taking down a dastardly villain. It's gained some criticism for it's content being a 12 certificate film, and it is easy to see why this is, given the girl's dress sense and some of the quite explicit violence in parts.It's a bad omen, but probably the most impressive thing about the film is the special effects, stylish, impressive CGI action set pieces, including dragons, fighter aircraft and Nazi trenches, brought to life with a colourful, vibrant quality that makes the film work where it was meant to. Snyder has worked his Watchmen formula to a film not quite as violent or graphic, but which still packs quite a powerful punch, with a plot in reverse twist at the end that helps it make sense a bit more.Unlike Watchmen, it's wisely a lot shorter and therefore more palatable and works a bit more where that film didn't. The characters are certainly more pleasing to the eye, and to be honest so is the action, so even if it isn't perfect, you're on to a far surer bet with it. ***",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Oh, and one more thing ...","Greetings again from the darkness. I am actually a fan of Zack Snyder's two most recent films: 300 and Watchmen. Because of those films, I was really looking forward to what he would do with his first original piece. Two things are now very clear. First, Mr. Snyder is a visual virtuoso with film. Secondly, he is not much of a writer.I'll start with the bad news. I was stunned at how lousy the story and script were. Some of the dialogue is so bad it comes across as purposefully dumbed down. If that is the intention, then I must ask WHY? It's clearly not a movie for little kids, so most over aged 13 are quite capable of following a story. Therein lies the biggest problem. This isn't even a story! The ending makes absolutely no sense and the road to that ending just makes you happy it's over ... no matter the dumb ending.The good news is that Mr. Snyder's visual effects do not disappoint. There are some terrific battle scenes and one of the coolest on screen dragons you'll ever see. The film is very dark and muted in colors (think Sin City) but that works for the dream sequences and the asylum interiors. Very little color is present other than just before the dance sequences. Speaking of, what's with the dance sequences? If Baby Doll's dancing is the key to the film, shouldn't we get more than just a head-bob? The premise is that Baby Doll (Emily Browning) is cast away to an asylum by her step-father. She has five days to escape or she faces a lobotomy. Yes, really. She quickly discovers that her dancing has a mesmerizing effect on all those watching and she can escape into her fantasy world. While there, she meets a Wise Man played by Scott Glenn in a role that would have been perfect for the late David Carradine. The Wise Man tells her what to do to gain her freedom and she quickly enlists the help of some other inmates: Sweat Pea (Abbie Cornish), Rocket (Jena Malone), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens)and Amber (Jamie Chung).The asylum has an even darker side as run by Blue (Oscar Isaac). He forces Dr Vera Gorski (Carla Gugin) to teach the girls to dance so as to entertain ""high rollers"" who pay big bucks to Blue to spend time with the girls. Gugino plays her character like a rip-off of Natasha Fatale from the old Bullwinkle cartoons. Blue is just a weaselly bad guy who brings nothing to the film ... and this film needed a top notch bad guy.The actresses all seem like they got into their roles and enjoy the physicality required for the fighting and action scenes. Cornish especially comes off well. Browning in the lead as Baby Doll brings no real baggage to the role as most won't recognize her. Jena Malone has been an indie film favorite for years and Ms. Hudgens is trying to find a new audience after the High School musical films.This movie was pitched as ""Alice in Wonderland with machine guns"". I believe that is a slap to the face of Lewis Carroll. Watching this movie is like watching someone else play a video game that you aren't familiar with ... or a two hour music video of a terrible song. So if you must see it, enjoy the visual effects and don't think too much about what the characters say or why they do what they do. And let's all hope that Mr. Snyder's visuals payoff for next year's Superman movie ... and be glad that Christopher Nolan is working on that script!",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Mixed bag, but still great to look at","Sucker Punch is really two movies. One is pretty dang impressive, especially from a visual standpoint, and the other is really just mediocre. Combined, they make a half-decent film. It's one of those movies that looks so good and is set against a backdrop with sufficient surreality that one can easily not only suspend disbelief but also expel it, semipermanently, from one's mind.A diminutive girl (Emily Browning) is thrown into an insane asylum by her evil stepfather after she accidentally kills her younger sister while defending her from his advances. Once in there, she's befriended/mocked/ostracized/encouraged by a group of young ladies, led by Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish). The asylum, we quickly learn, is really a very expensive brothel, and the girls earn their keep.When the girl, named Baby Doll, is asked to dance during the girls' ballet practice by their taskmaster teacher Dr. Gorski (Carla Gugino), she retreats into an imaginary world that would put make Alice's Wonderland look like a trip to JC Penney's. Within this fantasy world, Baby Doll learns from a wise man (Scott Glenn) that she will need to locate certain artifacts in order to make her escape. When she comes out of her reverie – to much applause, as apparently her dance was just that good – Baby Doll has formed her plan.Imagination is a powerful tool. Each time Baby Doll dances, she is able to get closer to her ultimate goal. But she isn't alone, not even in these fantasies – she is joined by Sweet Pea, Rocket (Jena Malone), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), and Amber (Jamie Chung). One moment they're fighting the Germans in a steampunk warfront, the next they're in a Lord of the Rings setting, and so on, all to get those artifacts. That's the good, impressive movie. The meh one is the plot line outside of those fantasy scenes. True, the actresses all seem to have good chemistry with one another, but what we basically get is an evil asylum leader with lascivious intentions that are eclipsed only by his unmitigated greed. We do get quite a bit of urgency, too, as Baby Doll is scheduled for a lobotomy in just five days' time. And while Oscar Isaac, as bad guy Blue Jones, is hissable as a villain, there's almost no depth to his character at all, making his scenes with the girls excruciating and pointless to watch.Here's something I did find a little odd. Browning, all bright eyed and bushy tailed, looked to me to be in her mid teens, an older sister to a single-digit sib. But when she's checked into the asylum by her stepfather, her age is given as 20. I don't know if Browning, who really is 22, looked 20 in this movie. But maybe that's a minor quibble.The visuals will remind you of director Zack Snyder's earlier work with 300 and Watchmen, with maybe a smidge of Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. Sweeping, violent, visceral war scenes, improbable action, the works. When the girls descend to kick ass – be the ass German, robot, orc, what have you – their movements are even less believable than those of the Crazy 88s in Kill Bill Vol. 1. But that's intentional, and here it works.Overall, Sucker Punch is entertaining, and it delivers on its own premise. It's full of truly astounding cinematography, spectacular but not dizzying, and it features some pretty damn commanding performances, particularly by Browning, Cornish, and Malone.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Action Fodder for Male generation,Went to see this film with my girlfriend who to be honest she wasn't looking forward to it. I had seen trailer and thought it looked excellent and being a fan of Zak Snyder was expecting a lot from it. On entering cinema and taking our seats I did notice two old men sitting in front of us (you can guess what they where there to see). It did deliver with an orgy of action which was pleasing to the eye especially with an all female cast rather than the usual male dominated action flicks.The problem is I could see why some people might find the story hard to follow with most if not all the action being played out in the mind of the lead girl Baby doll.It also had the look of a computer game at times with added slow-mo which I find appealing as effects and CGI can be hard to make out when moving fast (Spider man 3 shame on you).Overall I would recommend this film not to anyone (girl friend fell asleep) but mostly men and young teens looking for some eye candy and tons of action. I look forward now with confidence for Zak Snyders version of Superman Man Of Steel,5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The world's most expensive music video and little else.,"For anyone familiar with Zack Snyder, this movie is no surprise. He earned the right to make this by turning an old graphic novel, 300, into a money making machine and filming the once impossible to film Watchmen. Now, here he is with his own original concept and it's one for the ages. While the overall concept, in theory, isn't a terrible one, it's the execution that drives me nuts as it's filled with every imaginable cliché and the whole film is, in essence, one long music video. In between the much touted fantasy sequences, we have a cast of heavily made up, overly polished young women moping around a sanitarium without much to do or say although they would look more at home in a brothel. Style over anything resembling substance is the order of the day here. The fantasy sequences play in a way that kept making me think ""this is what a 12 year old with $80 million would make"" Giant samurai with Gatling guns, fire breathing dragons and slow-mo closeups of girls jumping with guns and swords. All bombast flash and no heart is what best sums up these scenes and this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Sucker Punch Delivers Unexpected Depth,"It is easy to dismiss Sucker Punch as another of the mounting number of films where digital effects substitute for plot, character development, script and justification. I think this seduced many reviewers into panning this effort based on preconceived notions. That's a shame, because this movie accomplishes much that makes it a fine bit of film-making.First, we care about the characters as they progress from societal jetsam into living engaging, satisfying entities through the most unconventional mechanism of sheer fantasy. Second, the film leaves us with several strong messages and pays homage to heroic altruism in a way that was, for this reviewer, quite shattering. After the banality of other fantasies such as Thor and Green Lantern, this level of engagement was very welcome indeed.Of course, one must address the issue of eye candy. The movie is a fountainhead of imagination. It aspires to portrayal of intense violence with almost no blood, sexuality with no nudity and makes use of the female warrior archetype with a completeness that films like Aeon Flux and Ultraviolet seemed to miss in the final analysis. Most gratefully, this success was achieved without the cloying presence of 3D.Seven out of ten seems like a high rating, but unconventional courage must be respected and this film provides it in both conception and execution.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Something Really Wrong Going On,"There is so much eye candy in this movie that it could cause a diabetic coma. That may be a good thing because you could not be offended by the absolutely dumbest dialog possible in a mega budget movie. The ludicrous lines and embarrassing exclamations (delivered as insightful witticisms) are abysmal.The binding of school girl cutesy and video game violence are trendy and targeted at the right audience for this type of thing. But its underbelly is laden with depressing depictions of mental health torture and trafficking in sex slavery and that is indefensible and completely unnecessary and irresponsible.Some very good films can be made about psychological horror, sex slave profiteering, and balls to the wall action adventures. But when it is packaged together and marketed for fun, there is something really wrong going on.The music is god-awful lame and some of the worst remakes ever, and the script is so disjointed that the whole thing collapses under the weight of self-indulgent seriousness that it is a mess of maniacal characters and psychopathic persona's that sour this ""summer fun"" film and leaves a very bad taste.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

You'll be fine as long as you leave your brain at the door,"I know a good movie when I see one...This isn't one. But you can't really call it a bad movie.Like much (read: all) of Zack Snyder's work, this movie is best watched with the reasoning part of your head mostly turned off. Just imagine that you're reading a cool comic book and then suddenly that comic decided it wanted to be a full length motion picture. That's essentially how I treated this movie and I believe that's really the only way to fully appreciate this movie.On to the story. From the trailer, you can tell it's about escaping reality into a dream. The thing is that story is about a girl, called Baby Doll, who gets wrongly sent to a mental institution by an evil step-father. In order to escape the horrible reality of being trapped in the asylum, she escapes by imagining a dreamworld...where she is trapped in an illegal strip club / brothel...wait, what?Anyway, while trapped in the brothel she comes up with a plan to escape an recruits a few friends. As they collect the needed items for their escape, she gives herself courage to go through the plan by...imagining herself in other crazy dreamworlds where she and her friends are super soldiers and her enemies are either zombies, cyborgs, mutants, or some strange combination of the former stuff.So in case you missed that, she created dreamworlds to escape the horrible reality of the brothel, which is in itself a dreamworld she created to escape the horrible reality of the asylum...And here is my biggest problem with the movie. Why the double layer of pseudo reality? I thought the story would be fine if they stuck with just brothel world. Or heck it would be also fine if they skip the brothel part and stuck with just being in the asylum. I think the only reason we even have the brothel part was because they needed an excuse to put the main cats in skimpy clothing (or, most likely, because Inception is still an internet meme at this point)So the story kinda goes awry when we start jumping between one reality to another but overall, there is a solid plot that you can figure out if you think hard enough. It was a decent story but the character development was a little lackluster. Also, the word ""acting"" has a veeeeeery loose meaning here.But the real appeal of this movie is of course the effects. Are the action sequences as crazy as we saw in the trailer? Yes. In fact what we saw in the trailers are just the tip of the iceberg. in typical Zack Snyder style, the action is intense, filled with complex choreography, cool use of weapons, sweeping camera movement, and the ever popular (read: quite annoying) use of slooooooooowwwwwww mooootioooon.Granted, he does use the slo-mo thing rather tastefully, syncing the action with the movies awesome soundtrack. The slo-mo is bearable here, even appreciated at some scenes. But there was this once scene in the move where I think the slo-mo was pushing it a bit.Credit to the guys who designed all of Baby Doll's dreamworlds though. The set design, both real and imagined, is excellent. Even though the movie is about escaping to non-reality, at least they didn't go totally into silly cartoon realms by removing all semblance of sense. It's like most Japanese anime: Nowhere near realistic, but not so removed from reason that you can't relate to it anymore.Overall, the movie was enjoyable. It had a decent story and cast and the effects in the action scenes were quite entertaining. Not terribly memorable but I'll probably want to pick it up when it comes out on video.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Fun Flick,The movie portrays itself as something a little different and that as a viewer is exactly what you get. The characters have enough personality to be of interest but none are really developed fully because of the steady pace of the action sequence that are weaved into the story line. The dream scenes are visually dazzling and the action in them top rate. The dynamic between the actresses is very much that of a team and it's impressive that many of the stunts and fight scenes were done by the actual actors in the film. I didn't find a real connection with any one of the bunch but it was a movie that was worth seeing on the big screen just for the stunning visuals. Solid Sci-fi/drama with some kick ass fighting.

Sucker Punch - 0.5 Stars,"""Sucker Punch"" ain't no movie. ""Sucker Punch"" is an excess of testosterone vomited into a reel of celluloid until it is violently splashed into the faces of its audience. The movie's advertisements are diligent in declaring its promise: ""You will be unprepared."" They were right. I was not prepared for the overwhelming atrocity that I had to bear during the course of its running time. By the movie's end, I felt that my senses had been pummeled to dust.The plot, if that's what you call it, is this: A grieving girl who has just lost her mother has been framed by her stepfather for murder, and is now imprisoned in a mental institution. A lobotomy awaits her. So, in the meantime, she creates a fantasy world of her own. Within that fantasy world, she creates another fantasy world. That's twice the fantasy. It's kinda like ""Inception"", only stupid.The girl's fantasy actually belongs to Zack Snyder, writer and director. One of his most popular films is ""300"", a movie where its heroes wage war wearing nothing but a cape and their underwear, so the enemy could marvel at the sight of their abs, and get distracted. In ""Sucker Punch"", five young women charge into battles with their short skirts and high heels. In the fantasy world, the second one, the girls are against kamikaze robot bombers, blazing angry dragons, giant samurais, and, of course, a few hundred steam-powered Nazi zombies. Movies by Zack Snyder aren't about what's rational or comprehensible. Reaching its truest form in ""Sucker Punch"", Snyder makes movies to share with the world, his imagination, which was the vomit I was talking about earlier.Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/sucker-punch-movie-review/",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Very flawed, but very fun (for the right audience).","""You have all the weapons you need. Now fight!""Sucker Punch is a cheesecake action movie that offers a crazy premise, lots of hot girls, and non-stop video game/anime inspired explosions and fights. If you expect anything more than that from the movie, you will be greatly disappointed. This is a niche film if I've ever seen one. It's simultaneously silly, dark, and very grim. All sex appeal and slow-motion back flips. Style over substance taken to a new peak. And a lot of people will most assuredly hate it.Will this appeal to you? Picture watching a hot girl having a sword fight with giant Gatling gun-wielding demon samurai (in slow motion and with lots of explosions and collapsing buildings) one minute, and then watching five hot girls fight a WWI-inspired battle against Nazi Zombies the next minute. With giant mechs. And then there are dragons. And orcs. And nothing but the flimsiest excuse for why these things are happening. And each girl dresses like a burlesque dancer or call girl at all times. And there's non-stop violence involving said scantily-clad girls. Sucker Punch is two hours of exactly all those things.Oh, and there are three separate realities that the characters exist in.I won't even bother trying to explain the story, because it's just an insane excuse to see half-naked women do things and kill stuff in slow motion. Don't worry about the plot, it will just distract you from focusing on Baby Doll (Emily Browning) shooting down a Zeppelin with a machine gun, while wearing a sailor outfit/Japanese school girl uniform. Or keep you from focusing on Rocket (Jena Malone) while she's blowing off a robot's head with a sawed-off shotgun and trying to stop a bomb on a speeding train from blowing up a city. If you're going to watch this movie, you'll get the best experience by keeping your attention solely on what's happening right in front of you at any given moment, and forgetting about what's happened before or what the overall story is supposed to be, and how any of this is supposed to fit into it. Just go with it.Sucker Punch is nonsensical, silly, and lots of people who see it will think it's purely exploitative, empty, action-driven trash. That's a fair assessment. I can't fault them for that opinion. Even a fan of the movie (which I am, in case you can't tell by now) has to admit that at it's very best, Sucker Punch is an absurd, sleazy male fantasy with only the most shallow visual appeal and thrills to recommend it.I still found it very entertaining, though. Flaws and all, this was ultimately a fun movie (for me). For the right audience, Sucker Punch is a uniquely exhilarating genre flick that combines babes, action, and a ton of different influences in a way that doesn't happen very often.Just consider my review carefully before you watch something that could possibly be a massive waste of your time. As for me, I'm looking forward to a blu-ray release that hopefully restores the footage that was cut from the theatrical version. This is a crazy ride, but I'm totally prepared to take it again.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What happened to 2 hours of my life?,"First of all, to all you people who loved this movie, I respect your opinion. But seriously, I find it hard to find a single good thing about this movie. Being a fan of 300 and Watchmen I refused to believe the reviews. Reviews that burned down this movie. Surely a man who made such great movies cannot create such a monster of a flick? How wrong I was. I should have listened. They were right. I encourage everyone to think for themselves but in this case, believe what you read or hear about Sucker Punch. At least believe the bad reviews. Save your money for a good movie. Do not spend it on this. And why is it so bad? let me sum it up in 1 simple line. Before you can have a story within a story within a story, you should have a story to start with, just special effects does not make a story. Mister Snyder needed ""to go Deeper"" with this story before he started shooting.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Zack's most controversial feature,"I guess here in my country it was one of the most promoted flicks and the one no-one went to. Really, even at my work there were posters hanging in the men's toilets. And admit, most posters just shown the girls in sexy underwear or clothes. So indeed, I thought that this was one for the flesh flute players. But still, all the negativity surrounding this flick kept me attracted to it. How many times are flicks being hated by the press becoming cult classics. Now I don't think that it will be a classic, only time will tell. Al the 5 girls were almost unknown for me, okay, I knew Vanessa Hudgens from High School Shitcall and Jena Malone from The Ruins but that was all. Scott Glenn didn't need an introduction I guess. But back to the five, I was surprised that they did it all well. Naturally it's a Zack Ryder flick and you love him or hate him. He's really a CGI man. And it do shows but it's all done so beautiful that I never was annoyed by the CGI. And the score, what a great tracks and how it was edited into the flick. I have seen the extended cut which clocks in 17 minutes longer so it took me over 2 hours of my life and wasn't bored at all. The CGI did take the overhand at the dream (or should I say dance) sequences but there was actually a story involved. This may be Zack's most controversial feature so far but if you can dig futuristic flicks or fantasy than it's one to watch. It do contain dragons, zombies, robots and creatures to have a fight with. For me it was a nice surprise to have seen Sucker Punch, I liked it, strangely most of the viewers didn't.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
There's a movie born every minute too...,"(Not Recommended) That sound you might here in the distance may be the ka-ching of the cash register as this film rakes in millions from unsuspecting moviegoers, or the grumbling from a disapproving audience of movie fans in love with graphic novel adaptations and video games. Yes, the latest loud, crass, and bombastic film from Zack Snyder, Sucker Punch ( with an emphasis on the first syllable, I might add ), has now entered the movie arena and you have now been officially warned! So prepare yourself if you choose to attend its screening for two full hours of utter nonsense or wisely avoid this movie at all costs if you have any common sense ( which the film itself sorely lacks ).The lame brained plot is a mere outline of a film without a real script. Meet Babydoll, ( Emily Browning ) who befriends Sweet Pea ( Abbie Cornish ), Rocket ( Jena Malone ), Blondie, whose a brunette ( Vanessa Hudgens ), and Amber ( Jamie Chung ). All of the actors overdo their roles and deserve better material than this.This miserable and senseless onslaught of mayhem is meant to be camp, but it lacks any real wit or humor. Sucker Punch is the equivalence of visual static. It's a series of music videos strung together posing as a coherent movie. Highly influenced in the Michael Bay School of Filmmaking, the film is full of noise, explosions, gunfire, and crashes. ( I would be amiss if I didn't state that the film's director, Zack Snyder, does have a strong visual sense of filmmaking. He keeps the action sequences moving at a quick pace, except for his overuse of anachronistic pop songs and slo-mo effects. But it is his writing skills that are also old- fashioned and lazy, desperately in need a reboot. He's become a poor man's David Lynch with a nod to Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill. )His film aspires to be just a teenage fan boy fantasy, a movie display of female eye candy who fight Nazi zombies, dragons, robots, and other Gameboy obstacles, dispensing justice with cutting edge swords and state of the arts computer effects. Sadly, Snyder has more to offer than this pap.Sucker Punch is a bloated mash-up of violence, action, and sex ( in descending order). The film has no redeeming value except for its visual kinetic style which put me in sensory overload within the first half hour. Sucker Punch will affront your senses and leave you breathless with its boldness and audacity. It certainly reinforced its title claim for anyone who comes near this film mess ( with an emphasis on the first word, I might add ). It is undoubtedly one of the worst films of this year.

Blatant contrived attempt at being deep, failed completely unless you're a Twilight fan. 3. Tarnished the name of a respectable director. 4. Obvious effort was given towards giving the dragged-along-boyfriend an erection by the sexual exploitation of the cast. 5. Severe lack of plot. 6. The cheesy narrator mentioning that ""everyone has a guardian angel"", thats not even relevant to anything within the film.What this film has done is ruined its target market. If you are going for the teenage girl with no brain, take out the guns and fight scenes where you can see the crotch of the main character.

The hybrid of game play and film,"If film is about imagination and exploring life through a visual representation of one persons intention then Sucker punch is a film.It marries complex game play where you can feel the challenges and the visceral achievement of completing each level, even the rhythm matches that of playing an adventure game.The game play immersion allows the complete belief in the visual art that someone had to imagine prior to creation on film.You look forward to the story telling through the imagination of the lead character and this adds to the sense of escapism, it gives you permission to suspend judgement and experience the art because, at the back of the story you know it is happening in someone else's mind.The writers tread a fine line between to much, which would tip the viewer over the edge into non belief and the joy of experiencing scenes that you accept only after recovering from them.Something happens to us as we grow up scary movies no longer scare us, love stories no longer make us blush and super hero's no longer have us wanting to wear their costumes and jump fences.This movie took me to the time that I miss when it was easy for me to believe in the story despite its unrecognizable place in reality.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Sucker Punch Sucks Hard,"This flick may have had something interesting to say in its juxtaposition of sexual violence toward women and mindless cinematic violence- if it wasn't so busy hypocritically parading a bunch of young girls around in burlesque attire and school girl outfits.Like Inception, the scenes depicted in this film cease to hold any relevancy to the viewer. After the structure of the film is established it becomes utterly tiresome to watch, limply accosting us with a secondary reality concocted by the film's heroine to cope with the primary reality. We are then intermittently subjected to a tertiary reality the lead uses to cope with the horrors of the secondary reality.For example, rape in reality #1 = striptease in reality #2 = anime brawl in reality #3. We get it. It's not clever.The bulk of the film consists of the theft of mundane objects to aid in a breakout attempt. Acquisition of an object in reality #1 = striptease distraction and crafty sleight of hand in reality #2 = 15 minutes of cinematic trash in reality #3.People who dig it will claim it to be very cerebral when it's really just a vapid excuse for misplaced fetish and video game shenanigans.By the end, you'll be praying for a visit from Jon Hamm.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A true disappointment,"I can't explain just how much I wanted to love this film. The special effects, the music, the sheer beauty of the sets and actresses, I didn't even conceive the fact this move might be bad. As a fond lover of Watchmen, 300 and Dawn of the Dead I prepared myself for a good fun thrill ride with a simple enough storyline to tie it all together nicely. But as the tag line reads, I was unprepared for what I actually observed.The film starts very well up until the point Babydoll begins to dance and the fantasies are conveyed to the audience through exaggerated fantasy sequences. I expected them to be of an allegorical nature, each aspect symbolising a facet of her reality, and often found the ties between the dreams and the main plot... minute at best. Whilst these action sequences were fantastic, the rest of the story was flat, the characters thoroughly uninteresting, and I found myself confused by the overly convolute story line; simply waiting for the next erotic or action-packed sequence. And neither came, the move ends abruptly without any real closure, opportunities for fantastic dialogue scenes or intense fighting scenes were hurriedly skipped over leaving a lot to be desired.With a 12a rating here in the UK, there's nothing very sexually enticing about the film other than some fancy costumes, no real gore or violence and the story line is so weak and inexplicably cluttered that I find the whole film unmemorable. I clung to the hope throughout it may become an artsy film with some deeper meaning, or a tale of female empowerment but every chance to make any such insinuation is passed up, and Sucker Punch, is the utterly unsatisfying result.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Yeah, there are sexy girls in tight clothing doing very suggestive moves but the movie is far more than that.There are many layers of reality we are confronted with.Perception is key. Baby Doll and her friends see the world in layers of reality where they have to follow a mission to achieve their goal. The mission is achieved but not in the way one would predict, which is where the movie surprises and delights.Every time a step of Baby Doll's mission is travelled she is reminded that she has everything she needs to get it done. No judgement, no fear. Just do it.Yes, there are people whom we come to care about. Some die. The feelings of loss is real on every level of perception.Intellect and reasoning is present. As is the action and determination to realise the goal. Freedom.In the end we gain a new understanding of freedom and free will.

A vision that got ruined by poor narration,"I am a huge Zack Snyder fan , and his previous movies have been masterpieces. But ,well Sucker Punch is a movie that even the most ardent of Snyder's fan would feel being let down . Yes the movie is visually compelling and there are some memorable set pieces , but that alone does not make a movie good. Zack Snyder had a good story and a vision , but the story narration was lost between focus on CGI and costume designs. What was even a bigger letdown was the fact that many things are left unexplained . It's not that it's an open ended film , it feels more like the director almost forgot to explain things and hastily puts in five minutes of epilogue that goes above the head of an already bewildered audience. In spite of the poor story narration , the cinematography and music is great, i would recommend this movie to those who have little expectations from this film and have nothing to do on a weekend.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Truly Bad,"I am not a graphic novel reader, so can't compare this film too the novels, but I am an avid film watcher & having seen Snyder's other films, 300, Watchmen & Dawn Of The Dead, went into this film with reasonable expectations. Confident that I would be entertained by a CGI driven action fantasy with (I hoped) a half decent plot! Sadly Sucker Punch doesn't deliver on any level, the plot is too long winded & flimsy, the CGI nothing overtly original & the acting is way below par, I hope Scott Glenn wasn't hoping this would improve his career. Carla Gugino shone best in this film in my honest opinion, but I've seen her act better than this, so can only assume that she realised just how bad it was going too be & didn't give it her all.Do yourself a favour, go watch wallpaper grow, but don't waste over 100 minutes of your life watching this!",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Good music, Nice Action, Just a little bit more soul needed","More than 600 reviews don't know if it's smart to write another one, but i i will try to write form a different point then the others.When i start watching it the first thing that caught my attention is the MUSIC i love it when people know how to use music in they movies. I think it has a great chemistry with the scenes. Later i found out that Emily Browning is preforming few of the songs used in this movie, where she did a great job, here is a comment from Youtube where 2 user are argue about the song :User 1: MARILYN MANSON'S﻿ VERSION VERSION IS BETTER!!!!!!User 2: NEVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEER!!!!!!I watched this movie without knowing what to expect, i didn't read any reviews or watched any trailers, so i had no high or low expectations. And i think it's that best way to watch a movie.The story confused me in the beginning but it's getting all clear and it has a nice thrill in the End. It's a Classic Zack Snyder movie (if u watched 300 and Watchmen u know what i mean), just the characters needed more soul.U will like the movie if u like action/fantasy scenes good MUSIC and hot girls with guns, and u will hate it if u expect a perfect story and deep character emotions.Movie: 6/10 but i gave it an 7 because of the great SoundTrack. :D",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Good, but Lacked Punch","First of all, let me state that I'm a big admirer of Zack Snyder's ability to astonish the visual senses and, for lack of a better term, his ability to make the audience feel extremely ""badass."" However characteristic of his style, the film also unfortunately fell into his footsteps of tradition in terms of story and character: the plot was extremely thin, and the characters felt two dimensional. At numerous points throughout the film, I found myself extremely engaged in fantastic action sequences rich with steampunk imagery and almost anime-characteristic, intricately choreographed combat; yet, at the same time my own nondiegetic nagging voice questioned the intent behind the sequences. For example, the main character Baby Doll (Emily Browning) exists on three planes of existence (and to avoid spoilers, I will not further divulge information about them).One of the three, however spectacular it appears to be, is completely disconnected from the plot or story, so much so that when watching these particular sequences, the viewer is almost asked to completely disassociate from the logical narrative world and plunge into a world of chaos and fantasy. While very engaging due to their nature as quasi-comic book action scenes characteristic of Zack Snyder's style, they serve little purpose in perpetuating the narrative or developing ulterior themes. They just look cool. This is unfortunate and very detrimental to the film, as the common film-goer may find this fantastic, but those looking for a deeper, more heartfelt message may find the film a bit dry. Additionally, this harmed numerous scenes with character interaction, especially with certain characters' states of finality (where the viewer knows what emotion should be felt, but the connection to the characters just isn't there to contribute to that emotion) in the closing images of the film. Knowing Snyder and his potential, though, the revelation of this fact was disappointing, albeit a bit expected; however, it's standard quality did not come as a complete sucker punch to me.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Imaginative, geeky, crude","It took me a little while to get used to this movie, since it's so different to any other film out there. It's great to have movies that separate themselves from the norm, and offer diversity to a saturated market of trash, clichés and stereotypes.First of all, I'll state what a lot of people already did, the special effects are BRILLIANT. Something that, apparently, caught too much the attention of many and they forgot that there's actually a plot, people who seem to think that this is all special effects and violence, like some sort of pacific rim for adults.Now, I like to see so many references to the geeky world here: anime, video games, cosplay, scifi, fantasy... All well mixed up in a potpourri that will make the nerds of the world go in ecstasies. C'mon, nazi zombies and samurai warriors with Gatling weapons? Yahoo! This is definitely a reference for all future anime/video games adaptations.I admit that the hot babes with big guns put me off a little at the beginning. I don't like 5 cm long eyelashes and that type of things, contrary to some who find lolita complex and Barb Wire style movies a blessing. Then, I understood (or want to believe), that's it's necessary for the drama to make sure the audience sees how society (men, mostly) treat women, and how the females can actually defend themselves if they need to, thank you very much. It's hard to say the reality of it, since the babes and violence might have been just a marketing strategy to catch a wider audience. Although the depth of the plot and how it unravels to the end makes me think otherwise.Ah, remember to watch the Extended Cut of the film (over 127 min), since the theatrical version was EXTREMELY edited (thanks censors for getting rid of logic, once again, to make more comfortable your reality of weak minded people). Apparently, if you watch the edited version, things don't make sense at all.I also like the crudeness of certain scenes of the movie. It's a blow of fresh air to have some entertainment for adults, with so many twilights out there and politically correct giant robots fighting monsters (wink to del toro).Alas, as some other reviewer commented, one has to wonder if certain people were watching the same movie when they say that it's shallow and simple.

Freedom (ART) requires Imagination of all possibilities.,"I agree with the first reviewer that gave this movie time to sink in. As I find the themes popping up in conversations in coffee shops and cocktail parties, the violence fades as the shear creative fantasy of considering all options in creating art in life. In creating beauty, artists have to have the freedom to consider all the options, IMHO. Both good and bad, and the conscious choice of beauty as the Dr. Suess book: I have brains in my head and shoes on my feet, which way I go depends on me.Most choices are situational as the dance in this movie, imagine the creativity once given the freedom to let freedom sing.

Not a sucker bet,"Zack Snyder's Sucker Punch is an original, charming, visually stunning movie that, while it may not win over every theatergoer, still packs a serious one-two punch.One reviewer described it as Kill Bill meets Inception. I don't know that I'd go that far, but it certainly has elements of both. It's a cerebral action film that operates on several different levels at once. The first level, the ""real"" world of the movie, is set in a primitive insane asylum where a dishonest orderly abuses and terrorizes the girls under his care. The newest addition to the madhouse is known simply as Baby Doll, played by Emily Browning (The Uninvited, A Series of Unfortunate Events). Baby Doll must find a way to escape the asylum before she really does lose her mind; and she needs to help the other girls escape, as well.The premise of the movie is simple enough, and rather mundane; but seen through Baby Doll's eyes, it takes place in a multi-level world. The next level up from ""reality"" is an old-fashioned cabaret, where Baby Doll and the other patients are all dancing girls and the crooked orderly becomes a pimp, renting or even selling them to the high rollers. While the girls gather everything needed to implement Baby Doll's plan to escape, the movie ascends to another, even more exciting level of fantasy, one alternately filled with samurai monsters, steampunk zombie armies, dragon castles, and robot soldiers.It's certainly one of the most interesting movies I've seen in years. But, there's also plenty to criticize about it. Though it's based on an original story by the director, it is rather derivative. And while the battle sequences that supposedly serve as metaphors for Baby Doll's struggles are captivating, they are far from perfect metaphors. The biggest misfire, though, I'd say is Scott Glenn as the Wise Man. He appears in each fantasy sequence to give Baby Doll and the girls directions. However, his ""wisdom"" is more than a little cliché, and doesn't always fit in the context of the scenes.Still, I'd call it a solid effort by Snyder, who is used to adapting other people's stories (Watchmen, 300). The acting and chemistry among the girls is a testament to their acting abilities (the group consists of actresses Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone, Vanessa Hudgens, and Jamie Chung, each of whom is due for a breakout role in film). Oscar Isaacs (Robin Hood, Body of Lies) is convincing as the ruthless orderly/cabaret owner, as is Carla Gugino (Watchmen) as Doctor/Madam Gorski. The film even features a special appearance by Mad Men's Jon Hamm as the High Roller whose arrival would spell the end for Baby Doll.In the end, much of the criticism of Zack Snyder's latest film, I feel, is unwarranted. This film may not break any box office records, but it's a great film for people who enjoy intrigue, action, and adventure. And really, the ""fanservice"" isn't all that prevalent, or even that gratuitous. Yes, Baby Doll and the other girls are often shown in either their cabaret outfits or kicking butt in short skirts, but it's all in the context of the story (yeah, I know it sounds cliché, but it's true). The action sequences are fantastic, the visuals are breathtaking, and the camera work is topnotch. The storyline may not challenge you to the degree that Inception did, but it does make you think.(Originally appeared at http://fourthdayuniverse.com/reports)",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Why Is It Being So Spanked?,"I had some fears in going see this movie after reading the reviews, but I'm glad I did anyway. Why everyone is trying to give it some deep inner meaning and stating it sucks because it has no meaning, is beyond me. It has a meaning, just a very simple and straightforward one. It's a plot in a madhouse, but movies in mental institutions exist by the dozens, so this one takes that premise and goes to another directions to give lots of fun to the viewer. It's a great ride. Movies like Inception or specially Brazil revolve around alternate universes created in our mind, and this one too, why is it being so bashed because of that, I don't understand. It's a journey of imagination, where all that a grown kid loves put together in awesome visuals: World War I and II, Robots, Samurais, Dragons, a Cabaret and hot girls. Movies aren't only supposed to be exactly the same has the real world, they are supposed to take you to new Worlds too, and this one does just that.

Sucker Punch or why we go to the cinema,"I just came back home after watching this fantastic movie and I saw the interview with the director Zack Snyder.

It's an action movie, so it's short on story but why would you come watching it for anything other than what it is? Overall I'd say that if you like anime, comic books, have ever played an RPG, or are a fan of chicks and guns it's worth your time. If you don't like such things this probably isn't for you.

Not too Bad,"For starter I think this movie really pushes the boundaries of a PG-13 rating, but that is a side note.I loved the action sequences in this movie. Some of the CG shots are really sweet, and the action sequences are good also. The actual plot line of the movie had a lot to offer, but it would have been nice to have that story developed a little more. Instead there is a concentration on the actions scenes, which are pretty cool.The style of the movie takes a little getting used to, but ultimately it adds to the story.Finally, this movie has what might be called unnecessary hotness. What I mean by this is none of the women ever where ""normal cloths."" They wear hot looking cloths even when peeling potatoes. This is very similar to all of the ""oh by the way, Megan Fox is hot"" shots in Transformers 2. This is not only wholly unrealistic behavior, it is also distracting for the average healthy male.Overall, it's not too bad of a movie, but not exactly what I was looking for.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
visually stunning and vapid,"I found this film completely unwatchable.

It's not enough to acknowledge that these tropes in movies (and video games) exist and make a movie that supposedly satirizes these tropes. ""Ironic"" sexism is still sexism. Humor does not excuse reprehensibly shallow representations of women in the media, and giving women guns and placing them in a traditionally macho male fighting role does not make them ""strong female characters"".I am highly disappointed that Snyder is directing Wonder Woman, as he will certainly bring his peculiar skill of living in complete and utter denial of his blatant sexism to the table in the latest DC installment.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good movie,"Off the bat I have to say I'm over thirty years older than what some pro critics have claimed is the demographic for this one.

Lest I'm in the closet and now in middle age about to unleash traits and feelings previously untapped. Which if the latter is true you would have to say well done Zack Snyder, for that's serious film making...Sucker Punch is loud, full of visual orgasms, musically adroit, exciting, clever and very sexy. Snyder has made no secret of his fetish leanings when making this piece, but it hardy constitutes a dark seedy mind at work. It can easily be argued that the film is very much pro women, the story itself - in amongst the explosive thunder of the fantastical action - is tender and beautiful, complete with emotional kickers. Perhaps it's in the eye of the beholder? But I see a strong female led action movie, with shifting fantasy realms, and cunningly it calls for deeper ponder come the finale.Love it or hate it, Snyder has pushed buttons with this exercise.

I thought it rocked,"I had this idea that I knew what I was getting myself into when I saw this movie for the first time in a trailer a while ago, during a video game expo. Zach Snyder has a great time making his films, which I enjoy as a viewer, and I assume the actresses and actors he hires are ready and willing to have a blast alongside everyone else involved. This movie was over the top with its action and mind blowing with its visuals, both actual and rendered, which is a core idea behind making a great action movie. I think Sucker Punch succeeded in making a must buy Blu Ray for me at least for the action and more. A group of girls in an orphanage/dance club who want to escape was something I gathered upon first seeing the trailer and quickly assumed the story would be a hard sell in ways. The story wasn't as grand as Zach Snyder's previous films but it had, in its heart, what I considered a fun romp in itself. I was surprised when I watched the film because it didn't lead me down a path I predicted and all the while it kept my attention and consideration without taking me out of the experience and I loved that. The script played out like a video game during the action bits and as an avid gamer I was excited to watch and listen. The action bits pieced together the story as ""Baby Doll"" dances in the club which I enjoyed because the action was awesome to behold. I found myself understanding the characters motives more than I got to understand the characters themselves which was unfortunate because the splendor the film portrays doesn't do the characters justice in my opinion. I did feel a sense of gratification after the film was over because it lead me down a fun path that I wasn't ready for and I really liked that about it. Its characters were fighters and they fought hard alongside Snyder's imagination to make what I think was a great, fun film. Fight on.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Sin City Meets The Matrix,"Sucker Punch plays out like a video game/music video, and although some of its tactics are questionable, it proves to be somewhat of a unique and wow-inspiring experience.Young girl (20? yeah right! Try more like 17) is committed to an insane asylum by her evil, pedophile stepfather after a rape attempt goes awry and she accidentally kills her little sister. The stepfather bribes one of the orderlies to put a rush order in for her unwarranted lobotomy, but during the week-long wait for the procedure, imagination propels her into an alternate reality consumed by action-fantasy. Accompanied by a handful of hotties, she does battle with colossal demonic samurai, ferocious orc-like Nazi stormtroopers, metropolis-destined WMD's, and even a fire-breathing dragon, all the while dressed in cleavage-boasting tops and schoolgirl miniskirts. It is a teenage boys dream come true.Not over-overwhelmingly original, the trip is fun, the effects are cool and stylish, and I really dug the backdrop tunes. But I like video game flicks and admittedly, I found myself contemplating which of my library I was going to slip into the PS3 once I got home. To that end, the film was a bit of an inspiration.I disagreed with the PG-13 rating. Responsible parents beware. The movie is packed with strong sexual under and overtones. Now before all you anti-censorship zealots get your panties crammed into wedgies, I agree that to take away from its extremely sexy seductiveness would leave it naked and rather impotent and I am merely suggesting it should have received the R-rating it deserved. Never mind that the matinée I hit held 50+ year old men as the majority in attendance (hmmm)... This is an exploitation flick flaunting young, scantily-clad, cuties wielding swords and kicking ass while trying to escape a whorehouse. I just don't think the little kiddies should be Sucker Puch-ed. My only real exception, as is true with any film dealing with similar subject matter, is the making light of pedophilia. This movie opens disturbingly with a dirty old man about to rape a young, preteen girl. Something of that nature has no business even being insinuated or associated with ensuing images clearly intended to titillate and peak the libido.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Couldn't get into it,"I stuck this one out until the end but I couldn't get into it and ended up hating every minute. I appreciate the thought and gesture going into the basic concept, involving girls in a hellish mental institute retreating into a reality-mirroring fantasy landscape where they can take out their anger on a series of artificial enemies, but seriously? The execution is never aimed above the level of your average 14-year-old boy.Zach Snyder made this after the comic-book double-act of 300 and WATCHMEN, two films which I liked a lot, but SUCKER PUNCH falls flat because it's inane. It's an endless series of CGI-augmented fight scenes in which a group of scantily-clad women fight off various CGI nasties. It's the sort of film that sets the cause of feminism back 20 years and ends up demeaning the cast at the same time.Critically, it's also exceptionally dull. I think Snyder is a gifted and sometimes visionary director, but he struggles to bring the material to life and it's never more than two dimensional. The endless action sequences look good and are filled with pretty effects but they're senseless and mean nothing. The acting, of course, is horrid, from the interchangeable girl group to the incredibly hammy Oscar Isaac.In all honesty, I think SUCKER PUNCH is a film best forgotten about. Even Corey Yuen's ultra-cheesy DEAD OR ALIVE is better than this...",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Montage mania!!!,I have seen the montage used to hold some pretty good movies together and provide balance to them.However you can't make a montage and hope to hold it together with a movie.I was scratching my head to say the movie was all over the place well that would be an understatement.The movie was more frustrating then strippers in spiked lingerie.And I don't recall seeing any boobies so no gratuitous nudity(hope that doesn't count as a spoiler).Beautiful imagery some very cool special effects sequences and what red blooded American male would say he doesn't enjoy a hot girl in a school girl outfit.The advertisers really earned their money on this one because it looks really cool.Of course it came out about a week ago and I don't see the commercials anymore hmmmmmmmmmmmm.Love you :)I'm dancing.................I'm dancing....I'm dancinnng........dance.,1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
For the fans of previous Zack Synder films.,"2007 he brought us ""300"" and in 2009 he brought us the comic book adaptation ""Watchmen"". Now we are blessed with ""Sucker Punch"".Im not going to explain the movie in this review, but I am going to point out the good and the bad points.PROS: I love the action sequences. Sure, they're a bit cliché, but who gives a flying f**k. I love the way Synder makes his movies. The story is deep and great. and the graphics? This is Blu-ray material, ladies and gentlemen.CONS: the PG-13 rating. It holds this movie back a lot. It could have been better if they had released it as an R rated movie. (this is the only reason keeping me from giving this movie a 9)If you enjoyed 300 And Watchmen, You'll love this, If not, go watch Battle: Los Angeles.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great visuals but sadly lacking in substance (IMO),"There is some really spectacular CGI in this film and the fighting sequences are all very well done. It's a shame the narrative couldn't live up to the visuals though. I finished watching this film with the feeling that I had just watched a bunch of music video's patched together with a very flimsy storyline. Admittedly, they were very spectacular music videos with some spectacular effects, but I didn't feel it made for a film. There was no way I could form any connection to any of the characters because there was no time. The action comes thick and fast and, although there's a lot of talking in between, little of it serves to explain what's happening or even why. Over all, great to look at, but with little substance I guess those that get their kicks from watching scantily clad young women with big guns will like it, but it really didn't do a great deal for me I'm afraid.My Score: 5.7/10IMDb Score: 6.1/10 (based on 99,643 votes at the time of going to press).MetaScore: 33/100: (Based on 29 critic reviews provided by Metacritic.com at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 23/100 (based on 196 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 47/100 (based on 83,935 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Film...just sucks.,"This movie fails...now, i'll be honest, i haven't seen any of Zack Snyder's work, like 300 and Watchmen, so i don't know what his directing is like, but this movie...was probably not his best....at all. Looking at this film, it just made me confused about the plot, because it didn't make sense on any level, and leaves a whole bunch of plot holes. I mean, there's this whole thing in the intro, where the mother dies, the stepfather gets angry because he wasn't included in the will, and kills one of the daughters, while the other is sent to a mental institute. And guess what? THEY NEVER BRING IT UP AGAIN!! I kid you not! they forget it! i mean, COME ON Snyder! if people loved your work with Watchmen and 300, then why are you failing on this?!....there are other things like that, that annoyed me.....but i'll give the movie credit, it wasn't boring. it had decent action, even though it was in the mind of a little girl who's practically in her underwear (Wha?!), the acting wasn't that impressive, especially from that chick from Dragon Ball Evolution (CHI CHI MY ASS!) and this film felt more like Sailor Moon to me.....I'm not kidding. This literally feels like i've been watching an episode of Sailor Moon, stretched into 2 hours. overall, it's just a basic popcorn flick, that's just low on story, and just disappoints. I wouldn't recommend this, but if you're up for seeing it, go for it. though i'd wait for a discount theater, or wait till it's out on TV or netflix/redbox or even on demand, it got one thing right, for me...it sucked.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Action movie disguised into a non existence concept.,"Movies and imagination always were side by side. So, a movie about a girl that tries to use the imagination to escape from reality isn't an original plot and at the same time is a dangerous one for the fact that movies are natural products of imagination. Sucker Punch follows the same premise of 2010's Inception, which isn't as good as it seems when trying to mix fantasy and reality. I'll not extend my points of view about Inception because I've already wrote about it, but the fantasy product that Sucker Punch offers is more successful than Inception because it's surreal as it could be, and the movie should have stayed like this entirely. But Snyder's attempts to make it not an ordinary action movie fails badly.Snyder did a lot of promotion and explained a lot of something that in the end is just a movie filled with spectacular action sequences, amazing visuals, young women representing different fetishes in the attempt to attract the male audience, and all this huge package still bore and make us thinking the reasons of its existence.I've read a lot of reviews about people saying that ""you need to understand it to enjoy it"", for me it's completely the opposite: if you try to understand anything, than you will not enjoy it. That's why the audience didn't get the movie, because there's nothing to get even with all the explanations Snyder gave about its concept because he tried to make it a cult movie and maybe a reference for the genre in this decade giving deep perspectives to an action movie that has nothing to offer. So the audience expects something really huge and then the movie gives nothing than a boo-hoo. I mean... it's an extremely loud thing when just a regular scream should be effective.Sucker Punch could have everything to be a perfect action movie, but his plot full of empty reasons just messed with its amazing action sequences, making it just a collection of music video scenes. And that's it and only.One of the other negative things about the movie is about its sexual incoherent intents. If the movie pretends to be about women empowerment why reduce them to fetish characters? If the movie is about women trying to release themselves of men's oppression why keep oppressing them with all its attempts to attract the male audience? The rough and raw beginning of the movie gives the audience interest to keep their attention but then the characters became just a product of the male culture. So, that's why I agree that somehow there's some misogynous thing about this movie.At first Sucker Punch may seems impressive and pleasant, but then you realize it is just the easiest way to make an action movie disguised into a concept that only exists in Zack Snyder's mind.As I said before the movie blows your mind with spectacular action sequences, amazing special effects and visual concepts... one of the best since Matrix, 300, among others, really! Technically it's perfect and fans of comic books and video games will be dazzled by it, but should be watched just for theses qualities.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Lot to love. Lot to hate.,"Sucker Punch is basically Zack Snyder's ""Inception"" - with an equally fascinating concept at the heart of his film - venturing into the mind of his central character - but a somewhat less masterful exploration of it than Nolan's aforementioned blockbuster.
The idea itself is intriguing & with further rewrites to streamline the narrative (& improve upon clunky dialogue), it could've been brilliant but unfortunately, what we're provided with is a mismatched, tonally incoherent, peculiar installment in Snyder's filmography...
Genuinely unsettling moments of tension with outstanding performances from Jena Malone, Oscar Isaac & Carla Gugino, inventive editing & composition of sequences, as well as effective uses of colour palettes in scenes with great cinematography - there's undeniably a lot to admire & appreciate; but the unpredictability in Snyder's direction is both a blessing & a curse, leaving things bordering on being blatantly inconsistent...",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
DIRECTOR'S CUT. One of the best action-feminist movie of the decade!,"Great fight sequences, score and CGI , overall good performances and a fresh and visonary idea from writer/director Zack Snyder.I loved the movie when i first saw it on the big screen, then i found the Director's Cut (slightly longer with more fight scenes, a musical moment and a BIG yet intimate scene at the end) and what i previously considered as a great action movie became something deeper and more coherent.This movie embodies the poetry of living your life as a battle ground while keeping the goal of being (alonside with Fury Road) one of the best action-feminist movies of the decade.Director's Cut is highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Zack Snyder proves all of his ability to build visually flawless scenes while corroborating his difficulties in telling a story with interesting characters,"Sucker Punch 'debuts as the first film based on an original concept by director Zack Snyder. The director even declared in interviews that the film is a kind of 'Alice in Wonderland with machine guns'. The talented director, responsible for the most interesting recent cinematic experiences of cinema such as Madrugada dos Mortos (2004), 300 (2006), Watchmen, O Filme (2009) and The Legend of Guardians (2010) bring us a different concept bringing a ""portrait"" stylized movement on the action and type of landscapes of the imagination and things of that nature "", in the director's own words.Babydoll (Emily Browning) was admitted to a sanatorium by the unscrupulous stepfather, who ordered surgery to destroy her brain. But the young woman discovers that her refuge may be inside her mind and only then will she be able to be free forever. Now, living in this parallel world, she will face supernatural dragons, samurai, robots and Nazis, who will make her live a dangerous and fantastic adventure in the company of fellow inmates Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), Rocket (Jena Malone), Amber (Jamie Chung) and Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish). Was this your only chance for liberation?The script written by Snyder himself along with Steve Shibuya is somewhat daring. Snyder could easily deliver a thought-provoking drama about the limits of sanity, madness, trauma, reality and fantasy, but he preferred to mix it all up with pure fantasy that becomes an allegory to all the protagonist's conflicts and dramas. These fantasies represent the sacrifices made by the girls in the sanatorium in search of the objects that will give Babydoll and her colleagues freedom: a map, fire, a knife, a key, and an undisclosed fifth element that would require a profound sacrifice, but would bring a perfect victory.
The film takes place on three different levels: the asylum where Babydoll is trapped, an imaginary version of this world where she is trapped in a brothel entertaining guests with dance numbers while her friends are prostituted and a third world of imagination, where the girl goes during their performances, in which the patients face their enemies wearing fetish clothes from the nerdy imaginary. In fact, the most interesting thing here is that although the sexualization of the female characters and the action scenes seem free at first glance, there are in the film a series of details and visual metaphors in the three levels of Babydoll's imagination that form a complete story. Some objects may appear in another way, some people may appear in another function, some situations may be metaphorized, but the three levels of consciousness tell the same story and complement each other in this idea. While Babydoll fights monsters to retrieve an essential escape item on the third level, she distracts the men around her with her dance so that her friends steal that object at the brothel level. The film never shows exactly how these men are distracted in the asylum, but it is suggested.However, it is important to mention that the big problem is the connection we have with these characters because we do not perceive an emotional relationship between the characters, a dramatic arc for any of them or even a basis to justify the fantasies created by the protagonist. Without any explanation, she begins to imagine that she is in a kind of house where she still ""dreams"" of worlds as diverse as a war trench and a moving train about to explode a city. Where these illusions come from and what they represent remains a real mystery to the viewer. The script could work the fantasies as representations with some meaning, symbolizing the protagonist's psychological state, with her fears and fears. However, there is no sign of this. Was it just a random allegory that sought to represent the objects for the protagonist's freedom? Apparently, the intention seems to be just to create action scenes and spectacular random scenarios made in computer graphics that vaguely refer to objects, but that do not represent any attachment to the real world.As if that were not enough, Snyder is unable to maintain coherence even in the crazy worlds he creates, since some heroines disappear without justification during missions and villains do not stop appearing when this seems appropriate to the script. But Snyder's lack of skill in narrative matters becomes glaring as he closes the film, completely changing the focus of the story, giving importance to a character who was, during the entire projection, nothing more than a supporting role in a desperate attempt by a brilliant plot twist, but in the end, it just becomes frustrating.Unlike '300' in which warriors looked with their defined abs, here the protagonists are young and beautiful girls - with provocative names like Rocket, Sweet Pea and Bebydoll - exhibiting their physical attributes in minimal outfits, boasting, breaking, machine guns and swords while eliminating robots, Nazis and gigantic samurai. And Sucker Punch is exactly that: a youthful adventure that looks more like a huge video game, even with its well-defined phases. The various female protagonists seem wasted. Provenly talented actresses like Abbie Cornish and Jena Malone can do nothing but become representations of a youthful imaginary and, although they are all beautiful (the protagonist Emily Browning looks so beautiful in porcelain), this is not enough for the construction of interesting characters, by whom the audience will identify. Even an experienced actress like Carla Gugino seems lost, creating a questionable accent. In the case of the young protagonists, they all lack charisma and do not leave the viewer distressed with the destiny of each one thanks to the invulnerability in the fantastic world, since practically no creature offers real danger to them.Even if it fails in its dramatic and narrative execution, it should be noted that the integration of the three worlds proved to be a poorly executed idea. However, in terms of aesthetics and visuals, 'Sucker Punch' is a very inspiring achievement. With an inspired photograph of Larry Fong, allied with the production designer Rick Carter, they are breathtaking scenery. All the fantastic scenarios are worth the investment of more than 80 million dollars in this production, like the temple in feudal Japan where Babydoll meets the Wise Man and then has to face three giant samurai, the bunker in World War I (map), the invasion of the orc-infested castle to recover two fire-producing crystals from inside a baby dragon (lighter), the train to fight robotic guards and defuse a bomb (knife). The art direction of Patrick Banister and Todd Cherniawsky also accompanies the impeccable technical quality of the film composing the cabaret and sanatorium scenery with every aspect of the 60s mixed with the aged dirt of the detonated plaster of the wall stained with rusty mirrors. The costume is marked by the beautiful and provocative fetish characterization of each character. The original track is composed of mixes and reinterpretations of some songs, including 'Where's My Mind', 'Army of Me', 'Love Is The Drug', 'Sweet Dreams' and 'Asleep', with these last two being sung by the protagonist Emily Browning.Zack Snyder's shooting mode provides us with impressive visual compositions. The filmmaker again demonstrates undeniable talent in building beautiful shots, with incredible camera angles and movements. Still, Snyder has a clear tendency to excess when he shows the protagonist countless times dodging a blade in slow motion or when he films the girls falling to the ground in stylish poses.'Sucker Punch' is definitely one of those 'love it or hate it' movies. It was not meant to be understood literally and it is never explained to the viewer, exactly why the internet is full of theories about what it really proposes to tell. Was it the story of a girl who escapes reality to deal with her traumas? Or a feminist metaphor? Which characters exist and which are only part of the fantasy? The certainty is that the film takes itself too seriously and harms itself, especially in the final act. Snyder, while far from being a visionary genius as many try to sell, is really capable of providing something outside of normal standards, even if only in terms of technique and style. In 'Sucker Punch', the director just proves all of his ability to build visually flawless scenes while corroborating his difficulties in telling a story with interesting characters. Still, the film is a unique visual experience that is worth watching. The work makes you question at all times about the worlds of dream and reality.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What's the difference between this and Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,"Meaningless fights.the whole time I was watching this movie, all I can think of is Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.Even in the Scott Pilgrim movie, the characters get hurt, and there are times when you don't know how the fights would go.In this movie, the scantily clad girls with hot legs fight. After the first fighting scene, you just know things will be like that for the rest of the movie.The hot girls fight, they shoot, cut, hit. It's ridiculous. Not even funny after a couple of fights.Yeah,yeah I get it. It gives us the profound message that we are sometimes not the center of the story. We should sacrifice ourselves when the time comes for other people.well, if the director really wanted to get that message across, he should have focused on it! I don't know if I was watching a profound movie with deeper meaning, or if I was watching a comic book, or if I was watching a porn. I didn't know what to focus.The characters are not developed at all. The different layers of story don't match.Let me give you a piece of advice.If you want to enjoy this movie, focus on one thing, whether it would be girls with hot legs and boobs, be CG, be fighting scene, or be the message that they claim the movie has.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Liberty motive,"Sucker Punch is totally different movie than any others in this type. Of course it is made of sole of pop culture - violence, love, blood and pretty-stupid girls even called ""doll"". But there is some structure that people love about. There is a circle route that main character needs to take. As Campell said - the hero needs to start a journey of his/her life.

So in summary CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP. Luckily only 40 odd minutes of my life wasted (and trust me my life ain't all that!),unlike the poor cast of this movie who have wasted their talents by signing up for this.

Very Powerful And Mesmerising  But It Needs More,"I think its a highly impressive movie with a lot of energy and emotion, In fact it strikes people a lot because some of these things can happen in real life. However I believe strongly of the fact that the stories of how the other characters ( the 4 friends of the main character and the dancing teacher) got into the mental place, also how the owner of the place got it for starters, it certainly needs more story and work behind it. I also think it could have been just a bit more realistic. Its a shame how a simple but powerful movie could have had more in it. As a summery of all, it had the best storyline for a suspenseful/sadistic/thriller movie but it was like a draft as if we could have heard the history behind the place. I also think its a big shame how the movies a dream of a dream because it kills the feeling in it.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Sucker Krunch,"Yep. Sucker Punch sure was an annoyingly frustrating movie to watch, on all counts. And, with that said, I really don't know where to begin tearing into it and trashing it as it so rightfully deserves.For starters - I'd say that even though this film's subject matter was clearly geared to adults, it lost itself some significant points for wimping out by giving us a movie that was specifically aimed at those in the 14-year-old age-range.So, that, in effect, completely destroyed the overall impact that this film's story could have had on a more mature-minded audience, which certainly included myself.Sucker Punch was a perfect example of the sort of lame movie-making that directors, such as Zack Snyder, are frequently churning out these days.Anyway - A film of this one's empty-headed and frivolous nature only served to disappoint and anger me to the nth degree. And, that, in turn, has prompted me here to write only negative comments about Sucker Punch in hopes that others, as well, will view this ultimate ""white-trash"" trash in a very similar light.Enough said.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Waited 10 years....,"""Sucker Punch"" is a movie I saw one week ago as it was recommended on one of the YouTube video channels. So I did. And I was not disappointed at all. Knowing now more about writer-director Zack Snyder, my only surprise is the low rating now (6/10) whereas most of his movies score a solid 7+. I can imagine that for a movie that is now 10 years old ""Sucker Punch"" has set a new bar for graphic storytelling. And his attempts to transplant the purity of imagination onto the cinema screen is very successful. Now and then. The movie opens when Baby Doll (Emily Browning) is institutionalized by a wicked stepfather after her mother's death and her introduction to the asylum where other damaged young women are sent to be kept away from society. She meets the people-in-charge, Blue (Oscar Isaac) and Dr. Gorski (Carla Gugino) as well as the other girls in the institute: Rocket (Jena Malone) and her sister Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish), Amber (Jamie Chung) and Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens). I have to admit that I can already see outstanding acting from Oscar Isaac. The others are kind of ""forgettable"". If anything, ""Sucker Punch"" truly defines the generation of filmmaking we exist in. His use of CGI is masterful although I am not a big fan of CGI. Prefer the Nolan style, less CGI when possible. I strongly recommend to watch this movie, even after 10 years is feels like a masterpiece.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

And our girl named baby doll(Who thought about those names?) as soon as she gets there decides to break out. Yeah - sounds cool right? So the plot is alright I guess, could of been better but the plot isn't the most important here. Acting is pretty bad. In entire movie there is only two characters that I liked.

The action scenes are awesome. You watched 300 right well it's almost as good. Almost all the action scense were happening in baby doll's head so they could do cool things.

Like most of you, I'm assuming, I loved ""300″, liked ""Watchmen"", and thought his 2004 rendition of ""Dawn of the Dead"" was OK. Not the most consistent director, but you can at least expect his movies to be entertaining. Did ""Sucker Punch"" hold up? Well kind of, as long as you have zero expectations regarding a comprehensible plot. ""Sucker Punch"" is visually spectacular, just as you'd expect with most of Snyder's work. The visuals are definitely the movie's strongest suit, with incredible and unique combat sequences, ranging from killing zombie Helghast-look-alikes (from the Killzone games) in a WWII setting, to fighting gigantic living samurai statues. Now if you haven't heard much about the movie, you must be asking yourself: ""How in the world can zombies from WWII be in the same movie as gigantic samurai statues?""

"Ultimate geek fantasy, but with some flaws","I felt a like I sorta got sucker punched after watching this movie in theater. The trailer really hyped me up for this movie, it just had the elements I would really enjoy watching on the big screen. And to some degree it does, but the film has a lot of flaws. The video game/graphic novel style visuals and a bit of eye candy are the elements that is the main attraction for this flick. It seemed like Zack Snyder just thought up a bunch of cool sci-fi/fantasy ideas and tried to cram it in one movie, but without it being engaging or having a good connection. What I mean by good connection, is that reality and sci-fi/fantasy worlds does not connect together in a manner that makes sense. It almost makes no sense at all at times and just throws the audience off. The cast of girls in this is alright, but they are mainly there as eye candy but I ain't complaining. The CGI action sequences are well done and is very entertaining to watch. But when the characters enter back to reality everything gets dull, no matter how much emotion they try to pour out on screen. The plot just wasn't engaging or made me care for the characters all that much since there is hardly any development. And like I said some areas in the plot didn't make any sense because the connection between reality and sci-fi fantasy worlds is very thin. What it comes down to is hot girls kicking ass in geek fantasy worlds in a slick and stylish manner with some cool special effects. That is why I am giving this flick a 6.6, although it might be slightly unfair because the film overall isn't very well crafted. But the cool elements somewhat outweighs the negative in this, sort of.6.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""Sucker Punch"" Is ""Inception"" Without Representation","""Sucker Punch"" comes as a disappointment to me because the previews for the film looked really good. I love action movies, and a film where the heroine warriors are adolescent angst- ridden girls has to be unique. Unfortunately, ""Sucker Punch"" feels more like a video game or a music video: there are great special effects and action sequences, but they accompany a half-baked story line, underdeveloped characters, and a series of highly-stylized fantasy episodes that come out of nowhere and tie together poorly.It's as if Zach Snyder made this film as an excuse to show such action sequences, because those sections of the film where girls are kicking ass are very well polished and are great eye candy. What we the audience really need to know is ""Why?"".The movie starts off with a pretty blonde girl whose real name we never find out (Emily Browning). Through a montage, we learn that the girl's mother has died, leaving her with her sister and an abusive stepfather. When that stepfather attempts to abuse the younger sister, the blonde girl pulls a gun out on him, but accidentally shoots her sister instead.In a plot devise seemingly ripped right out of ""Chicago"" (2002), the girl is sent to a mental institution with other girls her age, where she becomes psychoanalyzed by Dr. Vera Gorski (Carla Gugino), the seemingly only well-meaning person to work in the facility. Dr. Gorski tells her students/patients to set their mind free by using their imaginations, and these girls seem to have more vivid imaginations than the good doctor gives them credit for.In a confusing segway, the blonde girl goes from being in a mental institution to being a stripper in a seedy club. Her name becomes Baby Doll, her fellow patients are also erotic dancers, Dr. Gorski is a dance instructor, and the other institution workers are owners of the club, or pimps. Again, does this remind you of ""Chicago""?Although this strip club is much nicer than the grim loony bin, Baby Doll still seeks escape. Once again, she imagines herself and four other acquaintances yielding swords and guns, and attacking faceless soldiers who stand in the way of obtaining five objects that will help her and the others escape. According to their imagined Obi-Wan-like mentor simply known as Wise-Man (Scott Glenn), the five objects they need are a map, a thing that makes fire, a knife, a key, and the last thing Baby Doll has to figure out for herself.The plot synopsis is a headache to write about, and you can imagine what it's like to watch it. The truth is, the imagination synopses would have worked so much better if Dr. Gorski had actually TAUGHT these girls how to imagine, rather than just saying things like ""Open your heart and let your imagination take you."" That quote is not verbatim, by the way, but it's pretty close.Plus, these girl characters are so underdeveloped that you don't get a sense of how they came up with these fantasies of kicking ass and taking names. It's not unusual for boys to fantasize this way. And yes, you're given a brief back story for Baby Doll, but it isn't enough because she literally doesn't talk for the first 20 minutes of the film. You don't know why she wants to escape, or what she's going to do once she does. Plus, once she kills her sister, which is something devastating and life changing in and of itself, it's never mentioned again in this movie.Her fellow BFFs with ironic nicknames are not developed at all. Amber (Jamie Chung) and Blondie (Vanessa Hudgins) are no more than just pretty faces. Sisters Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish) and Rocket (Jena Malone) have a back story, but it's not much of one. You learn that they ran away from home, but never why, how they ended up in an institution, or their ambitions besides leaving the place they're in right now.Plus, Wiseman just pops up in their dreams, and seems to have no basis whatsoever. Why didn't Dr. Gorski guide these girls in these imaginings? Doing so would have given her far more clout as a mentor.So ""Sucker Punch"" is a big miss. Although the action sequences are well made and enticing at times, it's almost as if Zach Snyder made these short films, and someone else tried to tie them together with a really undercooked story line. The ending is just confusing, and feels incredibly weak. A ""Chicago""-like song and dance number during the end credits feels just as random and out of place.In addition to ""Chicago"", I was also reminded of ""Inception"" (2010) while watching this movie. While ""Inception"" had its confusing moments, it had a coherent story line, and at least you knew why people in that movie had the dreams they were having. It was also a lot deeper a story. ""Sucker Punch"" is just a music video in disguise as a feature film. The more people who make these kinds of movies, the longer MTV is going to go without showing music videos. Why bother, right?",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Unusual film: Love it or hate it, but must watch it.","This film has very good points: the music, the stenography, the multiple realities approach, Scott glen and Jena Malone. It has very bad points, too, like the main character, Emily browning, anything but an action films actress, who performs horrible in combat choreography. Combat scenes have plenty of special effects, but awful choreography. Do not expect something like Milla Jovovich combat performance. The plot is much more complex than you could expect at first, so if you are looking for some empty, girls with guns, combat movie you will be very disappointed (for instance, if you go to watch the movie because of you like the movie promos and posters). I think the best of this movie is the mix of reality with bizarre action scenes, pretty photography, very adequate music, and some touches of pulp fiction, kill bill and other Tarantino productions. Should you go to watch this movie? I think the answer is YES. Even if you do not like it as a hole you will enjoy, as I have said, good music, nice photography and an unusual production.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Dated, lazy filmmaking with spectacular CGI","I loved 300 and all that heroic SIN CITY-type graphic madness, live action on the fringes of animation. Also I love a lethal female lead hell bent on dealing out justice. So I had high hopes. Man, was I disappointed? This is incredibly lazy filmmaking. There are NO characters - just pretty or ugly puppets - cliched puppets at that. There is NO story - seriously, none. There's a set up but it doesn't go anywhere. This is just a repetitive series of vaguely related vignettes. And so many cliches. Worst of all, is the waste of talent and budget - it LOOKS GREAT, fantastic CGI (hence my generous 3/10 rating) and the performances are fine considering there's nothing here for an actor to work with. Probably would've loved it in 1975 as a 14 year old sack of hetero-hormones. But - when was it made? There's really no excuse. Frustratingly awful.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Seriously off-kilter, but tasty","The story to this film is easy enough: a young girl with more baggage than she is supposed to have at her age is committed to a mental asylum. Instead of being helped to deal with her baggage she's being tormented even further - which makes her search for other ways of escape.The implementation of this story is a short introduction which gives more than enough insight into the backing of the characters and the location - and then an overly large dose of eye candy that alternates between reality and fantasy. This alternation works well - it gives a nicely balanced rhythm of high and low pace scenes and all of them are worked out artfully right.The film does feel a tiny bit fractured though and the ending isn't entirely pleasing or even fitting. This isn't due to the acting - which is good enough in general, but is purely due to the chosen story line. It doesn't make the film bad - it's eye candy and nothing but eye candy after all, but it could have been better.So, all in all, maximum visuals, more than OK sound track, highly entertaining and sometimes even art-house but forgotten the moment the cinema is left behind.7 out of 10 unreal realities.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Your the Sucker if paid to see this movie,"So this movie got destroyed on Rotten Tomatoes. It currently enjoys a 22% rating. Is it really that bad? Yes and no. Visually the movie is amazing. Zack Synder did an amazing job bringing this movie to life and it's a worth a watch just for the visuals.Where this movie falls apart is with a confusing and overly complicated plot. It's just really difficult to follow what the heck is going on in this movie. This is not a casual watch. It demands your attention and if you drift off you will surely be lost quickly.In a nut shell, the plot revolves around Baby Doll (Emily Browning) who is placed in a mental ward after she tried to kill her abusive step-father. While she is in the mental ward she plots her escape with some of her fellow inmates. The one weapon that she has is that when she dances, she places her captors in a hypnotic state. Once that happens, she enters a dream state where she is a powerful warrior. With the help of her friends (inmates) who also enter the dream world she has to complete various tasks to help her escape. If she completes the task in the dream world then she completes the task in real life. Confused? That's because it's confusing as hell.What could have been an interesting film gets dragged down by a crazy plot that's difficult to follow, and not really worth the effort if you do manage to figure it out.

"Hot for Gamers, Cliché for Everyone Else","The narrow audience of gamers will like it. Everyone else might find a way to not hate it if you just appreciate the battle scenes without the backdrop of a cohesive plot.There are several battle scenes throughout the movie that were spectacular. If you look at each battle scene as an individual piece of art without a story line to string them all together, then you might like this movie. Those scenes are beautiful and impressive but you can still tell its someone else's interpretation of battle scenes played out in other movies. One scene was straight out of Lord of the Rings with fiery pit, crumbling castle and Orcs.Nonetheless, they were interesting to watch. When each one was over, however, you were forced back into the overly simple, drab plot that is closer to a bed time story for teen age boys than an action film for the rest of the world.The movie is peppered with clichés like, ""If you don't stand for something, you stand for nothing."" Maybe they changed a word or two to try to make them appear as original words of wisdom but you don't have to be quick to catch them.The plot itself is cliché. In order to escape from the clutches of evil, a girl and her team of sassy warrior-strippers must collect five items. I think I can pull out four of them right now from the junk drawer in my kitchen without having to seduce or outwit anyone.

good enough could have been better,the negative review s for this film are not entirely wrong.there wasn't enough dialog in the film .the main character in the film doesn't say a word for a good twenty minutes into it. the story is very hard to understand.it's very conceptual and it's quite unrealistic.that might not sit well with many.for me it was a good movie we all know the graphics were amazing. Zach Snyder has done it again.the action sequences were great to watch.but I think the whole movie relied on his graphics too much.300 was great not only because of the graphics but because it had a great story and an amazing script.in these aspects I feel sucker punch fell short.i know it's the type of movie in which too much dialog would have ruined it as well and made it feel disrespectful.but there should have been more dialog that would have expressed the story to the viewers in a better way and they would have connected more to the movie.without the dialog it all unfolded before us and it left me with this weird left-out feeling.all in all I must say it was good movie.great graphics amazing soundtrack but with a little bit more script and a slightly less complicated story it could have been amazing.so I can say great potential but a it relied too much on Snyder and the Soundtrack.what made it worse was that the movie had two genres acting at once.on one hand it was really dramatic/depressing on the other hand it was this action movie.they should have just gone with one genre.this just confused every thing in the movie,7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The lobotomy of the viewer,"I went to see it on a large IMAX screen, in the mid-night show, to get the full flavour of special effects. I did not expect a thick plot, nor a very creative story, probably a linear action story.By the time the movie ended, more than half of the initial crowd decided to do something better with their lives. It was weird to see that Snyder did not manage to hold together the linear story, and it felt that some distinct parts of the movie were quite good, but the link was so abrupt that you remain with nothing.The start of the movie sets expectations that are completely lost halfway through, and towards the end it feels that your IQ gets depressed by the lack of plot thickness.All in all, is not completely garbage, but it will go down in history as just another CGI movie.Go get your lobotomy.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""If you don't stand for something, you'll fall for anything""","Fortunately for me, I watched this film with absolutely zero expectations.I missed all the original hype, and it was purely by 'chance' that a piece of music that I'd heard on youtube led me to Sucker Punch.I fell in love with this film from the very beginning. I let myself be carried along on a wonderful visual and musical journey, a fantasy within a fantasy laced with layers of meaning that need not be analysed ... simply absorbed.Sucker Punch is a work of Art that will surely become a cult classic once the haters have finished tearing it apart and gone away to find other films that give them what they want without 'sucker punching' their linear minds.It's an unfortunate human trait that people feel the need to deride and destroy that which they don't understand. They can't simply say ""I don't get it"", or ""it isn't for me"". Somehow they feel threatened ... they feel that they should 'get it', and if they don't 'get it' it must be inherently bad.And it's not as if there's much to 'get'. The film won't reveal 'the meaning of life' to you, although it might just reinforce the 'meaning' of your life. I guess that some people are looking so hard for deeper meaning that they miss the simple and obvious.If you've never seen Sucker Punch, please give it a try, and as you watch it, simply let it play out before you without trying to analyse.

But I hoped and expected it to be this good and cool and it delivered! The way this movie was directed and the soundtrack is simply wow! It's really cool that most of the songs are a little remixed and sung by the actors themselves, Sweet Dreams sung by Emily Browning in the intro is so dark, creepy and nice! The music plays an important role in the movie because it triggers the fantasy, action scenes so it really had to be picked carefully and it fits great. I really like the visuals in the movie, the locations, the way the characters look and move and sound... The whole movie feels as if it's happening on a theatre stage... If you'vee watched 300/Watchmen, you'll notice the same shade of grey/brown and blue/green throughout the whole movie. The story is pretty good and there are some real shockers in the plot, but I'm not gonna reveal anything! All I'm going to say is if you're expecting this to have the typical action movie ending, wrong! The acting was OK, I liked Carla Gugino very much! Also the characters of Sweet Pea and Rocket seem to be the most developed...Now for the action and the effects and visuals... DROOL! The special effects are flawless in my opinion, the action scene with the 3 big samurai is seriously the best action scene I've ever seen! I really like the little touches to their costumes and weapons like the cute little anime bracelets on Baby Doll's gun! The girls did a great job with the stunts! They didn't overdo with the actions scenes, they're incorporated really well into the movie. But once they start... wow! They pretty much covered everything!:DSince I'm an anime fan, this movie is pure sex for me! The only thing I would've liked is another culminating action scene and villain, the second part of the film was a little less epic... But still, nice work not ending it like everyone expects it to end! It gave it a deeper meaning... Maybe it was even better that way... The movie is probably more a 7 or 8 (mostly for non-anime fans etc.), but I'm giving it 9/10 because of the directing/music used and the character of Baby Doll! Really I think this is the best anime movie ''adaptation'' (if such has even existed before).To summarize, GO WATCH THIS!:D You'll have so much fun!

Decent action but not much more.,"I enjoyed this movie for what it was. I didn't expect an Oscar-winning story so I wasn't let down on that point. But when the title is ""Sucker Punch"" you really cant expect much more than an action film whose main audience is guys between 15-25.As I am a huge fan of the visual style in 300 I thought that this would satisfy me as well. The scenes where they are in this fantasy world are nice too look at and all I still feel like it should have been more than the few times that they occurred. I also feel that the first of these scenes set the bar to high and the rest of the movie couldn't reach that level. But that is probably because I'm a huge fan of those kinds of movies.So for the plot, and I am trying to give away as little as possible. There are five girls trying to escape from a facility. I can't say much about the girls as they are all stereotypical and not original at all;1. The older one who needs to be the center of attention.2. The younger sister of that girl who wants to make her own decision.3. The new girl who is taking the attention away from the previous center of attention.4. The two girls that does what they are told and isn't a major part of the story.Also you don't feel any connection to the characters. This is something I don't like in movies because when something happens to the character you don't care. The girls mission is to collect five objects that they will need to escape from the facility. It is when the girls are trying to collect these items that you see the action scenes. Sounds weird? Well thats because it is. As they are getting the items in real life we see it all happen in the main-character Ambers imagination. What you see in the fantasy represents things that actually happens, and because you know that it all her fantasy you can enjoy the action scenes for what they are and not think about how unreal they are. The villain of this story is Blue Jones played by Oscar Isaac and he does an amazing job. He is smart (but not too smart), cold-hearted, manipulative and creepy. He is definitely doing the best performance in this movie and I would say that he is one of the best villains I've seen in recent films. For the rest of the cast I really can't say that much. It's not great but it's not bad either.I know a lot of people will try to find some meaning in this movie, other than the fact that your fantasy can be a tool for coping great sorrow. But the story didn't touch me enough to make me think about it as the movie went on and trying to analyze the deeper meaning of Sucker Punch in after hand is probably a waste of time.If you have nothing better to do an evening and you just want to watch something fun I would definitely recommend this movie. But not more than that as it's not a movie you'll want to watch twice.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Inception Punch with Steampunk Zombies,"In Sucker Punch, you get the impression that Zak Snyder wanted to make a kick-ass movie with hot chicks in schoolgirl uniforms fighting steampunk zombies. And at that level, it really works - the fight sequences are nothing short of awesome. Crank up the surround sound for those.But where the film gets annoying is the half-arsed way that he justifies the action - it really makes no sense; and if you can't get past that illogic and just embrace the aaaawesomeness of the action, this film will not work for you.The story: 'Baby Doll' (played by Aussie actress Emily Browning, who you might remember from 'Lemony Snickets'), in a stylised, graphic novel inspired sequence at the start, is institutionalised by her depraved stepfather, who covets the estate of her recently deceased mother. In a further lurch into depravity, he bribes a turnkey at the the 'Institute for the Totally, Like, Insane' to schedule Baby Doll for a lobotomy - in Five Days Time.Here's where it gets all 'Inception'; for some reason, Baby Doll flips into an alternate vision of the institution as a faux-Twenties speakeasy/flophouse (that still boasts a photocopy machine); and when she is asked to dance, she morphs AGAIN into the really cool Matrix world where she and her vixenish compatriots do incredible deeds, mentored by a mysterious father figure played by Scott Glenn.A flimsy premise is then constructed that gives the rest of the film some structure, in the same way that classic porn movies feature a visitation from a pizza guy to drive the story; Baby Doll and the Hot Kickass Vixens must gather unto themselves four items to help them escape before the date of Baby Doll's lobotomy. In the flophouse world - one level down - this is represented as the visit of the High Roller (played by Jon Hamm, reveling in antagonist rolls between 'Mad Men' seasons), who will deflower Baby Doll.Zack Snyder's previous notable efforts (300, Watchmen) had solid scripts behind them, garnered from equally high-quality graphic novels; this movie shows us that he's not much of a writer, at least relating to plot and structure. But what he does well, he does really well, and it is the cool visuals and spot-on classic pop remixes backing the action, that punches this movie up beyond complete mediocrity.Thankfully, his next movie, 'Man of Steel', has been penned by the same guys behind the critically and commercially successful 'Batman' reboot; Chris Nolan (whoah, Inception again) and David S. Goyer. Let's see if he can redeem himself there; I'm hopeful.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Don't be fooled by dazzling imagery.,"When I heard that this was a Zack Snyder movie I had to pause for a moment. It could be a hit or miss with him. You can't win them all. While I enjoyed 300 (2006) and loved Watchmen (2009), I thought the Dawn of the Dead (2004), remake was awful, so I was nervous as to where I would land on this one. A ridiculous story, that could have been fantastic, unfolds in the guise of a young woman named Baby Doll, who is stuck in an orphanage by her horrible step-father, manages to escape her imprisonment by somehow thinking her way into an alternate-universe of apocalyptical proportions, while at the same time doing an exotic dance for the deadbeat orphanage owner's clients. In this ravaged, devastated, alternate-reality she and her buddies battle horrible soldiers in video-game fantasy recreations of famous wars from history, or at least, that's what I figured out.While I really enjoyed the soundtrack, watching the CGI, taking in the eye-candy and the impressive imagery, the story had a major flaw in it. No matter what kind of a movie you are making, do not insult the audience by force-feeding them a story, with no real explanation as to what is going on and hope they don't notice, because they are being dazzled by great imagery. it is like a videogame that you can't participate in. That's not really fun. The story starts in the stepfather's house. Immediately after that, she goes into an asylum, then moves to the orphanage, closes her eyes and ends up fighting giant Majin-Samurais, sword for sword, punch for punch. I couldn't handle the implausible concept that the characters fighting, flying, jumping, shooting, etc. was genuine.The only likeable character in the film is the Wise Man (Scott Glenn). He is really the only one that explains to us what the girls need to do in order to escape the orphanage. Other than that, we don't know why any of this is happening to them. We don't know how it happened. Why are they there? Why are these things happening to them? It is totally forced into us. What also dragged the grade down further for this film were the hackneyed scenes, seen throughout the film. For example, the moment Baby Doll enters the orphanage a chick-fight breaks out. Also, a fat lumbering chef takes a bite out of a huge sandwich, while drooling and acting all fatty, etc. It is very cliché' and low on character development, although there is a connection felt between the relationship of the two sisters Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish) and Rocket (Jena Malone). If you want to be of the mindless and you want to enjoy some cool action=packed images than get out this film. It's not bad, but not great either. It could have been worse.7.2 (C MyGrade) = 7 IMDB",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The twist was obvious at the 15 minute mark.The structure was good, had Blake Snyder written all over it, but the hero and plot was not strong enough to carry me through the beats. Her cuteness dragged me through, not her growth as a character.3 actors carried the whole movie, 1 of which was not that important to the flow of the story, and none of which was the hero of the story, the others tried to get by on seductive faces, over the top make-up, and sexy lingerie.Had a hard time swallowing the character development, was not sure if the character had truly grown by the end of the movie.The fight scenes were fluffy with lights slow-motion and bullet-time, but never went beyond 2 movements before an attack. Very little Science to the choreographing.You can totally tell that they piggy-backed off of 5-6 video games and anime to gather their ideas for the action scenes. (Devil May Cry, Bayonetta, Dragon Age, Call of Duty, Final Fantasy, Sailor Moon).",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Looks amazing and still deserves 1/10,"For me, this was the worst high budget movie of the last 15years. Lets start by saying that the CGI looks really great, also costumes, makeup, scenery etc. The basic story even makes some sense, working on both 'levels' of the movie.Despite that, i just couldn't imagine making it any worse. Acting is awful, especially from lead actress. She moves like a plastic figure, her dance or martial arts both are awful and make the experience of watching her really dreadful.Overall it looks like someone directed all CGI before any story, then mixed it up with serious topic making very light of it, then added some pretty faces and hoped for the best.It would be better if they only used the CGI scenes and deleted the rest. It would even be smarter.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Don't remember when i gave a 9 in my review,"How often do you find a movie where the camera does the talking in the film's opening scene. You waltz with the visually stunning frames in and out of the story for full ten minutes before even realising that there were no dialogues!!! Sucker punch breaks the convention in many ways and at several levels. It demolishes the stereotype; challenges your tastes and offends your clichéd sensibilities. It is like a room full of colourful tapestries, each more beautiful than the other, so much so that their collective brilliance confounds the orthodox and humbles the willing. It is a simple story of a bunch of girls fighting their demons made brilliant by its unmatched style of presentation. So, it is not about what the film tells the audience, it is how it tells them. Director Zach Snyder's concept of a theatre inside an asylum is the key to the film which unlocks its secret in the very end. The story about girls finding their wits to escape the asylum also becomes the plank for them to break free from the reality into a surreal world where they become the protagonists and control their worlds. The ending is as dramatic and as devastating as life itself. It cannot be replayed. Like life, it is not fair. Like life it is not the least predictable. A must watch for those who are willing to widen their creative mindspace... Will give it a nine for making me think and think again.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""Where is my mind?""","It's been three weeks, and I still don't know what to think. There is a kernel of truth in this film, but it's buried deep beneath what seems like a lot of nonsense. The wisdom of the opening and closing narration and the enigmatic Wise Man's one-liners are misplaced, eclipsed by generic video game-style action sequences and the heroines'exploited beauty.Sucker Punch, like its female protagonists, struggles to do better and have a voice among the distracting, head-scratching elements that make up a majority of the movie. It's an action movie with a message- several messages- about escapism, sexuality, and turning weaknesses into strengths, but where they are to be found is different for everyone. The characters are flat, but they don't need to be their own people- they are like figures in a dream, in an allegory, and their virtues (courage, wholeness, loyalty) and their vices (lust, cowardice, betrayal) are universal.I would love to see Sucker Punch as a book, or a graphic novel. I would love to see what was left on the cutting-room floor for it to earn a (pointless) PG-13 rating. But at its best, it's a stunning synchronization of visual and audio, a true music video movie, with a little bizarre philosophy on top, like oil in water. It's destined to be watched late at night over and over again, dissected and discussed, until the viewer finds something deep and meaningful, or a load of garbage.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Don't get Sucker Punched,The story itself was not bad and the movie would have been better if they stuck with the real world or the fantasy world. Wasted a good lineup of bold characters and an interesting tale. This movie deserved a do over. I understand the desire to be innovative and fresh but they took it too far. Thrown into the action from the beginning I got the feeling that I was going to be in for a great ride. Things quickly took a turn and I never quite recovered. Previews are great and I as many others had great expectations based on that. If you end up watching this film you will understand what I am talking about. By dropping the surreal world they could have done more character development. I was not the only person disappointed as others walked out on this film. This movie is a 5 at best.@gowatchthis,5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Truly magnificent action-fantasy scenes that just barely stay grounded in a dark story,"I don't write a lot of reviews but I think this one is thorough and fair. It has no spoilers.To say that Snyder used the confusing plot as an excuse to hit us with some of the best eye candy on the market would be a lie. There is definitely a story being told. Theres even reasons behind some of the confusing elements. Yet at the end of the day, it's just a little too hard to follow. For me the characters come across as underdeveloped, even though they DO show a LOT of emotion on screen. I think the film would've benefitted from a bit more quality small talk to make us fall in love with each character, which the film had almost none of. It makes sense though that every line had to be plot oriented when the biggest issue with a film like this is connecting the fantasy to the ""real"" storyline. I will say that the main female cast is nothing short of excellent both in the action and in the acting departments, and you will easily connect to them even without the exposition I wanted. You could totally argue that it's more realistic with how the characters interact with real emotion and they just don't explain why they are how they are because by the time we see the film they already know each other. That argument would be perfectly fair. The film probably just needed to be a little longer, and there's a good chance that the 18 minutes of extended footage in the Blu-ray cut make a big impact on the completeness of the experience. The fantasy sequences REALLY deliver, while the real world scenes feel like they don't get enough storytelling done. Seriously tho, the action is so damn good. Some of the camera work you just won't be able to find anywhere else, the slow-mo is used both generously and effectively, and the girls are incredibly acrobatic and absolutely ooze dramatic flair. It's bad ass. The real world plot feels like it takes too long to confusingly explain a simple plan. It was strange to me how the dialogue was often on the flat side, yet the narration at the end was so deep. The music is consistently bad ass and effectively adds to the atmosphere.There were a couple moments where they failed to maintain ultra realism, like when a bad guy walks in on the gang plotting. Right after he leaves, 4-5 seconds later, they resume their full volume conversation. This vibe lingered throughout the movie too much and dropped it from 8 to 7 for me.Bottom line: if you have a taste for things dark and bad ass AND you think you're pretty good at reading between the lines, this is 100% a must-see movie. The story really is there, it just takes a lot of effort to fully grasp with what's shown on screen. If you're a Shakespearean-style critic who only cares for intricate dialogue and thurough plot development, skip it. If you're an action junkie and love seeing hot girls twirling through the air shooting guns and swinging swords at often truly formidable foes in well-shot slow-mo, it should be on your bucket list. If you enjoy quality action portrayed with emotional actors, this is worth picking up.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
yuk,"Sure - Zack Snyder is entitled to get aroused by the idea of young girls getting battered, murdered, raped, forced into prostitution and lobotomized. Sure - he's entitled to dress up his sick fantasies in push up bras, hot pants, fishnets, stilettos, and false eyelashes. And sure, it's a free country, so Snyder can delude himself into thinking that his flimsy derivative script is deep. (Did he pay Nolan a license fee for the dream within a dream within a dream gimmick?) But please please please, someone make him stop spouting all that BS about female empowerment! He wouldn't understand female power if it kicked him in the ass. SuckerPunch falls only a few steps short of kiddie porn. How very sad that watching fantasy girls get brutalized is what appeals to the ""young male demographic"" in the US, when so many flesh-and-blood women around the world are really and truly suffering all the crimes that seem to titillate Snyder and his ilk.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Vivid, Sexy, Genuine, New Generation Fantasy","I had high expectations for this film ever since I saw the first trailer. The film's target audience seemed pretty predictable, but with Zack Snyder I knew he'd deliver more. I'm in love with ""300"" and ""Watchmen"" so I you already know he plans on succeeding on many levels, and as usual he doesn't disappoint. The beauty of it all is that this is an original story, and so I'm looking forward to his future projects.Let me start by saying the story itself will start off kind of cryptic, but if you analyze it properly you'll keep up. The acting was so spot on with these characters, their beauty was only a plus. I had been worrying about Vanessa Hudgens' capabilities, but she did rather well I must admit. Jena Malone was my personal favorite, and she portrayed her character perfectly. Emily Bowning was spectacular and Oscar Isaac came off pretty damn menacing. Carla Gugino was also pretty good as well, and Scott Glenn was a very enjoyable character. You quickly embrace them all, despite the fact you know little about them all. I don't want to spoil much but I will quickly go over what makes this film so enjoyable. The soundtrack and score were amazing to listen to, giving the film a very surreal feel to it. Of course covers can never surpass the original piece of music, but still Yoav and Emily Browning is great. It keeps the film energetic yet appropriately ominous and dark when necessary. The cinematography and action scenes are incredibly elaborate and the CGI is well used. Every scene is just insane and a real treat to watch.Let alone being a superbly visual film overall, it works on a psychological stand point as well. Its themes are powerful, best summed up that reality can be harsh and cruel, nut it is better to die free than live in damn nation. I believe ""Sucker Punch"" is going to be a hard hitter for 2011, despite the many ignorant reviews dismissing it. Don't listen to the critics this time.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

But after re-watching it now that I am more critical, I realized that it is a fundamentally problematic movie. I am surprised though still that the movie did not do well commercially.The movie's problem is Snyder's creative writing; it just did not work and did not please anybody. And also the music choices - they were not good, with the exception of the opening song ""Sweet Dreams"" by Emily Browning and Marylin Manson.The visual effects were created by FIVE different visual effects companies (MPC, Quantum Creations Fx, Inc., Pixomondo, Animal Logic, & Prime Focus), which names I got from watching all the credits at the end. These people did a great job.But the cool VFX were not enough to overcome a crazy creative writing decision by Snyder.The cast was fine and the cinematography by Larry Fong is as good as you expect from him. I love his work, which includes WatchMen, 300, Batman v Superman, & Kong Skull Island.The ending is a big (?) and leaves you *scratching your head.*Conclusion: same as summary above.7/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

If Only,"A film angsty teenage girls who like emo-pop videos, combat computer games and sleepovers will love, as well as boys who desire the aforementioned girls. For some of us it will be a film that will play like those moments on American Idol when a very good singer has chosen a song we can't stand because our big sister played it four thousand times on the same day the hamster died. Granted it is often beautiful to look at: beautiful images and sequences with beautiful faces and bodies and beautiful costumes but that is all a bit wasted on a story that tries to be three layers deep but all comes off as a bass relief rather than 3D. I hate saying that. There is a wealth of ideas and not a little love put into it. Here are my if-onlies: If only it didn't remind me of those earnest theatrical plays of plays within plays (within asylums) like Marat/Sade which I knew would be good for me to see (intellectually) but found grim as homework. If only it didn't remind me how daft a lot of action films are which I don't question because they use a cool tough dude to do the far fetched nonsense and not sweet and beautiful girls. If only it didn't occasionally recall scenes from films like The Ring Trilogy, Zathura, Labyrinth and all that Terry Gilliam and Jean-Pierre Jeunet stuff so that the incredibly fertile imagination of the creators looks to have limits. (Yep, that's a back handed compliment.) If only the soundtrack didn't stick itself in your face so much and make you think they were spending whole afternoons trawling You Tube music videos instead of WORKING ON THE SCRIPT!!!! If only the Barbie Doll image for the lead girl hadn't been such a good idea on the one hand but resulted in a lack of emotional involvement on the other. If only I wasn't so critical.

Concept is brilliant... but lazy plot construction.,"Personally, I think the concept is simply brilliant, yet completely left out to dry... Why? Well, I understand that at some points of writing the plot, there are some huge holes that are left to be filled with brainstorm ideas that come after everything. I believe these parts could have been thought through a lot better.First of all, the 'world' they live in switches thrice, the asylum, then the dancing world, then the war world. When the dancing started as the war 'transition' did, I felt banging my head so hard against a table. Maybe they thought it was cool or whatever, but I think it's such a boring way to shortcut through a supposed 'intense' scene of when their going through the most intense moments. And the hypnotizing dance? God! Talk about the biggest upperhand in the world!This movie could have been my favorite ever (based on the concept) but the plot tanked, yet I still enjoyed it. Reasons? The music was brilliant! CONCEPT. The graphics were spectacular! The starting -EPIC- and the ending -loved it!So do I hate it? Can't. Do I love it? Can't. It's not bad. It's not incredible. It actually annoys me that it had the potential to be fantastic-al. That rhymed! REWRITE! Or book version. Either would be awesome.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Sucker Punch (2011),"An absolute incompetent mess. I was so excited for this, and it just let me down. Snyder should never again try and fart and original idea from his brain. How could you mess up sexy girls, dragons, robots, and samurai warriors with chain-guns. This film looked exciting and fun, and I wasn't expecting anything more than that. The film opens with a music video montage, of what should be the emotionally defining moment. Instead we get a terrible cover of ""Sweet Dreams"", a song choice with all the subtlety of a fat man at the gym. We see the evil stepfather, who is so evil, he straightens his tie after his wife dies and gives a seedy smile. He may as well just say ""YES! Now my wife is dead I can rape my stepdaughters."" He does the tie thing not once, but twice. After Snyder skips over what should be important character development, we are thrust into a computer game dream sequence where the ""plot"" is unveiled. Basically, Babydoll needs 5 items to escape. Each item can be found in a different fantasy/level. These action scenes are so sudden that they have no tension. I don't care about these girls because you haven't introduced us. The action scenes look dumb and fun, but are played out in all seriousness. Snyder tries to mix fun action with a story about mentally and sexually abused girls.This is all done in complete earnest. Like an exploitation film that wants to be taken seriously. As I watched the movie I was simply critiquing it. I even managed to enjoy X-Men The Last Stand and Spider-Man 3 whilst I was watching them. This movie just flat out abused me without the common courtesy of having anything going for it. Sucker Punch cold have been so much more, but the lack of fluidity between scenes, and the feeling that Snyder thinks this might be important, was all a bit too much.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"An action-fantasy with plenty of colorful images , set in the vivid imagination of a young girl.","Although she has been admitted to a mental institution against her will, Babydoll (Emily Browning) has not lost her will to live, so she has decided to fight for her freedom, despite she will undergo a lobotomy in five days' time. The young girl institutionalized by her abusive stepfather (Gerad Plunkett) retreats to an alternative reality as a coping strategy and for this she encourages other four rebellious girls: the outspoken Rocket (Jena Malone), the street-smart Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), the fiercely-loyal Amber (Jamie Chung), and the reluctant Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish)--to band together and try to escape their terrible fate at the hands of their captors, Blue (Oscar Isaac), Madam Gorski (Carla Gugino), and the High Roller (Jon Hamm). All of them join forces in order to sacrifice themselves to stay alive. But with the help of a Wise Man (Scott Glenn), their unbelievable journey--if they succeed--will set them free. A mind bending vision of reality from the director of Watchmen & 300 !. Feed Your Head !. You Will Be Unprepared !.Zack Snyder co-writes and directs this action fantasy epic, every bit as aesthetically daring as his blockbusters ¨300¨ , ¨Watchmen¨ or ¨Justice League¨. An action-fantasy set in the vivid imagination of a young girl whose dream world provides the ultimate escape from her darker reality, including dynamic visually striking opening scenes and credit sequences .Within a video game structure, Snyder immerses the viewer in the vivid imagination of a girl whose dream world is brought to life by spectacular World War I battles against unstoppable dragons and invincible armies, as well as heavily stylized yet brutal fight scenes . Her dream world is the only escape from her dark, sad and dangerous reality. Unrestricted by the boundaries of time and place, our heroine is free to go wherever her mind takes her, and her incredible exploits and breathtaking adventures blur the lines between reality and imagination. In her overwhelming brawls and adventurous confrontations she is accompanied by her brave friends and throughout they will have to face immeasurable enemies, all set in a strange world effectively brought to light by the CGI special effects of the latest generation.The film stars a group of young actresses in their twenties, all of whom will develop illustrious and unequal film careers. They are the following: Emily Browning, Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone, Vanessa Hudgens, Jamie Chung; being accompanied by a grup of experienced and veteran actors, such as: Oscar Isaac, Carla Gugino, Scott Glenn Jon Hamm, Gerard Plunkett, among others.The motion picture was professionaly but unevenly directed by Zack Snyder. He is an American film director, film producer, and screenwriter, best known for action and science fiction films. Snyder is the co-founder of Cruel and Unusual Films, a production company he established in 2004, alongside his wife Deborah Snyder and producing partner Wesley Coller. His films often have ordinary trademarks: female characters who suffer at the hands of male authority figures; references to classic works of art; many of his movies have a rotating shot where the camera shows a character surveying their surroundings; often uses religious symbolism; his pictures often have stunning visual effects with frequent use of slow motion; often works with cinematographer Larry Fong that provides use of slightly darker, toned down colors; his heroes often have statuesque physiques, inspired by his love of Frank Frazetta and the golden age of bodybuilders and powerful female characters who the male heroes are in awe of. Snyder made his feature film debut with the 2004 remake ¨Dawn of the Dead¨ and has continued to be known for his comic book movies and superhero films, including ¨300¨ (2007), ¨Watchmen¨ (2009), ¨Legend of the Guardians¨(2010), ¨Man of Steel¨ (2013) and its sequel, ¨Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice¨ (2016), ¨Zack Snyder's Justice League¨ (2017), ¨Army of the Dead¨ (2021), among others.

I both liked and disliked this movie... here's why,"I will preface this by saying I probably had the worst type of experience the first time I tried watching Suckerpunch.To cut a long story short, the first time I watched it I didn't see ANY of the middle section... that's right I saw the first 25 minutes, then the last 30 mins... and I was less than impressed. The first 25 minutes are very slow and the characters are hard to follow and flat.I left my home and headed for my friend's house. Little did I know he was watching Suckerpunch too. ""Man!"" He said when I got there, ""have you seen this?! Such a wild movie!"" ... to which I replied... ""The first 25 minutes were borrrrrrring and I couldn't figure out any of the characters properly."" I watched the last 30 minutes with him and was left with a confused reaction. It certainly was not great. It also certainly was not even remotely close to the worst script or acting i've ever seen (not sure how many movies some reviewers on here have seen... Suckerpunch is shallow and flat... but not terrible).I just finished watching all the middle parts I had not seen. I will certainly say it was not what I was expecting. There was actually some boring parts in amongst the CGI but there was also 3 moments that were truly amazing works of CGI/art direction, very well done.To put my thoughts into concise summaries: What I disliked: The script could have been clearer, or lost completely. Really for the target market they could have cut out half of the dialogue and just added more girls dancing and killing things and that would have been fine with me. It was also taken far too seriously. If you're going to push it into fantasy dreamworlds there should be some sense of relief at some point.What I liked: That it IS actually a movie that makes people react differently. I have friends who LOVE this movie and I have friends who can't stand it. Too many Hollywood movies try to be cookie-cutter repeats of something else (see the ludicrous amounts of prequels and sequels ... even to awful movies), at least Suckerpunch was something different.Definitely could have been better, or worse, depending what you want out of a movie but it is different.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I'm going to be sick,"I think I got to about half way through. The weedy covers of some of my favourite alt rock songs were bad enough. However, they were not a patch on the vapid, nauseating characters and tenuous storyline. I was so gobsmacked by the painfully tasteless opening scene that I had to watch it again to check that it had really happened.If you are a fifteen year old boy who loves Bayonetta, Muse videos and teenage girls in fetish wear this is the film for you. If you think mental health problems are edgy and cool and that Japanese stuff is awesome, this is the film for you.This film suffers, in the worst possible way, from style over substance. Zack has chosen to replace substance with stilted dialogue, a cliché at every moment and characters with less dimensions than Pacman.The most unforgivable crime is that the film appears to take itself seriously. It lacks the tongue in cheek, B movie authenticity of films like 'Versus'. It is also devoid of any solid premise to act as an anchor for its massively over-produced action scenes.It feels like the Zackster has taken the blueprint of 'inception', written down a list of 'cool stuff' to include, sucked it dry of any meaning and shat some Kerrang over it. Pictures on a screen do not become profound by adding an Evanescence-esque soundtrack (in fact they become rubbish). I wont even get into the ideological issues I have with the film.The Z man should not be given money to make films. I actually feel less intelligent after watching this.

What a waste of money,"I am honestly the kind of person who usually like this kind of movie. I got blown away by any terrific visual movie and CG movie and Zack Snyder has always exceeded my expectations. Therefore I was expecting a LOT from this movie, specially when I saw the first trailers. I knew the story, I knew It could be kinda crazy and couldn't make any sense at all, but if I'd bet 1 million dollars that this movie would surprise me I'd surely lose. This is by far one of the most disappointing movies I have ever seen. I was praying for the movie to end or join the people that was leaving the theater. Why didn't I? Because I was still hoping until the very last second of the movie for something to happen that could make any sense to that junk. Things that I completely disliked: The action is so boring that made me wanna cry, the acting is completely expendable, the lines, oh boy, how come you made Scott Glenn talk some rubbish like that? And the STORY, obvious. At the end I wanted to join Baby Doll in a lobotomy just to forget about this movie. The only two things not expendable are: the visuals and the girls and this is why I gave any points to this movie. I only regret they were not used in a proper outstanding project. It made me wonder why the studios have been canceling so many great projects out there and spending a huge amount of money in a project like this.

"A truly powerful movie that will stick with you, both visual and plot-wise.","Before you thumb down my review for praising it to much, let me say that, even though I'm 15, Im not an average 15 year old when it comes in the way of film. I hated the Hangover, (everybody else I know loves it,) my favorite movie is American history X, and I've seen somewhere between 100-200 movies, many being classics or movies in the top 250. With that being said, I LOVED this movie.If you haven't seen the ads or looked it up yet, Sucker punch is, according to Warner Brothers, ""An action fantasy set in the vivid imagination of a young girl whose dream world provides the ultimate escape from her darker reality.

""This movie sounds awesome!"" or 2. ""This movie sounds really dumb and written by a horny scriptwriter."" Honestly, when I first saw the trailer to this movie, I thought the second thing. However, 2 weeks before the movie came out for me, I saw a TV spot for the movie. I got curious again. I looked at the trailer from a different point of view, and I saw something that many movies lack today. Pure Entertainment. Just, pure unadulterated entertainment. As the days grew closer, I was growing in anticipation to see this movie. On March 25th, opening day, a friend and I went to see it. We both were blown away.Not only was this movie full of action, but the storyline was, surprisingly, great. As was the acting, music, sets, etc. Probably the most haunting performance was Oscar Issac as Blue, the main antagonist. He is an absolute prick on screen, not like most villains in movies today, who are more funny then scary. The best song used in this movie was sweet dreams by Emily Browning, right in the beginning in the movie. I could go on and on about why I loved this movie, but I must stress one thing. DON'T READ ANY REVIEWS FROM MAINSTREAM NEWSPAPER CRITICS! While they do bring up good points, I think they saw the movie as something different then what it was supposed to be. Just see it for yourself. Im glad I did.(P.S. If you go into this movie expecting as much from the story as you do from the action, the movie will become 5 times better. And, If its watched right, a couple theories will be forming into your head that could, possibly, rival the theories that form when watching Inception. Don't believe me? Go see it.)",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Great action, choreography, cinematography and art direct all let down by possibly the worst story.","Zack Snyder is one of my favourite directors at the moment, and on the directing front in this film he does quite well. However, the script and story for this film seem to be nothing more than a case for his crazy (but pretty awesome) fight sequences. Basically, Zack Snyder should stick to the directing and bring to life a story which showcases his talents better.It would have been better if it was higher age rated, like a 15 or 18 rating in the UK rather than a 12A.It's Watchmen/300 mixed with Dragon Ball Z or something. Quite fun to watch, but nothing more.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Gimmicks and Cocktail!,"Snyder is excellent to invite the audience to a unique world of his films. Here, it's more like a cocktail. Very stylish, lot of gimmicks and Vfx, but should have made the audience more engaging. Should have drawn the audience into the film. He failed to do so.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This film proves Shakespeare wrong,"You're probably all familiar with the quote, ""that which we call a Rose, by any other name would still smell as sweet."" Well, this film has proved the big man wrong.This is the filmic equivalent of a gorgeous pile of sh*t.I'm not sure if I stole this from anyone or if I coined it myself, but my friends and I have a term for stuff like this; good rubbish.You must see this film, but it's awful. Beautifully, beautifully awful.I do think the site should relax the 10 line / 1000 word minimum on certain films; if the director couldn't be bothered to come up with a thoughtful, coherent plot then why should us amateurs be forced to come up with a thoughtful, coherent comment.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
watch with an open mind and it blow you away,"probably the best movie i have seen in the last 5 years. i already love zach synder's work, 300 and watchmen are 2 of my favourite films ever. sucker punch is such a great movie, i have watched it twice already. i must say that the extended version is much better and i would recommend anyone to see that for your first viewing. i knew people would slate this movie as the trailer makes this film out to be something that it isn't. this movie has so much to offer, you just need to watch it with an open mind. to fully understand this movie takes a little work from the viewer, I've watched it twice and i still come up with differn't theories as to what happened, but that's what i like most about it. soundtrack is also amazing.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"The plan was sound, its execution maybe otherwise","For starters it was definitely something unique, faltering in those small places which could have possibly made this movie one to remember. Pretty girls battling in high heels is probably not the best way to make a lasting impression with viewers and the fact being they have all done a very good job made it easier for me to like sucker punch. The fighting scenes in the movie could have been better (shorter), not the effects but the whole approach seemed kind of monotonous. And also taking the high roller scene off the reel has probably caused a lot of damage to the movie. Emily Browning(the best reason at first i watched this movie for) more than qualifies for the role of baby doll. Sucker punch is not a movie where every single thing is explained, it leaves the audience to figure most of it out. Looking for an action movie with a brain??- its right here.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Zach Snyder is the better Michael Bay,"Walking into this movie, I had mixed expectations.With Zach Snyder directing, I knew I was going to get plenty of action with so much slow-mo that it would probably kill me. I was correct with that assumption.Beyond that, the movie seemed like it had a great premise, and in combination with Snyder's directing style, I thought it could be a damn good movie.Now after seeing it, I am slightly conflicted. So I will just break it down into different points.CG/Action: HOLY BALLS WHAT IS GOING ON! OH MY GOD THAT IS SO CRAZY WH.. OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! So in other words, it was pretty amazing. Action was great, with good uses of slow-mo though there was definitely too much of it, and with any movie with too much slow-mo, you get 1 or 2 unnecessary shots of something flying through the air with a slow-mo close up, or some kind of slow-mo battle hit on something/someone. And overall, it was used too much, and I was fully expecting a lot of slow-mo.Not even talking about the action, just the landscape, the scenery and all that jazz. It was still pretty impressive. The worlds they give you when you are in Baby Girl's mind are creative, expansive, detailed and a little bit breathtaking, though the action makes it too fast to be out of breath for long.Acting: This was really hit or miss. Baby Girl really didn't have much acting to do with all the action scenes she was in. She could pull off the action scenes (while getting me excited in more ways than one), but off the actions scenes, there were a few good, and a few bad. The other girls, again had a lot of action scenes, so those were choreographed well, but out of them, just some good and bad. Blondie has a moment where... Well, if you have ever seen Happy Gilmore, there is a seen where he is about to get hit with a car, and someone screams ""HAPPY LOOK OUT AH!!!"" but it comes out as ""HAPPYLAGADAH!"". If you don't know what I am talking about, watch the movie again =p. It was funny, which went completely against what the scene was going for.Again, it was hit or miss.Concept/plot: From what I understood of the movie, the concept seemed pretty good. Some girl getting locked away for some reason, and she had to go into her mind for some reason to escape. During/After, I loved the concepts presented. How the whole escaping your mind thing came into play, the important plot points that fueled the whole thing, they were all intriguing and interesting. I don't want to give anything away, so I will be vague, but the ideas themselves are very captivating. Fused with the plot, you have a grand idea for a movie. Not necessarily unique, but still something that can make a great movie.The execution of it all was disappointing though. Well, that is misleading. They did it in ways that were good, but there was so much more they could have done with it. They left out points that would make parts of movie much better, and they had a few parts that could have been changed or done differently. Give the concepts to a director such as Peter Jackson or Martin Scorsese, and it could have been done beautifully. Zach Snyder, though I like him, he doesn't make the most phenomenal movies with compelling plots.Actor/Actresses: Well, mostly actresses... Yeah everyone was gorgeous, beautiful, and most of the guys in the theater were probably turned on through most of the movie, through a combination of explosions and revealing clothing. I have no complaints.Overall, I think it was a good movie. Expect a lot of the appeal to be in the action, but the plot isn't totally devoid of worthiness. There are some cool points, decent acting and intriguing ideas, and in the genre of action, Zach Snyder is definitely does it better than Michael Bay, but don't expect another Inception.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It Should've Just Been a Video Game,"Zack Snyder has never given me reason to doubt him. He's created some of the coolest movies in recent years and, with SUCKER PUNCH, he's finally gotten around to creating a wholly original (though obviously heavily influenced) film. It's a fast-paced, sexy action collage with a paper-thin plot tying it all together. After the accidental murder of her younger sister, a young girl (known only as Baby Doll) is committed to a mental asylum by her corrupt father in an attempt to keep her silent as he steals her inheritance. The father forms a deal with a shady orderly to organize a lobotomy in mere days that will ensure Baby Doll is no longer a threat. In the asylum, Baby Doll begins to imagine the place as an elaborate brothel run by the abusive Blue Jones. Baby Doll falls in with a group of orphans and runaways (Sweet Pea, Rocket, Amber, & Blondie) and formulates a plan to escape using her hypnotic dance to distract while her friends gather the supplies they need. Baby Doll dives into fantastic imaginary worlds where she and her team battle evil forces in a desperate attempt to escape their imprisonment.It really is a strange story, with fantasy worlds inside fantasy worlds. Unfortunately, the story itself is the movie's weak point. Snyder has proved in the past that he's an incredible visual storyteller with a unique style and he proves it yet again here with amazing fantasy sequences where Baby Doll and her team are thrown into incredible sequences battling a fire-breathing dragon, steam-powered zombie Nazis, and more. The action in this film is spectacular with vivid worlds and adrenaline-soaked battles and plenty of Snyder's beloved slow-motion. When I watch this movie, I can't help but feel like I should be holding a controller. This movie is more of a feature-length video game than a proper narrative film. In a way, it's even divided into individual stages, each with its own objective and the brothel scenes playing out like narrative cut scenes. The fantasy/action sequences are boosted with some killer music setting the mood, including star Emily Browning's haunting vocals in a version of the Eurythmics' ""Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)"" and a wicked cover of Jefferson Airplane's ""White Rabbit"". The soundtrack in this movie is definitely one of the best this year.Well, action's not necessarily enough to carry a film on it's own so SUCKER PUNCH has the added bonus of mind-blowing sex appeal. Emily Browning is gorgeous as a the blond Baby Doll, often sporting a school girl outfit in her fantasies as she's taking on stone samurai or slicing through a horde of orcs. Whenever she's on screen, she's impossible to take your eyes off of. Her team is rounded out by the beautiful Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone, Jamie Chung, and Vanessa Hudgens (all grown up from her Disney Channel days, apparently). Carla Gugino has a supporting role sporting a Polish accent as Dr. Gorski, the voice of compassion in an otherwise dreary life for these girls. Oscar Isaac is the film villain, Blue Jones. I've never heard of Isaac before now but he does well as the volatile...pimp? I suppose you could call him that. Regardless, he makes a cool villain for the piece. There's plenty of awesome characters here, but they don't matter as much here as the gunfights and swordplay. It's a shame, too. I wanted Syder's first original piece to stand out as much as his previous films, but the fact that he sacrificed an intriguing story and strong characters for women in skimpy outfits flying mechs and firing huge guns turned a lot of people (both critics and audiences) off. Wait, women in skimpy outfits...massive guns...what was the problem again?",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Best Movie of the Year 2011,"*No Spoilers* Sucker Punch is about a young girl named Baby Doll (Emily Browning) who is institutionalized by her stepfather for a crime she didn't commit . As she is there she meets 4 other girls, Amber (Jamie Chung), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish), and Rocket (Jenna Malone). Baby Doll is also forced to take dance lessons for there ""clients"". While Baby Doll dances she retreats into her own world were she has to find 5 items to escape. This film also features Carla Gugino, Oscar Isaac, and John Hamm. It is also directed by Zack SnyderThis movie left me smiling the whole time i was watching it. The whole concept of Baby Doll fighting giant Nazi Zombies to get a map or fighting giant monsters with a samurai sword and then another monster comes out with a machine gun amazed me. This movie had a huge twist at the end and it made me want more. Some of my friends didn't even get the twist and i had to explain it to them. The reason why they didn't get it is because they went to the bathroom at an import part. This movie is like Inception you have to pay close attention.

"Not a great film, but entertaining enough.","SUCKER PUNCHI had heard nothing but bad things about this movie... but I never go with other people opinions, I like to come to my own conclusion.The movie is about a girl who is left with her step father after the death of her mother. She is abused and sent off to a mental institute for the death of her sister (which she didn't do). While there she starts getting these visions that she is a dancer in a brothel. Her mission is to escape with some of the other girls and find the freedom she is looking for.The story is very confusing at times and not easy to follow. It was OK in the end when it explained itself, but it was still not a very strong story.The effects were not great. Some of it was very good, but at other times it felt like I was watching a computer game. It could have been better. There were times where I thought that it was good... some of the ""dream"" characters were really well done. I liked the way that when some of the soldiers got killed, steam came out of the wound instead of blood. I thought that was different and looked great.The acting was average at best. There were some actors who did a good job, but others just seemed bad. The movie starred Emily Browning as Babydoll. Unfortunately I thought she did a bad job. She was not very convincing and her fighting scenes looked uncomfortable. Other cast members were Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone, Vanessa Hudgens﻿, Jamie Chung, Carla Gugino and Oscar Isaac. Oscar was the best actor in this by far. He was creepy and horrible and played it really well.It looked like all the girls that were there to kick some butt, just didn't have it in them. You could tell these girls felt like they couldn't do it and the fighting scenes suffered because of it.I don't think this film deserves the bad wrap it got. It was not a great film by any means, but it was entertaining enough if you don't expect a great big box office movie.I will give it 6 out of 10.""Have you ever wanted to just take something back?

On other side is story which is unexploited enough and far from being original.This movie is something between Moulin Rouge! and Sin City. Unlike two of them Sucker Punch fails to deliver the drama. And it is a bad mix I'm afraid. Acting is not good, especially by leading actress which messes some better performance of supporting cast.While watching you wish there were something more than just great visuals.

"Not great, but good fun all the same!","Zack Snyder is without a doubt one of the best up and coming directors around. Watchmen and 300 are two of the best and most faithful Comic Book movies ever made. His visual style is incredible, and even though he remains faithful to the source; his style manages to add something new and invigorating to those graphic masterpieces. But every director has their missteps every now and then. Sucker Punch is Zack's first.When I say Snyder is a good director I mean just that... DIRECTOR! The man thrives with source material, but the problem here is... There is no source material. Zack Snyder co-wrote Sucker-Punch, and after watching it I believe the man should pick up a pen never again. The writing for Sucker Punch was nothing more than set-up after set-up for cool visuals, and that never works out very well Mr. Snyder.(see Avatar) However with that said, the visuals, and video game look and feel alone make this movie worth a trip to the theater.The big problem with Sucker Punch is that it never tries to tie in the ""Dream Worlds"" with the ""Real World"". Yeah there end up being some real world consequences, but the action in the dreams never assimilate what's going on in reality. Having better tie-ins could have easily improved the movies dull conclusion. Instead the movie ends up playing out like a series of video game boss battles, which end up not being pretty fun to watch. If you go into Sucker Punch expecting mindless fun you'll get it, and you'll enjoy the hell out of it.All-in-all Sucker Punch isn't as bad as critics are making it out to be, but it is by no means great. It is a fun time at the movies, and like a video game, it's better with friends.6 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
They coulda been contenders,"A young girl is locked in a mental institution. In other to avoid being lobotomized, she devises a plan that involves a series of missions in fantasy territories she must fulfill with the aid of other female inmates.Zack Snyder has loads of talent for visual wonders. His forte is a breathtaking cocktail of stylized violence and eroticism. He makes bloodshed pretty and sexual. Which is okay with me as long as we don't mistake these dark juvenile fantasies for real life.The problem is that, as far as one can judge from this his first original script, when left on his own, he simply has no story to tell.The script feels like a five lines document that was pitched to the studio heads, containing a cool log line (""Alice in Wonderland"" with guns, I've read somewhere else on this IMDb page), a sort of mythical structure borrowed from a Christopher Vogler lecture (The Heroine's Journey! wow, wow, this is deep!"") and a couple of platitudes supposed to serve as the THEME, which as every how to write scripts manual reminds us is the most important thing in a movie. So here that would be umh... ""fight for your dreams"", ""yes you can"", ""freedom is good, I guess"".... And that was that. They went into production with those five lines. Who needs a full script when we have full lips and bucketfuls of style? I'm being intentionally mean cause this could have been sooo much better. To quote Elvis Costello: All this useless beauty. And the excellent actresses try and try like real troopers, but there simply is nothing to work with. They've been let down by the director/writer.If Mr. Snyder and co. had cared a bit more about creating good characters and telling a story (a regular story would have been enough), and less about choking the movie with style and borrowed references, this could have been a GREAT fantasy movie.Oh well, better luck next time.One last thing. That awful soundtrack. with those sanitized covers of great rock songs. I mean, how wrong can you be? The rest can be forgiven, Zack Snyder, but that is the unforgivable sin.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Incredible visuals spoilt by an insidiously creepy plot,"Version I watched: UK bluray releaseActors: 6/10Plot/script: 5/10Photography/visual style: 8/10Music/score: 6/10Overall: 6/10Nominally Zack Snyder's first (and to date only) original project, Sucker Punch is actually nothing of the sort, wearing its influences openly and proudly. The film features a series of lovingly crafted fantasy sequences set in worlds inspired by Lord of the Rings, the Matrix, steampunk culture and Japanese manga.The framing device for these sequences, however, is a problem. A young girl, nicknamed Babydoll (Emily Browning) is wrongfully imprisoned at an asylum that turns out to be a brothel that exploits her and other girls who are similarly fraudulently incarcerated. Her escape plan involves performing (implied) erotic dances that captivate and distract all onlookers for several minutes while a group of her fellow captives collect the plot tokens they need. While dancing, Babydoll distracts herself from her own shame and degradation by escaping into the fantasy worlds described above, transposing her aims as 'missions', mostly of an aggressive kind, performed by her 'team' of fellow captives, now transformed into badass warriors clad in costumes with classically fetishistic connotations: schoolgirls, sailors and soldiers of the past and future.No matter how I look at this, it's not good. The most charitable interpretation is that Snyder is trying to 'sucker punch' us by luring us into escapism and then hitting us all the harder with the harsh reality; a form of social commentary. However, my conscience refused to let me be lured away, and indeed I rather resent the implication that I can be distracted so easily. The grimness of the 'real world' soured the fantasy for me.A worse interpretation is that Snyder didn't care, that he thought it was okay for Babydoll to be treated like meat, because she has somewhere cool to escape to. Or at least, that it doesn't matter because it's all just cool stuff passing in front of our eyes for a couple of hours, so it might as well be REALLY cool stuff.It's such a shame, because the fantasy sequences are simply stunning, and I am sure I would have greatly enjoyed the whole if they had found a framing device that wasn't so damn creepy...",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Explosively appalling,"Sucker Punch fails so spectacularly in so many ways it's actually kind of interesting. How could an acclaimed, visually accomplished director making the ultimate geek fantasy with tens of millions of dollars end up creating something this rubbish?First, the characters, or lack thereof. The girls simply have no personality and differ from each other in no other ways than height and cup size. They hardly show any emotion and there's nothing to show what kind of people they are. The same applies to all the other characters with the possible exception of the villain, but only because someone has to be the bad guy. The acting is as good as the characters, i.e. terrible, but you're so detached from the movie anyway it hardly matters.Second, the visuals. One would assume on the basis of the trailer that the movie would at least evoke visual interest, but fails even at that. It's simply too much: once you've seen one amazing scenario you kind of zone out and it all becomes white noise. Zack Snyder's love for slo-mo is at its very worst here: the movie feels like it's been directed by a 12-year old who can't sit still for 5 seconds without going ""PHWOOOOAARR ISN'T THAT COOL?!"" And since all the visuals are done with CGI, none of the action sequences have any physicality or tension to them. It's about as exciting as watching marshmallows getting dropped on a silk mattress in 0,1 gravity.Third, the soundtrack. All I can remember is a cacophony of electric guitars and techno beats. In conjunction with the visuals it becomes simply too overwhelming, going in one ear and coming out the other.These are only the main problems of the film, but the way they combine and create new problems is quite amazing. The end result is one of the stupidest, most juvenile and boring films released this century.Recommendation: I can't recommend this film to anyone. Not even movie masochists, because unlike other atrocious sludge like Sex and the City 2, SPunch isn't even painful to watch, it's simply boring. Boring beyond words.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Do a favor to yourself and skip this movie, it's a total waste of time.

Finally a movie that makes you think again.,After all the movies I've seen which such a high entertaining-value it was time for a movie to surface which had more to it then the eye would see at first. A friend told me to watch this movie and after a while I sat down and watched it. At first I wasn't sure what the movie wanted to tell me but while watching the movie more and more of what is happening is clear.The gift of Snyder is that he can make a movie which lets you focus on one aspect and it turns out to be different. This is what I like to see in a movie where not everything that you see should be taken for granted but you have to think for yourself as well to see more then the screen shows you. I loved the ending and I saw while searching the internet that it started some discussion of how the ending could be seen.There are a few theories possible.

"Packs less of a punch, on more of a suck....but still B-Grade fun.","After the appallingly low approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes (currently sitting on just on 22%), I was apprehensive about spending $10.50 to watch Sucker Punch - and although this is far from the huge success it could have been (given director Zac Synder's potential), it is far from the enormous travesty many reviewers are making it out to be.The outstanding opening sequence reminded me of Synder's gift for visual flare. It plays out almost like a silent film, to a pumping remix of Sweet Dreams, telling the story entirely through visuals. Pretty soon after Baby Doll (Emily Browning) is incarcerated, the screenplay enters b-grade territory...and the cast of beauties ham it up nicely (as does Jonathan Hamm, as the labotimist).The feisty Sweat Pea (Abbie Cornish) carries a strong physicality on screen, and possesses incredible beauty. I couldn't take my eyes off Cornish when was within a frame. It was like a vortex. Jenna Malone gives it her all, but Vanessa Hudgen's was weak, but it is Emily Browning who milks it for all its worth, with a bit of 'tongue-in-cheekness' poking through her performance.And yes, the fantasy sequences are incredibly well staged and there are some stunning, eye-popping moments. Sucker Punch's weakness however is perhaps the connection between the fantasy sequences to the real world. There are no clever flourishes that link the two, and thus nothing feels at stake during the action. They remain pure fantasy within the film, and unlike, say Inception, the action feels gratuitous and self- conscious.The screenplay flounders in the final third as it tries to ground itself in reality and create emotional resonance. The sacrificial ending is questionable too - something more empowering would have been wise given the subject matter.Sucker Punch isn't intelligent - but it is thrilling. I would consider it far more of a b-movie than most critics are taking it for - and I am entertained by b-movies. Given the high quality of Watchmen, it is perhaps disappointing to see Synder revert back to his 300 days and it remains a shame that Sucker Punch doesn't strive for anything more, given its potential. Let's just hope Superman will give audiences a bit more to chew (or suck?) on.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Everyone who is thinking about seeing this should just go see Hanna instead.,"Beyond awful. I originally was really pumped to see this movie, because, come on... steam punk Nazis? Girls dressed in skimpy clothes kicking ass? Robots? Mental institutions? A dragon chasing a plane?! It looked like it would be aesthetically pleasing, and delightfully cheesy.Instead, we're given another one of Zack Snyder's creepy glamorization of rape threats.It was just gross. I consider myself to be pretty thick skinned, but I just felt really uncomfortable throughout the whole movie. I don't even mind feeling uncomfortable if the story is good, but it just wasn't. It also wasn't empowering at all. If the movie was just the action sequences, it would be passable and could even be potentially seen as being empowering to women. But all of the implied rape and the threats of rape were just totally unnecessary and didn't do anything for the story at all.Hanna just came out and is a much better film for so many different reasons - but I think what I'm most excited about is the fact that she was so strong and the antagonists were scary without being creepy and threatening her with rape. I'm just really tired of Zack Snyder being such a creep in the name of ""art,"" especially when the art is no good.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Flawed but awesome,"So, let's get something straight. I think Zack Snyder is a brilliant director. His incredibly stylistic vision he employs in his films is astounding and brutally incredible. Thus, anything I say in this review should not reflect poor opinions of Mr. Snyder, because he is a fantastic director. Despite anything that is wrong with his new film, Sucker Punch, Snyder still does an incredible job on the visuals and I would go as far as to call this film an aesthetic masterpiece. With that said, Sucker Punch is about a girl who is admitted to an insane asylum by her stepfather. The asylum, however, is just a facade for a whorehouse, and our protagonist finds herself amongst a lot of troubled young girls who want to escape from this evil place. In order to do so they go into the recesses of their minds to find the items they need in order to make their escape. It's trip. It's bizarre. It's rocky at points, but it is overall really cool.The film opens with one of the coolest and most fantastically well put together opening sequences I've seen in a long time, something I've come to expect with Zack Snyder films. This sequence sets the bleak, yet highly stylized tone for the entire movie. After this initial setup the films story begins and we continue to get a feel for this moody and aesthetic atmosphere we are in. Then we have the first scene where Baby Doll, the protagonist, escapes into her mind for the first time and must fight three giant robot samurai warriors. And yes, it is as awesome as it sounds. This first true action scene made me realize just what I was in for and how visually incredible, if nothing else, this movie would be.The movie continues to swap between real life and these, I guess you could technically call them, dream sequences. And each atmospheric action packed dream builds upon the previous, getting more and more intense. Snyder never lets up on the very specific, heavily stylized action, and it never gets old. I always commend a director when he delivers to me an adrenaline fueled action scene where I can actually tell whats going on. Snyder does this very successfully and rather than employing the shaky cam and loads of obnoxiously quick cuts Snyder plays out his action with lots of long shots and lots of slow-mo. After a little while I thought I would be terribly fed up with the slow-mo by the end of this film, but some how I wasn't. Like I said, everything that Snyder does with this camera and the amount of ingenious style he pumps this film with makes it all worth it, and it never gets old.But of course when you have a movie with such strong visuals like these, there has to something wrong somewhere else. And there is. There really is. The story has a very cool concept behind it and can be considered very existential and psychologically deep, but the film doesn't go as far as I would have liked. Some things pan out weaker than expected and a lot could have been done to improve the flow of the story. The film does end well and it will definitely leave you thinking and wondering, what did I just experience? But the two biggest and most glaring issues this film has are its weak and placid characters, and its awful dialog. The dialog between characters isn't necessarily cheesy or corny, it was just so ridiculously one dimensional, with no kick, no air, no mood to it. It was completely flat, dull, and lifeless, just like the characters on screen who could have been a lot more interesting with the backgrounds some of them are given.The acting is also pretty dreadful in this film. All the main actresses are, albeit gorgeous, very dull. This could definitely be because they had nothing to work with in terms of a script, but even the very few scenes that had some acting potential went nowhere for me and struck no emotional chord with me, no matter how hard it tried. For once I was actually happy that a film kept its dialog to a minimum because normally the dialog will be my favorite aspect of a film. But if Sucker Punch had spent any more time trying to develop these dead characters I wouldn't have ended up liking it as much, if at all. But thankfully this movie knows what it is capable of. It knows what it is here for and it knows what its audience wants. We want hot, scantily clad girls with giant guns and swords blowing stuff up for our own amusement. And we are given just that.Sucker Punch is not at all a bad film. It is incredibly flawed, but there is just no way I could bring myself to dislike a film with such mind boggling visuals that had the adrenaline pumping through me at probably dangerous rates. I don't think I could hate this movie no matter how hard I try. It is just too awesome to dislike and it really does tell a neat story, you just kind of have to wade through a lot of dull characters and dreadful dialog to find it. Zack Snyder once again proves himself to be a modern day auteur, even if that is all Sucker Punch really has going for it.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
