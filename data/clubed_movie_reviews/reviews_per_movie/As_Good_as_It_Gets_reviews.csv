"Well, I certainly can say I've never seen a film like this before!","Several years ago, my wife watched ""As Good As It Gets"" and she told me she didn't like the film. So, I avoided it for years....and now I wish I hadn't listened to her. I loved the film---just don't tell her I said so!The film, to me, was perhaps a bit different experience than it would have been for the average viewer. As a former psychotherapist, I kept trying to analyze Jack Nicholson's character in order to understand the story better. He appeared to either have a variety of personality disorders--including an avoidant personality (where he pretends to HATE everyone and pushes them away to avoid being hurt), an obsessive-compulsive personality (or perhaps an Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder) and probably a nice dose of either Asperger's or was just socially retarded. Regardless, this sort of person would NORMALLY live a very solitary and sad existence. However, the film manages to make it seem believable that a man like this could change...some...as well as find love. It's all very improbable but also very charming and sweet. And, later in the film rather oddly romantic. Additionally, the film is, at times, rather funny. Overall, a quirky and well-written film with some terrific acting.A lot of other stuff has been written about this multi-Oscar-winning film....so I'll just end by saying my wife is 100% wrong...but I still think she's terrific.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
It's hard not to leave this film with a smile on your face.,"""You make me want to be a better man.""I finally got around to watching this touching and funny film directed by James L. Brooks that stands out thanks to some wonderful performances and memorable characters. As Good As it Gets is proof that actions are louder than words because despite how cruel and mean Nicholson's character is, he does incredible and kind things for others. In a way this film reminded me of David O. Russell's Silver Linings Playbook as I found both films to be difficult to follow at first due to the lack of a likable character, but once we get to know who these people are we forgive their flaws and end up routing for them. Both Nicholson and Helen Hunt give excellent performances, and their Oscar wins were well deserved in my opinion. As Good As it Gets is the very definition of charm, and the screenplay written by Mark Andrus (Life As a House) shines thanks to some incredible performances. I really enjoyed this film and found myself laughing through most of the scenes. This is one more film I can eliminate from my shame list, and I'm glad I finally got to experience this romantic comedy which also has a lot to say about overcoming illness.We are introduced to Melvin Udall (Jack Nicholson), a cranky but successful author who suffers from OCD. He lives on his own in a beautiful apartment where he spends most of his time writing. He always goes out on his daily breakfast ritual which consists of walking to a nearby cafe without touching anyone or stepping on any cracks. He always sits in the same place at the cafe and always demands to be served by the same waitress, whose name is Carol (Helen Hunt). Carol is actually the only one in the cafe who stands his constant outbursts and cruel comments. Melvin's daily routine changes through two events that end up affecting his life. First, his homosexual artist neighbor named Simon (Greg Kinnear) suffers an accident and Melvin unwillingly accepts to take care of his dog in his absence. Second, Carol's son, Spencer (Jesse James) gets ill and she quits her job. Not accepting the fact that Carol isn't there to serve him, Melvin tries to find her in order to restore order back to his life. These series of events force Melvin to change his routine and at the same time he forms an unlikely friendship with Carol and Simon proving that he isn't as bad as he seems to be.The performances by each one of the talented actors are the heart and motor of this film. Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt share an incredible chemistry together. It's funny how despite never being able to share his feelings towards her and always saying the wrong things, it becomes clear that she does inspire him to become a better person. The supporting cast is also incredible here, especially Greg Kinnear and Cuba Gooding Jr. who deliver several funny scenes. I was partial to Brooks's work considering I had only seen How Do You Know which didn't work for me and Spanglish which I did enjoy, but As Good As it Gets is without a doubt his best work thanks to an unbelievable cast. This is a smart and funny film, which also could be cruel at times, but it was well balanced. Despite the schmaltzy story it still worked thanks to the characters that carried this film. It's hard not to leave this film with a smile on your face.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
What every romantic comedy aspires to be...,"and this movie can be watched again, and again, and again (at least by me).By now, most people who watch movies are aware that this one practically swept the Oscars for the year it was produced. It won Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt best Actor/Actress awards, came away with Best Picture and also Greg Kinnear won Best Actor in a Supporting Role for his portrayal of Simon Bishop, a sensitive gay artist.Seventeen years later the movie stands up well because of its timeless quality. ""As Good as it Gets"" is a very tight story and performance by all the actors and there is not one moment, scene or actor wasted. The story centers around people's expressions more than most movies. One example is an elderly woman actress who has opened her apartment door to run an errand and her features contort in disgust when she happens upon Melvin Udall, the Jack Nicholson character who is about to do some mischief with his gay neighbor's dog.Another example is Skeet Ulrich, who plays a street tough who somehow winds up doing a modeling job for Simon (Greg Kinnear) the gay artist. When Simon explains to Vincent (Ulrich) what he is looking for in a pose, Vincent's eyes widen and he murmurs ""Wow."" Moments later he nonchalantly delivers the type of pose Simon is looking for. Unfortunately, Simon and Vincent's association ends badly and creates a turning point for the movie.There are also several layers of irony at play in the story. It is ironic that Melvin, a hardcore misanthropist mired in full-blown OCD can somehow deliver romance novels that women love and buy by the barrelful. Also ironic is that Melvin's character transformation begins when he must take care of Simon's dog, an adorable little Brussels Griffon.It's also ironic that Carol, Helen Hunt's waitress character, works in a restaurant populated by actress-hopefuls who serve diners while striving for their big acting break. Some have stated that Hunt, a fetching but not-too-glamorous actress was too pretty for the role. However she was dressed down just enough for the role to make it work and her understated beauty comes into play in a big way later on in the story.Finally there's Jack Nicholson. His portrayal of Melvin Udall stands out as one of his great performances because of all the subtle nuances. The shot of him holding Verdell the dog and cooing to him is one of the signature shots not only from the movie but from his whole career. Near 60 when the movie was produced, he comes across more fit and polished than usual, definitely more so that his portrayal of the raucous astronaut in Terms of Endearment, another one of his great performances, which had occurred 13 years earlier.If you've never seen it what on earth are you waiting for? And if, like me you've seen it over and over, hopefully this review gives some new insight as to why ""As Good as it Gets"" is so gloriously watchable, over and over again.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
How to create something out of nothing? Ask Mark Andrus and Jim L. Brooks,"Really, how to make something original, fresh and odd out of absolutely nothing except a few characters? Using characters, only characters and nothing except characters. That's the simple formula Brooks uses in all of his work, but, for me, he has never created so much charm, warmth and sensibility as he did in `As good as it gets'.Characters write the screenplay in this movie, and everything that happens - happens because of what they are. They are nothing special  they are ordinary people we meet in the street every day and that have the same problems a lot of other people have. This movie presents the example of how much you can pull out of that. And if that is written as well as it is in this case, not even a happy ending can bother you. Because, in real life, shown here, what is the end?Everything is good and warm in this movie, everything is fresh and vivacious, understandable and well performed. Jack Nicholson brings one of the best performances of his career, that terrific Helen Hunt finally got a chance to show how skilfully an actor can connect naturalism with the laws of the camera performance, and Greg Kinnear shows the most convincing emotions coming from a gay character I've ever seen.The relationships between the characters are created in the way that you can't predict anything that's going to happen, eventhough you know in advance what could come out of their mouth and what kind of attitude they'll have in a certain situation.You can simply feel the progressive collaboration that occurred between Brooks and the actors and the mutual understanding they developed, and it's not often that you see that kind of artistic superstructure shining on the screen so much as it does here.I find `As good as it gets' complexed, vital, intelligent, emotionally deep and studied, fresh, original, amusing, cheerful, funny, and one of the best films of 1997.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A superior Hollywood piece of sentimentality,"Melvin is a romantic novelist who is a selfish manic compulsive who is rude and insulting to all he meets.  When Melvin's gay neighbour is beaten up and robbed, Melvin agrees to look after his dog.  The dog gives Melvin something to care about other than himself and his life is approaching normal until his regular waitress has to leave work to look after her asthmatic son and his neighbour wants his dog back.  Melvin starts to realise that his life needs others for more than just selfish reasons.The big Oscar winner for Jack is recent years is enjoyable if you come to it knowing what to expect.  The film is very sentimental but in a good way. The film is gently comic and amusing and the characters (although exaggerated) are winning and involving.  The telling is a little long winded at times and the film could have been shorter but it is still enjoyable.  It does tip over into sickly sentimentality at times and can be a bit syrupy but it comes with the territory.Nicholson is excellent and is the main reason it all works well.  His un-PC Melvin is funny but also a character that you can hate and pity on several occasions.  Kinnear is good because he is a solid understated character and not hammy or OTT like he can be.  Hunt is good but is left with the majority of the syrup and sentiment where the other characters get more share of the laughs.  Gooding Jr continues his trend of being good in over the top roles and is funny and happily avoids becoming a flaming gay stereotype.Overall this is a sentimental romantic comedy that is typical for the genre. The story wanders to it's point but the good cast, led by a great Nicholson, hold the whole thing together.  A superior piece of sentimentality.",,Anonymous,Romance
Unusual movie,"This movie is bizarre because, while judged overall its story is shmaltzy and unbelievable, nevertheless each individual scene plays absolutely convincingly and feels very real. It's weird. I don't know if it's just the greatness of the actors overcoming an under-thought out script, or whether it's just the script concentrated solely on crafting great scenes one after the other, but not so much in coming up with a convincing through-line. Whatever. All I know is that this is one of the most entertaining pictures I've ever seen, extremely funny and quite emotionally affecting in places. Somehow, it just doesn't matter - I like it anyway.The performances are uniformly excellent. Nicholson shows real range here - sure, he gets to be the sarcastic curmudgeon we've all come to expect, but his character also has moments of fear, repression and vulnerability which he brings off equally well. My problem with this character (and the ""problem"" only exists as I think about him afterward, not while I'm actually watching the movie) is in his conception: he seems to be whatever the writers want him to be at that moment, with no particular consistency from scene to scene so when he supposedly ""changes"" at the end, we're left to think, ""Change? This guy's been changing through the entire movie!"" And also, the fact that his character is a romance novelist is never really explained or examined in any way.And yet, Nicholson's performance makes it not matter quite so much.Helen Hunt is a revelation in this movie - she nails every scene she's in, whether she's forced to be witty, embarrassed, angry, defiant, emotionally overwhelmed, whatever. She keeps Jack on his toes, and they work off each other brilliantly. Also, I never thought I'd find myself saying this, but Greg Kinnear was great as Simon, the gay neighbor.   (It was also nice to see director Harold Ramis - the third Ghostbuster, after all - in front of the camera again, if only briefly, in a small part as a doctor.)What more can I say? Good comedy, good love story, great acting. None of it, in the end, is very convincing, but if you just focus on the individual moments and not on the grand design - a task made easy by the wonderful writing and playing - it's very easy to like As Good As It Gets.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
As Good as Romantic Comedies Get,"""As Good As It Gets"" boasts a splendid, delightful combination of wonderful, zesty acting and a remarkably bright and effective screenplay. Jack Nicholson is pitch-perfect as the obsessive-compulsive curmudgeon Melvin Udall, who possesses some of the strangest and most curious tendencies ever concocted by screenwriters; his Udall is so human, so heartfelt, so genuine, and so whimsical and Nicholson perfects him to such a degree that not a moment of his screen time is unwanted or uninteresting: in my valid opinion, this is Nicholson's best performance of his career, and one of the most reverent performances in film history. What an engaging, enthralling story: an troubled, insecure man helps a troubled, insecure waitress (troubled and insecure in different respects), and the two form an unlikely relationship from being distant acquaintances (Hunt even exclaims that Nicholson is crazy in their most uncomfortable moment in the film) to practical soul mates (Nicholson to Hunt: ""I feel that I'm the only person that knows that you are the greatest woman alive""), through a series of misfortunes, self-explorations, and mutual bondings. Kinnear's character Simon has the distinct purpose in being both the bridge and the divider of Nicholson and Hunt's relationship, and he identifies with his character with compassion and understanding, as he has frequently been wronged throughout his existence. The most curious aspect to a story such as this, involving such unduly, diverse characters: a miserable recluse, a zesty, yet insecure waitress, and a sensitive and insightful, yet wronged homosexual, is that in their distinct differences, they share many of the same problems, and these problems eventually bring them all together, although hardly in a civilized manner. I appreciated practically every element in this wonderful, delightful masterpiece of exemplary romantic comedy, in its indelible acting (Oscars well deserved), its whimsical, touching screenplay (This was neons above ""Good Will Hunting""'s quality) and its comforting morale, that despite all of the great odds in life which prevent us from being happy, we can perhaps find it within ourselves to take that one important step in reversing our fortunes, in ""stopping with taking pills"" and to allow our lives, and our desires to shine and be realized, as this story depicts life. The best romantic comedy, certainly the best film of 1997, and one of the greatest films of all time, ""As Good As It Gets"" succeeds in practically every entertaining and endearing cinematic respect. **** out of ****",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
This is how you do it,"Hollywood is currently a failure because even simple movies like this, they don't know how to write anymore. The old ways had writers who lived and interacted with people. Today's writers are in a bubble trying to impress each other. The old ways had diverse castings, writers and directors. The difference was before, it was putting the art first. Today? I haven't a clue. There's nothing on screen that looks like life around me. This movie is closer to what I know than anything they put out today. I was in my 20s when I saw this in movie theaters. Both leads are the reason I wanted to see this back then. This movie is smart, witty, has some heart and knows exactly what it is.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
More Pertinent To Life Than When It Was Filmed,"It's ironic that the ways in which this seems to have aged poorly-Melvin being homophobic, casually racist, and more-has actually made this movie more relevant. It forces you to think about every main character and the main theme is transparent and codified in dialogue: ""You look at someone long enough, you discover their humanity.""A lot of reviews condemn Melvin, but the film actually never asks the question as to whether or not Melvin, in particular, deserves pity, sympathy, and empathy. Because everyone deserves that, even people like him. There is not any real altruism instilled in him, or arguably anybody, but simply by proxy, empathy and love is a transformative experience for everyone involved. That's what the move is about.Not only that, but adjacent to OCD, which Melvin has, is Tourette's syndrome. I wish it had gone into whether or not any of his verbal compulsions stem from that, but it seems to imply that. Regardless, though, I think that his working toward reparations and his actions speak louder than his words. Surely a remote viewer of an audience can work to extend that kind of empathy to someone who is very challenging to extend it toward? In the time of political polarization and cancel culture and the like, regardless of how you feel about the message of the film, it is more pertinent and interesting and dynamic than most comedies. And no comedy is quite like this, that I've seen.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
As good as Jack gets...,"You'd swear JACK NICOLSON was playing himself, he's so on target with his character (Melvin Udall), a quirky, misanthropic writer who thumbs his nose at everyone with sharp wisecracks, delivered in that dull monotone he perfected so many movies ago. When he isn't shoving a cute dog down the incinerator chute or avoiding stepping on sidewalk cracks, he's just about the rudest patron any waitress (HELEN HUNT) could expect to meet up with. His eccentricities even extend to bringing his own silverware to his favorite restaurant and insisting that only one particular waitress serve his meals. Poor girl.But the opposites attract cliché seems to be at work shortly after they meet and gradually learn to tolerate each other before romance enters the picture. Meanwhile, Nicholson finds time to be rude to his gay neighbors, GREGG KINNEAR and CUBA GOODING, JR. who share the same floor in his brownstone apartment building.When it's all over, there's an uplifting, feel good feeling about the whole thing, despite the nastiness of Nicholson's character which is almost always played for laughs. All the players are excellent and each have their special moments. Nicholson and Hunt went on to win well deserved acting awards for their offbeat roles.A cheerful, wacky look at those strange creatures called human beings.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Truly a classic from the 1990s that gets better with multiple viewings,"I saw AS GOOD AS IT GETS in February 2016 and I liked it. I saw it for a second time in August 2019 and I liked it more. I re-watched it for a third and final time last March and I loved it even more. And since I like a lot Jack Nicholson (and some of my friends think that I look a bit like him in his younger years) I couldn't wait to finally review it here.Melvin Udall (Nicholson) is a misanthropic and obsessive compulsive novelist that lives alone in his apartment. He is obsessed with having everything clean and in order, gets irritated easily even when his neighbours ring the bell or sees his gay artist neighbour's dog and when he goes to have breakfast in his favourite restaurant he avoids walking close to people in the sidewalks and instead of using the restaurant's cutlery, he bring his own silverware from home because he is afraid of germs. One day his neighbour Simon Bishop (Greg Kinnear) is robbed and nearly killed and while Simon is in hospital, Udall has to take care of his dog and while in the first times he couldn't stand it, he then becomes affectionated to him to the point that when Simon is released Udall has problems in giving back the dog. Melvin's life furtherly challenged when Carol (Helen Hunt), the waitress of his favourite restaurant, decides to work in Brooklyn closer to her home because of her son's health problems and Udall arranges to pay for the medical expenses necessary for Carol's son's condition, but she is a bit skeptical.Since Simon is facing bankruptcy, Udall offers to accompany him to Baltimore and Carol joins them for lessening the awkwardness. Once in Baltimore, Carol insists to Frank that they have to go to dinner in a restaurant. During the dinner Udall's comments flatter and soon upset Carol, and she leaves. In the hotel room Simon starts to sketch her and this rekindles once again his desire to paint. After returning to New York Carol apologizes to Melvin about the rough things she said to him and in the end, they finally start a relationship (the movie ends with the couple walking together at 6 AM).Jack Nicholson probably gives his best performance ever (closer to greatness only with the ones from SHINING and ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST) and he nailed the role of the misanthropic and obsessive compulsive writer to the point that only he could have played such a part well. Greg Kinnear, Helen Hunt and Cuba Gooding are all very good and give great support, and the dog was very adorable. And overall, the movie gives this great message: if you have to change for the love of someone, you can do it even with one step at a time, and I experienced it in real life too.Don't miss it if you have a chance because of the acting and the messages it gives in a subtle manner. Very intelligent and witty.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

As Bad As It Gets!,"Trio of star are at their worst playing irritable characters in the movie. One minute they'd be nice to each other, the next minute they'd be mad at each other without any apparent reason. The performances are exaggerated to the Nth degree.Nicholson still acts with that too-familiar sly manner, but runs out of steam this time. He's thrown out of the restaurant where Hunt works for bad behavior, but after a few scenes, he sits in there enjoying his meal again. It's either the restaurant owner or writer-director of this movie is out of his mind. Besides, do you believe a waitress can have long chats with customer without getting warned by her boss?As for the story, there're not enough events to sustain it; just full of ludicrous dialogue from irritating characters.

This comedy is as good as it gets!,"Comedies (especially romantic comedies) can only be judged by how much they make you laugh and if they make you feel good inside. As Good As It Gets does it for me every time. I'm not just saying this on account of being a ""Jack fan."" The characters are so beautifully drawn, you forget it's just Jamie from ""Mad About You"" (Helen Hunt) and the man with the eyebrows (Nicholson). This movie deserved all of its Oscars, and then some. The role of an obsessive-compulsive is an easy one to parody and mock to death, but Jack does it with style, humour, emotion, and that usual Nicholson flair. Hunt has never been better as a waitress with a major anxiety to do something for herself for a change. Greg Kinnear is also very good as a gay artist that ends up having to turn to the irascible Jack for help after he is scarred and left destitute following a break-in. This is such a special comedy, fresh from the pen of James L. Brooks, the man behind the wonderful Terms of Endearment (another wonderful Nicholson performance) and Broadcast News. As Good As It Gets made me feel so good, even though I couldn't really relate to the characters' situations. The humor is pure Jack, set to the script with perfect ease. The emotions evoked by the actors are also authentic and heart-felt, as if they love what they are acting out. Movies like this come few and far between, and that is the reason why I appreciate this film so very much. As Good As It Gets was one of the best films of 1997.

Simply great,"As Good As It Gets is one of those incredibly moving films that is also hugely entertaining. It's not just a comedy, you can't quite label it a drama piece, it just is what it is; simply great.What works here so well are the actors and the script. Nicholson and Hunt both won Oscars and they're simply great but Kinnear is no less effective as Nicholson gay neighbour. Plus that dog is amazing as well. This film really relies on great performances and there's no shortage of that here.As Good As It Gets is also remarkably well written. So well defined characters and completely involving, you quite simply grow to love them and sympathize with their plight. Nicholson's remarks are terrific, each one very quotable (personal fav; I think of a man and I take away reason and accountability).Direction is first rate, Brooks made Terms of Endearment so it's well established that he's quite capable of making great films.

"When Jack's on screen, you can almost never go wrong!","Jack Nicholson is one of those actors who impresses me the second (and I'm not overstating in the least bit) he appears on screen.  The moment I see Jack's face on screen, I get this feeling that everything's going to be all right.  He could do a Pauly Shore film, and elevate its quality with his mere presence.  And I didn't even get to his acting.Nicholson won a well-deserved Oscar for this movie.  Then again, I feel like he deserves an Oscar for virtually everything he's been in.  Hell, you can even give him an Oscar nod for ""Anger Management.""  THAT'S how great he is! He's one of those actors who can communicate even more emotion when he's not saying anything than when he is.  And of course, he has one of the coolest movie star voices ever, so it makes it a joy whenever he does speak.  I still feel like ""You can't handle the truth!"" wouldn't be as priceless a line if Jack didn't yell it.  He can say almost any line of dialogue and turn it into gold.  In this movie it was ""You make me wanna be a better man.""  Again, an otherwise forgettable line of dialogue made gold by Jack.""As Good As It Gets"" is a flawed film, with scenes that drag and an overlong running time, but it's highly enjoyable and altogether pretty well-written. Aside from its many hilarious moments, it's also quite touching.  But I have to admit that it's the comedy that sticks out most in my memory.  There's some priceless gags like when a Jewish couple is sitting at Jack's usual table.  He first intrudes into their conversation saying, ""People who speak in metaphors oughtta shampoo my crotch.""  He complains to Helen Hunt, his usual waitress, saying ""I have Jews at my table!""  He then intrudes in the couple's conversation again, noticing the food on their table, saying ""Obviously your appetites aren't as big as your noses.""  Now, I probably wouldn't want to personally know a man like Melvin in my real life, but I still found those cracks to be hysterically funny.  The same when he attacks Greg Kinnear's gay character with constant homosexual slurs.The performances are great all-around.  Though Jack pretty much steals the show, Greg Kinnear gives a wonderfully endearing performance.  He doesn't play out the gay stereotypes, yet he's sensitive and feminine enough to have me convinced that he is gay (unlike Eric McCormack on ""Will and Grace"" who acts like he's gay for the sake of the show's gimmick).  It's nice to see Kinnear rise from the host of ""Talk Soup"" and the thankless late night talk show ""Later"" to a fine actor.  Previously, I wouldn't have any notion that he could become what he is now.  Helen Hunt also gives a compelling, emotionally packed performance.  And Shirley Knight, as her mother, provides a little bit of comic relief.  Cuba Gooding Jr. has a small but interesting role, and he makes the best of it.The film does have its dull moments, but Jack's one-of-a-kind performance makes it all worthwhile.  There is nobody, and I mean NOBODY, who could've played Melvin better than him.  I read in the trivia that John Travolta was originally offered the role.  Now, I like Travolta, but in this type of role he wouldn't hold a candle to Jack.My score:  7 (out of 10)",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

One of my favorites but seemingly forgotten...,"... which is rather strange since it is one of only seven films to win both Best Actor and Best Actress Oscars for its leads. But it is rather quirky and offbeat with unusual subject matter for a romantic comedy.Melvin Udall (Jack Nicholson) is a misanthropic and obsessive-compulsive novelist living in New York City. He is abrasive and self absorbed past the point that being OCD could just explain it, or even being misanthropic. He goes out of his way to insult his neighbor, Simon Bishop (Greg Kinnear), a gay artist. And he also throws Simon's dog down the building's garbage chute. I'm a misanthrope, but I don't go around hurling slurs at people or hurting animals.Among Melvin's compulsions is eating breakfast at a specific diner with a specific waitress, Carol Connely (Helen Hunt). Carol knows how to serve breakfast the specific way that will keep Melvin from having a conniption fit. But Carol's only son has a complicated allergy/asthma situation that her HMO doctors either aren't competent to diagnose or don't have the time to dedicate to solving it, so she's been missing work when her son is ill.At the same time Simon is looking for subjects to pose for him when he sculpts, and he hires a model who turns out to have violent criminal tendencies and badly injures him.These events all work to draw these three people together in a most interesting way, and they each wind up helping each other with their problems in unexpected ways.The film's portrayal of New York City is as vibrant as its characters. The cinematography captures the energy and charm of the city, immersing viewers in its unique atmosphere and acts as a snapshot of New York City as it existed in the late 90s when it was going through a bit of a renaissance.Special kudos to Cuba Gooding Jr. As Simon's agent who knows how to deal with Melvin by going into scary threatening mode. And also to Simon's dog, who winds up being a catalyst for change in Melvin. The dog should at least have gotten a supporting actor nomination.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Grumpy Old Man,"Melvin Udall (Jack Nicholson) is a romance novel writer who has problems. He bullies his gay neighbor Simon Bishop (Greg Kinnear). In fact, the first thing he does in the movie is to shove Simon's dog down the garbage chute. He's a petty angry horrible man suffering some OCD. He has to eat at the restaurant where Carol Connelly (Helen Hunt) works as his personal waitress. She's a tough woman trying to get by with a sick child. When Simon is attacked in his home, Melvin is left to take care of the dog.Of course he learns to accept other people. He falls Carol and she saves him from a bitter lonely life. That's the basic storyline and director James L. Brooks adds the colors of a memorable performance by Jack Nicholson. Nicholson is definitely tapping into his sly mean-spirited self. Some of his action is funny, but a lot of it is too angry. I wish he had more vulnerability at the start to allow the audience to root for him.Helen Hunt is obviously way too young for Jack Nicholson. But there is something about Jack that he can certainly get a woman that age in real life. It's Helen Hunt that doesn't really fit. She isn't really the MPDG type. She seems to be too smart to get involved with that mess. Although it makes for a good movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

""I take away reason and accountability.""How does someone who says that have the capability to care for a woman while hating women? I get that he is a curmudgeon.

Wonderful,"Now I know what good acting means. You are absolutely surrounded with it in this movie. There is not a single actor or actress in this movie that didn't exceed himself/herself. Helen Hunt is great (I don;t know why, but I find her quite attractive) and I won't bore you about the performance given by Jack Nicholson. When I first saw this movie I thought it was really boring and overrated, but I saw it again the second day and immediately loved it. Maybe the ending is a little bogus, but it's a romantic comedy, so it didn't bother me that much. A fairly complicated plot presented with ease and simplicity works perfectly and there's a nostalgic tone to the movie in whole. Maybe because it's a rare occasion nowadays to come across a movie that isn't stuffed with special effects. This is a movie that should be seen on a beautiful day, when you're in a good mood.Great fun that keeps getting better and better each time I see it.  A strong 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
This almost all Oscar winner cast gives such a great performance that it makes it almost impossible not to love this movie in its entirety!,"Directed by Oscar nominee James L. Brooks, the story written by Mark Andrus brings up not only very interesting characters but also very interesting issues.  I have the video and enjoy watching it. The CD is great with music of Nat King Cole, Shawn Colkin. Outstanding acting by Helen Hunt (Mad About You, Twister) who won an Oscar for this role where she plays Carol Connelly, a single mother, working as waitress in Manhattan, New York. A single parent trying to cope with her work and paying medical bills for son Spencer Connelly, played by  Jesse James (Message in a Bottle, The Gingerbread Men, Gods and Monsters). Jack Nicholson (A Few Good Men, Easy Rider, Witches of Eastwick)  is Melvin Udall who is an obsessive compulsive.  Nicholson also won an Oscar for his part. His obsessive compulsiveness has taken over his life and he is not able to live a normal life.  Melvin Udall  has tons of soap all organized in his medicine cabinet.  He uses a bar of soap once and then throws it out. He will not step on a crack on the side walk but skips to the next block of concrete. When he goes to the restaurant he brings his own plastic fork, knife and spoon in a plastic bag. Udall uses plastic gloves to hold the dog and has all his office supply stacked and all color coordinated in his home/office. He eats at the same restaurant, sits at the same table, if someone is seating at his table he insults them to make them leave so that he has his table back, wants the same waiter Carol to wait on him, and takes forever to take a shower. He closes his door several times and counts how many times he has done it. As a writer who works at home I do understand Mr. Udall really well. Writers think somewhat like this: we like to be alone with ourselves in order to think. We have to go inside ourselves to produce good work. It is a very isolated world. We do not like to be bothered unless we are bored, or tired, in which case we want to communicate with the outside world for a brief period of time, then after one hour or so we want to go back inside ourselves again and be left alone. This is somehow like Melvin thinks. People think that he has nothing to do and they keep knocking at his door and he gets really aggravated about that.  He is my favorite character in this movie, not to diminish the other ones. He is just so full on nuances that make him very entertaining. Helen's role is very, very, good and she did a really good job with it. Greg Kinnear (Sabrina) is Simon Bishop, the artist who is Udall's next door neighbor who finally has Melvin turning into a little more normal human being and he is there to teach him many life lessons.  The supporting actors are great,  you have Oscar winner Cuba Gooding Jr. (Jerry Maguire) playing Frank Sachs, Simon's agent.My favorite scenes: elementary school kids all in uniform screaming: ""Wait! Melvin,  wait""! Greg Kinnear imitating Melvin. Melvin and Caroll going to eat fresh rolls in the wee hours of the morning. When Melvin realizes that the dog is also skipping cracks on the sidewalk.My favorite quote: ""I am drowning  here and you are describing the water."" This is a nice story telling movie. I recommend it!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Badly Edited, Written, and Directed","""As Good As It Gets"" has three great performances. Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson deserved their Oscars. Greg Kinnear deserved his nomination.The problem is that all of these performances could be in different movies. There is absolutely no glue holding these characters together. The direction appears to have been done scene by scene. There doesn't seem to be any story just scenes. The editing seems to have involved putting the film in a Blender and then putting it back together, piece by piece.There are great moments though. Helen Hunt describing how she felt looking at a couple is a guaranteed tear-jerker. Helen Hunt bashing HMO's. Jack Nicholson buying a suit jacket from a doorway, washing his hands, and any scene with the dog. Greg Kinnear in the hospital, after he's beaten up.

"By default, one of the best films of the year","At first, i didn't know if I should put this film in my best of the year category, I liked it alot, but I wondered if Titanic would go over it.  It didn't, so I put this film in, and well deserved.  The film is directed by Oscar winning director James L. Brooks (of Terms of Endearment and The Simpsons TV show fame) and stars Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt (Nicholson won his third Oscar for this and Hunt won her first).The story follows a bitter old scrooge (Nicholson in his usual perfect self) who is also a romance novelist (his line ""I think of a man, and I take a way reason and accountability"" when describing writing women is classic), but through a series of events including a cute dog, a gay artist (Greg Kinnear is endearing in this role), and a waitress with some problems (Hunt), he becomes a little better.  Conventional to be sure, but it is definately a winner in laughs and romance.  That's comic veteran Harold Ramis as a doctor.  A+",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"""I Think of a Man...Then Take Away Reason, and Accountability.""","In the category of romantic comedies that are bubbly on the surface and intricately layered and complex the deeper you dig, As Good As It Gets towers over the competition. It's a film of three stories, two halves, and one precariously balanced central romance. It takes a different shape and focus in nearly every scene, and each is as interesting, thought provoking, and engaging as the last. It can be deconstructed, analyzed, or critiqued in a dozen different ways, depending on where one focuses. It's soulful and full of life, but centered around deeply flawed, desperate characters doing their damndest to make the best of what they've got. Oh, it's also incredibly funny, well-acted, well shot, well directed, and well written.The film follows OCD misanthrope Melvin, loving mother Carol, and heartfelt painter Simon as they cross paths, driven by an act of apathetic generosity of Melvin's. The film walks a wonderful tightrope between their lives, though it's centered on Melvin and his callous, blunt, and usually hostile demeanor.Although it's a romantic comedy, the film is most fascinating when there's no romance involved. Melvin is an irritable jackass with OCD, meaning he cares only for his own routine. He's waited on every day by Carol, whose son is chronically ill. One morning he's too sick for her to work, which greatly disturbs Melvin's routine and thus agitates him into action. He pays for a full-time doctor for Carol's son, so that she can show up to work every day without distraction.Melvin possesses almost no emotions and (because he works so frequently as a well-published author) almost unlimited wealth. When he's even slightly inconvenienced, his first instinct is to buy his comfort back. He gravitates toward Carol because she's not intimidated by his surly attitude or blunt approach; no other waitress will put up with him. Melvin's misanthropic views, coupled with his OCD, make him apathetic to anything happening around him. He uses slurs frequently and stomps on others' emotions and desires. He's not motivated by cruelness or a past tragedy, but robotic in his disdain, an all-consuming blackhole of selfishness. Everyone is the hero of their own story, but in Melvin's story, there aren't even any other characters.Because of this dynamic, intentional or not, the first half of As Good As It Gets plays like an indictment of America's healthcare system and uncaring market forces. Carole is trapped by Melvin's apathetic charity; she struggles to comprehend his motivation while trying desperately to keep him out of her life, weighing her sanity against her son's health. Melvin, again, isn't interested in any of this; he doesn't need emotional or sexual gratification and vehemently refuses a long, soulful thank you note. All he wants is a specific waitress. It's a perfect metaphor for the influence of money on the well off, and the hopelessness of the down trodden to escape their circumstances with only the help of indifferent higher powers.That's the first half. The second half of the film shifts gears entirely, taking a few liberties with Melvin's character and getting Greg Kinnear more involved. It's just as funny and engaging as the first half, but the balance begins to tilt. The chemistry between Melvin and Carol begins to shift as Carol's emotional defenses are worn down. She's wary, but she's also longed for companionship, and Melvin fits this role to varyingly effective degrees. Are they friends? Do they want to be more? How can they be when every conversation ends in confusion and frustration? This is a romcom.As Good As It Gets is so great because of its novelty. Nothing about the film is conventional; Melvin almost never sees eye to eye with his other leads, his relationship with Carol begins with genuine indifference, and many redeeming moments are immediately muddied by his total lack of self-awareness or empathy. The subversive nature of the film is built into the film's DNA, present right down to the ending. The film ends on a note of sweetness and hope, but it's also fairly ambiguous; it answers the central question of all romcoms - will they/won't they - but promises no binding resolutions, no permeant status quo as the picture fades to black.There's no doubt that As Good As It Gets is a great film. It's consistently funny, full of humanity, and deftly tackles questions of identity and acceptance without heavy handedness. The acting is superb all around, with Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson absolutely earning their Best Actor/Actress wins. It's as charming, down to Earth, and laidback as any James L. Brooks film, and is arguably the greatest film he directed in his short but impressive career. It's a multifaceted pleasure, with perfectly structured layers of humor, drama, and perplexing romantic tension. Go see it.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

As Good as It Gets,It has taken me a very long time to watch this movie. I finally sat down and did so. I've never been so entertained and captured by characters like I was for this two hour movie. It is very rare to have a movie full of people and actually feel for them. What is interesting about it is that you have your main characters and you have your extras and background people. Normally you don't think twice about them. In this film you do. You notice little things. Some are sad and it's very prominent that they are. Some are talking about little things that we catch a quick audible sound of what. It's that little extra attention to detail that the film makers did for this story. It adds to authentic feel for everything. You have all that and you have great acting from the leads and a story that you can relate to in one way or another. This movie is very feel good and should be seen by all. A good script and clever dialogue are let down by a little bit too much sentimentality. Jack Nicholson at his very best.,8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson show that people must make judicious choices to change their lives.,"James L Brooks' film ""As Good as It Gets"" surely belongs to ""too good to be true"" genre.It is in many ways stylistically similar to ""It could happen to you"" directed by Andrew Bergman.The reason for classifying this film as an excellent story which easily defies human belief is that it is quite true that there are precious moments in people's lives where they cannot stop putting their trust in other people's lives but it is not so easy to find such people and moments.This is exactly what happens in seemingly ordinary yet momentous lives of this film's three major characters who establish that even bad people change when important events happen in their lives.""As Good as It Gets"" is a good film to be watched with family as it does not distance itself from its ""pro people"" stance.This is the only reason why audiences would be able to brook an odd assortment of characters whose sexual and racial preferences are somewhat overtly illuminated throughout this film.All in all,""As Good as It Gets"" is a good American film which would go down in history as a work of art which has mellowed out obnoxious prejudices against gay people and single mothers.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

The worst thing about this movie is that it has to end.,I have to admit that -To some degree-I can relate to Melvin Udall's character in the sense that he is a very compassionate and caring man armored with the harsh bitterness from the world. The fact these dynamics are exaggerated make it comical.The cast was phenomenally on point for the characters. Each and every character added flavor and depth to the storyline-Even the expressive dog.So many small roles played by actors that are huge now.This is one that will go in my time capsule.,10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Romance and OCD/Neurodiversity Done With Style,"A glorious movie which is a little underrated and has aged very well since the late 1990's until now. The casting is epic. The leads are superb. Even the extras are great. It's just a very well-made and conscious movie which highlights difficulties of being gay and having OCD (separate characters) in the big City.The romantic storyline is the stella takeaway of the plot. It involves an OCD degenerate who is suffocating (Jack Nicholson - perfect for this role) for everyone around him due to his selfishness and understated ignorance of people in his surroundings.As a neurodiverse person I can understand many of the lifestyle choices of Jack's character. For instance the obsessive collecting of keen interests; ability to become confused and extremely offended in social situations and the difficulty of life itself not being in place with you.For instance this is demonstrated superbly with the walkways of NYC really damaging the mental health of Jack's character. I'm not sure if he did much method work before this film but he really knows how to showcase OCD trademarks; something really excellent actors can do.The gay character is played superbly by Greg Kinnear. Melvin (Greg), is a typical exceptional arthouse student and suffers with the social issue of struggling to afford the rent and eventually losing his home as he struggles with the gentrification of NYC.He gets violently attacked and robbed by conmen. He never seems to come to terms with being abandoned by the gay community because of hid violent ordeal and the repercussions on his image.This is not like the gay community which I know but it is a great screenplay for how the central characters come together via eventual understanding and empathy until total unison is created and culminated.This makes this movie rather special. The romance interest with the glamour waitress (Helen Hunt) and her odd OCD customer is perfectly-articulated.Helen Hunt plays her role incredibly well. It's hard work when you have to play with such an elusive screen icon as Jack Nicholson and she rises to the occasion with exceptional grace and style.Her eventual romantic plot is extremely well-scripted and it's so refreshing having a movie with neurodiversity at the forefront. The Director did a wonderful job. The cinematography is fantastic too.Lots of close-ups and tracking for opening scene situations. I adore how the scenes are set and the camera sequences involved. It sets the tone for the movie. It makes you want to watch it. The acting does everything else. It's a tad cliche this movie but it's done properly. It's a little long-wounded with the storyline but it's done with great purpose and effect.Really grateful to have watched this as it's about time that more neurodiversity was included in blockbuster movies. An excellent 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
If OCD was portrayed accurately.,"As Good as it Gets is a movie portraying Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, OCD, and the effects it can have on a person's every day life. Melvin Udall is a middle aged writer that lives his life without stepping on cracks, being late to breakfast, and shows no compassion towards anybody. Although Melvin shows no compassion for any other person when he is forced to baby sit his neighbors dog while his neighbor is hospitalized he falls in love with the dog as misses the company once he returns to his owner. It's not until his daily waitress, Carol Connelly, has to quit work to take care of her ill son that Melvin shows concern for another person. These are the first steps of Melvin being able to put his self-centeredness and compulsions aside to help others in need.Melvin is devoted to his writing and to nobody else; as long as his day goes orderly he can keep his obsessive compulsions to a minimum. To a minimum meaning he will still wash his hands with 12 different soaps each time and will still switch his lights on and off 5 times before being satisfied, but he won't break stride as long as things work in his favor. When Carol is absent from work and can't serve Melvin his daily breakfast is when his disorder can no longer be controlled. He makes a personal visit to Carol's home to see why she is not present at work and in return hires a doctor to personally come to her house to take care of her son so she can return to work. For a person without OCD this may seem odd, but for Melvin this is just his way of getting his life back on schedule. Carol is hesitant in accepting Melvin's offer, but her mom convinces her it's a gift she cannot refuse. Melvin thinks his actions are only benefiting him, but he has changed Carol's life by devoting himself to somebody else that he cares for.Melvin does a precise job in demonstrating what a person with obsessive compulsive personality acts like. He distances himself from everybody by compulsively acting out in a manner that in return nobody would want to associate them selves with, except for Carol. He is obsessed with the number of times he washes his hands, switches his lights on and off, and when he packs. Although Melvin mentions in the movie that he has OCD and could take medication that would help him, the movie implies to the general audience that he gets better because he falls in love and wants to change for Carol. He started showing compassion for others prior to him mentioning that he started taking the medication. Overall I think the movie showed the qualities of the disorder, but I don't think the treatment part of it was accurate.",,Anonymous,Romance
As Good As It Gets,"It's a really good movie, I don't know why, but the movies of the 90s have always been good for me, so the movies of the 90s make us feel those emotions, we are human, let's watch the movie, it's a good movie.Movie, I already said that. It's a movie you should take the time to watch. Jack Nicholson is an actor that I like very much, he is an actor that I know with his crazy and different roles
(of course, I mean crazy in a different sense than normal people :))
Let's talk about the movie itself, it is a complete movie.Comedy and drama movie. It is a very beautiful movie, Carol Connelly's role impressed me a lot, the reason is that she is a very strong woman, because she is the only woman.She takes care of her family alone and even takes care of her children.Nowadays, some women cannot even take care of themselves. Anyway, I liked Carlo. Let's talk about the character of Simon. I am not gay, bisexual, heterosexual, or someone who is interested in these distinctions.I believe everyone has their own lifestyle, but to me Homos are people with personality.So (people with more active female hormones are more emotional, and people who approach people emotionally have difficulty communicating with them, because they have difficulty expressing their opinions, this is my personal opinion)
is it nice to watch the story itself? Of course it's watchable, my favorite part is you should have seen Melvi's face when Carlo kissed Simon. Jealousy was so clearly known :)
I laughed a lot while watching these events because I had seen them many timesAs for the character of Melvi, she always expected Carlo to love her because she was a person devoid of the feeling of love,
but she broke Carlo's heart with her thoughtless face.Carlo, but thank God Carlo understands the situation because she is a smart woman, a very good person, Malvin,

This is a great film,"I've read some reviews that say this hasn't aged well. I disagree. The foul stuff that comes from Mervyn Udall's lips are meant to be just that... foul. You hate him, sympathise with him, love him. The obsessive-compulsive disorder he suffers from shapes his every move, every thought. He is deeply offensive and totally unlovable, yet a small dog touches him and he begins the process of self-realisation. There's a tremendous act of kindness that is designed purely to get him his breakfast in the way in which he used to getting it. He starts to see things differently, relapses, struggles... it's torture but totally absorbing. Then there are the compliments... 'you make me want to be a better person' - it gets me every time. Don't be too harsh on this. Sentimentality isn't all bad. The humanity in this film is a joy to see, and the performances from the three leads (and everyone else) are truly wonderful. Some of Nicholson's facial movements, the lift of an eyebrow, slight glances... are pure magic. Helen Hunt is wonderful, as is Greg Kinnear. I recommend this film wholeheartedly.

"Helen Hunt was born on June 15th, 1963","It's no wonder, that this film is as good as it is. Directed by James L. Brooks, it is as funny as it is weird. Brooks has always surrounded himself with this kind of comedic strangeness, considering the fact that, he was pivotal in the creation of the Simpsons (1989-present). In this film he takes an angry writer, named Melvin Udall (Jack Nicholson), with an obsessive compulsive disorder, who is not good at dealing with other people. Brooks creates a romantic comedy, which involves him meeting a woman named Carol Connelly (Helen Hunt), who strangely enough, learns that he is worth being saved. Is love right around the corner? Also thrown into the mix is his neighbor, Simon Bishop (Greg Kinnear) and his boyfriend Frank Sachs (Cuba Gooding Jr.). However, it is their third roommate, Verdell the dog, that really has an impact on Melvin's life.The comedy is fresh and the story develops well, along with the character creation. It is a combination of some of the most different personalities ever. It shows how different kinds of people can sometimes have great influence on others. Some may say about Jack Nicholson's performance, that it is just Jack being Jack, but we don't care. The motive fits the crime, or in this case, the diagnosis. He channels the kind of personality that Jack can deliver on screen. It is a combination of his crazy character from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) and his treacherous dominating warlock from The Witches of Eastwick (1987). The supporting cast is perfectly matched up with him. This is one of James L. Brooks' six directorial efforts and it is a pretty good list, especially his early ones. Jack and Helen Hunt would both win the Oscar Award that year. The film was also nominated for the Best Picture Oscar, but had a Titanic (1997), loss.8.5 (B+ MyGrade) = 8 IMDB.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great,"In this film, we follow the adventures of the life of Melvin Udall, an established novelist who, despite his fame and public recognition, suffers from an obsessive disorder, combined with a profound misanthropy. That is, he is virtually a hermit, who lives confined at home and has fits of rage if forced to escape his routine or socialize with the people around him. The most regular victims of Udall's caustic and rude temper are his gay neighbor Simon, his dog Verdel, and Carol, the waitress who serves him coffee every day, always at the same table, and which he eats. Using plastic cutlery that you bring with you. Everything changes with the robbery of Simon's house: confined to a bed, wounded and broke, Simon becomes partially dependent on Melvin, who will gradually learn to do acts of kindness and generosity towards the people he has hurt.The cast is led by Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt, two proven actors, who here manage to give us two excellent performances. Personally, I thought Hunt was too young to be a love interest for Nicholson, but the fact is that they both seem to be totally at ease with the characters and also with each other. Greg Kinnerar gives us an equally mature and consistent work, in which he is assisted by Cuba Gooding Jr. And a final word for the excellent dog used in the film.Technically, it's a standard film, within most Hollywood works. It has good cinematography and editing, with good colors and a very safe pace. The scenarios used are very good, with a natural highlight for Melvin's apartment. The soundtrack fulfills its role well and there is a lot of situational comedy to make the most serious audience laugh.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Not as good as it gets, but certainly good","I didn't expect ""As Good As It Gets"" to live up to its title, and it doesn't.  The big-screen work of writer-director James L. Brooks, including the Oscar winning ""Terms of Endearment,"" has yet to match the quality of TV's ""Mary Tyler Moore Show,"" which he guided to classic status in the 70s. Nonetheless, ""As Good As It Gets"" is his best work for the big screen to date.  Jack Nicholson did not deserve his third Oscar for his role here, but, hey, he's Jack and a delight to watch even though his affliction--obsessive compulsive disorder--isn't rendered too believably (Nicholson doesn't simply avoid stepping on the cracks in the sidewalk, he rather nonchalantly DANCES around them--hardly the thing a true obsessive compulsive would do).  Helen Hunt's no-nonsense waitress is convincing, though, as is Greg Kinnear's gay artist.  There are more than enough funny lines to merit the Oscar nomination for best screenplay, and even at 144 minutes (what is this?  A James Bond movie?), it's an enjoyable ride.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Over-rated Rubbish,"I'll never understand how this movie got so many good reviews. This is nothing but bottom-of-the-barrel-stuff with a glossy Hollywood touch. It has no plot. It simply goes through a whole heap of boring stuff 3 incredibly boring characters put up with in their lives. The interplay between these 3 characters (Jack, Helen and Greg) is so false and put on nobody in their right mind could mistake it for real life. Jack is the only person who deserves some credit for his performance but he's done much better and his character is not worthy of any actor of his stature. Helen Hunt is simply appalling as the whingeing single mum. Her character is completely obnoxious and hard to have any compassion for despite the problems she is facing. When acting becomes too hard for her, she simply takes to flashing parts of her anatomy across the screen. Greg Kinnear likewise does nothing in his role and although not as annoying as Helen's waitress, still seems like he's just tacked into the story (if you'd call it that) for no apparent reason. But the thing that really drove me to hatred of this film is the ending. Jack and Helen were at each other's throats literally 2 minutes before the ending credits but they still somehow get together for a supposedly romantic and happy ending. At this stage I walked out of the cinema unable to believe what I just saw. I'll never understand the mindset of film critics when they can praise trash like ""As Good As It Gets"".

Excellent!,"I watched the film not knowing I watched it before, and I was happy that I rewatched it. I wonder why the film did not make an impact on me the first time I watched it years ago. The acting was superb, the script was excellent, and Greg Kinnear looked really gay too!The film contains humour (not just the cheap toilet humour or tripping the stairs), love & the harsh realities of life. Jack Nicholson's performance as a psychiatric patient was very convincing. It was a little bit of a pity that Cuba Gooding got such a minor role, so minor that it only served to support Jack Nicholson's joke at the beginning of the film. This is probably the only flaw of the film.",,Anonymous,Romance
"About as Good as James L. Brooks Gets, Which Isn't Bad","Another sitcom-style comedy for adults from James L. Brooks.Like all of Brooks' films, this one is well acted and written and it's always entertaining, but it's also unchallenging and cinematically uninteresting, and always feels slightly sanitized, even when it's dealing with rough topics.Jack Nicholson plays yet another version of crazy in the kind of role that his later career has been full of. Helen Hunt was hot at the moment because of ""Mad About You,"" and while it's inconceivable all these years later that she actually won an Oscar for this film, her experience in sitcom acting suits Brooks and his material well (though there's quite an ick factor in seeing her paired with someone so much older and lecherous). Greg Kinnear rounds out the principal cast as a gay artist, while Shirley Knight and Cuba Gooding Jr. appear in smaller roles.Grade: A-",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Either top or bottom,"In a way, I appreciate this flick. It's witty and warm feel good. If you can see aside the underlying themes it may strike you as brilliant, even; ""One of the best comedies ever made!"". But again, if you seek beneath the surface, it's a whole different story. So let me start: it's definitely not about prostitution as such, which you might suspect about 15-20 minutes in the movie, where a brief moment of joy for any one with a bit of consciousness, one understands the male character isn't originally interested in just having sex with the female lead, or is he? But right there we come to the point; take the direct sex out of the equation (or alternatively even boost it if you will) and suddenly this comedy could easily been turned to a drama in tunes of whatever was still going on in US about few decades ago. This movie, without its comedy, could easily have gotten a couple of Nominations if it was to be placed hundred or so years back in time and the female character changed into an afro American person. Just take out the wits. And make no mistake, I'm white myself, but this whole scene makes a mockery out of all comedy this film represents.

A Quirky and Complex Exercise in Acting,"It was very difficult to sit down and enjoy this film, in spite of the fact that I've enjoyed other films by each of the stars.The viewer is required to spend so much time paying attention to all the details in the hopes of getting a handle on the storyline, that I never quite cared if the characters in the film did anything, much less shared romantic or insightful moments.Credit must go to Helen Hunt, Jack Nicholson, and Greg Kinnear, since their performances were very good.  But that's just it, they were so busy trying to act their parts, that they weren't given the chance to convey their character to the audience in depth.I myself don't enjoy movies that are merely demonstrations of acting ability, so I did not enjoy this film all that much.

One of the worst films of 1997,As Good As It Gets has on of the most unbelievable endings ever in film. The only funny moment in the film is the beginning. The rest of the film  is surprisingly dark.

As Bad As It Gets,"Okay, not literally.  It's not as bad as it gets.  But it comes pretty darn close.  You could easily say this film had the 'Titanic' effect on me... you know, where a lot of people turn against the film for winning so many awards.  But here's my problem... it really wasn't a good film when I first saw it.  What you have here is essentially a two-hour long sitcom... one you want to end after half an hour.  But it doesn't... it keeps going.We are introduced into a story that seems to have been going on for three or four seasons, er... years, and the connections between them all are never quite distinct.  The characters are never fully developed because James L. Brooks thinks he can release these cut-outs onto us and get away with it. For the most part, he's succeeded.  He's received a warm welcome from many, many people.  But not me.This is just putrid.  One wonders how this one got nominated for Best Picture, when The Sweet Hereafter was infinitely better.  In fact, Atom Egoyan, the director of that great film, was nominated for Best Director, while James L. Brooks was not.  Thankfully, this meant As Good As It Gets wouldn't win.  But it won for Best Actress and Best Actor, and this just completely astonished me.  The hype over Helen Hunt is almost unbearable.  I love Mad About You, and I love her character.  But every single movie she's done since has just been that character with a different problem.  Twister: Mad About You with a twist.  As Good As It Gets: Mad About You with an ill child.  Even Mad About You is approaching the limits of which I can take, as Hunt won the Emmy for Best Actress purely on her Oscar win.  It amazes me that the Academy, a group of selected people who watch the performances and decide, chose Hunt over every other performance, all infinitely better. Kate Winslet was great, but either Helena Bonham Carter or Judi Dench should have won.  I doubt most Academy members even saw that movie.  Thankfully, Hunt even acknowledged Dench's loss (although, I think she secretly thought she deserved it).  Best Actor... JACK NICHOLSON?  Are you insane?  I mean, he's won before.  And he's won for doing this performance.  I think the Academy felt bad for not giving it to him for Chinatown, and so they awarded it to him again.  The REAL best?  Either Peter Fonda or Robert Duvall, both incredible in their performances.  Jack Nicholson was doing a cliche of a character, and he won.  And why wasn't Leonardo DiCaprio nominated?  He didn't deserve to win, but he deserved to be nominated.  I don't necessarily like the guy, but as an actor, he's one of the best.I don't normally hate a movie for winning awards, but this is one of those rare exceptions.  Undeserving of every nomination and award it received, As Good As It Gets becomes one of the most annoying films in recent memory.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""Sell crazy someplace else. We're all stocked up here.""","FILM: 8.0
In my inaugural viewing of the 1997 film As Good As It Gets, I was treated to a masterclass in character portrayal by Jack Nicholson. He takes on the role of a raging misanthrope, a character who radiates disdain for everything around him. Yet, as the narrative unfolds, it becomes apparent that his abrasiveness might just be a shield for an avoidant personality, a mechanism to protect himself from the complexities of human connection.Director James L. Brooks, along with the talented cast, orchestrates a plot that forces Nicholson's character out of his solitary existence and into the realm of human interaction. The improbable transformation becomes semi-believable through the adept storytelling and convincing performances.The chemistry between Nicholson and Helen Hunt is a standout, with their characters expertly drawn in the script. Greg Kinnear, while delivering an impressive performance, finds himself playing second fiddle to the dynamic interplay between Nicholson and Hunt.As Good As It Gets doesn't rely on visual effects; instead, it grounds itself deeply in the performances and narrative. The film skillfully avoids the need for flashy gimmicks, letting the characters and their interactions take center stage.While the conclusion adheres to typical romantic comedy schmaltz, the preceding events, coupled with the stellar performances, make it forgivable. Overall, the film earns its stripes with an engaging storyline, well-drawn characters, and a balance of wit and heart that keeps the audience invested throughout. With Nicholson leading the charge, As Good As It Gets stands out as an enjoyable, positive experience.FORMAT: Blu-rayVIDEO: 8.0

I tried.,"I tried to like this as much as everyone told me I had to. I came into the film thinking that not liking this movie condemned me to be lumped into the group of people who only watch Adam Sandler movies. I left it thinking that it's the people who watch Adam Sandler movies who looked at this and saw a work of art.First of all, let me say this: it's not that bad. It's a fairly well made movie. But it shouldn't be an Oscar-worthy film, it shouldn't be the 55th best movie of all time (according to IMDB voters) and it's not worth all the hype. Helen Hunt's and Nicholson's performances are overrated-in fact, if anyone deserved an Oscar for this film, in my mind it's Greg Kinnear.Let me defend my statement that Nicholson's performance is overrated. I have the feeling, and this was confirmed by others who told me about the movie, was that the idea of Melvin Udall was that as you gained insight on his condition, you were supposed to feel sorry for him, or at least root for him to get the girl. Nicholson supposedly opened the mind of someone inflicted with OCD so we could understand. Well, as much as I love Nicholson, I hated Melvin Udall. The longer the movie went on, the more I rooted for Helen Hunt's character to just move away and not leave a forwarding address. My read of Nicholson's character was not, first and foremost, a sick man: it was a total b******.Now, I know the idea of his character was an anti-hero who finds redemption. But I couldn't root for him, so he wasn't an anti-hero; what's more, at the end he wasn't redeemed-in fact he was rewarded for bad behavior. (I'm sorry, but OCD patients are not required to be offensive. Some of the behavior, such as locking the door and bringing one's own silverware, are true to OCD people. But finding any offensive remark to make about another person has nothing to do with OCD and everything to do with just being a caustic person.) He was still the same jerk, he just found someone willing to put up with it. Hooray for him.What I'm basically trying to say is that the movie didn't work for me-I feel that it fell short of its goal.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Another kind of romance,"Although it is more or less an exaggeration in the context of the character arc, this movie made me recall the ending of a famous quote by Carl Jung: ,,within every beast, a saint"". And even if Mr. Udall (Jack Nicholson's character) is never really getting that close to the threshold of holiness, the change that happens in his character across the movie is surreal. I would even classify it as a tad unrealistic, but all in all ''As Good as It Gets'' is undoubtedly a depiction of the protagonist's tumultuous way to a romance in relationship to himself.Apart from the main character, I would also like to praise Helen Hunt's acting.

Simply Excellent,"Of the 900 or so films that I have rated, this film is one of 46 to receive a 9/10 or higher from me. It is serendipitous, laugh-out-loud funny, deeply sad, and painfully relatable. And the best part? It nails all of this while always feeling natural and effortless.The story follows a depressed gay artist, a single mother with a sick child, and a scrooge with OCD. The plot often seems directionless. But I believe this actually works to the film's benefit, as one's life is rarely clear. Instead, the story takes it's time to organically develop with a pacing that is spot-on. I was captivated from start to finish.Character growth and plot progression feel truly believable and earned.

I could watch it again and again every few years and would love it every time. It is such a good movie because the story is very charming; it takes place in NY city but unlike some boring storyline you might expect where a prince charming rescuing a poor woman, it's about a man who has OCD starts to show human sides of him even though he could appear so rude/harsh sometimes, he actually has very kind sides to him. And everyone/everything he touches becomes happier by helping them and him being helped in return, even though he suffers from OCD (a mental illness). The saying of what goes around comes around stays true in this movie, and it is just like a real life, be kind to others the life would be kind to you back, which isn't practiced by very rich people (especially in the US), but it stays true in this movie :D (and the main character is a wealthy author played by Jack Nicholson).

What If This Is As Good As It Gets?,"If what you need right now is a heartwarming Jack Nicholson flick, then As Good As It Gets is exactly what it says (barring the last detail + romance).I actually came to AGAIG on the suggestion of a client who struggles with OCD, and who described her feeling of joy, when, in 1997, a film finally depicted someone with OCD up-close and personal. This is hilarious, because Jack's character at the outset is probably one of the last people someone would want as a poster child for their cause.As someone who just got a new apartment, AGAIG reminded me that even if I get into occasional squabbles with my new neighbors, things could be worse. They're not hardened, bigoted authors who are throwing my dog into garbage chutes. I don't have to coax them out of their own misery in order to make them aware of the existence of my emotions.Really, very fun to watch.

"""What if this is as good as it gets?""","As an avid movie buff, I have witnessed countless extraordinary performances on the silver screen, but Jack Nicholson's tour de force in ""As Good as It Gets"" took my admiration to new heights. This beloved 1997 romantic comedy stands as a true masterpiece, and Nicholson's portrayal of the cantankerous and deeply flawed Melvin Udall seizes every scene with mesmerizing brilliance.From the opening frame to the closing credits, Nicholson commands the screen effortlessly, bringing to life a character so complex and layered that one can't help but be spellbound. Melvin Udall is a repugnant and deeply insecure individual, boasting an array of obsessive-compulsive quirks and an unfiltered tongue that spares nobody from his sarcasm-laden insults. Yet, surprisingly, Nicholson imbues this detestable curmudgeon with such charm, wit, and vulnerability that audiences can't help but fall under his outrageous spell.With each line delivery, Nicholson showcases his unparalleled talent. His comedic timing is impeccable, effortlessly finding the perfect balance between hilarity and empathetic introspection. The manner in which he weaves biting sarcasm, dark humor, and moments of subtle tenderness is nothing short of genius. Nicholson's authentic portrayal expertly displays Melvin's underlying emotional struggles, making him a true anti-hero that we can't help but root for.Additionally, the chemisty between Nicholson's Melvin and his on-screen love interest, played flawlessly by Helen Hunt, elevates this film to incredible heights. Their interactions are filled with genuine passion, palpable tension, and soul-stirring exchanges that make every scene they share an absolute joy to watch. The dynamic between Melvin and Carol showcases Nicholson's versatility, as he transitions seamlessly from lighthearted repartee to soul-stirring moments of profound tenderness.Moreover, Nicholson's ability to convey subtle nuances is unparalleled. Through subtle facial expressions, body language, and eye movements, he brilliantly portrays Melvin's internal struggle with his loneliness and fear of opening himself up to love. It is a testament to Nicholson's immense talent that he can convey so much with such understated and nuanced acting.The depth and authenticity of Nicholson's performance can also be attributed to the masterful writing by Mark Andrus and James L. Brooks, which allows him to explore the multifaceted layers of Melvin. Nicholson seizes every opportunity, breathing life into this beautifully written character, creating one of the most memorable performances of his illustrious career.In conclusion, ""As Good as It Gets"" is an extraordinary film made exceptional by Jack Nicholson's magnetic performance. His embodiment of Melvin Udall is a tour de force that captivates from start to finish. Nicholson's ability to traverse the fine line between comedy and emotional resonance is unparalleled, and his portrayal is a shining example of the power of cinematic acting. If there's one film that showcases the incredible talent of Jack Nicholson, ""As Good as It Gets"" is undoubtedly it. A perfect 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Now what about the dog Verdell who too has shown good emotions and responded pretty naturally. Now, done with performances appraisal, now lets rip the movie with its further study.Screenplay is lethargic rather placid I must say and its a long drawn out for nearly more than 2 hours to convey a point and to express a feeling. Now, situations had to be fabricated to squeeze such feelings out of the characters and this is where I did not like it, like the road trip to understand each other or the act to have a doctor see Carol's son. These are a few overboard things in which is otherwise a pretty decent film.The direction is not so much there and rather unappreciable in adding up unwanted scenes here and there and making it a bit messy than needed. Now, having said all the above, dialog by Mark Andrus and James L Brooks is outstanding and thats what sets this film engaging though scattered and long. All other departments are just fine and have done their job rather commendably.I give it a 3/5 a good one for sure just and supreme acting and good dialog makes it a worth romantic comedy. I wish our Telugu or even Hindi Films are more subtle and simple like this one.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
As Good As IT Gets 👍,"One of the funniest, most ingenious and endearing films I have ever seen. And believe me, I've seen them all....

A masterpiece. I love it and it makes me happy!We have a well-designed film, with authentic characters, a varied story and intelligent humor. Quite simply created a masterpiece.

Great acting accompanied by an insipid plot,"Great acting by Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt, and that's pretty much it. The plot doesn't bring anything special or remarkable to the movie, it just bores you during the major part of it.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Way over-rated,"Can't understand why people are so crazy about this one.  I cannot understand it.  Kinnear was trying too hard, Hunt not enough, as usual Nicholson was in his own movie...never felt any connection between me and the characters, among the characters themselves...you know things are not what they should be when you go to the dog for reaction shots.

A Classy Soap-Comedy,"I am amazed I kind of liked this modern-day soap opera-romance with the usual Liberal twists and sometimes-annoying characters. Yet, despite the annoyances, the story was very interesting, the acting was superb and Jack Nicholson combined both to his make character the most interesting of them all. He had some memorable lines. The story was involving, meaning it was tough to put down once you started. Also, for a film that featured the story a lot more than any scenery, it was well-filmed.I did have a few complaints but they are fairly minor, such as too many OMGs and a little too worldliness at times, but nothing's perfect. For today's usual group of comedies which tend to be on a sleazy side, this was had some class to it.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
As Good As They Get!,"""How do you write women so well?"" asks a flattered young lady after reading one of the man's sappy romantic paperback novels and recognizing his face on the street. He turns around, looks at her and says, ""I think of a man, and I take away reason and accountability.""The secret of ""As Good As It Gets"" is its unconventional, and often times irreverent, view of the entire romance scene. It is centered solely on two people, Melvin (Jack Nicholson) and Carol (Helen Hunt). Melvin writes those corny romance novels you always manage to find tucked in between the fiction and non-fiction area of your local bookstore. You know, the kind that little old ladies like to read through at an incredible speed in an ill-fated hope to re-live moments of their past.Melvin is a bit like Paul Sheldon, from Rob Reiner's ""Misery,"" although I'm sure if he had been found by a murderous fan he would have been killed early on--he's incredibly blunt and annoying. He probably would have told Annie Wilkes what he thought of her from the get-go, not hesitating any more than he has to.Melvin has obsessive-compulsive disorder, which basically means he goes through strange routines every time he does something, whether it means locking a door twice or not stepping on the cracks of a sidewalk (we all do that, sometimes). I recently read a new Steve Martin novella about a man with obsessive-compulsive disorder, and it reminded me very much of ""As Good As It Gets"" and the Melvin character. Melvin is such a wacko that he pushes his gay neighbor's dog down the laundry chute after he finds it wandering around the hallway.The gay man is played by Greg Kinnear. His name is Simon, and he has a small little dog he likes to call ""precious."" Simon is an artist, but when a band of kids wreck his apartment and beat him up, he is left with the realization that he hasn't enough money to keep his flat, and his boyfriend (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) may break up with him.But the biggest worry of all is...what to do with his precious?Frank, played by Gooding Jr., decides to give the dog to Melvin--who refuses at first but is left without any option but to obey. He soon achieves a certain subtle love for the beast, and when Simon has healed and comes back for the dog, it doesn't even want to leave. It even starts to develop nasty habits--like avoiding cracks in the sidewalk.Meanwhile, a troubled single mother and a part-time waitress, Carol is constantly nagged by Melvin. Only she can deliver him food. Only she can take his order. Only she can kick him out of the restaurant. Mistaking this for some sort of sexual craving, she tells Melvin flat-out that she will never sleep with him. He doesn't seem to care. That had never even crossed his mind.The fact is that Melvin is insufferably lonely. He likes to act as though he likes to be lonely, but the truth is that his loneliness is something he loathes. He would love to reach out and gain some friends--but he's too proud to humble himself in such a way. We all know people like Melvin--he just takes himself to a new extreme.Melvin is surely one of the great screen characters of all time, ranking up there with Raymond ""Rain Man"" Babbitt and Forrest Gump as some of the most unique and likable inventions to ever grace the big screen. Nicholson presents his character in an especially effective way--at first he seems gruff, then he seems strange, then his soft side is revealed, and he slowly becomes the likable mean guy who lives upstairs and likes to try and kill neighbors' dogs.Hunt won the Oscar for her work in ""As Good As It Gets,"" but it was truly Nicholson who deserved it.Regardless of all this, ""As Good As It Gets"" still stands alone as one of the cleverest romantic comedies of all time, and certainly one that both sexes can agree on. The film features some of the most memorable lines ever written on paper, the majority of them all coming from the lips of Melvin Udall, perfectly spoken by a typical gruff Jack Nicholson. They all come off as utterly hilarious and convincing. (Nicholson: ""How old are you? If I would guess by your eyes, I'd say you're fifty."" Hunt: ""If I went by your eyes I'd say you were kind."")This is the type of new-age romantic comedy that rivals the greatness of ""When Harry Met Sally"" or ""Sleepless in Seattle."" It's founded in its characters, their lives, their interaction, and how they learn to overcome their own personal obstacles and moral obligations. This film carries all the Autumn-time sweetness and cleverness of a Rob Reiner comedy, and all the lightness of a Frank Capra movie. It's a delightful blend of comedy and romance, and the type of redefining genre motion picture that ""When Harry Met Sally"" was eight years prior.What a perfect, delightful movie.4.5/5 stars.John Ulmer",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
The finest compliments in all of film history,"This movie has a few icky bits of humor but its somewhat overlooked for a fantastic script and acting that's more suited to the irony that prevails most films of today. Yet, it is made in a style that resembles 80s and 90s rom-coms.I love it. I hate Udall and would probably be one of those people cheering as he is forced to leave the restaurant, but humanizing him was quite a feat.",,Anonymous,Romance
As Good as it Gets,"Greg Kinnear (""Simon"") finds himself in hospital after a brutal bit of gay-bashing, and that means that his small, yappie, dog (""Jill"") has to be entrusted to his rather curmudgeonly, author neighbour ""Melvin"" (Jack Nicholson) - not exactly the most loving and obvious of choices. Now this latter guy isn't exactly flavour of the month - indeed it's really only waitress ""Carol"" (Helen Hunt) who will put up with his selfish and churlish behaviour. When her young son becomes ill, she has to take time off and ""Melvin"" finds himself truly alone - with no breakfast! The solution, well all three of them take a trip and, well, you can imagine that with Nicholson and Hunt on super form here, Kinnear clearly thriving as their foil, and a screenplay from James L. Brooks at his best, we get an highly entertaining and earthy hybrid of comedy and the most unlikely semblance of romance as the three realise that there is so much more to life than any realised was possible. It's a wee bit long, but the characterisations are rich and engaging and there is a genuine chemistry on screen between all three - and the dog! It's a feel good film that has some serious undercurrents but those are dealt with in a fashion that is potent but not preachy and provides us with food-for-thought wrapped in a smile. Definitely worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Jack you makes my 20 bucks valuable!,"Honestly at beginning I spent my 20 bucks for Helen, she is beautiful, elegant and adorable. In addition, Hunt got Oscar via this movie. However, after watching it, I think I am more lucky than before when I only went for Hunt but Jack. It is perfect for me to pay money getting a film of which both the leading actor and actress make me excited.Initially, I don't like Jack, as the most time I saw him is not in movies but on the first row of Staples Center where is the host court of L.A. Lakers. His crazy applause for Kobe Bryant annoyed as I don't like the showoffer - No.24 of Lakers. However after this movie one thing I clearly understand is you can't ignore the merits by the defects of a person. Also the guy Jack playing also make me sick, but this guy gets something making me feel good as well. Once again, it gets proof that the annoying guy also gets merits.The movie helps the communities create a harmony neighbourhood. How can you image that an annoying neighbour like Mr Udall can find his true love and the precious friendship. That's it people must get some merits no matter how badass they are. And another important thing is people are changing, so please do not judge them with your old prejudice.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Like a steak that arrives over cooked but still ends up being absolutely delicious. You get the classic Nicholson marvellous spin that he puts in all of his rolls, and Helen Hunt is just a tremendous actor, everything she does is so believable you forget she's playing a role. The story itself is SO well thought out; everything has a reason for being in the script and all the questions and lose ends are answered and addressed. There's all these tensions in the movie and they all end up being properly resolved. It's as romantic and as clever and as funny and as good as it gets.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
More offensive stereotypes,"I love Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt.  And I love the part of the moviethat is about them only.  But the gay characters have got to go.  As aGLBT person, I was totally offended by the conventional gay stereotypes.Could Cuba Gooding Jr BE any more fey?  Seriously, I've had it with gaycharacters in film and on stage who are sensitive and somewhat troubleartists who act as mere conduits for the straight love story.  The fact thatSimon Bishop cared so much about his face after he was assaulted alsobothered me.  The most troubling is the subtext of his artistic expression.Drawing attractive, potentially sexual, young men leads to danger, physicaland emotional harm, and maybe death.  But drawing someone of theopposite sex, such as the scene where he draws Carol, is liberating, andunlocks the secret of his artistic self.  In the end, Bishop gets to be alone, and another gorgeous, young woman hooks up with a scraggly, old man.Yes, I hope everyone has noticed that this film just wouldn't work inHollywood if a beautiful young man hooks up with some old hag.

As Good As It Gets,"James L. Brooks' mammoth flop HOW DO YOU KNOW (2010) has again put his prestigious laurels of an Academy-winning director into a precipice, after his grotesquely mawkish SPANGLISH (2004), spanning his entire 30 years career, he has only directed 6 films so far, half of which are mediocre drosses (said two films plus I'LL DO ANYTHING 1994), lucky AS GOOD AS IT GETS is not among them, and has truly extracted the top form from its stars Oscar-winning stars and Verdell the little doggie.The ""impossible pair"" setting is always a most common yet compelling stunt in a rom-com, while usually male plays a dominant part, and female part takes some moral advantage to keep the balance as equally as possible to avoid any sexism accusations. So in this storyline, Jack Nicholson's unmarried compulsive writer resembles Shelton Cooper from THE BIG BANG THEORY, maybe we could divine Shelton's senior life like that, his own routine cannot be breached and he maintains nonchalant towards the people and happenings around him, Helen Hunt's single-mother waitress with an ailed kid, has the worst case scenario at hand, but clearly is the best woman in the planet with all the carefully-embellished merits, could be even the muse for the destitute artist, which can be a smart move to get approve from the most of the female demography. Then a third factor is Greg Kinnear's gay artist, which may seem to be the weakest among the trinity, but as the representative perspective from the minority group, his mayhem serves as a more evocative agent to be viewed as the rosy prospect of gay right even in today's time.The performances are marvelous, for Nicholson, maybe not his career-best, but suffices all the accolade he received for his wacky but arresting antics, and his third Oscar win is fairly acceptable; Hunt is on the other hand, adding more intimate revelation and vigor to her ostensibly soppy role, I have no grudge towards her win (but my pick is still Helena Bonham Carter from THE WINS OF THE DOVE 1997); then Kinnear, whose career-best has emerged too fast and a comeback seems to be a rather long shot now.Virtually all the achievements should be owed to its script, very resourceful and operative, as for the director work, Mr. Brooks' journeyman dexterity has no mistakes but surely is not a novelty in this case.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Watching this in 2021 I'm shocked.,"It's clear a man wrote this film. As a woman, I'm not sure why anyone would fall for the misogynistic deeply disrespectful comments made in this movie by Jack Nicholson. His character continuously insults and undermines the female lead and she somehow finds it endearing. The only part I agree with is when she screams ""why can't I find a boyfriend who isn't crazy"" and her mother says ""that doesn't exist."" Only a man in 1997 would think that Jack's character would ever get the get-or that this is a romantic comedy!! I was genuinely uncomfortable and confused during the entirety of this film. Helen Hunt's actions and affectations toward Jack Nicholson make no coherent sense. One second she finds him repulsive and awful and the next she's throwing herself at him. Nearly every ""compliment"" he paid her was a compliment to himself. The writing is stereotypical, one dimensional and lazy. Thank God trash like this is no longer made.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

The movie belongs to Helen Hunt,"Helen Hunt is brilliant in this movie. As good as Judi Dench and Helena Bonham Carter were in their Oscar-nominated roles of 1997, Hunt was every inch their equal. Her role was by far the most difficult of the film.Nicholson basically just played himself, and did a few obsessive-compulsive tics every now and again for variety. If you're a fan of his, you've seen this before.Greg Kinnear did an okay job, but his character was largely ignored by the screenwriters -- I never felt as though I were allowed inside his mind the way I was allowed inside the mind of Hunt's character. The only way we even know that his character is gay is because everyone keeps talking about how ""gay"" he is -- it's a character trait written in to annoy Nicholson's character; he could have been a saintly Jew or a saintly black man. The fact that he's a saintly gay person is largely inconsequential.But...Hunt's performance is easily worth the price of the rental.

"Talking' about everything upon nothing. If this has been a Sit-com series, couldn't have seen the second season.","A telly-familiar face from the production crew of the Simpsons series, James L. Brooks, directs a 5-year old screenplay and rakes up a pretentious cast of actors. The original script has been written by Mark Andrus in 1992, and has been developed differently from its origin in 5 years time by the director James L. Brooks. The length of the time passed in between this period has surely deprived the efficiency of its editing. Hence, we shouldn't have expected a good relation between the storyline and the plot. Thankfully, James L. Brooks hasn't even put a plot on view. So we get a simple sit-com entirely tied to the actors' contribution in this comedy/family movie.When a movie goes nowhere via its point, comedy is the easiest cure to make it find a way. Consider a horror movie, you watch it but you don't feel any fear; in order to be meant for something, a horror can be cured with some comedy, that way can it only become interesting. On the other hand, comedy is the hardest cure to make a point-lost movie find a way; 'cause you gotta have Oscar worthy performances at least to make it worth to watch. As Good As It Gets is the worst movie of 1997 with its technical features:Editing is the worst, screenplay is a mess, no camera aspects, no successful sound editing or mixing(no one has no idea how can a puppy murmur through a garbage chute and can be heard inside an apartment unit), art decoration has zero achievement(that's why it's a sit-com) ; at the same time As Good As It Gets is at its best for 4 great performances: Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson at the leading, Greg Kinnear and Cuba Gooding Jr. at the supporting. If a Hollywood movie is just leaning upon its cast, why watching Hollywood then?As Good As It Gets absolutely deserved its 2 actor-based Oscars and in total 3 actor-based nominations. The other 4 nominations are a fine cods-wallop!Priggery and meticulousness are very well staged by Nicholson, playing a quirky character at the culminating point of capturing viewers' attention, reminding us of Bart Simpson at age 60; especially with his style of walking crab-wise on the street. Helen Hunt plays and heartens a mother of a sick child within bearing of her vicissitude of fortune at one side, bearing Jack Nicholson as the menace of her emotional argument at the opposite side. Cuba Gooding Jr. is a self-assertive individual and the only person in the movie who can deliver a replication to Nicholson. Additionally, Greg Kinnear is the gingerbread of the movie playing the beaten and robbed gay artist. Because each one of the actors has a complete different view of life, the non-plotted script magnetizes us growing our curiosity on if they ever roll up like a hedgehog together.As Good As It Gets made me want to watch Seinfeld. Based upon same idea, to play along with each other, Seinfeld is much much more better than this one of its analogous.

As Good as it gets couldn't get any better,"Melvin Udall is an obsessive-compulsion author who writes romance novels, and who is rude and obnoxious to everyone he comes into contact with. This includes his gay neighbor Simon. When Simon is hospitalized after being robbed and attacked in his apartment, Melvin finds himself reluctantly looking after his dog, he begins to soften and develops a more caring side. Especially towards Carol, the long-suffering waitress who frequently serves him at the local diner he goes to. But when she is forced to leave work to care for her sick son, Melvin finds himself unable to eat his breakfast and makes a surprising move that Carol would have never expected.On the face of it, Melvin Udall is an inveterate misanthrope who is as dysfunctional as he is both hostile and cranky towards everyone. Not someone you'd expect movie audiences to find themselves warming to or rooting for. After all, Melvin is an obsessive-compulsive writer of romantic fiction who is racist, xenophobic, anti-Semitic, homophobic, and misogynistic. But somehow James L. Brooks's magnum opus, As Good as It Gets manages to do precisely that. Thanks in part to an Oscar-winning turn from Jack Nicholson as the movie's obsessive sourpuss. Proving once again that Nicholson's talent is not only as a dramatic actor but a comedic one. In the hands of a lesser actor, or a lesser writer for that matter the character of Melvin would not elicit any sympathy or any measure of pathos.Much of the movie's charm and warmth comes from Melvin's sharp barbs, which come chiefly at the expense of Greg Kinnear's Simon, the gay neighbor whose dog finds himself on the receiving end of Melvin's more mischievous nature. It's this dynamic between him and Carol the Waitress, played by Helen Hunt who we see early on carrying the weight of the world on her back. Having to contend with her son's acute asthma, providing the crux behind the movie. When Simon is hospitalized it's Melvin who becomes the unlikely miracle in disguise and steers him towards the movie's story arc of redemption. And to say it's a rocky road would be an understatement. In the grand tradition of some of the best comedy characters being those who are not necessarily the nicest of human beings (think Basil Fawlty for example), there is an element of tragedy to him. Like Jerry Lewis once said, there is no line between tragedy and comedy. And Melvin exemplifies this beautifully. But as before stated, there is hope for Melvin, who has lived a reclusive existence in his apartment and has resigned himself to believing his life as it stands is truly as good as it's ever going to get. It's the relationships that he begins to find himself developing between both Simon and Carol that offer him a shining beacon of light.Nicholson brings humanity and sympathy to Melvin, in a role that could have easily been very one note. And he's matched with winning performances from both Hunt and Kinnear, the former once again displaying her knack for comic bantering in the U. S. sitcom Mad About You. On paper, As Good as It Gets could sound like another generic comedy, with the relationship between its romantic leads getting off to a rocky start before each of them invariably falls for one another. And while it does bow to convention it does so without ever feeling hackneyed.The lead trio of Nicholson, Hunt, and Kinnear are complimented by some excellent support which includes Cuba Gooder Jr., Yeardley Smith, (the voice of Lisa Simpson), and veteran actress Shirley Knight as Carol's mother. Making As Good as It Gets is a winning feel-good comedy that will leave you with a smile on your face long after the inevitable fade to black.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Jack Nicholson does his best, but the script is atrocious - it sets up a series of black-humour situations and tops them off with typically cheesy har-har Hollywood punchlines. I winced all the way through. For example: Greg Kinnear's character goes through a series of horrible ordeals: he is beaten up for being gay, his relationship falls apart, his career has ground to a halt and he is facing bankruptcy in addition to being in considerable pain from his injuries. He tries his parents for help - they reject him. Where does the gag go from here? Even his cute little dog chooses a stranger over him! HA! Big laughs from the audience - watch the mutilated gay guy lose everything he loves! Now that's comedy.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

I had to see this movie a few times to really get what it's about,"James Brooks' humor and narrative is never simple.This movie is about the male vs. female psyche. It's not just a story about an obsessive compulsive guy with a gay, destitute neighbor who falls in love with a NY waitress.It's about the battle men have with themselves as their organized, logical minds are forced to function in a world of feelings and human female interaction. I can't help but think of the episode of Star Trek where Kirk is separated into a ""Nice"" Kirk and an ""Evil"" Kirk.Men are for the most part- logical, straightforward, goal oriented beings. The Jack Nicholson character represents the male mind in it's most raw and blunt form. It's this very same form that is forced to re-mold itself as something less straightforward in order to obtain what its ultimate goal is... namely, the love of a good woman.To me, the title ""As Good As it Gets"" refers to the idea that compromises need to be made from our default manner of thinking if we're ever going to find the love we so desperately seem to need. There's no such thing as a perfect relationship... it takes work and sacrifice. It's as good as it gets- yet absolutely worth going after.As for the production characteristics- the movie is a gem. Helen Hunt & Jack Nicholson are sublime in the way they make their characters rich and real to an unprecedented extent in movie history. There's a scene between the two at dinner where Nicholson compliments Hunt at her request that is pure gold. The writing, performances and directing throughout the film is of the highest caliber to be found anywhere.I wasn't a big fan when I saw it years ago. Now I realize why there was a big deal made of it at the time. You need to read between the lines in this one- to see how beautiful of a walk through humankind it is.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Not perfect, but still damn good","It's too long and I'm not sure I buy the eleventh-hour romance ... But! There's plenty of goodness here.For one, I absolutely love Helen Hunt; her personality, warmth, struggle; she crushes it. Also, the writers plumb the depths of bigotry for comedy; Jack Nicholson will probably shock you, but man, some of the things he comes out with! At one point, Harold Ramis shows up, which is always a high point.This is definitely a ""feelings"" movie, and I think that's James L. Brooks' real win here. How devastating it is to see the cruel hand dealt to Greg Kinnear; the fortitude and desperation of an overworked mom; the universal need for human kindness; hell, just the desire for Nicholson's character to redeem himself (this happens often).It may not work perfectly as a romantic-dramedy, but the performances are incredible -- and *that* is worth seeing.Also, go to Hell, Skeet Ulrich.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Superb acting with witty, sharp dialog.","A story of messed up real life people trying to find a happy hollywood ending, almost real life for a change.Nicholson is fantastic getting all the quick witted replies and comments that he deserves, and Hunt provides a fantastic lead opposite him and the pair blend beautifully together in their scenes.Gooding and Kinnear provide strong support, but it's Kinnear who outshines Gooding, why haven't we seen him in more prominent roles before?The film can get a bit sappy in places, but it always brings it back to reality with a bang.Definately a go see, for all those Victor Meldrew types.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"...which, as it turns out, isn't bad at all","What does a single mother, a writer(neurotic, of course... aren't they all?) and a gay artist have in common? All three appear in this movie, focused on their relationship. With both stars earning an Oscar each, and Greg being nominated and deserving to win, this has phenomenal acting. Well, the kid is arguably over-the-top at points. Apart from him, the performances are powerful and convincing. Hunt, Nicholson(especially) and Kinnear all use both their charm and their skill to great effect. As far as being a romantic comedy, this isn't as clichéd as most of those are. This is a marvelous drama, if there is a bit of sap(don't get me wrong, it is genuinely sweet at times), and not everyone will agree with L. Brooks' indictment of the US health care system(the social commentary is tough to argue with, though). The dialog is sharp and witty. This can be quite funny, if a handful of gags and jokes try too hard, and some will find the depiction of OCD offensive(I personally don't think it ought to be played for laughs, the way it is here). The plot isn't bad. There is a bit of disturbing content, a little vague sexual content(all visual or hinted at) and brief, brutal violence in this. I recommend this to fans of the genres. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

sick relationship of a sick man - NOT a love story!!,"Ignoring my initial disgust of the usual 50+ year old man w/ the 30 yr. old woman... I hope no one thinks this is a romance!

[Not to mention you can't cure obsessive/compulsive behavior with love - even with the pills he was taking that's probably not enough.

The movie also tells us how some little things in our life are so important and can give us so much happiness. How our little kindness can make someone's life a lot more easier.,,Anonymous,Romance
It'll get better Melvin,"I have always loved this movie. It's a romantic comedy without too much of the sappy love stuff and an overload of the sarcastic, cynical, funny stuff. Jack Nicholson is fantastic as a victim of OCD and love. Every line he spits out is quotable. He's somehow charming and slimy at the same time. Every interaction he has with other characters just makes his character better. All of Melvin's interactions with Simon and Verdell are a riot. Melvin has a sweet spot with Verdell that he can't seem to have with any human, even Carol, and a critical nature towards Simon. He is so judgmental, but can't stand to have the tables turned on himself which is true to life. That's probably what I like most about this film- it's a true depiction of life, perhaps a bit dramatized, but life is never easy. People are never simple. We are all complex. We all have our OCD ticks and our sick kids, but somehow we all have other traits that make us bearable and necessary to the rest of the world. It gets better, because we can't always be low. Unless we are unwilling to change, things will go up.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Emotional, dynamic, a well-made film...","Jack Nicholson can do no wrong. The man is a veteran of the profession, and he is constantly giving a unique, dynamic personality to every character he portrays. And this film is no exception. It introduces us to some very deep, very real people, with real problems, and weaves them together in a series of events that build them up and bring them together. And through it all Nicholson retains his magic, delivering a superb portrayal of a man burdened with chronic obsessive-compulsive habits. It is a very effective film, and the acting is no less than one would expect from the likes of Nicholson and Helen Hunt. It's an honest, emotional, and often sad film with which you're bound to find yourself sympathizing. It's a strong story, strong cast, truly a dynamic film with an offbeat sense of humor that everyone is likely to enjoy. I strongly recommend you see this movie, whether with friends or family.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"So many tough problems in life, but this film makes everything look so good","As Good As It Gets (1997) :
Brief Review -So many tough problems in life, but this film makes everything look so good. I sat for almost 140 minutes without getting bored, and I feel that's the most important thing about this film. A film that doesn't bore you, makes you use the fast-forward button, and keeps you grinning for two hours is, I believe, a good film. As Good As It Gets is all about problems in life, and these are not the regular problems but very intense and depressing ones. Yet, this film makes everything look good, simple, and easy for you. Melvin is a romantic novel author suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). So, things like washing hands, walking on the road, and eating outside food anywhere aren't his things. He has a neighbor, Simon, who is gay and a painter. Melvin goes to only one restaurant and eats at only one table. Carol is the only waitress who can tolerate him. Well, she has her own problems. Her son has had asthma forever, and Simon is beaten and nearly killed, leaving him broke as medical bills overtake his income. Melvin has a change of heart and helps both, and these three start forming a new bond. Melvin and Carol fall in love, but it's difficult to confess and accept this relationship because of their own problems. As expected, it all ends well. It does get a little cheesy and slow down the line, but overall, it's a warm, nice, and heartfelt film. Jack Nicholson gives a fine performance as Melvin. He is a hateful guy, but the way Jack presents it, with the hidden guilt and self-pitying gestures, truly makes it more genuine. Helen looks beautiful when required and a bit dull and tired when needed. Greg Kinnear was good but didn't really give off any vibes of a 'gay' person. That dog and Carol's mother were adorable. Why can't I have a normal boyfriend? The mother says, ""Everybody wants that. It doesn't exist."" Maybe this entire film is about being imperfect, but in nearly perfect ways.RATING - 6.5/10*By - #samthebestest.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Some sweetness, some unpleasant stuff and characters that didnt age well","The grumpy old man who gets won over by the sweet and pretty waitress. Not the most orginal plot. Yet it does show kindnes in a slow, ""allowing the mess"" kind of way. Carol is an impressive character, standing up against her co-workers to keep serving the bitter and difficult-to-handle Melvin. Her awareness of being important in his routine is sweet to watch. The way she takes care of her child is also adorable. Melvin hower, is problematic. As the viewer you do have sympathy with him, but you learn so little about his past, its hard to actually feel with him. Where is this OCD coming from? I don't like the way it gets ""magically fixed by love"" in the film. The whole romance anyway, seeing Helen and. Jack together as an on screen couple feels wrong and slightly disgusting. Why would you let a movie like this end in a kiss? Its unncessary. I don't like how she changes her mind about him after he payed for her son's treatments. He doesn't care about the kid, he just desperately wants her and ""buys her in"". Without his money, she might have never let him close. He's still the same guy who threw a puppy down the trash shoot. Oh and by the way: i would have liked to see some answers to the boys health conditon. There should have been enough time for that in the two hours. What might him better at the end?I also dont like who Carol kisses the gay Simon and undresss in front of him. Eventough its a sweet friendship, just because he's gay, doesnt mean he's comfortable with that. Him painting her was a good scene tough. Showed that there can be intimacy and apprecciation of one's body without it being sexual.So overall, there are some good scenes, but the movie as a whole has too many badly aged ""old bitter straight white man with money"" scenes to really be enjoyable in this time and age.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

As Good as It Get defines this movie.,"Probably my most favorite movie. The only difficulty I personally have Is watching the graphic beating of Simom. But I derived a somewhat relieving observation the last time I watched it. In the middle of the furor of the horrible beating of Simon, one of the thugs said excuse me to another thug as he passed by him. I thought that was hilarious and it softened the effect for me. I have seen the movie at least twenty times and don't remember hearing that before. I was wondering if the dialog was different in subsequent released versions. The part that helps make the movie so important is Melvin defending himself to Carol. He tells her about his medicine and his new resolve to take it. She makes him want to be a better man. That humanizes his recognition of his cold logical compulsive behavior. That he wants to do something about it is a tribute to him and a challenge to everybody else.

Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt proved themselves to be deserving of those Oscars, while Greg Kinnear also gave an Oscar-deserving portrayal of Melvin's (Jack Nicholson) gay neighbor.  I love this movie so much because it shows how when people come in contact with each other, the unexpected often occurs.  The three main characters have these problems that they unsucessfully try to solve on their own, not realizing that they can help each other out.

One of my favorite quotes of this film is, ""Do you understand me, you crazy f***?""

Jack is THE MAN. Incredibly blunt yet incredibly feel good as well. Gets better over the years. Rom com classic.,"Blunt lighthearted drama, yet so endearing and incredibly feel good and funny simultaneously. Even quite romantic near the end! There arent many movies like these that can offend yet charm the viewer simultaneously. The reason why it works is Jack Nicholson. Everybody loves Jack! And this actor legend can get away with murder and still charm the heck out of us viewers.Terrific acting performances by Helen Hunt, Cuba Gooding Jr. and Greg Kinear as well. This is a full on actors movie.The story is about Jack Nicholson who plays a rich mental weirdo with an obsession for cleanliness. He is afraid of doorknobs and of any fysical contact with other humans. He is a total control freak and anything out of the ordinary freaks him out. And this is exactly what is gonna happen to him, he loses control and then he starts noticing that he TOO does need other people for love and support.I have said it before, I will say it again, what is so endearing about this picture is its charming way in which it offends every person, race, religion or gender. Gotta see it, to believe that being a true *sshole can be incredibly funny and even endearing.Highly recommended for fans of Jack and for lovers of the quirky rom com genre.

Oscar-worthy,"If you missed the Oscars in 1998, then you probably don't know that this film won several awards, including; best actor and best actress. And although the film itself didn't walk away with an Oscar, it should have in my opinion. Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson star in this unusual film about life, that's more true to it, than one might think.What is this film about? That's an answer that the viewer of the film would have to make on their own. Some people might call it a love story, while others may refer to it as a human piece. Meaning, it's basis is human thought, feeling and being. It's interesting, sad, funny and beautiful all wrapped into one star-packed motion-picture.Greg Kinnear is probably the best in the film, and I was so upset that even though he was nominated for best supporting actor in this, that he didn't win. He was so good, and very believable in his role. Jack Nicholson is good, but he plays himself. This is the last film that I actually enjoyed seeing Helen Hunt star in, and would say that it might even be her best performance to date, leaving aside 'Castaway', which was by far and away her best role ever, although that wasn't a lead role, this was.James L. Brooks, does a terrific job communicating the struggle between all of the characters, but frankly it was the kind of movie, that any good director could have done, and would have been able to achieve, in my opinion, the outcome that Brooks did.But, for the kind of drama that the film is, it is very good. I recommend it to anyone over twelve, and although I say such a young age, it's still a movie that adults will certainly relate to. It's a movie you should own, and certainly a watch or two.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Good, but sends confusing messages","With the 2004 Oscars over, I decided to take a look at some movies in the past that had won multiple Oscars.  One of those movies was ""As Good As It Gets.""  I knew that both Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt had won Oscars for their performances.  Yet at the same time I didn't know what to think of their romantic pairing, and I only knew the basic plotline.  What I saw was a decent movie that often got lost and confused in the messages it was trying to portray.First of all, however, this movie was a comedy and did often succeed in being humorous.  Also, Hans Zimmer did an excellent job of scoring the movie with a score that matched both the humorous and dramatic aspects of the movie.  I was impressed, furthermore, by Hunt's and Nicholson's performances, as I feel they did their best with the material that they were given with which to work.Nevertheless, I felt that material was sometimes a little weak and too often lost in its own complexity.  The characters were made to be very complex, and they are seen to be intricate as they change and progress through the movie.  Yet the changes they go through often seem rushed and out-of-character.  Plus, the message that each event sends to the viewer often gets lost from the screenplay to the actors to the screen.  However, the advantage of these often confusing complexities is that they do not cause mindless pleasure, but instead provide thought-provoking cinema.Altogether a very good effort.Final Grade: B+.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Diction: 8 (True-to-life)
Character: 8 (Well thought-out)
Extension: 7 (Fairytale-ish)
Spectacle: 6 (Nicholson goes off)Although this movie lacks a prominent theme beyond the capacity of different people to relate despite their own reservations, this is still a funny, involving and somehow educational cross-section of the intersection of three very different lives.Melvin Udall (Jack Nicholson) is one of the best screen examples of a undercover emotional basketcase so far this century. It's hard to deny how painful and yet consistently interesting it is to watch Melvin cope with his own insecurities. It's almost impossible not to identify with him trying to maintain his rickety structure of self-control despite all the countercurrents of his supressed emotions. Also, watching Nicholson go off on people is pretty funny, even if it's cruel.to realize their commonality far outweights their disparity.

Good Enough For A Viewing,"This facile romantic comedy features a wealthy, misanthropic, obsessive-compulsive writer of romance novels (Jack Nicholson), who begins to engage with others, with help from the gay artist next door (Greg Kinnear) and his favorite waitress (Helen Hunt). If there's hope for oddball Melvin Udall, there's hope for us all. The sets, costumes, and general production values reek of money, not as typical of New York as much as a sound stage, but this is a pleasant fantasy of people reaching out. Writer/director James Brooks offers plenty of twists and turns to intrigue the audience before bringing us to where we expected.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
What Am I Watching?,"I know I saw this film a long time ago, but I didn't remember that most of the film is people mistreating an elderly man with crippling psychological problems. Now I'm watching Cuba Gooding Jr. threaten an old man with physical violence just because he (Cuba) is having a bad day. Then he foists an unhousebroken dog on said old man despite the fact that the old man is so crippled by his phobia of germs that when he goes home he washes his hands in literally scalding hot water with a brand new bar of antibacterial soap, only to throw away the bar of soap halfway and continue with another new bar, only to throw that one away when he's done.This is a man who cannot step on a crack in the sidewalk in New York City. This is a man who cannot eat a meal anywhere but one restaurant, at the exact same time, at the exact same table, with his own plastic silverware he brings with him, and if his regular waitress isn't there he literally can't eat for the day. This man has CRIPPLING psychological issues which we're shown over and over are completely outside of his control, and yet they're being played for laughs. Even his therapist treats him like garbage. And when the old man makes serious attempts to be nice to people, all Cuba Gooding Jr. does is laugh at how socially awkward he is.Where were the activists and advocates for the mentally ill when this film came out? I'm about as far from either type as you can get, and this movie is horrifying to me. How are people watching this and laughing? It'd be like if The King's Speech was played as a comedy, and every time Colin Firth stuttered the other characters pointed and laughed or yelled at him for not being normal.

Jack Nicholson's Greatest Performance,"Films that poke fun at Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and/or other disorders and disabilities usually offend me but this 1997 Tristar Pictures release tends to make the viewer laugh with but never at Jack Nicholson's endearing performance as Melvin Udall, a man who suffers from OCD and has a bad attitude because of it taking his annoyances out on everybody and everything that crosses his path. He eats at the same restaurant every day (even insisting to always eat at the same table and bring his own utensils) and always insists to be served by the same waitress, Carol (Helen Hunt). Everybody in the restaurant and throughout much of the city can't stand him but Carol learns to get used to Melvin's sometimes snooty ways. It's by her surprising levels of tolerance for him as well as his having to temporarily watch his neighbor's (Greg Kinnear) dog that begin to inspire Melvin to consider taking a new lease on life and letting every major person in his life join in. Great performances all around. The two leads won Academy Awards (Nicholson for Best Actor and Hunt for Best Actress) for their performances.",,Anonymous,Romance
They can get better,"Jack Nicholson's persona in this movie -- his usual sarcastic self -- is highlighted with bigoted lines and obsessive-compulsive disorder, which provides good comedy and entertainment.  However, the love story with Helen Hunt does not work -- it is neither touching nor humorous -- Nicholson's character is just too unappealing.  In any event, this film was not academy award Best Picture material; apparently, there was a shortage of quality movies in 1997.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Open hearted and downright charming,"Jack Nicholson is utterly brilliant as Melvin Udall - a man who learns to be generous simply by his adherence to his formula - charming, funny and quick-witted, whilst still emotional and pained by his disorder. Helen Hunt is delightfully memorable, giving a warm and open hearted performance as Carol. Greg Kinnear is also effective, but the little he has to work with in the script prevents him from achieving the same level of success as his co-stars. Cuba Gooding Jr. and Jill the dog are also scene-stealers.The chemistry between Nicholson and Hunt is magnificent, despite the age gap that is distracting at times, and Nicholson really glosses up some of the film's best lines. The script does feel padded at times - Kinnear's character feels like an afterthought at times, and the romance ducks and weaves for about 20 minutes too long - but As Good As It Gets is so open hearted and disarmingly charming that it is worth the time to watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A James L. Brooks classic for fans of Terms of Endearment and Broadcast News.,"I'm not sure how it's taken me this long to sit down and finally watch this movie. I've enjoyed other films by James L. Brooks, like Terms of Endearment (1983) and Broadcast News (1987). If anything, As Good as it Gets (1997) is almost like the end of the trifecta of Brooks films, considering how well-received by critics they are. When it comes right down to it, the appeal of these movies is the characters. There's a heart and realism rarely seen in comedies (most of which resort to stereotypes and fart jokes to get a laugh).As a more intellectual comedy, As Good as it Gets manages to bring together three unlikely people and push their boundaries to grow as characters. Of course, it's somewhat easy to do this with abrasive characters like Melvin Udall (Jack Nicholson). After all, actively trying not to be a jerk is great growth potential. Additionally, other characters grow through their tragedy, but their comedy comes from having to rely on someone who doesn't have the social skills to be friendly or tactful. Sure, these character flaws are easy to explain away by Melvin's condition, but they're still funny, nonetheless.Aside from some cringe-worthy moments involving Melvin (which haven't aged well over 20+ years), my only other qualm with this film is the age gap between him and Carol Connelly (Helen Hunt). It seems a little too large (~26 years, by the way) to be believable in these romantic situations. Still, despite some technological and fashion elements that date this film, the core content is relatively timeless. I'd consider it at least on par with Brooks' other successful films at the very least.A James L. Brooks classic for fans of Terms of Endearment and Broadcast News, I give As Good as it Gets 4.0 stars out of 5.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Romantic Comedy about OCD that Flags at the End,"James L. Brooks's film contains good examples of the kind of acting (often labeled ""great acting"" that wins a lot of plaudits but consciously draws attention to itself in a way that might seem superficially attractive but palls in the end.Such is the case with Jack Nicholson's Melvin Udall, a curmudgeonly writer suffering from OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder), and living on his own in a well-to-do New York apartment. His particular forte consists of being excessively rude to everyone, from his gay neighbor Simon Bishop (Greg Kinnear), to Simon's African American friend Frank Sachs (Cuba Gooding jnr.) and the cleaner Nora (Lupe Ontiveros). Some of Melvin's put-downs are so outrageous that we wonder why anyone puts up with them.Melvin's character starts to change when he is unwillingly deputed to look after Simon's little dog Verdell (Jill), while Simon is in hospital, and a relationship develops between the human being and the animal. Meanwhile Melvin shows a hitherto undiscovered streak of generosity as he pays for a high society doctor to treat Carol Connelly's (Helen Hunt's) little son who suffers from a rare form of asthma.As the film develops, so Melvin's softer side begins to show itself; we discover that the reason for his OCD lies largely within himself and his reluctance to admit his true feelings. The story takes a sentimental turn, especially when Melvin, Simon, and Carol go off together for a trip to Baltimore to see Simon's parents.While Nicholson obviously enjoys monopolizing our attention, we nonetheless get the feeling that he is consciously acting for the camera: every little gesture and facial expression is scrutinized in minute detail as we learn something of the soft underbelly of the character he portrays. The ending is predictable, and somewhat implausible, as Melvin sloughs off his OCD in remarkably quick time and learns something about how to treat his fellow-human beings decently.Helen Hunt does what she can with a thankless role; throughout this lengthy film we get the sense that she exists as no more than a foil to Nicholson's star persona: all her gestures and facial expressions depend on how he reacts. She remains perfectly plausible as a server trying to make the best of her humdrum life, but we end up wanting to know more about her complex psyche rather than witnessing yet another (slightly clichéd) exchange between herself and Melvin.AS GOOD AS IT GETS is an entertaining film, with Mark Andrus's script containing a fair share of witticisms, but the tone changes for the worse as the action unfolds, as director Brooks substitutes hard- edged comedy for sentimentality, with the plot chugging towards its predictable end. The film represents something of a missed opportunity to look at the consequences of OCD and how it can destroy a personality.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A cliche festival,"If you gave a class of fifth graders the assignment of writing a script outline for a story of an abrasive but somehow lovable middle-aged man, a young single mother and a dying gay man, they would come up with something like this. Opposites attract, people bond to each other while they're on the road as the characters learn how to love and  about the value of accepting others. Both Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson play characters who shift back and forth from normality to extreme neuroticism to suit the plot; for me, their characters were unbelievable. A great disappointment from James L. Brooks",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Not the best movie ever, but still amusing.","I liked this movie. I liked it a lot. I liked Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt. They are both great at acting, but as a couple, I really don't think they go together good. But then there is Greg Kinnear, who does a decent job as the gay guy in the movie. I felt they all did a good job, but this movie was probably not worthy of the best actor/actress Awards.The supporting cast includes Cuba Gooding Jr., Shirley Knight, Skeet Ulrich, and Jamie Kennedy. The movie is cute and amusing, as the humor is basic but bitingly sarcastic. There were some really original ideas that make this movie one for everyone to see.

"Emotional, funny, and everything in between!","As Good As It Gets is a perfect work of art mainly produced by James L. Brooks. I believe that Jack Nicholson won his Oscar for this film by a long shot. This has had great debate of wether or not One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest was Nicholson's better film, but in my opinion As Good As It Gets is his best. Nicholson's blend of insults and sarcasm was brilliantly executed. I think the story of As Good As It Gets is absolutely fascinating! Everyone knew that Helen Hunt was going to win herself an Oscar and what better film could she have won it for, but As Good As It Gets. Hunt was wonderful as a single mom fighting to survive in New York with her sick little child. However, my favorite character of the movie is ""Simon the fag"" played by Greg Kinnear. I highly agree by far with Mr. Kinnear being awarded an Academy Award for his performance. Greg Kinnear was the person that made you want to cry in this film (because of his good acting). To wrap up the main cast, Cuba Gooding Jr, was casted as Simon's friend and supporter. Gooding Jr, was fabulous annoying Nicholson's character ""Melvin"" whenever the two characters collided. The bottom line is- As Good As It Gets was one of the many films the ""Academy"" agreed with winning the most important awards, which it certainly deserved.

Seems to have missed its mark.,"Curmudgeonly Jack Nicholson softens to his world in this lovely piece of dramatic drivel. I'm not into dramas so I can't say I enjoyed this as much as most who would bother to review it. Aside from that, however, I find this well written, affectionate, and in possession of heart and soul. Helen Hunt is sweet and natural in her portrayal, but then again, I usually DO like her.This work is entirely story driven, and, as a result, spends a lot of time on character development, story enriching sub-plots, and an elevated overall execution of the dramatic element. Nicholson is as good in the dramatic roles as he ever was. His adroit dramatic talents are what make his horror/action attempts so good.This movie is supposed to teach you that love and matters of the heart should rule the day. For me, though, it seems to have missed its mark. It seems to me that without money, the ""miracles"" of this film could not have taken place. So rather than teaching that heart is the answer, it teaches that money is the answer, for without money, nothing Nicholson's character wanted to do for ANYone would have been possible. Otherwise, it was moderately entertaining.It rates a 6.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Good film,"Good film. Although it's a romantic comedy, the film is most fascinating when there's no romance involved. Melvin is an irritable jackass with OCD, meaning he cares only for his own routine. He's waited on every day by Carol, whose son is chronically ill. One morning he's too sick for her to work, which greatly disturbs Melvin's routine and thus agitates him into action. He pays for a full-time doctor for Carol's son, so that she can show up to work every day without distraction. Melvin possesses almost no emotions and (because he works so frequently as a well-published author) almost unlimited wealth. When he's even slightly inconvenienced, his first instinct is to buy his comfort back. He gravitates toward Carol because she's not intimidated by his surly attitude or blunt approach; no other waitress will put up with him. Melvin's misanthropic views, coupled with his OCD, make him apathetic to anything happening around him. He uses slurs frequently and stomps on others' emotions and desires. He's not motivated by cruelness or a past tragedy, but robotic in his disdain, an all-consuming blackhole of selfishness. Everyone is the hero of their own story, but in Melvin's story, there aren't even any other characters. Because of this dynamic, intentional or not, the first half of As Good As It Gets plays like an indictment of America's healthcare system and uncaring market forces. Carole is trapped by Melvin's apathetic charity; she struggles to comprehend his motivation while trying desperately to keep him out of her life, weighing her sanity against her son's health. Melvin, again, isn't interested in any of this; he doesn't need emotional or sexual gratification and vehemently refuses a long, soulful thank you note. All he wants is a specific waitress. It's a perfect metaphor for the influence of money on the well off, and the hopelessness of the down trodden to escape their circumstances with only the help of indifferent higher powers.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great movie,"In this movie Jack Nicholson plays Melvin Udall, a single middle-aged man who has quite extreme obsessive-compulsive disorder and also a rather unpleasant personality. Greg Kinnear plays his gay neighbor Simon, and Helen Hunt plays Carol, the waitress at the restaurant Melvin usually goes to. A certain event happens and the unlikely trio end up going on a road trip that is both very funny and also moving at times. This movie is very much character-driven, as the story is quite simple, and all three main actors are great and show how their characters change each other over time. Jack Nicholson makes Melvin Udall very unlikeable but also gives him some humanity at times, and it is hard to imagine anyone else playing the role. Although he can say nasty things, you feel for him at times because his disorder has a very big effect on his life. Nicholson definitely deserved the Oscar for this. Helen Hunt and Greg Kinnear also put warmth into their characters and make them feel very real, and Cuba Gooding Jr. is also very good and funny as Simon's partner. There are also some great one-liners that will make you laugh out loud and you will remember them for a long time after seeing the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A (Slightly) inventive romance,"As Good As It Gets is a romcom with good charm and outstanding performances, though I am not sure it is quite for me. My first complaint is that this film is at least slightly derivative- its story is essentially a predictable redemption arc for its neurotic, slightly unhinged, bigoted, and misanthropic central character. The stuff with the dog, the initial rejection, a later rejection, and the final inevitable acceptance is all standard stuff, things which can be seen a mile away. The other problem with the film is that whereas typical romcoms would like their leading men to be endearing, our central character here is brash, rude, and socially inept. I feel the screenplay could have at least toned Melvins character flaws down, perhaps making him more like a Dr. House character- someone who is still likable but deeply flawed. My last issue is with the disconcerting age gap between our leads, though this point is alleviated by the excellent performances of our leads. Indeed, our two leads give wonderful performances. Jack Nicholson is brilliant as the crass, impertinent, obsessive compulsive freak Melvin, who undergoes changes because he falls in love with Helen Hunts Carol. The two share good chemistry even though Nicholson is old enough to be Hunts dad. This is because of strong, sincere portrayals aided by wonderful writing. The characters are well written with good depth- Melvin is one who shows repentance due to love, while Carol is strong willed, assertive, and straightforward in expressing her emotions. The dialogue, while veering into sentimentality at times, is of a high caliber on the whole, thanks to insightful observations and good dialogue tailored and personalised to the characters itself. Overall, As Good As It Gets probably won't result in laugh out loud moments, but it is still a competently written, well acted, relatively breezy way to spend 2 hours. Worth a watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Love Helen!,"Kinnear's character Simon has the distinct purpose in being both the bridge and the divider of Nicholson and Hunt's relationship, and he identifies with his character with compassion and understanding, as he has frequently been wronged throughout his existence. The most curious aspect to a story such as this, involving such unduly, diverse characters: a miserable recluse, a zesty, yet insecure waitress, and a sensitive and insightful, yet wronged homosexual, is that in their distinct differences, they share many of the same problems, and these problems eventually bring them all together, although hardly in a civilized manner. I appreciated practically every element in this wonderful, delightful masterpiece of exemplary romantic comedy, in its indelible acting (Oscars well deserved), its whimsical, touching screenplay (This was neons above ""Good Will Hunting""'s quality) and its comforting morale, that despite all of the great odds in life which prevent us from being happy, we can perhaps find it within ourselves to take that one important step in reversing our fortunes, in ""stopping with taking pills"" and to allow our lives, and our desires to shine and be realized, as this story depicts life. The best romantic comedy, certainly the best film of 1997, and one of the greatest films of all time, ""As Good As It Gets"" succeeds in practically every entertaining and endearing cinematic respect. **** out of ****",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

As good as some movies get,"A stand-out film in many ways, but ultimately unnecessary ; I recommend watching this once, but repeat performances may seem paltry. All elements of film are here in good form; good acting, good structure, good angles, whatnot.

Good performances, especially by minor players like Cuba Gooding, Jr., light up this film. Helen Hunt, however, is a sorry excuse for Oscar winner in her role. Not so much that she made a lot of mistakes, but the role is a simple one that anyone can play. There are no stretches, no real grit, and certainly no punch.

As good as it was,"There you are the title defines the film itself. I resorted to the thought that I should be seeing a film one of the best actors living nowadays had acted with. I have to site that Jack Nicholson's best performance I've seen so far was since ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"". And I can't help grinning at thought of bringing the remnants of his acting trademarks which I saw in this film. Just creatively witty and this is the first time I saw Helen Hunt! She's just wonderful as well. It's indeed a bit off to imagine a grumpy, OCD writer, a troubled gay neighbor and a caring single mother would join and enjoy the full circle. It was really cool to see Nicholson do the part of bigoted, obsessively compulsive writer. Seeing and hearing Melvin Udall get to his clumsy attitudes amuses me, Nicholson is just cute for the part and he did it nicely. Helen Hunt has a bit of craziness and insensitivity there, but that's her character. The thought of hating it actually pulled through her acting skills. Greg Kinnear was also better. He did agreeably his role and it was splendid. The one impressed the most was the dog. It's funny, but considerably trained dog could have pulled the role. That was innovative. One thing lacking though is the part of Nicholson's character. I wish they could have emphasized more the background of his character's unlikely behavior. It wasn't only OCD that described Melvin's strange attitude but there was something else in there. I was thinking they could have focused on that side more deeply. The scene that struck me, it was only a moment but it was electric for me, was when Melvin was told to return the dog as Simon (Greg) was about to get better and wanted the dog back sooner. At that moment I saw how powerfully Jack Nicholson got into the character's deeply sad side. He was about to lose something that made him feel better. It was as if just the prior thought of it makes it painful for him. He cried! I almost cried seeing that! That was potent! I wish they could have brought a piece of that Melvin's side to Helen Hunt's character. But I realized later, the film went well probably without getting too much on that part. I've learned that a little of something so electrifyingly sensitive and catchy is best shown in seconds and in a single time only. As powerful as Jack Nicholson's performance at One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, this has to be his second most evocative performance. It should be understood that the film was more of a romantic comedy. Well I guess the little dramatic side of it makes it stands out.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

An Emotionally packed Comedy and Drama,"Toady I saw the film 'As good as it Gets'. It's a strange film. It tells a story of a unlikely man who struggles with his lonely life, closing him self in a world of imagination and words that fills his 62nd book. Melvin, Jack Nicholson, a troubled writer who has some disorder, some misconception, some dis-beliefs about the world around him and he behave true to his beliefs. There is a man who is living in his neighborhood, Simon, who loves his dog and the men; yes he is a gay. And there is a friend of this gay man Frank, played by Mr. Gooding. Now the character of Jack named Melvin hates his neighbors so much that he can't just avoid to see the Simon's dog. But still he has to tolerate it. When he gets outside, he walks carefully to avoid contact of men walking on the streets and also the crossing tiles or road lines; that he considers as a bad luck. Jack Nicholson played this disordered character so wonderfully that, anyone can feel a pity for him. Besides he visits a usual shop where he takes the breakfast.There he finds a waitress Carol played by Helen Hunt who only sustain his (Melvin's) over the top behavior. That make Melvin takes interest in her. Now this Carol, who is a single mother of a son Simpson and living with her mother; who is trying to get into a relationship that really works for her and the family. She tried to date with a man, who lands up in her bed but because of homely presence they couldn't make it. That really frustrates Carol. The portrayal of a single, workaholic and a needy woman who really wants the companionship of a man, that she not able to get, may be because of her job status or her way of expressing herself right on the face or whatever and feeling sad for her mistake makes her a really beautiful character. Oh how lovely the scene is when she confesses to her mother that what she feels about a man that she want in her life. When Melvin, Carol and Simon goes on a trip; Melvin could not express truly to her as he has a doubt that Carol likes Simon; that makes Carol angry and she spends a night with Simon while he sketches her nude portraits that he haven't sketched for so long. In fact, while drawing her sketches he gives a lots of compliment to her and that really makes her forget about Melvin's mistake and she and he both enjoys the process. Ultimately, after the trip, when Melvin helps Simon to shift into his apartment, there Simon asks Melvin if he really loves Carol; Melvin struggles, Simon tells him then he need to show it to her though he finds it difficult. Simon encourages him and Melvin gets that night to Carol's home and takes her for a morning walk where they both kiss and goes to a shop for a warm bread roll in the morning. The films is so emotionally charged, and that is of varying emotions; love, jealousy, fear, anger, hope, guilt, confidence and many more. That makes this film a complete watchable experience.

Brilliant,"among the best 3 movies of 1997, along with good will hunting & l.a.confidential. this movie has 3 top artistes giving off their best. the story is simple, and yet so complex. the characters are out- of-the-world and yet so real. as good as it gets revels in this paradox.touching at the raw chords, a story of a man who cannot (or rather does not want to) reveal his emotions. helen hunt plays the woman that turns him around, the one person who makes him ""want to be a better man"". greg kinear plays a brilliant role as the gay friend. he would have bagged the Oscars in most years, his tough luck that he ran into robin williams giving his career best performance in good will hunting.as good as it gets is funny, endearing, touching, dark, sad, cathartic, confusing and enlightening all at once. one of the modern masterpieces. the casting director deserves a special award for this casting coup. watch the movie for the brilliant performances, the arresting chemistry between these superstars, the heart-rending moments between them. this is one of the best movies of the 90s.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good,"I thought this was cute and not bad. AS GOOD AS IT GETS stars Mr. Jack Nicholson, an American actor, producer, screenwriter and director of some acclaim. The only thing that keeps it afloat is the sensitivity of the bilaterally desperately needy relationship between the characters. The characters in this film have a lot of depth and the realism with which they are portrayed by the actors is shocking at times. It is hard to describe life. Stories about mutants fighting wars in different galaxies, that is easy to describe; but writing about life, sometimes all you can say is, ""It's about life.""

Great movie! Even though its not my style.,"I have to say that this is not generally the genre I would go for, but I was pleasantly surprised. There are few films that have me laughing so much as this one. Jack's performance is great in this film. I don't know if he actually got any awards for his performance (haven't checked, 'cause I've had a tad too much to drink) but if he hasn't, he should have. What a movie!!! I would even go so far as to say that everyone should have it on DVD, so you can watch it when you are down. If you think your life is hard, take a look here. This guys, even though he does it himself, has a hard time at everything. Getting from one place to another is like a living hell... You'll see what I mean when you watch the movie yourself.

I never have and never will see a better film.,"I saw this movie when it came out two years ago and since then have been obsessed with it. Heck sometimes I even get mad at people that don't like it- its plain perfect! I really didd'nt like Titanic anyway and think this movie was cheated out of it's best picture oscar.How can it be so perfect you might ask, thats what i'll tell you.First off the cast couldnt be better. Jack Nicholson truly deserved his oscar as Melvin Udall, a compulsive writer that doesnt step on cracks, has to have the same restaurant and table everyday, closes and locks doors 5 times,and is prejudiced to everyone that is not him.Greg Kinnear is Melvin's gay neighbor Simon who decides to draw the street punk Vincent for an art show, and ends up having the punk's friends beat the crap out of him.So of corse as he is rushed to the hospital Melvin has to watch his (adorably) ugly dog Ferdel.So with that, Melvin begins to soften up - expecially around the waitress he loves Carol Connoly by Helen Hunt who also won a best actress oscar. Also in the cast is Cuba Gooding Jr. as Simons partner who has to threaten Melvin to get him to watch Ferdel. With Skeet Ulrich as Vincint, Shirly Knigt as Carol's mom who helps take care of her sick son,Harold Ramis as the doctor who will help her son, with Yeardly Smith and Lupe Ontiveros as Simon's friends. Also the music by Nat King Cole and Hans Zimmer is perfect. If you havent seen this you need to- fast!",,Anonymous,Romance
It's good but not as good as it gets,"""As Good As It Gets"" does not take the standard romance/comedy approach as it is almost a drama; very thoughtful and puts value on developed characterization. However, it occasionally drops down to the standard romance/comedy level. It is flawed by clichés and some cheesy and kitschy scenes. Parts of the movie are very funny (favorite line is when Melvin introduces Carol to Simon: ""Carol the waitress, Simon the fag"") and Jack Nicholson's performance is great.It's a good comedy and is worth watching. The IMDb-rating is a bit too high. If you expect to watch a movie that deserves a score of almost 8, you might be disappointed. If you expect a standard chick flick this movie will surprise you in a positive way.Better than standard comedy/romance --- funny!*** 6.0/10 ***",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Film making at its best.,"I have never been a fan of Jack Nicholson -- but this movie made me re-think his abilities as an actor.Of course, he does what he does best -- play a psycho (The Shining, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest) but this is a different kind of psycho -- one with a very human side.Mr. Nicholson plays someone with OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) as if he were a victim of this illness for his entire life.From the moment early in the film when he walked into his apartment and counted the number of times he turned the lock on his front door (5) to the number of times he turned the lights on and off in his bathroom (also 5) I knew what his illness was.Helen Hunt as Carol Connelly has just enough edge to her character that you realize she is not perfect either.  In her own way she has OCD also -- regarding her son and HIS illness.There are lots of cameos by well known actors in very small roles: Shirley Knight, Brian Doyle-Murray, Lawrence Kasdan, Harold Ramis, Danielle Brisebois and the ALWAYS entertaining but ever under-utilized Yeardley Smith (I KNOW it is her voice that keeps her from getting the major roles -- but I wish someone would really recognize her talents and give her a major role).I have always been a big fan of James L. Brooks, from his early work as creator of ""Room 222"" and ""The Tracy Ullman Show"" to Producer of Jerry Maguire, The War of the Roses, Big, Broadcast News, Terms of Endearment and Executive Producer of ""The Critic,"" ""The Simpsons,"" ""The Tracey Ullman Show,"" ""Taxi,"" ""Rhoda,"" and last but definitely NOT least ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show.""  His writing and directing skills (particularly in this film) amaze and astound me; he is truly a gifted artist.It is too bad this came out the same year as Titanic -- it is a MUCH better film and really deserved the Oscar for best picture of 1998.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Berst!!,This is movie a *great* portrayal of OCD. I find it funny how many people who hated it called Jack Nicholson's character annoying. Then you've never dealt with someone with OCD. It does affect their personality it isn't just doing things over and over. And to see how Helen Hunt could overcome his shortcomings and see the true man behind the disease is awesome. If only people would watch this movie and then take the time to understand OCD. Its not something easy to deal with both for the person afflicted with it and their family and friends. Its great to see that Helen Hunt could overcome it and try to see the true man behind the disease!!!!!,10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Apt title!!,"This film is as good as it gets! It lost to the bloated Titanic at the Oscar ceremonies, but Helen Hunt and jack Nicholson deservedly won Oscars for their performances. The two leads generate a lot of chemistry; both give naturalistic performances.jack Nicolson plays Melvyn Udall, a man with OCD, and Helen Hunt,Carol Connelly, the waitress who encounters Melvyn, first as abrasive and humorless, second as obsessive, unempathic and egocentric, third as a love interest. Add in a sparkling Greg Kinnear as a gay neighbor whose relationship with Melvyn changes through the film.The movie hasn't dated since I saw it on main circuit, nearly 10 years ago. It manages to avoid a lot of sentimentality (wich typifies Terms of Endearment, James Brooks' ""other"" famous movie, for which Jack Nicholson won his Best Supporting Actor Oscar!

Lives up to its title,"I'm a big James L. Brooks fan, so I was anxiously awaiting this movie, and though I preferred the original title (OLD FRIENDS), that proved to be my only complaint.  Brooks is one of the masters at combining comedy with drama, and he's also great at writing dialogue (the ""noodle salad"" speech is a highlight).  I should also say though I'm not familiar with Mark Andrus' work, he obviously deserves credit for writing the original script, which Brooks re-wrote.A lot has been said about Nicholson, but let me just say this; I have friends who work with obsessive-compulsive people, and people who suffer similar disorders, and they said Nicholson captured what being an obsessive-compulsive is to a T.  I also liked how gradual he changed, that his progress is slow, and that he still makes mistakes when he's unsure (like when Carol comes on to him and he asks her to sleep with Simon).There also seems to be a backlash against Hunt, and I for one would like to nip that in the bud.  A single mom is the type of role that other actresses might use to call attention to themselves, but Hunt never does.  And again, she concentrates on building her character gradually as well, and making her recognizable (the fact that the only way she can thank the doctor(Harold Ramis) who helps her son is to hug him, even though they don't know each other and he's obviously embarrassed).  Finally, Kinnear gives his first really good performance as Simon.  All in all, an excellent film!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not Overstating It,"There are some films that just wouldn't be the same without it's lead actors, well As Good as it Gets is one of those films. Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt both won Oscars for Melvin Udall and Carol Connelly respectively. Udall should be a very unlikable character for all the offensive and despicable things he does, but it's because of Nicholson's charm and charisma that makes you root for him. Hunt does the same with single mother who just wants to provide for her sick son. It's an unlikely combination but one that turns into one of the sweetest romantic comedies of all time.The story is somewhat like Gran Torino in that it's a man who that finds everyone and everything around him to be annoying. Udall is racist, sexist, homophobic, and also has OCD. Of course, there's a lot more to Melvin than seen on the outside. He just has a difficult time showing how much he cares. Some of the sweetest and most satisfying moments of the film involve him complimenting the people he had spent the entire film hating. Greg Kinnear plays Simon, his gay neighbor, and has his fair share of quarrels with Melvin. It's really not till the road trip between Carol, Melvin, and Simon that the three really find their groove. It's three people all with problems but they each find a way to help one another. Sometimes they don't even realize what they're doing is helping but eventually they get there.As Good as it Gets is a bittersweet film about acceptance and dealing with your own problems with the help of others. The performances, script, Hans Zimmer's score, and directing are very good. It's one of Jack Nicholson's best.+Lead performances+Score+Bittersweet story+Ending9.2/10",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
As sucky as it can get!,"First of all: I managed to skip this movie for many years, mostly thanks to my, by now, well sharpened sixth sense about films I have not seen. This one had a vibe of ""I may not like it..."" so I waited and waited... until few people told me to watch it. So, it came highly recommended.And, from the first second of this horrible excuse for a film, I could not believe what I was watching. A film that starts with no tone. I don't know what I am to expect; I know it is a comedy, but what type? I guess I will see as the film goes on.I will be honest: I only managed to torture myself with the first 27 minutes of this horror. I was hoping that they would all die premature deaths so that I don't have to watch it. Then as the film regressed further, I started hoping for an earthquake and finally a WWIII. Didn't happen, so I finally had to stop and come here to warn others.By the way, I have no idea what those who like this excuse for a film are on, but this is one of those times when I have serious doubts about the future of humanity, seeing that this sub-garbage gets 7.7 rating and high recommendations. I mean, even just judging it by simple standards of film making, this thing fails: characters have no motivation, they are absolutely unrealistic in every way possible, things happens just to get the story moving, and so on and so on. I mean, a 14 yr old could have written a better ""comedy"".How this thing ever got made into a film, and how so many people got conned into thinking that it does not suck even things that cannot be sucked is beyond me.

A Romantic Comedy that grips you from beginning to end!,"'As Good As It Gets' excelled in every possible way. The plot doesn't drive the characters, on the contrary, the characters drive the plot. Every thing that happens in the movie is because of the characters, and only the characters. Jack Nicholson is outstanding in his most perplexing role he has had to play up to date(a well deserved Oscar). Even tough his character is uncouth and eerie, his performance and vive he gives to his character makes him very likable. Helen Hunt, as well, is a delight to see in her Oscar winning performance. When she could have been annoying, sentimental, and rude, she was lovely and genuine. Hands up to Greg Kinnear! His performance made you like, care, and feel for his character, Simon. He doesn't overdo the emotions and reactions coming from a gay artist, but stays on the line. Finally, I'm not surprised at James L. Brooks' work. He is constant in his work and zesty films.

"A study in acceptance, selflessness and autism","Many have criticised this film for its lack of plausibility. Indeed, it goes to extremes to make its point, but that does not detract from its message.
Jack Nicholson's Melvin Udall is obnoxious and self centred. He makes socially unacceptable comments to everyone around him, and is thoroughly dislikeable. At first. But there's a reason for that, which becomes more and more apparent as time goes on.
Helen Hunt's Carol Connor is sarcastic, bitter, and reactive. She is unhappy, unfulfilled and despite her apparent tolerance for Melvin, she has no empathy or understanding of his needs.
But she has a reason for this too.
Greg Kinnear's Simon is more likeable from the outset, and his misfortune serves as the catalyst that brings all 3 characters together to evoke change in all of them.
Melvin has OCD, as is evident from the outset with hand washing and rituals, but much of his difficulty appears to be far more on the autistic spectrum than is openly admitted. A loner, his social awkwardness, his inability to understand whose turn it is to speak, his bluntness, his pain at the pressure of conversation during a meal, his obsession with himself and his own needs. Indeed, his apparent acts of kindness towards others are entirely motivated by self interest at first.
His development over the course of time, with him engaging with taking medication, attempting to modify his behaviour to become socially acceptable, and at the end actually showing genuine ability to care for others, is heart warming. He does not completely change, but he has taken steps towards achieving this, and he's understood the value of human contact.
Carol also develops over time. She begins to think of her own needs, having sacrificed them endlessly for her son. She begins to tolerate Melvin, at first out of gratitude and a sense of obligation, but later out of genuine affection. I feel her understanding of Melvin and why he behaves the way he does, does not develop as fully as I'd have liked. By the end she is still reluctant to accept him for who he is, faults and all, but I feel she's on enough of a journey for that to happen.
Overall the message is one of hope. We can all live in our isolated bubbles with no real understanding of what goes on in someone else's, but that is a lonely and unfulfilling existence. All it takes is a few steps to open doors and invite someone in. We can all change, and be a better version of ourselves if we try. And to really step inside another person's world and see it from their perspective is a great way to do that.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Too Long...and Not Too Good,"Without the great Jack Nicholson, this would have been a disaster. As usual he is in brilliant form. One of the many problems with AGAIG is the fact that Helen Hunt only ever plays Helen Hunt. A more serious defect is---there is no perceptible chemistry between Nicholson and Hunt. I never believed in there ""love?"" Or there relationship. Also--when a gay man gets beaten to a pulp----and a child is continually being rushed to hospital, I have to ask--is that supposed to be funny? The movies running time of 138 minutes is excessive. Its more of a saga than a comedy ..more of a tragedy than a romance. There is an annoying predictability about the whole--thing, too many scenes that make the viewer..uncomfortable. Also scenes that make the viewer --feel embarrassed--for the writer. That---is never a good --indicator.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

He carries on the whole movie with a character that came from Heaven. Helen Hunt plays a perfect equilibrium for him.

"Witty, amusing and touching little comedy of personal difference.","Nominated for nine Academy Awards in 1997, ""As Good As It Gets"" manages to live up to its hype.

Jack Nicholson makes a career breakthrough as a neurotic, grumpy, obsessive compulsive and cynical old man. He proves that he can excel equally at drama and at comedy. Helen Hunt also makes a career breakthrough and goes past the smiley sitcom character in ""Mad About You"". She is very convincing as the single mother cum waitress and rightfully beat Kate Winslet for the Oscar. While the limelight is aimed more at Nicholson and Hunt, Greg Kinnear does very well as a gay artist. Cuba Gooding Jnr. isn't really giving it his all but does OK anyway and makes good support.The brilliant script, the comic timing, the undeniable charm, the great performances and the overall enjoyablity add up to make ""As Good As It Gets"" a charming, cute and instantly likeable light comedy.

Ineot romantic comedy.,"Curmudgeonly romantic novellist, Melvin Udall (Jack Nicholson [sic!]) blames his rude disposition on his Obsessive Compulsive Disorder until he falls in love with put-upon waitress, Carol Connelly (Helen Hunt) who leaves him in no doubt that the way to her heart is via a complete change in his: and that means becoming friends with Simon Bishop (Greg Kinnear); a struggling, gay artist on the brink of a nervous breakdown as a result of a vicious aggravated burglary.The above says it all really...  American producers have rarely been able to (and never will on the whole) distinguish between the sentimental and the false; and this movie is a beacon to such confusion.  Coming as it does from the pen of James L. Brooks - a man responsible for the joyously excellent 'The Simpsons' - this is a shoddily written, would-be screwwball comedy that never ceases to grate and is done precious little justice by either cast OR director.  How it garnered it's Oscars (or even it's nominations) is an enigma to me: Hunt is just above adequate; Nicholson is consistently below and Kinnear is as convincing as Hitler on a civil rights march.

A perfect romantic comedy.,"With it's witty dialogue, simple and easy story, and the first class acting by sitcom television stars Helen Hunt and Greg Kinnear, and 3-time Oscar Winning silver screen legend Jack Nicholson, ""As Good As It Gets"" is the funniest and most intelligent- if pretty unrealistic- romantic comedy since ""Pretty Woman."" Nicholson has great fun as an obsessive-compulsive romance novelist, and has seemed to have matured just a little bit after nearly 30 years of 'bad boy' performances: Easy Rider, The Last Detail, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Witches of Eastwick, Batman, and Wolf. But, I would still bet on him to win a verbal and eye-staring rumble between him and Robert De Niro, Dennis Hopper, Peter Fonda and Michael Douglas. Hunt is extremely good but unrealistic as a lonely waitress whose son is really sick. But she plays the character as best as she can, and she has great screen-chemistry with Jack. Kinnear is probably the actor who steals the show not counting the humor. I'm sure everyone wanted Jack to shut up and put his glasses on when Kinnear told his engaging story about how his father gave him a ""sweaty wad of money"". That's real acting right there.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

"As good as romantic comedies usually get? No, better!","Hollywood has forgotten how to do rom-coms properly nowadays. With a few exceptions (e.g. Hitch), they're all so predictable and awfully repetitive. Lucky for us, As Good as It Gets is not one of those films. It's smart, it's original and it's also very, very funny.The movie begins with the now legendary sequence where misanthropic writer Melvin Udall (a priceless Jack Nicholson) dumps his neighbor's dog, Verdell, down the garbage chute, telling the poor creature ""This is New York, pal. If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere!"". This hilarious opening scene perfectly serves its purpose: to make it undeniably clear that Melvin is one of the most unpleasant individuals in the world. Apart from the dog thing, he spends his days avoiding people or insulting them. Not the kind of behavior you'd expect from a guy who writes romance novels, huh? Anyway, things change once Verdell's owner, gay artist Simon (Greg Kinnear) ends up at the hospital. From there on, it's up to Melvin to make sure the dog's fine, and on top of that, our antihero starts developing feelings for Carol (Helen Hunt), a single mom who works in the coffee shop he has breakfast at every morning. These unexpected feelings, which he has only known about through his literary works so far, are going to transform his life forever...As Good as It Gets has a concept which reminds of When Harry Met Sally: put two people, who would never go out together under the normal circumstances, in the same room (not literally, though) and see what happens. In this case, however, the story is made more interesting by the fact that its male protagonist is supposed to be beyond redemption. And Jack Nicholson does a wonderful job in making that man's craziness believable, but then again it's the kind of role he can handle with his eyes shut, isn't it? Hunt is also amazing, giving a career-best performance which was justly praised with a Best Actress Oscar, while Jack won his third ""golden baldy"" thanks to James L. Brooks'(yes, it's the director of Terms Of Endearment and executive producer of The Simpsons) charming film.So, is this movie as good as it gets? Considering the direction romantic comedy has taken in the past few years, I'd say it's better.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Never has negativity been so entertaining!,"Melvin, he world's grumpiest man, eventually learns to love - by doing good deeds for the waiter he fancies and a gay man he shares an apartment block with.It's a fun premise, and the movie maintains the fun and energy throughout. There's some classic lines, such as the infamous ""take away reason and accountability"" retort to a fan. But the best, when the gay supporting character says ""I love you"", Melvin (who's been making anti-gay slurs, along with misogynist, racist, and other remarks) replies:""I'll tell ya buddy, I'd be the luckiest man alive if that were enough for me.""Perfect response, captures how he's changed. The character arc is superb.If I have one criticism, it's making Melvin a romance author. Even though authors don't always live up to their words in real life, they have some social ability. Melvin has none, yet he can somehow churn out bestselling romances with well-written women? It would have been better to make him a crime writer, and have him channel his cynicism into thinking up grisly murders.That part of the character didn't work for me, but the rest of it is excellent.

Easily one of the best movies of the 1990s,"A misanthropic writer (Nicholson) finds inspiration to change for the better after falling in love with a waitress (Hunt) and fostering a dog for a neighbor who's been hospitalized (Kinnear). Nostalgic (look at the gas prices!) but also timeless, with an all around charm from the three leads plus the supporting cast consisting of Gooding, Herwick, Kennedy, Knight, Smith and Ulrich. The dosage of comedy is far more potent than the drama and romance, allowing for a chemistry that perfectly dodges anything too far-fetched or overemotional. The Baltimore and New York settings also add an element of class to this long-but-not-boring outing of proudly unusual friendships and love.

If it was supposed to be funny, it wasn't. If it was supposed to be appealing, it didn't. There was nothing sympathetic about any of the characters, and they managed to be supremely uninteresting at the same time. I was bored rigid by these cardboard characters. I cannot believe anyone outside America finds anything redeeming about this mechanical disaster. There is some kind of a popular culture gap as wide as the Atlantic between those who enjoy this kind of film and those who don't.

The awakeining of the human spirit,"Jack Nicholson plays Melvin Udall, a crudmugeon writer that is homophobic and has obessions complusive disorder. He has too eat food with plastic ware, sit on the same spot for breakfast, avoid walking on cracks from cement, and has to do everything five times(Wash hands, lock the door, five m&m jars, sets of paper and more). After his neighbor, Simon(greg kinnear) gets his ass kicked by a couple of guys, he must take care of his dog, verdall. All of a sudden, Melvin is rejoiced and happy again, seeing that somebody actually cared for him. Another person is Melvin's life is Carol, a waitress(played by Helen Hunt); the thing with her is that she feels like a prisoner because her son has been sick since the day he was born. She is on to him every 24-7 without even catching a break. The only person who wants her to be free is her mother(shelly winters in her breakout role ever). One day after recovering from an accident, Simon has to go to Boston in order to get money from his parents to pay the medical bills. That is when the three main characters(simon, melvin and carol) get together on an odyssey that not only get to talk, but also feel more spirited and alive.

Quite Literally As Good as a Romantic-Comedy gets.,"A Very Nice and humorous film boosted by excellent performances from Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt, showing us that friendship and love is a part of anyone's life.This Movie is about a Grumpy Writer Named Melvin Udall(Jack) who lives on his own in an apartment,and does not have any friends, and lives his life very disciplined,about how he develops a friendship with his Gay Neighbour(Greg) and a love interest towards a waitress of the restaurant he goes to have his breakfast(Helen).The Portrayal of Melvin from Jack Nicholson is quite honestly ''as good as it gets'' and he also got an Oscar for this role along with Helen Hunt who portrays a mother trying to cure her child's sickness while trying to find happiness at the same time quite brilliantly. The Supporting roles from Greg Kinnear and Shirley Knight are also well portrayed.

A hilarious yet moving masterpiece,"Words cannot express how awesome this film is. Every time I see it I cannot help but burst out laughing and burst into tears in equal measure. Everything about it is perfect. The quality of the acting, the subtle yet purposeful direction and warm true to life visuals all help squeeze the most out of what is an incredibly touching script.The film is about how passion for things, and for the people we love help us overcome the problems that we face in our everyday lives. It is also about that when you love someone, you both have to face compromise to get it to work and that because of compromising stuff you thought you had to do you can be a better person because of it.Jack Nicholson definitely deserved his Oscar for his performance as Melvin, a crazy author who has OCD, by managing to make him totally believable. It could have been so easy for him to go all out nuts and overact, taking away the charm and the warmth from his performance that lets us truly feel sorry for and sympathise with his character.All the other cast members were exceptional as well, with the guy who played the gay dude doing especially well. His performance as the man who is the complete opposite of Melvin and wears his emotions on his sleeve is especially important to make sure the film works. Helen Hunt does pretty nifty too and so many scenes in the film make me smile just because of the expressions on her face.The best thing about the film has to be the writing though. The are times in other films when lines of movie dialogue are seen as being exactly movie dialogue, but in As Good As It Gets everything seems real. The words are how a real person would say things, not just silly sound-bites that are charged up with emotional language that fools you into thinking they are deep and meaningful. Everything just feels true and natural, which really helps the movie swallow you whole until you are deep inside its warm, snuggly belly surrounded by the reality it creates and feeling every last trace of emotion.What is also really important to get across is that the film is also absolutely hilarious! There are the immediately amusing one-liners that make you chuckle and smile, but the film also manages to do more than this, setting it miles apart from your average comedy that throws around random words and and ""zany"" situations. Since you get so involved with the intricacies and quirks of each of the characters, the biggest laughs you will get out of the film are by simple facial expressions or the odd emphasised word that lets you know exactly what the character is thinking.You should really, REALLY watch this film. It is a masterpiece. It only gets better on repeat viewings as well. At the risk of being extremely cliché and cheesy, as far as romantic comedies go, it really is As Good As It Gets!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

The script is pathetic. Jack Nicholson over-acts dramatically as the central character, and my reaction to Helen Hunt was to hope that she spent as little time on screen as possible. In her TV role as an ugly, neurotic, abrasive wife she was superb. Seeing her in this film, you suddenly realise she probably wasn't acting.

Crackpot finds love and an unlikely gay friend,"I have now watched the film 3 times but not yet at the cinema. It seems to me to be better, more subtle and more thought provoking each time I watch it. Jack Nicholson, playing the neurotic Melvin Udall, is worth every plaudit the great actor has received. The first part of the film establishes him has a most unlikable character, so much so that when he starts to do kindnesses one feels disorientated. Helen Hunt as Carol the waitress in Melvin's favourite restaurant is an admirable foil to Melvin's battyness; calm, sensible, yet beset by worry about her son's illness. She establishes her part in the film with assured, entirely believable acting. Melvin takes on the unlikely role of pet sitter to gay artist neighbour (Greg Kinnear) Simon's dog (which we already know he hates). This unlikely happening is accomplished by excellent acting by all concerned not least Simon's unscrupulous male model . Carol (the only waitress that Melvin trusts) has to take time off because her son is ill. Melvin uses the considerable financial clout he wields as a successful author to employ a doctor (admirably played by Lawrence Kasden)to treat the boy. Carol, though grateful, suspects that Melvin's motives are less than pure. We, the audience, believe that Melvin only wanted to be fed but maybe Carol puts ideas into his head ...Meanwhile the counter plot of Simon having fallen on hard times leads to a visit of the trio to Baltimore and a chance for relationships to develop not always comfortably.

Contemporary Classic,"Jack Nicholson, from what I've seen so far, has never given a bad performance in his life. This is no exception to that claim. Even more, As Good As It Gets is a slight departure from his trademark screen persona, a snakily charming, confident, and dry man with a penchant for almost comically devilish eyebrow movements and sharky grins. Instead, here he is an older man with insecurities so overwhelming that he desperately hides it all underneath a wry and crude meanness that he jabs at nearly everyone he meets, harming them first before they can do what he fears out of a corrosive neuroses, which is that they'll harm his fragile ego first. He only begins to realize how much he yearns to be liked after so many unfortunate things happen to his neighbor, inadvertently causing so many fortunate things to happen to him, giving him a taste of how good life gets before things once again even out, making him want to become a better man.Helen Hunt's tremendously human performance stands out almost as far as Nicholson's, a feat that has since the 1970s been quite difficult to accomplish. To equal Nicholson's naturally upstaging presence is quite impressive. She seems almost as if she was born to play the waitress whose ill son is constantly on her mind but always keeps that winning smile on her face. She is very funny and deeply felt, imperfect and in such a realistic way.The film's breakthrough comes from Greg Kinnear, whose charm affects the sensitive role he plays, a homosexual painter, constantly under the heterosexual gun, often held by the nasty shell of the Nicholson character, and unfairly given the inarguably shortest end of the straw, yet always patient and accepting enough, until he reaches a point. Kinnear has an airy promptness and propensity for physical drama that make him a perfect counterpart for the other two stars.Something I find infinitely appealing about As Good As It Gets is its focus on the dog as a character. The dog is billed (as three different dogs) in the credits, and is developed as a character, as an interesting friendship grows between him and the Nicholson character, and grows into an adapter for the relationship between Nicholson and Kinnear.As Good As It Gets is one of the most well-written films I've seen recently. In it is hilarious humor, heartfelt character drama, and a chain of seemingly unrelated events with three different people rippling towards each other. Its extensive running time is due to its passionate development and concentration on these three very different people and their colliding lives.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Poor execution,This movie had some really poor attempts at humor.  The drama was sappy and what is the big deal about Helen Hunt's performance.  It's just a Mad About You rehash.  The woman so far CAN'T ACT.  Nicholson was business as usual and Greg Kinnear was definitely trying too hard.  I found this movie incredibly boring and the script was bland.  This seemed to me like a grown up version of Jerry Macguire.  This is overrated to say the least.,4.0,Anonymous,Romance
This truly IS As Good As it Gets,"The first time I saw this movie, I thought: 'Jack Nicholson is the greatest'. The second time I saw this movie, I thought: 'Greg Kinnear is really something'. I saw it a third time and thought: 'Wow, that Helen Hunt sure is amazing'. The fourth time I was in awe of Cuba Gooding Jr. Last time I saw it (must've been the 41st time), I wasn't thinking anymore, I was being part of the movie.I can't explain the charm and wit of this movie, but it's a movie you can't ignore with a good conscience. (Is that con-science?).Melvin is an interesting character with interesting flaws, he's interested in Carol the waitress and mostly uninterested in everything else. He has his own interesting views on absolutely everything, and he's easy to dislike - at first. But then you succumb and you fall in love with Melvin Udall, the writer of fiction for women (with no sense or accountability).This movie goes from A to Z. It opens and it ends. No overdoing here, just simple movie-magic.*****/*****",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Love Helen Hunt!!!!!!!,"Melvin is a romantic novelist who is a selfish manic compulsive who is rude and insulting to all he meets. When Melvin's gay neighbour is beaten up and robbed, Melvin agrees to look after his dog. The dog gives Melvin something to care about other than himself and his life is approaching normal until his regular waitress has to leave work to look after her asthmatic son and his neighbour wants his dog back. Melvin starts to realise that his life needs others for more than just selfish reasons.The big Oscar winner for Jack is recent years is enjoyable if you come to it knowing what to expect. The film is very sentimental but in a good way. The film is gently comic and amusing and the characters (although exaggerated) are winning and involving. The telling is a little long winded at times and the film could have been shorter but it is still enjoyable. It does tip over into sickly sentimentality at times and can be a bit syrupy but it comes with the territory.Nicholson is excellent and is the main reason it all works well. His un-PC Melvin is funny but also a character that you can hate and pity on several occasions. Kinnear is good because he is a solid understated character and not hammy or OTT like he can be. Hunt is good but is left with the majority of the syrup and sentiment where the other characters get more share of the laughs. Gooding Jr continues his trend of being good in over the top roles and is funny and happily avoids becoming a flaming gay stereotype.Overall this is a sentimental romantic comedy that is typical for the genre. The story wanders to it's point but the good cast, led by a great Nicholson, hold the whole thing together. A superior piece of sentimentality.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Well deserved Academies,"Recently became a big fan of Jack Nicolson but one thing was getting settled in my mind that this guy can do all the psycho kind of roles only. But this movie just took it all away. He was hilarious, his charactere was developed quite nicely from scene 1 itself. He very much carries his usual style but this time it was given different flavors. He looked relax compared to what he usually does. In short it was unbelievable that this guy can also work in a romantic comedy. Well talking of romance this movie had its own way of putting out. The lovey-dovey dialogues between Nicholson and Hunt were long but at the end they did leave a sweet taste on tongue and make you say yes these are ""GETTERS"". The chemistry between both is great too and performance wise also it looks as if they both are pulling each other's level up. Hence the Oscars.",,Anonymous,Romance

The film has beautiful character development right from the start, few subtleties encountered along its story line.  It takes place in New York and creeps its way through the psyche of the 3 main characters. Scored with appropriate music to keep pace with the film, its full of laughs and cry's and intellectual action if that is what you sometimes prefer. I first saw this movie on the plane, piped through the intercom unedited. It does have some cursing and bias, so perhaps not a family film.  Supporting cast members do a brilliant job.  The DVD includes commentary with James L Brooks, and the 3 main characters, a great addition to an Academy awarded film (1997). 9/10",,Anonymous,Romance
Jackie Simpson is the same as Bart Simpson!,"Jack Nicholson took home his third Oscar for ""As Good as It Gets"", playing grouchy Melvin Udall, who becomes friends - if a little unwillingly - with single mom Carol Connelly (Helen Hunt) and gay artist Simon Bishop (Greg Kinnear). With Nicholson in the role, it's pretty much guaranteed that the whole thing's gonna be neat. Especially that line about how to write women really well. I can't believe that ""Titanic"" defeated this for Best Picture (actually, my favorite 1997 movie was ""In & Out""). But, at least Nicholson and Hunt won Oscars...there was a reason that Leonardo DiCaprio wasn't nominated for an Oscar for ""Titanic"".

"Aged, and filled with unfortunate messages, but beautifully acted and still good","When I first watched this movie, when it came out, I thought it was great - a wonderful, evergreen movie that could not possibly lose its shine. I watched it a few times over the years. And more recently I watched it with my wife a few days ago.And... well, there was a question that suddenly entered my mind just before I pressed play, which was, ""how much misoginy is built into this movie?"" My memory was hazy, but I suspected the answer was ""quite a bit""... And I wasn't wrong, sadly.(minor spoilers)
The central plot is essentially Beauty and the Beast. Monster falls in love with Beauty, who eventually redeems him and turns him into a better person. The protagonist, Melvin, masterfully played by Jack Nicholson, may not be as hairy as the fairy tale, but he starts off as a racist, misogynist, homophobic, rude and aggressive straight old white guy. To belabour the point, they have him throw a cute dog down a garbage chute. In short, Melvin is bad through and through. To make this worse, this terrible behaviour of his is pinned on his mental health - he has OCD, therefore that excuses him being such a terrible human. It's like they were trying to play intersectionality bingo and annoy all the minority groups at once.Throughout the tale, Melvin continues to be very unpleasant (the profanity filter forbids me from using the right word here) to all kinds of people. He uses his considerable wealth as a successful author to sort out a medical problem that the poverty-stricken waitress Carol (masterfully played by Helen Hunt) can't solve herself, and then leverages that to coerce her into going on a road trip with her and his gay neighbour whom he's reluctantly (mostly because she might go on the trip) agreed to take to see his parents.During this trip, he continues to behave appallingly to everyone. At one point, after having it demanded of him under threat of her walking out of the restaurant, Melvin manages to summon one little compliment for the woman he apparently desires. He is immediately rewarded with both praise (""this is the best compliment I've ever received"") and a kiss. Eventually, without having changed all that much, just maybe softened up a little bit, but still being his weird and unpleasant self, Melvin essentially gets the girl.Along this is a side story where the gay neighbour Simon (masterfully played by Greg Kinnear) is beaten up, loses his flat and is broke (also due to medical bills; welcome to the US), and loses his inspiration to paint, which was how he earned money. He is also miraculously saved by the mere nearness of Carol, who seems to truly be a fairy tale princess, since she apparently not only turns Melvin into a slightly less awful human being, but also inspires a gay artist who normally paints male figures into painting female figures. Do I smell a whiff of some kind of ""she can turn gay people straight"" essence here? Maybe. Either way it's pretty dubious.So, in 2019, I found this loveable movie harder to love.What saves it, and deserves the 4 star rating, is the great performances by the actors, who bring this flawed script to life like the masters of their craft that they are. And when it finishes, your heart may well feel a bit warmed.But I wouldn't show it to my children, or to anyone lacking the ability to come to their own conclusions about the biases of the script. The underlying messages are too toxic.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Touching or Tragic?,"Are we bothered at the end of the film that nothing is really resolved between Melvin and Carol? Melvin will still be an obsessive compulsive and Carol will still be taking midnight trips to the hospital with Spencer. I find that to be an incredibly tragic element to the film. The fact that both characters found each other is touching, but Brooks structures it to show us that while there are happy endings, there's still reality.The brilliance of the film also lies within the simple fact that this is not a comedy. While Nicholson has many snappy one-liners and insult jokes at the expense of Greg Kinnear's Simon, the film is still as tragic and as deep as one of Shakespeare's sonnets. When Nicholson learns that Verdell is to be taken away from him, he's lost something that he has grown attached to and for a man in his position, it is loss at the deepest level. Verdell represents harmony for Melvin. Melvin is in harmony with the world when Verdell is around. There is a kinship between Verdell and Melvin that is quite lovely, but also quite tragic. As the film progresses, Carol represents harmony, thus their strong relationship emerges. Both Melvin and Carol are two lost souls searching not for the right answers, but for a place to start the search for the right answers.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Best film of 1997!,"This is by far the best film of 1997!  The hell with ""Titanic"".  That movie didn't have the performance level, script, and directing this one did.  Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt both won Oscars (Actor and Actress) for playing their very different New Yorker characters.  Jack (my favorite modern actor) is hilarious as an obsessive compulsive, and Helen (one of my favorite modern actresses) is the light of the movie as a waitress.  The only thing that suprises me is the fact that Greg Kinnear didn't win the Best Supporting Actor Oscar.  He is superb as a gay artist that gets attacked and is down on his luck.  Take my word if you  see one film from 1997, this is it.",,Anonymous,Romance
Good movie with great performances from Hunt and Nicholson. Proving most of all a relationship of friendship is the most important thing even if no romance is present.,"James L. Brooks has done it again he took a story and made it great with interesting characters. The performances of Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt turned just great the chemistry between the two was the best ever, both Oscar winners that were well deserved. I have to hand it to Jack time after time he proves he can take on characters with the most complex and odd behaviors just plain out crazy people. Nicholson gives a show-stopping performance as writer Melvin Udall, an obsessive-compulsive with one of Manhattan's meanest tempers. Melvin is to be helped along after his gay neighbor Simon (Greg Kinnear) is hospitalized and more unexpected kindness-comes along with waitress Carol Connelly (Helen Hunt) who helps put Melvin back in the human race. This film as you see in the end and really the whole time that a male and female relationship can be based on friendship and not sex and romance. It is the things we do for others that helps and makes our world seem better. Remember a friendship is important no matter what the age of a person or who they are. This is much the way the relationship of the characters of Jack and Helen can be described. Jack Nicholson also continues to get better with age his performance in this movie is a knockout! As Good As It Gets is a classic movie to watch just to feel important and see the great Jack at work.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
As Good As It Gets,"'As Good As It Gets' is about a man, Mr. Udall played by Jack Nicholson, with a social disorder that offends almost every person he comes in contact with. He makes rude and offensive comments and has no control over himself. He meets a waitress, Carol Connelly played by Helen Hunt, who is able to tolerate most of his behavior. She is not afraid to put him in his place when he steps over bounds with her. Mr. Udall comes to her restaurant where only she can serve him. He is rude to other customers if they are sitting in his spot. He finds that he is very dependent on her service and goes to her home when she stops coming to work. At first this is scary to her. Mr. Udall finds that Carol is home with her sick child and sends a much needed doctor over to tend to her child. She accepts reluctantly but only because her son's condition is pretty bad. Mr. Udall asks for a favor in return and this puts the two of them on a road trip. They go through some ups and downs and discover more and more about each other.The theme is centered on Mr. Udall and the emotional effect he has on people. He is such an abrasive person that it is unbelievable. He says outrageously offensive things to just about everyone he comes in contact with and he shows little to no remorse. Mr. Udall is lucky that he finds someone who is able to tolerate most of his behavior. Jack Nicholson plays the part of Mr. Udall perfectly.Mr. Udall's gay neighbor, Simon played by Greg Kinnear, brings out some of the good in Mr. Udall. It starts with Simon's dog, Verdell, who starts favoring Mr. Udall over Simon. This sounds impossible in theory but it happens. This is when the story starts to show a good side to Mr. Udall.This movie is like the movie ""Citizen Kane"". Both have a plot based on memorable characters. Charley Kane and Mr. Udall are both characters that made quite an impression on many. They are not individuals who are like everyone else. Both stand out in many different ways.The close up angles are used with great tasted. One example is when there is a close up on Verdell and Mr. Udall and it gives a lasting impression. The sound effects are great and add to the emotional effects of the story. The director, producer, and editors have done a wonderful job.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Better than expected,"I just saw this film for the first time. Did not expect much of it, but the versatile story, humor that struck me as well the true professionals Nicholson and Hunt made this drama an enjoyable piece of art. Via this film, I fell in love in Helen Hunt (I wish I met her some day!). Her ability to show various feelings without words is excellent (and heart-breaking). Also Nicholson does his body language in a way only a master can do. Those two great actors had a good balance (too often one superior actor/ actress steals all attention). The happy end was not a surprise, but it was created with a sensitive way not having too much of sugar and sentimentality.

One of Nicholson's best,"For all of its conventional plotting about an obsessive-compulsive curmudgeon (Jack Nicholson) who improves his personality at the urging of his gay neighbor (Greg Kinnear) and a waitress (Helen Hunt) who inspires his best behavior, this is one of the sharpest Hollywood comedies of the 1990s. Nicholson could play his role in his sleep (the Oscar he won should have gone to Robert Duvall for The Apostle), but his mischievous persona is precisely necessary to give heart to his seemingly heartless character, who is of all things a successful romance novelist. As a single mom with a chronically asthmatic young son, Hunt gives the film its conscience and integrity (along with plenty of wry humor), and she also won an Oscar for her wonderful performance. Greg Kinnear had to settle for an Oscar nomination (while co-writer-director James L. Brooks was inexplicably snubbed by Oscar that year), but his work was also singled out in the film's near-unanimous chorus of critical praise. It's questionable whether a romance between Hunt and the much older Nicholson is entirely believable, but this movie's smart enough--and charmingly funny enough--to make it seem endearingly possible.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

A film I will always keep close.,"This film delighted on first viewing and has continued to do so every time I watch it (which is frequently!!). It has so much that is perfectly done, so where to start. There are three strands running throughout and three 'leads' in each story. The main line and that which is most interesting is Nicholson's character  a writer with so many 'nervous ticks' phobias and prejudices both great and minor that they would make a pretty good film just on their own. Nicholson play's them for all he's worth which is considerable. Typical Nicholson but at his very best! The film is really about the blossoming of this Nicholson character goaded and teased in to becoming a 'human being' mostly by Helen Hunt (in her best performance ever for me) and to a lesser extent by Greg Kinnear (also acting at the top of his game). All three stories run concurrently and overlap throughout but each is fascinating and compelling in it's own right. Many things amaze about the film; just as each story can stand and make sense on it's own so each scene stands in own right and is a perfect and complete whole worth watching and thinking about. I'd like to end by paying tribute to the script that is enormously funny and so good that one nowhere finds an inappropriate or uncharacteristic word or phrase. All fits like a glove and of the hundreds of marvellous one liners here's two ""come in and try not to ruin everything by being yourself"" and ""The best thing you've got going for you is your willingness to humiliate yourself"" Try and see this movie if you haven't already done so.

Jolly Good Film,"There is no need to go into excessive or extensive detail here. Previous commentators have done that. I shall simply give my overall impression of this film. I was soon hooked, though. Once into it I began to care about these people, even the essentially bland character played by Greg Kinnear. Neither can disappear into the part as others can. I was always conscious that Nichlson and Hunt are Nicholson and Hunt.With his gruff visage and patented grumpiness and her quirky unconventional beauty, one always is aware of their identity. They play well against each other and well deserved their Academy Awards.Though I did not see this in a theatre, that is hardly necessary. (This is not Lawrence of Arabia.) I watched the edited for TV version, which doesn not diminish it in the intimate and close locations in which it is set, of which most are interior shots. Though set in New York, in this case, the setting is immaterial; unlike some other films (Barefoot in the Park, Klute, nd others), the New York sensibility is not needed.Though the language is somewhat explicit and coarse, it is milder than what can be heard on The Shield and in recent years on Law and Order. In Jakc Nicholson's case it is right in character.So enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

With a nod to Charles Dickens's Scrooge,"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)Brilliantly written, brilliantly acted and cleanly directed, this strange and wonderful tale is one of the best romantic comedies ever to hit the silver screen. Helen Hunt, as an unmarried thirtysomething waitress with a asthmatic five-year-old boy, is exquisite. Jack Nicholson, as a weird and mean obsessive compulsive writer named Melvin Udall, is even better than he usually is, and he is one of the great actors of our time, and even Greg Kinnear in a supporting role as the sensitive gay guy next door is outstanding.Of course I love impossible love, unrequited love, love that takes decades to culmination. This is a case of impossible love come true. Eat your heart out Nora Ephron! And you too Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks. But I couldn't help but think, considering the principals, how impossible it really is on another level. But never mind, in fact, all the better.James L. Brooks, who directed and who, along with Mark Andrus (from his story) wrote the script, is to be highly commended. The concept of an obsessive compulsive, self-centered (almost autistic) older guy, set in his ways beyond anything normal finding love is just wondrous strange. And a patient and caring, under-achieving, under-appreciated Manhattan waitress in a house dress, finding not just love but somebody who really knows who she is and what she's worth is also just wonderful.Wonderful, yes. A wonderful movie to lift the spirit. But As Good As It Gets is more than that. The dialogue is sharp and witty and big-city sophisticated and sometimes laugh out loud funny. The underlying statements about relationships and love in urban America are subtle and thought-provoking. So much is said beside the point. Yes, off to the side we find some street hustlers juxtaposed with someone sensitive, and we see how irrelevant they are and how he overcomes them and this brutal thing they have done to him. And off to the side we see again how irrelevant is the homophobia of a man lost in prejudice and self-hatred, and how it changes when he becomes aware and when he learns to love.The ancient rule in comedy, from the Greeks to Shakespeare to the musical comedy of the stage to the romantic comedies of the silver screen, has been young and attractive principals overcome obstacles and live happily ever after. Here we have obstacles of the most tiring sort, obstacles not of class or race or family, but of psychological problems, stuff straight out of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders--although to be technical, the symptoms of Melvin Udall are a cornucopia of psychiatric delight. The bitter, cutting, hateful insults that he showers on everyone, even his most devoted admirers, seem more characteristic of Tourette's Syndrome than of a obsessive compulsive disorder. But never mind. It works. In fact everything works in this movie, from the adorable little dog whom Melvin loves (""A dog...a blanky-blanky dog!"" who has captured his heart he tells us in amazement), to Greg Kinnear's character's friend (Cuba Gooding) trying to act tough, to Shirley Knight in a bit part as Helen Hunt's character's mother, to the cute little boy with asthma.However--and this is a big however--this movie is not for everybody, which accounts for some of the nasty reviews below. But ignore them. Trust me. This is a wonderful movie, although perhaps not for those who are homophobic or 13-years-old.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Feel- good film that is not too sentimental and which hits the right mark,"As good as it gets is one of my all-time favourite films ever and it's mainly all thanks to the wonderful performances given by the three main leads: Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt and Greg Kinnear. James L Brooks has this habit of churning out hit after hit, and this film is no exception. Even though this movie is 10 years old, it still manages to successfully retain that feel good factor and it looks as if it hasn't dated whatsoever. The story revolves around writer Marvin Udall- an OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder)sufferer and his attempts at becoming a better person and human being. at first, he is moody, aggressive, impatient, irritated and annoyed and often makes sarcastic remarks in the expense of other people. as the film progresses, Marvin changes as a person overnight and thus, these changes are ultimately as a result of the experiences and difficulties as encountered, shared and faced by Carol (Hunt) and Simon (Kinnear). Carol is a single mother, who lives with her mother and works as a waitress and of whom has to contend with looking after and caring for her sick son; Simon meanwhile is a gay guy who earns his living as an artist. However, his life changes completely after an incident where he is set upon and is physically beaten to a pulp by a bunch of vandals. Eventually,and in one point in the film, he ends up in a wheelchair and realises that his life is not going to get any better; however, when Marvin realises the errors of his ways after he taunts Simon and he, tries to hit back in retaliation, the events which follow afterwards lead to Marvin realising the importance of the good things that he has in his life.And that it is because of these two individuals in Simon and Carol, that they remind him that all the good one does, does indeed prevail over the bad in life.This is an excellent film that has a positive moral message running through it and that while it remains a comedy, the sentimentality is not too syrupy and not too sickly sweet, and yet at the same time, it is not underplayed in contrast to other romantic comedies throughout. It has the right balance of happy and sad moments, to a extent to which it is at an equal level playing field and keeps the story flowing nicely .Therefore, As good as it gets is arguably one of the best romantic comedies to have ever existed, period.

Jack Nicholson the obsessive romance writer, Melvin Udall, who lives in an up-scale Manhattan apartment across the hall from a gay artist, Simon Bishop (Greg Kinnear) and his adorable dog, Verdell. Simon is beaten up by robbers, and Melvin, the pessimistic, bitter, complaining, obsessive-compulsive, and prejudicial shut-in, has Simon's dog forced on him, while Simon's still in the hospital. Melvin grows affectionate towards the dog, and the good in him begins to leak out. The story also centralizes around Carol Connelly (Helen Hunt), a waitress at Melvin's only restaurant and who has a chronically sick child, Spencer. The story continues with the three of them traveling together to Simon's parents' house in the south of Baltimore. Melvin almost wins Carol over, but blows it. They come back to New York after the trip with Simon feeling a new sense of hope in his life, as well as Carol. The movie doesn't end there, but I don't want to give away the ending. I will say this, however. Melvin really is a good man on the inside, despite all of his short comings and sardonic remarks. The story is about finding yourself and love in your adulthood, and coming to terms with it. The only grievance I had with the movie was that it kind of went on for too long, but it's definitely worth it.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
What if this is as good as it gets?,"'What if this is as good as it gets?' So asks Melvin Udall, a selfish, rude, and very OCD romance novel author. He spends his day doing exactly as he pleases, not caring in the least about others feelings or opinions. Except for maybe Carol Connelly, the waitress at the diner he attends every morning.Wonderfully realized and perfectly acted characters are the basis of 'As Good as it Gets', a brilliant and heartwarming comedy. Jack Nicholson captures the character of Melvin both hilariously and heartbreakingly, often at the same time. Helen Hunt masterfully relates the many different layers of Carol, giving one of the most realistic performances I think I've ever seen on screen. And then there's Greg Kinnear, in one of his best roles, as Melvin's gay neighbor who becomes his friend. The only person I didn't care for was Cuba Gooding Jr. His overacting felt out of place and annoying amongst these other masters at work.'As Good as it Gets' is all too often pushed aside as just a silly romantic comedy, but it's so much more. Melvin and Carol relate to each other in a moving and amazing way. He is selfish and rude, so much that she can scarcely stand to be around him for an entire evening. Yet in the same moments they are clearly soul mates intended only for one another. She is the only one who can put up with him, and he sees in her a beauty that words can't really describe. There are moments when you'll love Melvin and see the wonderful human being inside-yet seconds later he'll destroy that feeling by his stinging words. Yet Carol can put up with him. Carol can forgive him. Carol can love him.Much like their relationship the movie is hard to describe in words. See the movie. You'll understand a little better then. All I can say is that if this IS as good as it gets, then I'm happy. An hilarious and heartwarming film. 8/10 stars!Jay Addison",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

An overrated and mediocre mix of comedy and drama.,"If this is as good as it gets I'll quit watching films. Has a slow start but improves after the first half-hour or so. Nicholson is good - though definitely not brilliant - and Hunt is forgettable. The film as a whole is semi-entertaining. However, there aren't any belly-laugh moments. But the biggest problem are the drama to comedy (and vice versa) transitions which tend to ruin the comedic flow of the film. Although worth checking out, the film is overrated. It's one of those comedies which cause major hysteria among both critics and (probably) viewers, and for totally unfathomable reasons. Oscar Shmoscar; this is most definitely not one of Nicholson's best roles. To be more specific, I will name some films where he was better: ""One Flew"", ""The Shining"", ""Hoffa"", ""The Last Detail"", and ""Wolf"". As for Helen Hunt, her Oscar is one in a series of undeserved Oscars for actors who have nepotism to thank for their illustrious careers. How does that old saying go?... ""Success is 10% hard work, 90% nepotism"".",,Anonymous,Romance
Great performances in a very good and entertaining film,"""As Good as it Gets"" shows that comedies can have something more than laughs and silliness.Jack Nicholson (playing Melvin Udall, a very unusual man) and Helen Hunt (playing Carol, a very nice waitress and an ordinary person) really deserved the Oscar. I've already known that Nicholson was a great actor, but Helen surprised me. She's a wonderful and graceful actress; one of my favorite ones. Her character has the gift to change the life of a cold and boring man like Melvin. I think Greg Kinnear should have won the Oscar (he's much more better than Robin Williams).I can compare ""As Good as it Gets"" with another great comedy released recently - ""Notting Hill"". They both show you the disabilities and the joy of ordinary people (even if he is a maniac man, like Melvin Udall, or the most famous movie star, like Anna Scott - Julia Roberts - in ""Notting Hill"").I think this film wouldn't be very good with other actors, but it's a very human comedy and it had the attention it deserved.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
really good,"OK, I thought this movie is seriously under-rated, I mean 7.8, common. I thought that the movie was not long enough. That's the only bad thing about the movie. Helen hunt has done a great job. She really got into her character. Jack Nicholson as usual never, never disappoint. He's the man. The perfection in the character. He has given no chance of doubting him. No one, and I mean no one would have best suited for the role. Whenever he disappears from the screen you then wait for him to return as soon as possible. I did not get enough of him. That's why I said the movie was not long enough. And how could anyone forget Greg Kinnear the supporting man. He was also I thought best suited for the role. He has not overacted or anything like that as a gay. He knows what he's doing no doubt about that. And of course Cuba Gooding Jr. A small part but done with of course greatness. Three Oscar winners and an Oscar nominee what do you expect? Just watch the movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Could've got so much better,"Huge Emotions Interpreter-director's another relationship-rally goes wrong in one detail and with that in everything: Jack Nicholson's mean and racist s.o.b. is GENUINELY sick person, having compulsive neurosis disorder or something like that. Not so much though that he'd be permanently committed or that Helen Hunt's good-looking (and seemingly sane) thirty-something waitress wouldn't fall for the bastard. He's been the way he is 50 years or so, he have had some treatment, seen shrinks etc, so he's not going to improve. He is and will be sick in his mind in the most unbearable way. But Hunt's character just couldn't do better. Very believable. But in the end, and putting it all together, I guess the movie's real message is that even an ignorant and disliked hetero male still succeeds in this world of ours over single-parent mothers and homosexuals. At least Nicholson's character seems to be economically stable and even ""satisfied"" by his own standards. He has the privilege to safely assume in his state of mind that everything bad is always other people's fault and period.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Not as good as it gets, but it is good.","This is a film that is driven by characters and thankfully the actors and actresses in this film do a good job so it makes for a nice comedy/drama film. Though I would say it is a bit more comedy than drama. It is also a film with more than a couple of uncomfortable scenes within it. You know the type of scene, the one that just makes you feel like turning the channel. The film's plot is basically a man with ocd and is a writer is doing his thing when he eventually gets called on acting a bit of an arrogant uncaring guy all the time. He gets forced a bit to watch his gay neighbor's dog though he can not stand the dog and he is forced to deal with the fact the waitress he has to have at a local restaurant has a son who is sick and in need of medical attention and she is not able to work at her job at times thanks to this. Though a funny thing happens, he starts to actually become attached to the dog and he does things that are not like the persona he shows the world. The movie is very good as Jack Nicholson is very great as Melvin, the man with the ocd. Greg Kinnear is also very good in his role as is Helen Hunt and Cuba Gooding Jr. It is interesting to see how Melvin changes throughout the film and the film ends perfectly as it does so simply.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Under-rated for some reason...,"This may be somewhat under-rated as I expect it deserves to be in the top 250 but for some reason it doesn't quite cut it with the voters out there. I cannot understand why, reason be it that Helen Hunt puts a little too much sentimentality into her role that it comes off as unrealistic, or maybe Greg Kinnear isn't a convincing homosexual, I surely could expect any of these reasons to give less the score. Maybe some witless fool thinks that Kate Winslet should have won the Best Actress Oscar for Titanic, instead of Helen Hunt. All these maybes yet it all comes down to one thing. Is the film enjoyable? Yes is the answer, it surpasses this goal with flying colours. That is why I simply cannot comprehend a feasible reason to why it is not given a decent rating.Jack Nicholson is on supreme form. he uses the other actors like a drug addict uses cocaine, he sucks them in, he takes their surroundings and their feelings and gives a response or an expression that is brilliant, and that is so accurate that it is astonishing to think anyone could do this. It is a performance that is also hilarious, slow-paced yet a rather enlightening talent that makes me want to watch it over and over.James 'The Simpsons' Brooks directs with flair too, as he doesn't aim for the heart-felt close ups or the excessive camera shots of their surroundings, like what James Cameron tended to do for Titanic, he simply shows the stars in their most basic forms moving around and doing what would normally be likened to a soap opera. And that is this films defining characteristic. It tries to give off an atmosphere that says this is reality, this is realistic and it does it fantastically, except for the prolonged breakdowns that Helen continually goes into. I think that is why I give it a nine. I think it is a great film, except for the seldom moments of unrealism mainly conveyed by the 1998 Best Actress Oscar . But overall I think Jack makes the film come alive, and that certainly makes for enjoyable viewing.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Helen Hunts performance as the down trod single mother is perfect, we begin with a view that she is just a run of the mill waitress with no substance, but anyone who knows any single mothers knows they are all exceptional people, and with a child with special needs even more so. Jack Nicholson shows the talent that we all know is there and he does it without trying.. love ya Jack.

Jackson can't beat Udall,"Most films are weakened by questionable dialogue but redeemed by a great premise or resolution. James L. Brooks' 'As Good as It Gets' is quite the reverse: the dialogue is fantastic, but the audience can't buy into the premise for one second. I know, this has been reviewed to death, but I just saw it again when I was home last month and had to laugh all over. Nicholson should get an award for just standing still! His expressions in this movie are priceless. His interaction with Helen Hunt (who may well be one of the best actresses around) make this movie not only believable but also heart warming.Jack Nicholson, in one of his career's best roles, plays Melvin Udall, an obsessive compulsive romance writer who is a regular at the restaurant where Carol Connelly (Helen Hunt) works. He insists that she always be his waitress, and she obliges-----not because she likes him, but because... well, the guy is crazy...Throw in Greg Kinnear in an outstanding performance as a gay artist, living within an inch of poverty and Cuba Gooding, Jr., his promoter. And let's not forget his dog! Kinnear makes the mistake of picking the wrong person for a model and gets mugged - badly - is hospitalized, beaten, broken and penniless. While he is laid up in the hospital who gets stuck with the dog but Nicholson - the last person in the world you should ever give a dog to! Love prevails, the dog wins out in the end. Nicholson is hooked and not only that, finds the dog gets him some brownie points with the ladies.1997 was a year that left film-goers a trifle loopy-headed-----Titanic was at the forefront of everybody's mind, and resultantly good art was washed out-----this is the only possible explanation for As Good as It Gets' snafuing Best Picture nomination. Nicholson and Hunt's Best Actor/Actress awards were, however, well-deserved. Despite Udall's snarky and bitter nature, Nicholson provides him with a humanity and resonance that few actors could. Greg Kinnear's prominence has risen since 1997, but his strengths still show here in his role as Simon the Gay Neighbor.However critics panned this movie for being totally unbelievable. I would have to agree-why would Carol fall for Melvin? Why does Melvin change his ways after so many years of acid-tongued insults? I don't know. I know people who disliked the film because Melvin was such a you-know-what. Personally, I love the evil retorts he hurls at any innocent bystander. Maybe it's a sick pleasure, but Nicholson's delivery is perfect and I couldn't help but laugh as he takes on everyone.The film does have its dull moments, but Jack's one-of-a-kind performance makes it all worthwhile. There is nobody, and I mean NOBODY, who could've played Melvin better than him.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"This movie truly is ""As Good As It Gets""","This movie truly is ""As Good As It Gets"". Outstanding acting, bizarre, yet amazing plot, this movie has got it all! Jack Nicholson plays a marvelous role as Melvin Udall, a seemingly cruel, middle-aged man, who is a successful romantic storywriter. Melvin is extremely rude to his neighbours, especially to his gay neighbour Simon Bishop, played by Greg Kinnear. Greg is a remarkable actor in this film. In fact, Greg was nominated for best supporting actor, along with Nicholson for best actor and Helen Hunt for best actress. The film was nominated for best picture and best screenplay for the 1997 Academy Awards. Greg plays the role of a gay artist who is mugged while working in his home studio. During his recuperation he has to leave his dog in the hands of his spiteful neighbour. In Simon's absence an unlikely friendship grows between Melvin and his neighbour's dog. The story unfolds to show that this uncaring man can indeed have feelings for another being, in this case the dog. You also see that Melvin has feelings for someone other than the dog. He has a daily routine of going to a restaurant. He orders the same meal by the same waitress everyday. One day the waitress, Carol Connelly, played by Helen Hunt, misses work because of her son's illness. Melvin refuses to eat until Carol returns to work. He can't live out his daily routine without Carol. He finds that he needs her. He pays for a home doctor for Carol's son to get Carol back at work. But this only scares her. Eventually they all learn to love one another. The directing in this movie was reasonable. The director was James L. Brooks. This movie is a bit better than other movie that he has directed, such as I'll Do Anything (1994), Broadcast News (1987) and Terms of Endearment (1983). The plot of this movie is interesting. It is believable, but not likely to happen. As Good As It Gets is an original film. No film I know is similar to it at all. I doubt there is any chance of any sequel to this movie. The sound in the movie isn't really noticeable in the film. However, perhaps that is fine. If the sound were out of place, possibly it would have been more noticeable. That would be unpleasant. One sequence in this film that struck me as outstanding was when Nicholson went to the doctor for help. He had what is called obsessive-compulsive disorder. The doctor refuses to help him because he made no appointment. On his way out he passes through the waiting room. He stops and turns to everyone and say ""Have you ever thought what if this is as good as it gets?"" I figure that was a turning point in his life. He realizes that life might not get any better and he should live it to its fullest. The photography and camera angles contributed to this scene to make it perfect. The movie was filmed in California, Manhattan and Brooklyn, New York. It was noticeable that the movie was filmed in New York, because the location on scenes looked like New York. One scene in the movie had exceptional make-up. The scene where you see Melvin's neighbour Greg in the hospital after he is mugged. He is so bruised up. It looked so real. In the movie when Nicholson was walking on the sidewalk he would always make sure he didn't step on the cracks. This was because of his obsessive-compulsive disorder. He did this every time he went out. Eventually after taking his neighbour's dog out with him the dog started to do the same. This is considered a stunt. The stunt crew created a thin string fence above each crack in the sidewalk. The string fence was not visible to the viewer, but the dog would have to step over the string when walking over a crack. However nothing that occurred was that dangerous to warrant a major stunt scene. The editing in this movie was done fairly well. There are no noticeable mistakes. I'm sure special effects were used, but none were obvious in the movie. As Good As It Gets was produced and directed by James L. Brooks. Tristar Pictures financed and distributed the film. The film was successful.As Good As It Gets is a good comedy, has a good love story and great acting. It is not that much of a convincing movie, however it has wonderful writing and acting. It's a movie I would recommend.",,Anonymous,Romance

A Beautifully filmed drama-comedy,"No CGI. No special effects. No over-the-top action sequences. Just pure cinema.Acting: Jack Nicholson might as well be the best actor of the later 20th century alongside Meryl Streep. Having subtle OCD myself, I was amazed at the authenticity with which Jack Nicholson displayed his role. You kind of just end up saying the wrong things at the wrong time, display hatred towards the more or less normal and sort of abnormal aspects of life, and have an obsession towards cleanliness. Jack, Helen Hunt and Greg Kinnear are the pillars of this movie. The talent which Helen brings to the table is unbelievable. Greg Kinnear does full justice to his role as well. You just feel like you've known a couple of people with similar traits all your life and that is exactly where this movie succeeds in balancing comedy with drama and realism. It isn't one of those lame Adam Sandler rom-com flicks. This movie just has a bit of everything, and keeps moving at a strong pace. You want to watch true cinema at the end of the day. This movie fulfills that duty.The Movie: Not one minute of this movie's runtime would you feel bored and just curious to just press the fast forward button. You feel like you're in the movie. Jack Nicholson is a legend. Truly. Helen Hunt joins the fun by bringing an equal amount of realism to her craft. She plays a loving mother who works as a waitress and is just looking for a male companion who would understand her situation and cater to both her son's and her own needs. Jack Nicholson is an author and an OCD infused character who goes to the restaurant where she serves and just does not feel comfortable if she doesn't serve him. Greg Kinnear's back story and how the three get connected and how the story moves forward is the basic crux of the film. Besides all these things, there are also a lot of beautiful themes that one must look upon, such as: A younger woman and an older man. Can they be romantically compatible?There are definitely more themes, but I don't want to give them away and end up spoiling the viewer's experience of the movie.Story, Screenplay and Direction:James L. Brooks definitely does justice to Mark Andrus's taut screenplay. It's like they both complement each other. There is not one wasted shot, and no wasted screen-time for any of the actors. It is just beautifully evened out. Hans Zimmer provides a fun-filled background score, which is vastly different from the scores he writes today. I didn't know that it was Zimmer's score until I went through the credits. John Bailey's cinematography is beautiful and makes you wonder if this really was a 1997 film.Overall, this is a wonderful film which has many recurring themes, and must be watched at least twice. I hadn't known that this was nominated for a couple of Oscars, and actually ended up winning two until I had finished watching the film. But then, I really felt that Nicholson, Helen Hunt, and Greg should at least have been nominated for their work in the film, and was glad to see that Nicholson and Helen won an Oscar for their work. This was Jack's 3rd Oscar win with a whopping 12 nominations and Helen's first win and nomination. Just sit back on one beautiful day and enjoy this 139-minute film to its fullest.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Nicholson steals the show,"Yes, the story is contrived, not even slightly realistic, nor is it beleivable that Carol the waitress would be in the least bit attracted to Melvin.  However Nicholson turns in one of his most unforgettable performances in years.  His neurotic, self-serving, obsessive compulsive behavior is amazing to watch. His crass comments and facial expressions are brilliantly acted.  I suppose Helen Hunt did the best she could with what she had to work with for her character, but nobody flip-flops that much in one movie.  One minute she hates him, the next she loves him... Yeah, sure the guy is sick and he needs help.  But he's a total jerk!  It must have been a really weak year for female leads for her to have won.  Greg Kinnear deserved to win best supporting actor more than Helen Hunt deserved her best actress award. I also enjoyed the too few scenes with Cuba Gooding, one of the most charismatic young actors going.  Nicholson however carries this thing on his back.

This Movie Is As Good As It Gets...,"I'm not into chick-flicks. Helen Hunt is the ultimate Chick in ANY chick-flick. I approach anything she's in with a certain amount of caution...And even though this movie rubs up dangerously close to chick-flick status, the saving grace in this entire movie is Jack Nicholson and his flawless timing and execution. The man is most definatly the ultimate acting machine. For me it's always been a toss-up between him and Deniro, but you know what? Lately Deniro is becoming too one-dimensional...how many different ways can you play ""Jimmy Conway"" anyway? By contrast, Nicholson is not afraid to take on different roles and regardless of the material, the man fills the screen with his presence. In THIS movie, virtually every line he has leaves you off-balance, appalled, and delighted all at the same time.

I don't...get it,"From the very beginning I was confused by this film. Naturally seeing it starred Nicholson I was expecting to love it, but it was just...odd. There were a few amusing scenes, but for the most part I just couldn't figure this movie out. I kept waiting for it to come together somehow, but it never did. It just felt disorganized and kind of all over the place. I still loved Nicholson. His character is very interesting, even if I don't fully understand what's going on. At one moment Nicholson's character said something so endearing I upped my rating from 3 out of 10 to 4.

'You make me want to be a better man' (Udall),"The title is derived from a comment Udall makes as he exits through the waiting room of patients of the Psychiatrist helping him with his OCD, ""What if this is as good as it gets?""Jack Nicholson as the successful author Udall is just about as good as Nicholson gets. Plus Helen Hunt and Greg Kinnear are just perfect in their respective roles. This is a superb movie overall, smartly written and filmed. And very, very funny within the context of a serious story.Having enjoyed it now for the sixth time now in April 2023, it is the kind of movie that is very good on first viewing, and is even better on subsequent viewings, after you know the basic story line and can appreciate all the subtle points.Udall (Nicholson) is a successful author, but in his 'normal' life is not very normal at all - an obsessive/compulsive personality, fastidious washing of hands with fresh bars of soap, bringing his own plastic ware to dine, avoiding touching others, and never stepping on a crack. And nearly always managing to say exactly the wrong thing.His neighbor is a gay artist (Kinnear) with a little dog. His waitress is played by Hunt, who has a sickly boy, and Udall provides them with a good doctor, just so she can return to work and be his waitress. His grander motive is her companionship.The story arc is very well conceived, every time I watch it I thoroughly enjoy it. I own the DVD.",,Anonymous,Romance

Its one of those films that I can watch over and over again and not get tired of it.Jack Nicholson plays a great part in his Oscar winning performance as the romantic novelist Melvin Udall who has a compulsive disorder. Helen Hunt also gives an Oscar winning performance as Melvins waitress Carol. Both actors thoroughly deserved their Oscars. The screenplay was well written by James L.

Didn't do anything for me,"Jack Nicholson, who is a darn good actor plays Melvin a guy with obsessive compulsive disorder. He meets a waitress played by Helen Hunt to whom he starts caring about and he finally gets involved with his gay neighbor, Played by Greg Kinear who was horribly beaten and robbed when he had to take care of his cute little pampered dog.I didn't much care about any of these characters after a while. The reason why I gave it a 3 is because the only time I was interested and saddened was for the neighbor that got senselessly beaten and robbed. Other than that, it was a soap-opera mess and not something I tend to want to pay for in feature films. The story got bogged down into sentimentality and to deliberately attract Oscar voters with all the unwritten Oscar rules to give it notice.OCD is neither interesting or entertainment worthy in this instance and compound that with the overall meanness of Melvin, it's just not something that would make me care. Helen Hunt's character was depressing as well as annoying - but what turned me off from this film is that this is all something I can run into everyday, so honestly I wouldn't spend my time looking at a film of something I can just look at down my hall way or walk the street daily to see.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

Comedy-of-ills isn't aging well,"This looked really fresh in 1997, but the story of cantankerous, people-phobic writer who manages to charm both a waitress and a gay male neighbor isn't the touching look at ""ordinary lives"" that it once was. Hatred and hostility in the world has now made Jack Nicholson's leading characterization less funny and more despicable (he calls the gay man's friends ""fudgepackers"" and insults the waitress almost continually). Helen Hunt gives more here than she ever did on her TV-sitcom ""Mad About You"", but her Oscar-win for Best Actress came for just one really astounding scene (at her restaurant when tells Nicholson off); the rest of her time on screen is spent exercising actorly tics (faraway smiles and pungent remarks). Greg Kinnear, as Nicholson's neighbor, does well with a shallow, insulting role, and poor Cuba Gooding, Jr. gets lost in the shuffle as Kinnear's business partner. The film is long and windy--it's full of comedic hot air--and the second-act transformation of several characters is done without much thought or insight, yet a great deal of Hollywood-ized superficiality. ** from ****",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Excellent!... But too long...,"Very well scripted with some really great one-liners; mostly delivered by Jack Nicholson; although there is one point where Greg Kinnear does a rather good impression. Both Jack and Helen Hunt put in great performances that were worthy of praise. My main niggle is that it is way too long; it could have easily been shortened by at least 20 minutes and that would have maybe given it a little more punch. Not that I was bored you understand, far from it, I just felt it would have benefited from being a little shorter. Enough of that; it's a very well made film with some excellent performances and a touching, well written, script.

Yes! This is a great movie. Not everyone will get it.,"This is a film about isolated people showing each other, at different turns, kindness and ending up happier than they were. And it is a film about a writer, a far from empathetic character, starting the process of becoming a better person.This is really a film for persons who have had lots of quality time with, or been, someone like Melvin Udall - isolated, and socially, and emotionally unaware. Without that experience base, it's probably hard to care about.The rest of us will see mirrors in Melvin's words and the reactions of Carol, Simon, and others. You can cringe at some horrible things that he says, wince at his mistakes, nod at an unpleasant event he brings on himself, and again as he starts to get it.There's nothing close to a typical romance in this film. Melvin is not much of a prize. After Melvin sends a financial lifeline (of a sort), Carol realizes that he must have a crush on her. She's appreciative, but concerned about what it means having THIS guy interested in her. One can only wonder how many women have had experiences like this with socially and emotionally unaware guys.Carol spends part of the film impatient with him, wondering what's with him, and wondering what's there, and asking whether it'd be workable or not. One has to wonder how many women have found themselves doing this, over the eons.The other subtext is about the way that Melvin, Carol, and Simon all end the film happier than they started, after experiencing time together and each showing the other kindnesses.The way that these aspects of life are familiar to people, I think, is a big reason why the film ended up walking off with a couple of Oscars.It deserves them.

Compelling Performance by Jack Nicholson!,"As romantic comedies go, As Good as It Gets is near the top tier. It's funny, sweet, and compelling all at the same time, and these are the kind of films which allow me to enjoy the rom-com. This film is not perfect as some scenes drag on and it is a bit on the long side, but it's well-acted and the characters are a big strong point for the film itself thanks to the endearing performances by Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt, and Greg Kinnear.James L. Brooks film tells the story of what happens when an elderly romance author, a Manhattan waitress, and a gay artist come together on a road trip from New York City to Baltimore. It's an unlikely friendship that blossoms between the three.The acting is incredible. Jack Nicholson deserves his Oscar for his excellent, over-the-top acting. I have never big a big fan of Helen Hunt, but she gives an excellent performance here as the waitress who is trying to provide for her always-sick son. Also, Greg Kinnear was excellent as Jack's neighbor and I liked how he doesn't give an over-the-top performance to prove that his character is gay.Overall, As Good as It Gets is a pleasurable romantic comedy that is sweet and endearing. I can only really enjoy the very good rom coms and this is one of those. With a little more editing, this film could have been perfect. But thanks to the compelling performances of the three leads, this film is near perfection. It shows that anyone can love if you put your heart to it. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

One of the best three films of 1997 !,"The Oscar nominations were well deserved in this one and the actor winners made for an excellent pair.  The story entices slowly in the beginning, but Nicholson's wit and humour won't keep you waiting for long.  It's a great film during which you'll laugh, you'll cry and you'll feel the full range of emotions that the character Melvin, the seemingly hopeless obsessive/ compulsive writer feels and experiences with depth and intensity. There isn't enough I can say about this film, having been a fan of Nicholson's for may years, except that this may be his magnum opus.  Newbe's Hunt and Kinnear were both definite Oscar calibre as well, and Cuba Gooding Jr. continues to impress, even here in a minor role. One of the three best films of 1997 in my opinion; get to the cinemas NOW while you can still catch it. Top rating (5 stars of 5) !",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""You Make Me Want To Be A Better Man.""","""As Good As It Gets"" may appear to be about mean man with OCD, a stressed waitress, and a gay visual artist, but it is actually about trying to be a better person. When Nicholson says the film's most famous line, the message becomes very clear. We get that this entertaining character study is trying to tell us something, but not until the end to we finally get what it is.The great Jack Nicholson won his third and final Oscar for what is my favourite performance of his. This is not his best movie (I simply think ""Cuckoo's Nest"" and ""Shining"" are examples of better films he has done) but it is my favourite performance of his. Like his great roles of the past, his character of misanthropic author Melvin Udall has many layers. Unlike his other roles, the theme of trying to better one's self is displayed with such richness and compassion that it is hard not to want to follow suit. Melvin hates everyone, and most people in today's world feel that way too. And when Melvin and the two others change, it is done with necessity. Melvin also displays classic obsessive compulsive disorder--another obstacle he needs to overcome.Melvin lives in Manhattan where he enjoys insulting his neighbour, Simon (Greg Kinnear) who happens to be a gay artist and must do the same things at his favourite restaurant with the same waitress, Carol (Helen Hunt) waiting on him. Carol's son has severe asthma and Melvin overhears her talking about it. He feels a little bad about it. When Simon is brutally beaten in a setup with his model (Skeet Ulrich), Melvin must look after Simon's dog. Why Simon got beaten up is barely looked upon and perhaps the biggest flaw this movie has. While looking after the dog, he instantly falls in love with it and is heartbroken when Simon returns home and takes the dog. Since Simon is gay, it takes a little longer for Melvin to become his friend, but they obviously do. Since Simon's injuries are so severe, he intends on heading to Baltimore to see if his parents can help pay the medical bills. Melvin feels it is his duty to escort his new friend and takes Carol along with them.Carol does not like Melvin, but somewhere beneath his cruel exterior lies someone who is fond of this waitress. With her son's health worsening, she stays home and thinks about getting work closer to home. Melvin helps her pay for some medical treatments, much to her surprise. He says he wants her to keep waiting on him, but he actually cares for the both of them.Carol and Simon feel sorry for themselves (and justifiably so), but they try to get out of their stupors. This trio of original characters are the best people suited to make them find their happy places.The final act seemed as though they tried stretching it out, but it didn't bother me. The positive nuances that these three have gone through is extraordinary. And a thing I liked was how well the mix of comedy and drama blended. There are some seriously sad scenes followed by very humorous bits. Yet somehow, it never feels very uneven. Each and every emotion is rightfully earned.With three first-rate performances directed by the great James L. Brooks and a life-affirming message, this one comes highly recommended by me.4/4",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

A great original movie.,"It is always nice going to see a film that is original not only that but add comedy, a fresh story with just using a few characters no extra special effects or fluff. Its a great formula that creates a lot of beauty, warmth and emotion. The characters absolutely make this movie it was like they became the characters. This movie had a lot of warmth and overall goodness. Jack Nicholson had a great performance playing someone with ocd and a little on the bitter side. Helen Hunt and Greg Kinnear also played the parts perfectly and showed a lot of convincing emotions that didn't even seem like they were acting. The way all the characters played their parts it was hard to predict what was going to happen next even when you know what would be said or how they would act in a certain situation. The engaging and captivating story of a troubled insecure man, who then helps and insecure waitress and the unlikely bond they develop to being almost soul mates after some tribulations and self learning. Kinnear's character seems to be put in the position as a bridge and barrier between Jack and Helen. It is interesting that even with all their differences, they still share some of the same problems and those seem to bring all of them together. The one important message while seeing this was that regardless of the road blocks life throws at us that keep us from achieving happiness, there is still ways we can find to take a step forward and reverse our perceived misfortunes. This was one of best romantic comedies that has come from Hollywood and it is successful in entertaining the audience. Overall a sentimental romantic comedy that is really made better with the performance on Jack Nicholson.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
The usual elements,"Cranky misogynist, an adorable dog, cute female lead, and a gay neighbor combined to produce a boring, disappointing piece of junk. I rented this for my late wife, who loved Nicholson, and I knew something was wrong when she sat stone faced through it, just as I did. Most of the film I could see what was coming down the track, but rather than surprise me, Brooks kept the train on schedule. Both wife and I got to the point where we did not want to see Nicholson redeemed, but we weren't spared.....and his redemption seemed so sudden, so 'hey it's time to be Mr. Nice now.'Of course we had that scene so beloved of directors: three people sitting in convertible, motoring down the highway with the top down, doing a sedate 35-40, and holding a normal conversation instead of trying to shout over the wind.27 years before this excretion, Nicholson played the young Jonathan Fuerst in Carnal Knowledge, growing into a unrepentant middle age Lothario.

Great!,"I had heard As Good As It Gets was a great film, but then again, I was told Anaconda was a great film, so I didn't know what it was going to be like. The result of As Good As It Gets was very good indeed, actually, forget that. It was great!Melvin, played by an impressive Jack Nicholson, earns his crust, absurdly, writing cheesy romance novels, and lives as reclusively as he can in a Manhattan apartment. One of his obsessive rituals is breakfasting daily at a cafe where only salty waitress Carol (Helen Hunt) - a single mother with her own stressful woes - will tolerate Melvin's diatribes and sass him back.When Simon (Greg Kinnear), a gay artist who lives across the hall, is hospitalised, old misery-guts Melvin is coerced by Simon's agent (Cuba Gooding Jr.) into caring for his despised neighbour's ugly but endearing mutt and - you betcha! - bonding is soon afoot as the pooch wags its way into Melvin's corroded heart. Thus softened up, Melvin is reluctantly but irrevocably goaded into a series of grudging good deeds which are entirely motivated by self-interest but which inch him in the general direction of humanity and improbable but superb redemption.Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt both won Academy Awards for their memorable, brilliant performances, but the rest of the cast aren't bad when it comes to acting. Greg Kinear is excellent, Cuba Gooding Jr. is great as usual and a brief but impressive performance from Skeet Ulrich secures As Good As It Gets' supporting cast. James L.

Jack Nicholson (8.5),"Jack Nicholson and his tremendous acting even get ahead of the movie, this movie is watched even to just watch Jack Nicholson.It's actually pretty good in the movie I think it has everything to be in a movie different, fluent, funny, and emotional.

It doesn't get very good,"Time's marched on enough to the point where a number of movies that have come out in my lifetime now feel dated. It happened with High Fidelity when I revisited that last year, and it happened when I watched As Good As It Gets for the first time tonight.Jack Nicholson's character being a bigot and becoming nicer throughout the movie isn't automatically a bad idea. It's more that I think they make him a little too bigoted, and being so awful at the start makes it easy to tell how his character will change by the end.Maybe in a brisk little 90-minute movie a predictable character arc wouldn't be such a huge problem, but this is a bloated 138 minutes. The writers have got time to make him start a little cranky, get more cranky, and then redeem himself, I don't know. Something more interesting or satisfying has to be done in a movie this long- this is not as good as this kind of premise gets.Nicholson is admittedly good, and Helen Hunt does a lot with a pretty thankless role, but I don't think any actors could make the relationship that develops between these two characters believable- not even Nicholson and Hunt. Also Cuba Gooding Jr is good but the movie really underuses him- he's not in it much. I wonder if they just hastily crammed him in after he won an Oscar for Jerry Maguire in 1996, to sell more tickets.They tried and maybe their intentions were good, but I don't think they tried hard enough. It's decent enough for the first 90 minutes, but the length is its undoing, and the last 45 minutes that focus on the unconvincing relationship are tedious. Good acting and some efficient filmmaking means this isn't awful, but I definitely wasn't a fan in the end.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Spectacular performances from all the leads with superb, solid back up. Outstanding direction as well. All of this is evident upon viewing, clearly.

One of the 3 Best Films of 1997...,"A richly textured character study wrapped inside of surprisingly original story, AS GOOD AS IT GETS was a striking and emotionally charged motion picture experience that will take the viewer through a myriad of emotions and find them trying to catch their breath and collect themselves as the credits roll. This unusual story revolving around three disparate characters who IRL would probably never cross paths except for the fact that two of them live in the same building and one of them hangs where the third works. Jack Nicholson won his third Oscar, giving one of his most dazzling performances as Melvin, a sexist, homophobic, anal-attentive, germophobic, anti-social writer who it seems has been living a fishbowl existence which has brought him to the belief that the earth was put here to serve and accommodate him and his needs. Marvin finds himself accidentally involved with Simon (Greg Kinnear, who should have won an Oscar), a sensitive, gay artist who lives in Marvin's building and becomes part of his life when Marvin is forced to care for Simon's dog after Simon gets beaten up by some thugs through a set-up by a sleazy bisexual con-artist (Skeet Ulrich). Helen Hunt won the Best Actress Oscar for her performance as Carol, a workaholic waitress with a sickly son who is Marvin's favorite waitress at his favorite restaurant. Any more details as to how these three people's lives intersect would spoil one of the most entertaining and delicious stories that was also nominated for Best Picture of 1997. A one-of-a-kind motion picture experience that must be seen to be savored.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"A great story with fascinating characters, but a little long","""As Good as It Gets"" is one of those really intelligent movies.  It's light-hearted without being too much to take, and it has its dose of ""reality for a Friday night"".  Jack Nicholson the obsessive romance writer, Melvin Udall, who lives in an up-scale Manhattan apartment across the hall from a gay artist, Simon Bishop (Greg Kinnear) and his adorable dog, Verdell.  Simon is beaten up by robbers, and Melvin, the pessimistic, bitter, complaining, obsessive-compulsive, and prejudicial shut-in, has Simon's dog forced on him, while Simon's still in the hospital.  Melvin grows affectionate towards the dog, and the good in him begins to leak out. The story also centralizes around Carol Connelly (Helen Hunt), a waitress at Melvin's only restaurant and who has a chronically sick child, Spencer.  The story continues with the three of them traveling together to Simon's parents' house in the south of Baltimore.  Melvin almost wins Carol over, but blows it.  They come back to New York after the trip with Simon feeling a new sense of hope in his life, as well as Carol.  The movie doesn't end there, but I don't want to give away the ending.  I will say this, however. Melvin really is a good man on the inside, despite all of his short comings and sardonic remarks.  The story is about finding yourself and love in your adulthood, and coming to terms with it.  The only grievance I had with the movie was that it kind of went on for too long, but it's definitely worth it.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Delightful! The best Hollywood picture of last years,"I enjoyed the film greatly. It is extraordinary clever and witty with original, incredibly amusing dialogues. I didn't want any action in the movie: it was enough just to look at the characters and to listen to their speaking. Besides, it's very moving: background is highly dramatic, though on the surface you find the funniest comedy. The real life is like that, you know  a short way from tragedy to the farce. The plot twists unexpectedly but so naturally that I never doubted the possibility of such events. Actors' works are outstanding. Jack Nicholson is the unique actor, he gives an unforgettable performer as Melvin Udall. Helen Hunt is excellent: expressive, spirited, and stylish. You feel every emotion of Carol and sympathize with her. Greg Kinnear showed all his abilities in the part of Simon  the most convincing and likable gay character I've ever seen. I also admire Shirley Knight as Carol's mother  perfect! My favourite moment is that at the end of the movie where she listens behind the door and suddenly pops out to explain that `normal boyfriends' don't exist. It was great  so funny and so true! According to the story there is no such thing as `normal people' in the world, we are all crazy. So never mind being crazy  life is just as good as it gets! Both of lead actors deserved their Oscars, however two awards are too little for such film. At least, screenwriter and director must have had Oscars. And why there is no special award for `the best animal in the film'? Verdel is an irresistibly attractive creature, and so talented! The film entertains you and touches your heart deeply, makes you smile, laugh and cry, but never depress or bore. 10/10 in every sense.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

I liked very much the acting, especially Greg Kinnear in the gay friend of Jack Nicholson.I consider this one of the great movies about New York (together with ""When Harry met Sally""), I mean it plays with the big apple and at the same time is dependent on it.

Wonderful dialogue,"This was a wonderful movie in terms of the dialogue and the characters. Its reminiscent of movies like ""you've got mail"", ""sleepless in seattle"" and even a little like ""terms of endearment"" only better than the aforementioned.

Greg Kinear is the gay artist. and the little dog was the cutest thing.As i've said, the dialogue is great. The only two possible gripes i have with it is that the storyline progresses a bit too slow at times. Also, i liked the ending but it could have been a much greater piece of cinematic work if the director/writer did not go the usual route of happy ending.Still great movie. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A fantastic film with a great lead performance,"A friendship starts to develop between a gay artist, a single mother working as a waitress, and a misanthropist, when the artist is left hospitalised after an attack. The three start to become somewhat dependent on one another, against their own expectations.'As Good As It Gets' is one of those movies that I remember seeing the trailer of, but never felt the need to see. Just seemed like a boring rom-com with actors I didn't really care about. 'As Good As It Gets' is, in fact, an incredibly funny and quirky movie that was fully deserving of the Oscars that it won. The script is the strong-point of the movie. Issues of homophobia, racism, misogyny and countless other prejudices are touched with a sharp, cynical twang. Emotional moments are slapped in the face by cutting jokes, never letting the audience settle in.A script is only as good as the people who recite it, though, and there's a reason why Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt both won Oscars for their performances. Sure, everyone is else as just as good, but the two leads are magnetic. Nicholson does a perfect job of playing the grumpy Melvin Udall, and he never really stops being grumpy; and this works excellently in response to Helen Hunt's exhausted but ever-optimistic Carol Connelly. The chemistry between the two is top-notch.You could argue that, perhaps, that the film goes on too long. It's over two hours long, when ninety minutes would have been absolutely fine. That extra time allows the film-makers to populate the film with other slightly bizarre characters, all adding to the general acerbic aura of the film. However, it's two hours of excellent acting, breathing beautiful life into some excellently written dialogue. Definitely worth a watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

So Good!,"I always say I like a flawed protagonist and Jack Nicholson's Melvin Udall fits perfectly into that category. He's racist and a bigot and he doesn't have a filter so he doesn't even attempt to hide these traits. But there's something about him that makes the viewer, if not like him, at least tolerate him.When I first saw this film I had a business partner who was an insufferable Tony Robbin's fan. Everyday had to be the GREATEST DAY EVER!!! And you weren't on the path to success unless you were so motivated you could walk over the proverbial Hot Coals.I remember being refreshed by the central message of this movie which asks the question: What if this is as good as it gets?(Btw, my recipe for success is a dose of both attitudes. Sure I want to tomorrow to be better than today, and next year better than this year, but I also appreciate where I am at this moment and if this is ""as good as it gets"" I'd be okay with that. Maybe that's why I'll never be a multi-millionaire. But if I got hit by a bus tomorrow, I'd go to my grave grateful for the life I've lived.)I'm not sure if the filmmakers intended for all these thoughts to bubble up during this silly little comedy but they did for me and that's one of the signs of great art, or at least stimulating storytelling.Also, a sign of great dialogue is its quoteabilty. I've used ""Go sell crazy someplace else. We're all stocked up here"" too many times to remember.Nicholson and Helen Hunt earned well deserved Oscars for their roles here. The rest of the cast is amazing as well, specifically Greg Kinnear.

Gorgeous comedy,"What a hilarious movie this is!! Seriously, this movie is one big fun ride.

So what makes this movie that good besides its' script and Jack's performance? Certainly the performances of Greg Kinnear and Helen Hunt. Greg creates an incredibly lovely character and he displays the emotions of his character Simon perfectly. I really wonder why Greg doesn't get more leads in movies, he is a very fine actor. I loved his ""Simon"". Helen is also convincing as a struggling single Mom who is one of the little people who dare to tell Melvin what they really think of his behavior.

Bears striking similarities in story and character to THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film, as it is deftly written, acted and directed. However, I cannot help but be surprised at the striking similarities it bears to THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST (1988). I have never heard anyone compare the two films despite how close they are. Both are about well-to-do writers, played here by Jack Nicholson and in ""Tourist"" by William Hurt. In both films the writers meet a young single mother who is not very well off financially (Helen Hunt here and Geena Davis in ""Tourist). Both mothers have a young son, and in both films the son is sick and the writer helps the mother out financially to take care of her child! Also, in both films the writer fall for the young mother. If that is not enough, both films contain dogs who do lots of funny tricks and are often the center of attention!

A bitter sweet romantic comidy which really portrays the gritty reality of true love relationships,"In a society which is gradually becoming more and more entrenched in PC (political correctness) here we have a drama which really goes against all the unspoken rules and codes of the typical romance movie as it puts a bunch of misfits together and shows us how being human is not all that bad. Well to begin with Nickilson's character as a reclusive neurotic hypochondriac (who just so happens to be a budding romance novelist if you can work that one out) and manages to offend every single person he meets. And what a supporting line up. A gay artist neighbor (who manages not to fulfill all the stereotypes) and a beautiful waitress who serves him lunch everyday but has no real social life outside of work due to the condition of her terminally ill son. What really makes this movie so enjoyable is Nicklsons scene stealing performance as a guy who seems to have a problem with everyone. One of the best lines in the film is in a conversation with his neighbor where he is seeking advice as he has finally realized the pain of love, his response to the advice is ""I thought you guise where suppose to be sensitive, is this the best you can do"". Nicklsons brash character has the worming quality that it breaks down the ridicules barriers that people build up around themselves and we always know what he says is what he means. The crux of this film is that you will never find the perfect partner but maybe this is as good as it gets to find someone you can be with despite all their short comings.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

As Good As It Gets is my second favorite movie of all time, just behind Jerry Maguire.

I've seen it get better.,"This is a pretty good example of post-Cold War/turn-of-the-century Hollywood running out of ideas for new iterations of its standard formulas and trying to co-opt the arthouse. It wasn't a particularly thoughtful effort and it hasn't aged well at all.Melvin (Jack Nicholson) supposedly has obsessive-compulsive disorder though in reality his particular antics suggest obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, an affliction which is more difficult to treat and identify and makes generally for a far less tolerable friend/neighbor/lover. That he allows himself to be drawn in to caring for a dog he dislikes belonging to a neighbor he also dislikes defies belief. That Carol, a relatively young and fairly intelligent girl next door with the looks of, well, Helen Hunt should fall for such a snide, unhappy old specimen as Melvin.Indeed, I hate to say it, but the only thing both remotely ""edgy"" and true-to-life is the personality of Melvin's gay neighbor, Simon, even though the film only touches and then runs away from the seedy underbelly of the gay world in which someone like him often orbited in those days (and still often orbits).It's a shame, too, because the talent is all there. But while the characters ring true, their subsequent actions and intrigues do not, and the whole thing just falls apart.

Feel good movie.,"It's a classic movie with a good message, beautiful actors and still to this day one of my favourite movies to watch on a rainy day.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
How good a romantic comedy can get ...,"There is a weird exhilarating feeling watching the compulsive obsessive Melvin Udall delivering so many insults, homophobic, racist, anti-Semitic and misogynistic, as if he allowed himself to express his personal grudge against the whole world. But I guess the character ceases to be detestable only on the account that he's played by Jack Nicholson, we can easily suspect that he was written with 'Jack' in mind for only he can elevate a curmudgeon to such a level of reverse likability, maybe because the eyes betray a touch of vulnerability that try to cover his expressive eyebrows. Yet, although it's not too hazardous to assume that by the end of the film, the inner goodness of 'Uncle Scrooge' will finally blossom, when the movie starts with Udall throwing of the neighbor's dog Verdell in the trash chute, we're left with mixed feelings.Thankfully, the relative vileness of good old Udall is compensated by the presence of one of the sweetest female characters ever written for a romantic comedy. Helent Hunt plays a sort of everyday 'Dorothy Boyd'. I wonder by the way if Albert Brooks took some inspiration from ""Jerry Maguire"" (I personally doubt it's a coincidence that Cuba Gooding Jr. stars as the neighbor's boyfriend) but it would be reduce Helen Hunt's role through a comparison, the movie glows out of her touching sensitivity. Provided she lives with her mother, her son suffers from a chronic asthma, so she doesn't have time to think for herself, her performance transcends the cinematic banality of her situation. She wonderfully plays the kind of women so constantly in a state of panic and anxiety that any relief could leave her with some emotional alter-effects. In a way, like Udall, she's also depending on habits that canceled off all her chances to find love, to even dream about it.The two characters are meant to be together, but I concede that's a feeling guided by movies standards. I doubt that a man like Udall would be with a woman the age of his daughter. Maybe an older woman would have fit the story, or a younger man, or maybe we shouldn't be too optimistic about what happens two weeks after the closing scene, but once the movie establishes the characters, and before they end up together, it's all about the human interactions, the ups-and-downs between two lonely hearts taken in a sentimental maze. Their relationship can almost be compared to these labyrinth games where you have to guess from which point to start to get to the end, only this time, you can't cheat by starting from the end, everything has to be done by the book and God, how hard it gets for these two, even by romantic comedies' standards.But if as a rom-com, ""As Good as it Gets"" delivers the classic material, as a human comedy, it's a wonderful exploration of the way different people can influence each other for the better, how love and friendship can be planted by the seeds of generosity. I insist on the human comedy term, because general romantic comedies rely on two main characters with foils meant to separate or reunite them. ""As Good as it Gets"" is enriched by the addition of the gay neighbor, an ill-fated artist painter who's beaten by one of his models' friends after a botched burglary. Greg Kinnear is Simon, a young man whose life totally falls apart and can only find hope through the help of the very guy who threw his Verdell in the trash chute. And Verdell plays a significant part too, would have he been shown in the poster otherwise?Verdell is the first intrusion in Udall's solitary life, but the cohabitations goes surprisingly well, Udall plays ""Always Look on the Bright Side of his Life"" (a priceless joke by itself) and the dog eats the bacon, at the end, Udall and Verdell acclimated to each other and Simon realizes that if the dog liked him, maybe he's not such a bad guy. Basically, the whole film consists on Udall revealing more generous sides of his personalities, but ruining everything at the most crucial moment. When he hires a doctor to take care of Carol's son, without any costs for her, he not only saves the boy, but also changes Carol and her mother's life. He asks nothing in return, except when the opportunity comes, to accompany him, while he's driving Simon to his parents. We suspect the trip will be pivotal for the three characters, but it's all in the way it happens and how Simon acts as a perfect buffer between Carol and Udall.And the love-and-hate relationship reaches a beautiful paroxysm during a restaurant dinner, when Udall makes such a despicable remark; he's forced to counterbalance it by a nice word. Carol begs for a compliment not because she's desperate but because the moment is too romantic to be ruined, they have to act as normal persons for once. After a confused monologue, Udall finds the perfect wording with the unforgettable ""You make me want to be a better man"", which is the ""You had me at 'hello'"" of the film, but more meaningfully. Yet we're so used to his personality that we expect the word too many. The relationship seems doomed unless Carol stops being obsessive of having a better man, and does her best to look on the bright side on Udall.You know how good ""As Good as it Gets"" is? It makes you realize how some romantic comedies were not as good as you thought. Naturally, at the end, the obligatory happy ending kind of belittle the whole originality reached by the film, yet the feeling is swept off by a total relief, to see finally these two tortured characters having a break, and enjoying a good time, we hope to be as long, or perhaps, as good it gets.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
enjoyable characters,"This film is really not about anything.  It starts off simply introducing some of the characters who you will soon never forget.  We are immediately introduced to a crumudgen named Melvin played by Jack Nicholson.Melvin in short is a SOB.  He is rude, racist, paranoid, homophobic, and just a horrible person.  Our first introduction to him we wittness him taking his gay neighbour's dog running around and chucking it down the garbage chute.When Simon finds out (played by Greg Kineear) he decides to take a stand but is so intimidated by Melvin's antics that even when he tries to confront him he just breaks down.  This also leads to a diatribe Melvin says to Simon that is so brutal that you can't help but feel bad but laugh at hystericaly.This is pretty much the pace of the film.  All the characters have their shining moment.  Melvin has several, Simon has many, and even Simon's lover played by Cuba Gooding Jr. has a great confrontation scene with Melvin telling him to lay off Simon.There is a reason for Melvin's antics, which isn't explained until about 1/2 way through the film, and that is he has OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder).  In short this is a bit of a flaw cause it makes the viewer not sympathize with Melvin right away.  Instead many people witnessing his antics may just end up hating him so much cause his behaviour is without reason, (walking in to the same restaurant every day, at the exact time, demanding to be served by the same waitress [Helen Hunt], bringing his own plastic cutlery, while bad mouthing everyone else in the place is a good example).  When he finally gets kicked out by the owner all the patrons stand up and cheer.  To some degree that may be the reaction some people watching this film may have by walking out of this film before its even 1/4 through.  It's a testament to Jack's performance for creating someone who is truly an absolute unbearable person to witness.  Melvin seems VERY real..But in short all these characters come together in the end out of bizarre circumstances and life changes for the better.  It's an enjoyable film, with some great performances particularly for Jack's best actor performance, and Kineear's wounded likes of Simon.The film also has a very well trained memorable dog that is amazing in its personality.  This dog even has better acting chops than most actors  in films I have seen!  The film does try to create a romance between Melvin and the waitress which is OK but gets a bit overlong (the restaurant scene is a bit lengthy), but still highly recommendedGreat feel good film.Rating 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

It Doesn't Get Better Than This!,"Hugely enjoyable and well scripted movie which gets you easily involved with all the characters. Jack Nicholson is rude and eccentric, Helen Hunt is nervous and insecure and Gregg Kinnear is vulnerable and lonely.

overacting,"call me crazy, but i consider this movie a perfect example of over-acting. everyone did a poor acting job in my opinion, nic, hunt, cuba, the mom, certainly no Oscar winning performances.however i find that kinnear did a decent job and so did ramis too.the fact that those actors gave much better performance in other movies, and the abundance of overacting leads me to blame the director rather than the actors.if i play the script in my head, i might give it an Oscar, it is mostly good.that's just what i think ..",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

A comedy from the heart that goes for the throat,"Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt, Greg Kinnear, and Cuba Gooding Jr. star in this James L. Brooks hit comedy, AS GOOD AS IT GETS. Nicholson gives a show-stopping performance as Melvin Udall, an obsessive-compulsive novelist with Manhattan's meanest mouth. But when his neighbor Simon is hospitalized, Melvin is forced to babysit Simon's dog. And that unexpected act of kindness- along with waitress Carol Connelly- helps put Melvin back in the human race.It's refreshing to see that has faith in the fact that real people in real situations are interesting after all not some empty headed special effects films.

For Hunt it is having to care for a sick child.  Kinnear as we learn had a falling out with his father years ago, being beat up and fitting in as a homosexual.  Nicholson has to deal with obsessive compulsive disorder and for the most part being a jerk. All the characters come together neatly in the end in this great film.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

A comedy that will please every heart,"As Good As It Gets is a truly magnificent feel-good comedy that through a detailed look on its three main characters is able to draw viewer's attention right from the very first moments. It's full not only of brilliantly clever laughable sequences, but also of so many realistic notions and situations, which can actually happen in anyone's life. From the creative mind of the great James L. Brooks comes a story that contains so many wonderful and unexpected twists, combining for an on-screen relationship that no one will ever suspect.Melvin Udall (Jack Nicholson) is an obnoxious, pedantic, obsessive-compulsive (there are many other adjective that obviously come to mind about his persona) writer, who doesn't give a damn about nobody else's feelings but his. He leads a life of pure selfishness, devoid of any friends, lovers or partners. He loves to make fun of his homosexual neighbor and artist, Simon (Greg Kinnear), and his cute little doggy named Verdell. Already in the first scene he shovels this adorable puppy down the waste chute. Even though he knows that everybody actually hates him, the thought of it doesn't really concern him. Following his every day routine (the hilarious strolls around New York City, when he omits chewing gum on the pavement) he eats breakfast at a nearby diner, where he orders only through one particular waitress, Carol (Helen Hunt). And all those activities would probably never change, if it weren't for a few sudden events that took place and turned his peaceful life upside down.First of all, Simon is hospitalized after he becomes a victim of an unexpected assault and Melvin has to take care of his dog (discreetly forced by Simon's friend and art dealer Frank). Second of all, Carol has to stay in at home and look after her sick son that one day. When Melvin comes to the restaurant and sees that she isn't there, he is so frustrated and angry thathe arranges a private doctor and full medical care for Carol's son, just so she can get back to work and serve his meals. A bit eccentric, don't you think? On top of this Simon realizes that he doesn't have any more money and has to take a trip to his parents' home in order to ask them for a loan. And who would drive him there? His good old buddy Melvin. He also asks Carol to come along, and she does so feeling a bit indebted to him. And believe me, totally hilarious and surprising things happen as the three unlikely pals travel through the country in a fancy convertible. Melvin suddenly decides that he has to get a hold of his true feelings and maybe finally let them out. Carol realizes somewhere on the way that Melvin can be really cute when he tries to, so she might actually give him a chance after all. Simon finds his true calling once again, which ends up making Melvin a little jealous. And what finally comes out of this very interesting threesome accounts for many heartwarming laughs, which is what a great comedy should always be able to do.Jack Nicholson is simply brilliant. Even though he plays a really nasty character, his performance is exactly the opposite. One is able to find some deep emotions in this seemingly emotionless man. He plays this part in a fresh, convincing, and utterly enjoyable manner in every single scene. No one else would be more appropriate for that role.Helen Hunt in a Oscar-deserving role as a woman, who wants to get something for herself this one time, after all those years spent on looking after a son. She simply lets go of every problem that's been troubling her and goes with the flow to find a greater meaning in her peculiar bond with an older, but certainly handsome, man.Greg Kinnear is a hilarious addition to the group, with the very persuasive performance as a very gentle and subtle guy, who has to go through a series of bizarre adventures just to find a real sense in his art.All in all, As Good As It Gets is one of the finest comedies build up on an analysis of completely different character traits, which, when put together, combine for a fantastic and lively cinematic experience. Clever and joyful dialogues, well-structured story and the mesmerizing passion coming out of the remarkable cast merge beautifully to create a top-notch comedy that everyone should watch at least once.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A TV movie forced into Hollywood epic,"An endearing story of people at odds finding comfort in one another told by a great central cast suffers due to length. The belief that these characters are interesting enough to sustain 2h 19m wears thin by the second hour, at which point it appears that their depths were plumbed in the first half hour. After their intruige expires, the film resigns to stroking their surfaces, resembling a soap opera omnibus, the characters' destinies secured long before they are reached. What should be a slight tale of human interaction and how it impacts character is forced into an Oscar grab without much adaptation apart from the addition of a Hans Zimmer soundtrack, the potency spread thin over the running time.Perhaps it should have been a miniseries or TV movie, the pressure to create a cultural landmark would not have distended it in that case. Its inflated sense of cultural importance may also be a symptom of its time: in 1999, a destigmatising depiction of a lonely old man with OCD, his depressed gay neighbour and a struggling single mother were alone ground-breaking enough to warrant an extended examination. However in 2020, having seen millions of these depictions with far more nuance and fewer cliches, having seen their vulnerabilities and foibles exposed, these characters lack the revelatory intrigue and flair that won them Oscars and critical acclaim. Not to say that the performances and script aren't compelling, they just reach their cleverest too soon and their shortcomings are brought into sharp relief by extended overexposure.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Classic romantic comedy with great writing and acting,"I watched this movie again today with the family, and was reminded why I enjoyed this such when it came out.It is a bit surprising that the rating is below 8. The writing and acting is flawless in this classic romantic comedy, and this is coming from someone who does not enjoy romantic comedies too much (well at least not as much as my wife).What is best about this movie is how subtle the comedy is, but makes you laugh out loud in almost every scene. It generally puts a smile on your face. A big reason for this is the the actors facial expressions and long pauses in scenes, which set up the punchlines perfectly. However, this is also due to great writing.In short this movie is intelligent, intriguing, hilarious and you get so attached to the characters through superb acting.

Best Romantic/Comedy I've seen to date.,"I'm not a fan of the typical Romance Comedies that we have been seeing for the last decade. I think it is a hard genre to crack as they can become predictable very quickly. HOWEVER 'As good as it gets' is most definitely an exception.Essentially this film is a combination of 3 actors and some layered and smooth writing. I say smooth because it rolls off each actors tongue and contains an element of poetry that doesn't cringe you out. What more can you want from a Romance film? This is a character based film that merges the naturalistic with the unlikely. It is the solid acting that makes the unbelievable narrative believable. You see 3 dimensional characters all develop in some way through the connections with one another. Simple. This wasn't a typical romance film because unpredictable it was and pretentious it wasn't.All in all a feel good, tummy tickling, bundle of delight. Romance/Comedy/Drama",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

The movie that got as many Oscars as it deserved to get,"As good as it gets revolves around the life of Melvin Udall who is a spiteful and lonely person, mean to everyone around him but himself. He seems to have no specific purpose in his life other than following his daily routine until love knocks on his door and changes everything.The film is magnificent in a number of ways but it would be unfair to not state the obvious, it is Jack Nicholson's movie. The way he delivers the quirky character of Melvin, his facial expressions, his anxiety when he makes a weird mess, the way the he transforms from the meanest to the kindest person and back, the way he delivers certain lines - it is like he imprints them in stone and in the viewer's mind forever. Some of his lines are more cruel but this is a good thing as it helps to understand the chaotic difference between his good and his bad side. Melvin is anything but a flat character. But at the end he shows us that if love can change a man like Melvin and set him out of his ways, then it can do anything.Helen Hunt is a close second. She manages to show a very kind side despite all the problems she has been dealing with. And as soon as she has a doctor to take good care of her son, she now has the time to understand that she has been alone for too long. While she is desperate to have a relationship - she is also proud and will not go for Melvin until he proves to her that he is the right man. She is great in her role, when she shows love for her son, when she opens up crying and shows her vulnerable side, when she tries to make Jack a better person for her but keeps knocking on walls. But she is persistent and kind as she has always been and she is rewarded eventually.Greg Kinnear is simply amazing. He manages to come through as a kind and sensitive person. But most of all, he comes through as authentic - anything that happens to him and how he responds to it feels real. He is openly gay but never overdoes this persona so as to become an unfunny stereotype, he really shines through in his role.Cuba Gooding Jr and Shirley Knight complement the leading cast in an excellent manner their characters are again very well written and acted.Some argue that the movie is too long by 30' but it is not really, it is very well paced and acted and the screenplay is tight and doesn't flat out. The writers have done an excellent job, the dialogue is very real, very clever and funny, avoids cliches, conveys the feeling that it needs to convey in every scene and when this is delivered by a magnificent cast the results can't be far from great.As good as it gets is a funny, romantic and one of a kind movie - a classic really. It hits the mark on so many levels that it would be unfair for me to score this any less than 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
How did Nicholson win the Oscar?,"It was in some moments one of the most uncomfortable films I've ever seen. The casting of Jack Nicholson for this film is incomprehensible and he is one of my favorite actors! For me, the age difference was not the problem, it was simply the fact that Jack Nicholson was not made to make romantic films.
Even more ridiculous was the fact that I won an Oscar for this role !!I highlight Greg Kinnear's performance, just spectacular. The way he messed with Nicholson made me laugh a lot. It looked like he was being himself and not playing a role! Fantastic!",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Highly recommended,"'As good as it gets' is tragic comedy about a writer Melvin (Jack Nicholson) who is afraid of germ-infection from other people and other places. At the beginning of the film we see him being hostile against his gay neighbor and his dog, we also see him having lunch at the same restaurant where he always wants to be served by the same waitress.The Jack Nicholson character stands pretty much central from the beginning of the film, but that is going to change when the other two leading characters start to develop. The waitress Carol played by Helen Hunt has a very sick son and he is in desperate need of medical help. Melvin is prepared to offer this help in a kind of way by submitting a doctor for him. Here fore he asks of her just to keep serving him at her restaurant.The third leading character Simon who is a painter gets harassed early in the movie. Simon ends up in a hospital and is threatened to lose his apartment because of financial depths. From this point a relationship begins between Melvin and Simon.At a certain point in the movie the three characters make a trip to Simons parents for financial support. Here all the characters really melt together and some good scenes come along. The acting of all three parties is great. The dialogue is pretty decent and the story shows little flaws.Of course the outcome of the movie is predictable and a Hollywood ending can't lack from the film. But overall I still highly recommend this movie. Final grade 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Flawless film which utilizes the supreme cast to fruition.,"Before I even considered watching this film for the first time, I was instantly biased because of the enormity of the casts talent; there's the monumentally charismatic Jack Nicholson (who would run out of fingers to count his Oscar nominations), Helen Hunt (who has a substantial collection of Golden Globes and Grammys), Cuba Gooding Jr. (who is the finest Actor of his generation) and Greg Kinnear (who's perfectly cast amongst the latter Hollywood greats).'AS GOOD AS IT GETS' focuses on Nicholson's character Melvin, telling  the story of how he copes with having an obsessive compulsive disorder, which is evidently destructive on the lives of those who surround him.  Exhausting ritualistic patterns such as washing his hands in boiling water, forbidding anyone to physically touch him, are among just a few of his alienating habits.  Aside from apparent intimacy issues, he is also a confrontational homophobic--suffice it to say that he doesn't appreciate living next door to Simon (played by Greg Kinnear) who is a gay artist.  Upon following events, Melvin aspires to win the affections of Carol (played by Helen Hunt) who is a compassionate yet lonely waitress.  Hesitantly she opens up her heart to him and discovers that beyond his appalling behaviour, is a man who is capable of demonstrating huge acts of kindness, who has sincere feelings for her.Despite having an emotional undercurrent the film should definitely be stamped as being in the comedy genre; there are many instances of noteably hilarious material, in this positively shining script, especially in the classic scene, where Simon confronts Melvin, about throwing his beloved dog down a garbage shoot.  Expect to be surprised by this film; the rareity of the magnificent script, combining with the multitude of talent in the cast, makes it magnetically engaging from start to finish.Even though I'm in great danger of becoming repetitive, I have to give some more adulation to the cast.  Jack Nicholson gave us his finest performance, unsurpassed in the attention he gave to the complexity of Melvins' character.  Helen Hunt is THE finest actress on our screens today.  In giving everything her soul had to offer, the audience was able to see the sincerity of the pain Carol was experiencing.  Whilst Helen gives you heartfelt raw emotion, she has an amazing aptitude to channel her talents for comedy too.

364th vote,"With 363 preceding comments at this time, everything which can be said about this film is undoubtedly included somewhere among them.I would add that Jack Nicholson's performance is among the best of perhaps the finest actor of our time. The two primary co-stars, Helen Hunt and Greg Kinnear provide equally-competent, engaging performances, along with Cuba Gooding, Shirley Knight, and everyone in the remaining supporting cast.It is a very long movie, nearly 2-1/3 hours in length - but so enjoyable it seems like one of those shorter hour-and-a-half films. This is a true test of a completely-enjoyable presentation - and thankfully, the producers didn't try to cut its length to conform to a more normal movie theater show schedule.The entire story, all of the characters, and their relationships with one another, one-on-one or in some sort of grouping, entertain without pause or exception during the entire film.""Melvin"" and all his cohorts are a group you're not likely to forget.{Some of the folks on this site have characterized Helen Hunt's character/performance as ""annoying."" Ms. Hunt is not my favorite actress, but while agreeing her character here was annoying - I would add that I feel this was a necessary, understandable component of her character. Here was a waitress, living with New York expenses, commuting from one borough to another, and with a son with a bad case of asthma, hospital emergency runs, etc. (I have family experience with such asthmatic-triggered emergencies, although thankfully, without her character's financial and insurance problems.) All of the circumstances surrounding her life and work would certainly provide this sort of comportment. Further, since most of her character's displays of an ""annoying"" demeanor were with Melvin, a rich, neurotic individual, obsessed with self-centered trivialities, she couldn't logically avoid being impatient and less-than-empathetic to his seemingly (to her) relatively petty frustrations.}",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

As Good As It Gets: 10/10,"Nominated for seven Academy Awards and winner of two, As Good As It Gets is really as good as it gets. It has biting and sarcastic humor, sincere and poignant drama, and plausible romance (let me tell you, I bought Helen Hunt falling in love with Jack Nicholson more than her and Woody Allen in The Curse of the Jade Scorpion.) Directed by The Simpsons producer James L. Brooks, it really makes you laugh.Nicholson is Melvin Udall, a curmudgeon in his 60s who is also obsessive-compulsive. He has to lock his door, he flips the light switch five times, he can't touch anyone else, he can't step on cracks, and he repeatedly uses new bars of soap. His gay neighbor Simon (Greg Kinnear) is a painter who loves his little dog Verdell. Every morning, Melvin goes to his favorite restaurant, where only Carol Connely (Helen Hunt) is able to put up with him.While having somebody pose for a painting, Simon gets beaten and needs someone to look after Verdell. The only person left is Melvin. Of course, he can't show it, but he soon falls in love with the dog. When her son's illness causes Carol to miss work, Melvin doesn't know what to do. Soon they all bond and, as the song says, they `look on the bright side of life.'Upbeat music (which should have won the Oscar) makes this movie even greater. It's impossible not to tap along. Although not playing during all of the serious scenes, it really is great music that makes you feel good, which is what this movie is: a feel-good movie. Sure it gets heavy-handed at times, but it IS a comma (comedy-drama). As I mentioned before, it's biting, sarcastic, and hilarious. You can't go much without laughing at something Melvin says to either Simon or Carol and their equally wise wisecracks back. Also, I could tell that, at times, Nicholson was improvising, and that made the movie even funnier.Another Oscar that As Good As It Gets got screwed out of was best original script. It really had touching moments thrown in with the superb characterization and humor. You could sincerely feel good about any one of the characters, even Melvin. Nicholson, in this role, reminded me of his later role in About Schmidt. While I'm on the topic of acting, let me say Nicholson was amazing. He tried to keep his tough-guy person still with him, but he let go that he loves doing commas. He was excellent, proving that, once again, he's not finished with us yet! Hunt also deserved her Oscar, with crying that puts, well, actual crying to shame. Kinnear was also great, and so was everyone else, especially Cuba Gooding Jr.I would highly suggest seeing As Good As It Gets before long, because it is a great movie!My rating: 10/10Rated PG-13 on appeal for strong language, thematic elements, nudity and a beating.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

What if this is as good as it gets.,"As good as it gets is without doubt the greatest romantic comedy of the last 30 years. And it will surely join such Classics as When Harry Met Sally, Sleepless In Seattle and An Affair To Remember in the hall of fame of the genre. James L. Brooks teams up legendary Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt in a duo which has warmth, honesty and tenderness rolled into it. Coupled with Brooks' perfect romantic timing, use of the well chosen score and you have one of the sweetest, most sensitive and heart warming movie seen in years. As Good As It Gets was in my view robbed of the Best picture and Best Director awards at the 1997 Academy Awards by a blockbuster called Titanic. And to further validate my statement both Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt won respectively Best Actor and Best Actress for their performance in As Good As It Gets, NOT Leornardo Di Caprio or Kate Winslet. If you are for the over the top, over romanticized and somehow unrealistic love stories then you would probably think that Titanic is better. But, if you stop and think a little, after watching As Good As It Gets then your answer may not be the same anymore. Highly Recommended!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Wonderful comedy-drama,"""As Good As It Gets"" is another terrific movie from writer-producer-director James L. Brooks, the creator of ""Terms of Endearment"" and ""Broadcast News"". The great Jack Nicholson, who won his second Oscar as Best Supporting Actor for ""Terms"", won his third Oscar as Best Actor for his hilarious performance here as Melvin Udall, a mean-spirited writer who is hated by everyone and has a tendency to act weird and unusual (for example, when he walks down a street he avoids stepping in cracks by stepping over them). Then he begins to show off a nice side of himself thanks in part to two other people: his favorite waitress Carol Connelly (Helen Hunt) and his gay neighbor Simon Bishop (Greg Kinnear). He also becomes attached to Simon's adorable little dog Verdell when Simon's art dealer pal (Cuba Gooding Jr.) forces Melvin to watch the dog after Simon is injured in a beating and hospitalized. Most movies simply don't get as good as this. ""As Good As It Gets"" is very well-written and directed by Brooks who sure knows how to make good movies. He's only directed four feature films in his career and three of them have been excellent (only his 1994 film ""I'll Do Anything"" was a dud). ""As Good As It Gets"" is also beautifully acted by the entire cast. Nicholson is perfect here and so are Hunt and Kinnear. Hunt has proven that she can be a great actress both on the small screen (as on her long-running TV show ""Mad About You"" which won her four Emmys) and on the big screen (she deservedly won the Oscar for Best Actress for her performance here and she's very good in the current release ""Pay It Forward""). Kinnear is also very good in this movie too (he was nominated for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar). The rest of the supporting cast from Cuba Gooding Jr. to Shirley Knight to former ""Ghostbuster"" Harold Ramis are cast to perfection in ""As Good As It Gets"". This is a terrific movie with only one minor problem: it runs just a little bit too long. Still, I loved it anyway.***1/2 (out of four)",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
couldn't be happier,"i LOVE this movie! its great, and light hearted, sure it has hints of drama and people getting stuck in a rut and stuff but it takes a happy approach on all these hardships. i had only seen jack Nicholson in the shining and the batman movies so i had never knew if i actually liked him as an actor before, but i definitely do now! you will laugh so hard and love the romance and everything about this movie! i highly recommend this! you will love jack Nicholson's character and also hate him at times but mostly love and i don't think there is an unlikeable character in this movie! you will love life and love after this movie and just want to live your life to the fullest!!!!!!!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Always look on the bright side of life,"I first watched this in a cinema when it came out, many times as I was working there at the time. Depending on the day and movie, audiences enjoyed it more or less. A romantic comedy got more laughs and attention Thursday to Saturday nights, serious dramas seem better appreciated Sunday to Wednesday nights. Kids stuff like Flubber weekend daytime. Titanic was obvious huge every showing.I watched this again tonight for the first time in several years. I'm even more in love with it now than when I rated it a 10. I never before noticed the extra makeup on Nicholson's face that makes him older and more sinister, didn't see the many facial ticks every actor shows as they express their innermost feelings and fears, and again I'm laughing with tears rolling down my cheeks at the pithy one liners, retorts, and wisecracks. Such a beautiful film, it's been a while and I'm so glad I watched it again. Beautiful art is one of the biggest things I'm missing, being locked down here.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Gets Pretty Good, I Guess","As someone who is obsessive-compulsive and identifies as queer, I felt fortunate to find this film at a time in my life that I needed it. As Good As It Gets... helped, some, and it made me laugh. Decades later, it's still watchable, well-written and well-acted.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Likable movie about an unlikable guy,"This is a very interesting movie in that it immediately establishes Jack Nicholson as a terrible person and then spends the rest of the movie trying to convince you he's better than you'd think. Nicholson is up to the challenge, being monstrous in the beginning and then slowly softening, but never flattening out, the rough edges. Hunt is equally excellent with his very convincing portrayal of a Brooklyn waitress, catching the spirit of someone leading a very ordinary life.Like most James L. Brooks movies, this one is quite amusing. It's also rather touching, so much so that I was willing to forgive it for its utter unlikeliness.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Helen Hunt's Oscar well-deserved,"One persistent criticism I've seen of this film is that Hunt's Oscar for the role was a gift, that she didn't have to really work for it, that the role was too slight, yatta yatta yatta.  But one of the things that made this an exceptional romantic comedy for me was a combination of Hunt's performance and a very different approach to comedy.  Comedy, especially romantic comedy, has pace; it zips and zings along, you think of the classics like _It Happened One Night_.  But this film does the opposite; some of its best moments, like when Melvin is struggling to come up with a compliment, or when Carol is trying to explain to her mother her attraction for Melvin, are filled with huge pauses.  Lots and lots of space and time.  And it's in these moments that Hunt really shines, showing that she's not dependent on the badda-bing pace of something like _Mad About You_ but has that mysterious something that used to be called screen presence, the ability to draw people in even when there's nothing happening.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
I Loved It.,"The first time I saw As Good As It Gets I thought it was average. The second time I thought it was good, and better than before. The third time, which is most recent, I though it was excellent. I was so unbelievably blind to think it was average earlier, because this film is so great. Everything about it was likeable, the script, the cast, the music, the impressive direction, the cinematography and even the websites damn it!As Good As It Gets is a movie I recommend for everyone, it is one of the best films of 1997. I'll be seeing it for a 4th time extremely soon I imagine...Rating: 9",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

"incredible film, nicholson and hunt shine","This was a film that really pulled my emotions around. Nicholson delivers an incredible peformance as the nasty neighbour with obsessive compulsive disorder, and Helen Hunt atacks her role with a realism that is rarely seen. A  genuinely funny and moving film, the outstanding script has just the right lines for the right moment.  Jack Nicholson delivers his ""Carol the waitresss, Simon the fag"" so perfectly dead pan and matter of factly that i fell about laughing. the only niggle i had was that melvin udall never comes out and says clearly to the others that he is sick  and can't quite help being the way he is. we are left to guess how much of his personality is controllable and how much better he really could be.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Good story, perfectly cast, superb result -- Improves each viewing",This is a highly realistic story that is perfectly cast.  I have seen the picture three times and it got better each time. The reason for the improvement was my noticing the details of the acting and the story with subsequent viewings.  For instance in the Baltimore restaurant when Nicholson complains that he has to have a coat and tie when Hunt needs only a house dress is priceless in Nicholson's character complete lack of personal communication skills.,10.0,Anonymous,Romance
I didn't see a movie which was so funny in two years.,"Melvin Udal is the main character. He is cynical, but he has a great sense of humor. Deep down inside Melvin Udal lives a nice man. The next day when the washing machine repair man came to my door to deliver a new machine and said not to take it upstairs, I repeated the words Melvin Udal said to his neighbours. Just some funny remarks to scare the simple repairman. I had to laugh when he was gone and saw Melvin Udals face. The film will keep my mind busy for a long time.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Jack NiceManson,"This is a very funny movie with a lot of heart. Its a very well rounded story, with possibly one of the greatest character arcs I've ever seen on screen. It's simple but fun to watch Jack Nicholson's character turn from a jerk to a charitable man. Jack Nicholson is good in this, even though he looks like a serial killer he is a rather funny guy who can clearly pull off difficult roles. I'm not a Helen Hunt fan but I like her in this.I'm not too comfortable with a Helen Hunt and a Jack Nicholson romance. If you ask me, he should be gettin with her mother. It almost seems like a Woody Allen movie lol. But that's okay, I'm glad that wasn't the focus of the movie. Also I don't mind woody Allen movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
It's Not Only As Good As It Gets,"This movie is by right better than ""Titanic"", but not as good as ""Good Will Hunting"". The storyline is so appealing that it captured the my attention from beginning to end, except for the ending.The three lead actors, Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt, and Greg Kinnear, are brilliant. They all deserve Oscar, and they all would have gotten it, if only this movie was not competing against ""Good Will Hunting"". Greg Kinnear lost to Robin Williams, but he surely was his only true competitor that year.Well, what can I say? People in Hollywood still prefer big budget romantic movies with young actors instead of this kind of movie...",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
How rude people can be great to watch...,"If there is one actor that has done a very good job in almost all the movies he ever played in, than it must be Jack Nicholson. He's one of the most constant actors I know off and with this movie he proves his many talents once again...This time he is Melvin Udall, a cranky, selfish, extremely rude and obsessive-compulsive writer who hates everybody and everything, especially his homosexual neighbor with his cute little dog. When his neighbor has been brutally beaten and needs to be hospitalized, Melvin is entrusted to the care of the dog he hates so much. His entire life is turned upside down and to make things worse: the only waitress who tolerated him at the only restaurant where he eats his daily breakfast, needs to leave work to care for her sick son, making it from then on impossible for Melvin to eat his breakfast. All this makes him realize that perhaps he needs others for more than just selfish reasons...Of course you could say that this is yet another sentimental, romantic comedy / drama, like we have seen so many more before and in a way that is true. But it is mainly thanks to the cast's and especially Jack Nicholson's excellent performance, that this movie is lifted above the average in the genre. I'm sure that there aren't many actors who are able to make Melvin a person who you love to hate at first, but who also has something likable about him. Jack Nicholson is one of those actors and he really did a very nice job in this movie.But next to the excellent acting, I must also admit that the story was well-written and that the humor worked perfectly. Sure it is all quite predictable: It's the typical stuff of people who are each-others opposites, but start accepting and even liking each other in the end. But the thing is that it works very well this time and that's all that matters to me when I'm watching a movie. Somehow the writer and director have found a way to make it all more than just bearable or watchable. They have made a fine comedy out of it and that's why I give this movie a 7.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"An enjoyable, unexpected pleasure","With Jack Nicholson playing this role, the script writes itself. He is still one of the best actors of his generation, pulling off some sketchy dialogue and awkward scenes with the ease of a hand magician. He takes this movie on his shoulders and carries it almost all the way through.I don't get Helen Hunt. She has her moments - her scenes with Nicholson as he tries to complement her are priceless - but she just doesn't have the emotional range to pull it off. She tries, but her high-profile scenes don't ring true. She was upstaged by Greg Kinnear for Christ's sake - and SHE was naked!Well directed for the most part - there are some pacing problems, and this movie falls victim to ""great line"" disease. Great pieces of dialogue are framed by clumsy directorial arrows pointing to us and it, telling us that what we're about to hear is great dialogue. Still, it IS great dialogue. Overall, this is an enjoyable, unexpected pleasure.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Imperfection at its finest.,"No hot models.  No action heros.  No 'sappy' unrealistic love story.  No intricate plot with twists and turns.  Just arguably the best movie of 1997.How?  Great acting and a great story.  Sounds too simple?Basically, they took some odd, flawed characters that have little to do with each other, and make a great movie by bringing them together through some very unique circumstances and poking fun at all of them, but bringing you closer to them as you go.  Character development is a large part of the movie.I laughed at several scenes and felt moved in others.  The funny scenes weren't corny and the heart-warming scenes weren't sappy.  This movie is different than the normal movie, which is a big plus.  The cast and their acting makes it all work.  Probably the best all-around movie of 1997 in my opinion.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Over rated,"Some admirable intentions in trying to develop some original non-cliched characters that interact over an unusual plot line.

Oscar worthy performance by Jack Nicholson,"Jack Nicholson won an Oscar for this role and I absolutely think that he Deserves it one hundred percent.Let's star off with the plot , follows Melvin a guy that isn't very likeable and faces some situations that actually improves his personality while that process is a little slow in this film the movie feels actually longer than it is which is not a bad thing because of many factors that made this movie very good.Jack Nicholson's acting is undoubtedly Amazing he did an amazing job he portrayed a character that isn't likable in a way that he made him likeable in a way , he is a bit gritty as a character which adds that dynamic to his character and there are some subtle jokes and mocks that his character makes which are amazing and were absolutely necessary to make us see this character in more ways and scenarios. Helen Hunt's acting also was pretty good her character had some ups and downs and had a significant impact to Jack Nicholson's character which is nice in the way of how character development goes. And I also like that Harold Ramis had a part in this !Overall an Oscar worthy performance of the legendary Jack Nicholson and all of the cast did a good Job and overall the plot was something interesting and overall the movie was fun and the score by Hans Zimmer was great also . 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"""There are Jews at My Table""","Really Jack you haven't seen Jews before in NYC until today? Amazing.This film overall is good, but for cringeworthy scenes like the above--and others--my rating has decreased over the years. Another scene is when Helen Hunt is telling the doctor about her asthmatic child's experiences in the ER, saying that after one full-blown attack, the ER doc gave the child the wrong kind of antibiotic. Well, you don't give an antibiotic for an asthma attack. This is not necessarily a script oversight, unfortunately I've seen this in medical practice where the docs throw it all against the wall and see what sticks. And naturally the patient thinks this is the standard of care but I digress.Helen Hunt was especially annoying in this film. Nicholson's character was obviously off his head, but Hunt would get annoyed at the tamest slight.Good film and good performances from Kinnear, Nicholson and Cuba Gooding.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
