The Best Of The Disney-Era Star Wars Films,"Without exaggeration, this is easily the best offering in the franchise since 'Return of the Jedi'. Yes, it is a spin-off of a simple set-up line from the original film, but it manages to really craft it's own story around the demands of where the plot has to go by the end. While it's definitely not a character driven movie, I was surprised with the amount of time given to our key protagonists and the effort to at least make them intriguing.The idea of another prequel movie was a hard sell; but unlike the prequel (and for that matter, the sequel) trilogy, this manages to tell it's own story within the structure of a lead-up to an event to which we already know the outcome. Felicity Jones and Diego Luna are especially effective along with secondary characters like those played by Riz Ahmed and Donnie Yen becoming easy fan favorites. Ben Mendelsohn is great as always as Krennic despite not being given much dimension as a main villain.The character of Saw Guerrera (Forest Whitaker) seems a little cut-up and while I understand the character is better informed by one of the animated series, what we have in the film seems like it may have been a little more beefed up in earlier edits of the movie.One thing I hear from people who don't care for this movie is the amount of fan-service moments. Random appearances of old characters or species, call-backs to famous lines and some easter-egg visuals can be a little distracting and if you don't care for that self-indulgent stuff, you'll definitely notice it here. Personally, it never really bothered me apart from one instance that lasts 5 seconds.On a final note, while the decision to include Darth Vader was inevitable for this movie, I was so glad to see they did a little more than give him a short cameo appearance and actually give him a moment or two without leaning on him too much as a crutch to distract the audience.If you love old Star Wars and couldn't care less about the two superfluous trilogies that followed, consider giving this a try.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Back to the roots,Rogue One is the movie we didn't asked for - but what we got was beyond any expectation. Excellent pacing of the movie. As the movie progresses it gets better and better. Culminates in one of the best finales seen in any of the Star Wars movies.CGI on the past main character seemed odd. But worked well on pilots and scoundrels. Many Easter eggs trough the whole movie are appreciated. Humor from Alan Tudyk's K-2SO was spot on.Empire Strikes Back is still king of the hill as the best SW movie till date. But Rogue One comes damn close near it.,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This IS Star Wars. At its best.,"What has made Star Wars into the internationally recognized genre that it is today? Two things in particular - original material and a touch of humor/wit. Rogue One is a plethora of both. In addition, even in an area where previous Star Wars may have lacked (perhaps even overlooked, understandably), the acting is superb, top of the line. Forest Whitaker may be the most recognizable name in the entire cast, and he kills it every moment as his brilliant, rebellious character, Saw Gerrera. But he is merely the tip of the iceberg in what becomes an epic, near-perfectly written plot that connects episodes III and IV. It is haunting, it is funny, devastating, cheesy, and it is wonderful. It IS Star Wars.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Best Star Wars Film Since The Originals,"Rogue One is, by far, the best Star Wars film to be released since the original trilogy. A fantastic cast of original characters, still hitting on the popular characteristics from previous fan favourites, seek to complete a daring mission which ultimately sets up A New Hope and the whole Star Wars saga.Instead of trying to reinvent an already successful formula, this standalone story modernises the approach of the original trilogy. Dialogue is powerful and used to set up the action of a Rebellion, and characters clash to create energy on screen. Some of the best moments from the original trilogy even return in new scenarios, making an impact but not stealing attention from the plot; who doesn't want to see an AT-AT on a beach?Well tied to the canon set chronologically before and after Rogue One, links to the prequel trilogy are limited, but heavy connections are made to the Clone Wars series. Despite no focus falling on previously established characters, the plot is the perfect backstory to a significant event in the Empire's downfall.There is a great figurehead to represent the Empire, understated and without garish traits, but evil. It is a fantastic special effect to bring back Tarkin, who remains imposing, and Vader is used in perfect doses, making limited but incredibly impactful appearances. One these being one of the best finales to any Star Wars film.An aesthetic joy, the film is visually wonderful due to brilliant costume designing, props and locations. CGI is used effectively, and at no point does it seem like everything on screen has been thrown in for the sake of it, unlike the prequels. The film is visibly clean and clear cut. The score, too, fits themes excellently and really sets the tone.Without a significantly direct tie to the Skywalker Saga, cinematically, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is arguably the best Star Wars film yet.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
star WARS,"The strange thing about this movie is that it is more of a war drama than the sci-fi adventure one might expect from a Star Wars story. It is dark, it is gritty and the main characters are traumatized and made homeless by a brutal civil war waged by an oppressive Empire. Consequently, the main characters don't start out as heroes but turn into heroes by the choices they make. It is in many ways the most realistic description ever shown in a Star Wars movie of how ordinary people become warriors because there isn't much of an alternative but fight. ""The time to fight is NOW!"" and the actors do a great job of conveying that feeling to the audience. Sprinkled in is a fair bit of humor and comedic relief. We get good creature designs, ample special effects and a lot of fighting: Ground battle, urban combat, space engages, close quarter fighting; you name it, they give it to us. And don't think those fights are Disney squeaky clean. To a degree you get war in all its nasty brutality. The final result is a good action movie set in the Star Wars universe. Somewhat lacking in the light saber and Force aspects a true fan might wish for but still well worth the money you spend on it.Go see it!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An Amazing Addition to the Star Wars Saga—5/5 For Star Wars (Spoiler Free),"Gareth Edwards and his crew accomplished something I never thought would be possible: they contributed a great Star Wars film to the Star Wars saga and canon.This movie was great as far as Star Wars is concerned. It truly *felt* like a real Star Wars movie, and not a cheap fan service attempt like the Force Awakens was (although the Force Awakens was very fun, it felt like it didn't take Star Wars itself seriously enough).So what worked with this one? Here's the list:1)The story.It felt like a totally believable space fantasy story, and furthermore a totally believable Star Wars story. It clearly was Gareth Edwards doing his own thing with Star Wars but also paying total respect to the path George Lucas originally paved with a New Hope.At the end of the day this story is a GOOD Star Wars story and it feels like it can be placed alongside the original trilogy in story quality.2)Not only the story, but the fact it was taken seriously.Whether you like the Force Awakens or not, you got to admit, it felt a bit cartoony. It didn't feel like a *serious* addition to the Star Wars saga. It felt as if that the people involved certainly liked Star Wars, but in a very fan-servicy sort of way. Everything felt very ""fun"" in the Force Awakens, but not serious. Rogue One doesn't fall into this trap. It was an amusing and fun ride surely, but the story was clearly priority here.Furthermore, the story elements and movie went *dark* when it needed to and didn't hold back. If the story needed death, that's what we saw. If it needed to show slaughter and killing, we saw it.3)No element of Star Wars was abused.There was no over abuse of lighstabers, the Force, or any old Star Wars characters. Wherever there was any fan service in this movie, it was done VERY tastefully. A respectful nod to the previous movies, but it never went ""HEY LOOK HOW COOL THIS IS. THIS IS SOMETHING YOU GUYS LOVE, RIGHT?""4)The characters and the actors that played them.Star Wars is never going to be known as a movie with ""great acting"", but full credit should go to the actors in this edition of Star Wars. They did a great job of bringing life to these characters— enough for us to care about them and the action occurring on screen, but not so much that it distracted from the ensemble story.5)The pacing. This movie was perfect Star Wars pacing. And by perfect Star Wars pacing, I refer to Empire Strikes Back. This was not an overly speedy movie that gave you no time to think, and yet it was not an overly slow and drawn out movie.6)The tie-in with the original trilogy.This story takes place before A New Hope. And as much as Rogue One completely does it's own thing and takes its own direction as a standalone film, it *beautifully* ties in with the original series. As I said above, I completely believe and accept this story as great Star Wars material as much as I do George Lucas' original stories.Overall, this Star Wars film is a 5/5 Star Wars film. I only rate it 7/10 on IMDb because, well, Star Wars is Star Wars and not the Godfather :D. As far as Rogue One stands in movie history, it's a great action movie. But as a Star Wars film it now has a special place in my heart.My personal new Star Wars top 3 ranking goes as follows: 1)Empire Strikes Back 2)A New Hope 3)Rogue One",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A top Star Wars movie,"As far as Star Wars movies go, this is the only one I can honestly say I enjoyed as an adult - the others being the original 3 I watched as a kid but no longer care for.This is what I wish Star Wars movies were all about, rather than the cliche eye-rolling fluffiness that the franchise has mostly produced.
A very brave entry overall that surprised me.
Why? It's ominous and bleak, no 'cute and fun' characters (unless you count the robot drone, who grew on me fast and was a worthy addition), and most importantly, none of the main characters survive this suicide mission of a plot. All those people on the poster... they all die. No one's sugar coating anything here, there's no 'coming back from the dead' type tricks. Now that's space opera cinema I can get on board with.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Better than the sequel trilogy,"The other recent Star Wars films were a little disappointing but this one lived up to expectations. It has excellent characters, story and battles.

So thankful for this film :) 10/10,"This week I've decided to make a Star Wars' week. I watched all 8 episodes and the last two (7 and 8) left me feeling betrayed and utterly disappointed. Luckily, I still had to see this one and Han Solo film (I really don't know If I want to risk and watch the latter). Rogue One fits perfectly in the Star Wars saga, it has the feeling of grandeur, seriousness. Yes, there are some jokes but they don't make this film a farce like it happened to the 8th instalment. The main hero is a woman but she isn't annoying and she isn't a super human. Nobody is a super human, there is no place for magic and the laws of physics and the force aren't violated, as neither is viewers intelligence. The plot is simple but it delivers. The characters from older films are treated with respect. I give this film 10 stars because it is truly a Star Wars film. I was sitting on the edge of the seat and couldn't look away from the screen during the fighting scenes, they were so intense and spectacular . Thank you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The best of the new Star Wars films by some margin,"This is almost perfect Star Wars. By far the best Star Wars of the new era (including the prequels). Hard to find any fault with it.

Best Disney era movie by far and one of the franchise strongest,"A scientist is forcibly recruited by the Empire to help build the Death Star.In my opinion Rogue One is (to date) the best Star Wars movie produced in the Disney era and one of the strongest entries in the overall franchise. I enjoyed it for its darker tone, excellent performances and in particular how well it fits into the overarching narrative of the Star Wars universe.There are a number of memorable scenes, particularly in the final act which packs a double emotional wallop with the fate of the main characters and what we know is to come in events portrayed in the original 1977 Star Wars movie.The action sequences and visuals are fantastic throughout, with a strong combination of great cinematography, sensible computer generated imagery and effective fight choreography. It's difficult to go into detail about the best bits without major spoilers so I'll just say they get the fan service spot on with a great blend of the old and the new.All performances are solid with Felicy Jones, Diego Luna and Alan Tudyk all compelling as the main antagonists. Riz Ahmed, Mads Mikkelsen, Donnie Yen and Jiang Wen give great support. The standout performances for me are Ben Mendelsohn as a memorable villain and Forrest Whitaker in a slightly unhinged cameo.Any fans of the original trilogy should enjoy this one, particularly when compared to the prequel and sequel movies which largely miss the mark.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Mindblown,"I personally am a big Star Wars fan, hearing rumours throughout the year of the reshooting and worry within Disney had me cautious about this movie, hoping rather than expecting it to be a great one. I brought my pop (who tends to be very critical of movies) along this time who had never seen a Star Wars movie and never has wanted to watch one. I felt as if this was a great opportunity to bring him along because of it being a standalone movie that has a start and end. The director did an absolutely brilliant job, helped give us a good understanding of the characters whilst moving the story along the way at an appropriate pace to a massive climax, the actor behind the blind monk was the star of the film for me and I definitely think Felicity Jones did a great job as the lead actress of the film The acting cast did a great job to capture the emotion of the movie without overdoing it which was incredibly pleasing to see. For me, it sits just behind Empire Strikes Back as the best Star Wars film and as for pop, came out of the film not saying anything just grinning as much as I've ever seen him until he was dropped off home, where he got out with a wink and said 'Thanks for inviting me, loved every minute of it'",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Emotion , thrills , noisy action , super-spectacle and impressive aerial combat effects","Set after the rise of the Galactic Empire in Star Wars : Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (2005) and before the Battle of Yavin in Star Wars (1977) .
In a short time period right before the events of A New Hope , we find ourselves in the middle of a galactic war between the Rebel Alliance and the Empire .The synopsis of this film starts in the entire opening crawl with the traditional text from Star wars (1977) : A long time ago in a Galaxy far , far away . It is a period of civil war with rebel spaceships....but instantly leaps to the action . No long opening crawl . In fact , this film is set days before the events of Star wars . It follows the outcast Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) and how she came to join the Rebel Alliance in a dangerous move to steal the Death Star plans . Her kidnapped dad Galen (Mads Mikkelsen) has built a terrifying super-weapon : The Death Star that contains kyber crystals and revealed to be used as fuel for it , it is a battle station capable of destroying an entire planet . With a desperate goal of saving her daddy from the Empire and retrieving the secret plans for the weapon of mass destruction : The Death Star, we follow a group of rebel spies (Felicity Jones , Diego Luna as Cassian Andor , Donnie Yen as Chirrut Îmwe , Wen Jiang as Baze Malbus , Riz Ahmed as Bodhi Rook) and including the ordinary robot : K-2SO (voice : Alan Tudyk) , an Imperial enforcer droid who's been re-purposed to work for the rebellion. All of them have hope to restore peace to the Galaxy , being commanded by the high staff (Jimmy Smits as Bail Organa , Fares Fares as Senator Vaspar , Alistair Petrie as General Draven , Genevieve O'Reilly as Mon Mothma , Ben Daniels as General Merrick , Ian McElhinney as General Dodonna) and to vanquish Orson Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) and other empire enemies as well as eliminate the destructive super-weapon or it will be too late . A risky rebellion built on hope . Save the Rebellion. Save the dream.Delightful follow-up to the trilogy that George Lucas always said was intented to be for children . However , because of its imagination , scale , spectacularity , and style , it results to be a fabulous entertainment for all ; both , kiddies and adults . Interesting and engaging screenplay by Chris Weitz , Tony Gilroy from a story by John Knoll , and based on characters created by George Lucas . And being the first Stars Wars franchise to introduce location on-screen caption . Some marvellous new creations , especially state-of-art robots , and the unbeatable special effects more than make up for a slighly overlong movie . Although it is more a spin-off than a sequel , it is more different and original than its predecessors ; if it's no less enjoyable or uplifting . To wonder at the way in which heroes and heroines steer their aircrafts and fall off in high-speed against the large enemy crafts . And the breathtaking dogfighting and overwhelming piloting at the end restore it to the realm of super-spectacle to which it belongs . Felicity Jones is acceptable as Jyn Erso joining the Alliance, Jyn finds herself in the middle of the ultimate conflict between the Rebels and the Empire as well as to cripple a super-weapon . She is well accompanied by an enjoyable support cast , such as : Forest Whitaker , Riz Ahmed , Mads Mikkelsen , Jimmy Smits ,Genevieve O'Reilly and many others . Tarkin, portrayed by Peter Cushing in Star wars is now played by Guy Henry with a CGI replica of Cushing's face superimposed over his . And special appearance by Darth Vader , voice: James Earl Jones, who is meticulously patterned after his look in the original ""Star Wars"". And Carrie Fisher-CGI Leia (Ingvild Deila, voice: Carrie Fisher) who is asked what the plans mean and she answers , ""Hope,"" signaling the start of the first Star Wars film... Star Wars (1977) . However , Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia), Kenny Baker (R2-D2), and Drewe Henley (Red Leader) all passed away in 2016.It displays an attractive production design , over-the-top scenarios , appropriate photography and adequate costuming , as costume designer David Crossman stated that some of the original costumes used in Star wars (1977), The empire strikes back (1980) and The return of the Jedi (1983) were reused here . It packs colorful and evocative cinematography by Greig Fraser And rousing musical score from Michael Giacchino , taking parts of original soundtrack by the classy John Williams ; Michael has composed every film directed by J.J. Abrams except Star wars episode VII , though composer Alexandre Desplat's original score was rejected . Michael Giacchino, his replacement, had only one month to write his musical score. The motion picture was well directed by Gareth Edwards who exposed their three of his influences for film-making are George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and Quentin Tarantino. He has made succesful films , as the hit of ""Monsters"" resulted in Edwards getting offers from the major studios, especially Warner Bros., who tapped him to direct an English-language reboot of the 1954 Japanese classic ""Gojira"", being produced by Warner Bros and Legendary Pictures, directing the successful ""Godzilla¨ . Finally directed this ¨Rogue one¨, a tremendous box office hit smash , grossing a lot of money worldwide .",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Some of the best action sequences in the Star Wars series,"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, is directed by Gareth Edwards and takes place between episodes 3 and 4 of the Star Wars series. This film is highly entertaining, as it contains some of the best action sequences in the Star Wars series. At moments the CGI is jaw dropping. Visually this movie is great. Also the storyline is quite interesting, as explains unknown information which leads to what occurs in episode 4. The characters were likeable and well acted, although they were not given enough depth. The audience knows little to nothing about most characters and it really makes it hard to connect and feel for them at times. Also the score by Michael Giacchino sounds a little rushed at times as he was only given 4 weeks to write the music. I feel that there could have been more creative sounds based around the themes by John Williams. Overall I really enjoyed Rogue One. It's a film that really entertained me, particularly in the 3rd act. It's no where near the best Star Wars film, so therefore I give it a 7.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Far superior to JJ & Johnson's work.,"This movie brings back why we all loved Star Wars in the first place. For those who remember watching the original in the cinema long, long ago in a cinema far away....it's brings a tear to the eyes, how they recapture the classic imagination that JJ Abrams and Rian Johnson could not.

Diamond in the Rough,"Rogue One is a surprise diamond in the rough. Though the film lacks the flair (minimal lightsabers) and wit (barely any humor) of other Star Wars films, it fits the narrative being told. The cinematography is Rogue One is crisp and the dialogue is generally pretty good. The tone is serious and the characters fully embrace the severity of the situation. There are duller moments, particularly in the first two acts, but the story comes full circle in the end.I've said it before and I'll say it again, Star Wars knows how to execute killer third acts. The finale of this film is no different, and might be the best climax in the franchise other than RoTS. Everything that happens after the shield opens on Scarif is anxiety inducing. Though we have a short time to develop relationships with these characters, the connections are strong as we watch their fight for hope.Rogue One is one of those movies that did not need to be made, but I am glad that it was. I try to stray away from using the word ""perfect"" in these reviews, but this film is the perfect segue into the original trilogy.Best Character: Cassian Andor
Best Moment: The Vader slaughter.Best Quote: ""It's not a problem if you don't look up."" That was Jyn's response when asked about the Empire's rule and the Imperial flag flying. This single line adds needed depth and understanding to her character.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Beats JJ Abram's Farce Awakens,"Just like the thousands of Star Wars fans out there in the world, I was absolutely giddy when I heard that J.J. Abrams was taking the director's helm for the seventh installment of George Lucas's beloved space opera. After I saw the Force Awakens, I was not sure how I felt about the movie. It has gotten so many rave reviews and I desperately wanted to feel the same way. After some time since its release and the adrenaline rush has worn out, I can honestly say that it was a big disappointment for me as a Star Wars fan. I will not get into the reasons as to why that is since the top reviews of Force Awakens do a superb job pointing out the flaws of that monstrosity.So anyhow, I went to see this film with low expectations because of my previous disappointment with the recent addition of the Star Wars franchise. Boy, was I wrong.Gareth Edwards puts the WARS in Star Wars unlike I've seen AND felt in the previous films. The dark and serious tone of the film makes you feel the rebel's fear of gruesome warfare as they fight against the more well- equipped and ruthless Empire. At one point, the film was reminiscent of WWII films due to its excellent portrayal of battle scenes.The acting and dialogue was for the most part well done, and the comic reliefs in the film did not feel as forced as *ahem FORCED Awakens.The director also does an excellent job connecting the prequels and the original series together. If a viewer sees the series in the numbered order with this film, the story line will play out seamlessly.And lastly, Darth Vader's scenes in the film definitely adds a terrifying legacy to his name. I will not spoil the scenes for you, but he portrays ruthlessness here that was not seen in the other films. The viewer will have a better grasp as to why he is such a feared character in the universe.J.J. Abrams diminished my love for Star Wars. This film has brought back hope in me for the franchise once more as Jyn Erso has done with the rebels.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

An example for future Star Wars movies,"Rogue One feels like a serious and grounded movie, with a plot that weighs a ton, that feels important on every scale from the very beginning and as the movie progresses it shows that it's on another level, much higher.The plot is very well written. It's simple, but direct, without fillers or unnecessary diversions. The levels of politics are reduced to the minimum so that it remains a factor to consider, but from the farthest box possible. It has impressive action sequences supported by flawless visual effects, such as the battle of Scarif, the battles of the ships and the devastating power of the Death Star. As if that were not enough, the film has cameos that have a very important presence.On the technical side, the soundtrack is very good as usual, but the sound editing also stands out tremendously. Photography is beautiful! Even from the first introductory scene of that ringed planet. The editing is also very efficient and its highest point is in the last third of the film, where there is a very fast pace as we get into the battles.The few negative points are found in specific decisions regarding the performances and the non-existent development of some secondary characters.This is a work that makes even those who most resist the fury of this old saga (like me) turn their eyes to this great action and science fiction show.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Best movie of the franchise (I said what I said 😂),"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016) is a Star Wars masterpiece that's in my DVD collection and I recently rewatched on Disney+. The storyline follows an orphaned young lady whose father was kidnapped by the Empire to build the Death Star. The rebellion recruits the daughter years later to find the plans that can hopefully find a weakness within the world destroyer and give them hope they can eventually overcome it.This movie is directed by Gareth Edwards (Godzilla) and stars Felicity Jones (Inferno), Diego Luna (Open Range), Donnie Yen (Ip Man), Forest Whitaker (The Last King of Scotland), Mads Mikkelsen (Casino Royale) and Alan Tudyk (I, Robot).This is the greatest Star Wars story ever told and the best movie of the franchise (I said what I said 😂). This movie is so well written with great characters, intense circumstances, tragedy, hope, humor...this movie has everything a great movie has minus the cheese the franchise is known for. The background music is intense and fit every scene to perfection. The action choreography and execution is diverse, entertaining and science fiction gold. The ending beach scene and finale is legendary, science fiction Shakespeare essentially. I adored the comedy the android brought with some clever one-liners and reactions to circumstances. The acting was fantastic and selecting Donnie Yen, Forest Whitaker and Mads Mikkelsen for the cast was brilliant.Overall, this is a science fiction genre masterpiece. I would score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Not great, not good, borderline terrible","Spoilers I was super excited about this new Star Wars movie, the epic story of stealing the Death Star's plans! That sounds awesome! Except that it wasn't. This is not "" just as good as The Empire Strikes Back.""! The characters were not compelling, the story was meh, and they rely to much on nostalgia.The characters in this movie were incredibly boring. The main hero Jen, played by Felicity Jones, never had the hero aspect and never showed her true importance other then my dad died and he built the Death Star. Cassain Andor, played by Diego Luna, didn't have hero qualities either, he was really just there. The acting wasn't great either. It felt extremely forced and unconvincing.The story line was thin, like if it was ice you would fall through. They changed the story to much from what the original story was. There wasn't supposed to be Jen. Why is Disney trying to make woman the hero now. It's not a problem, but they are putting them in extremely unconvincing roles. Putting Jen as the lead role didn't really allow the story to have full potential. The story was really just held together by large action scenes and costume design.Lastly they are relying way way to much on nostalgia. They had these cameos in there like R2 D2 and C-3PO and the aliens form the Mos Eisly cantina. Many most have though that it was clever, but they were lazily placed cameos that served no purpose at all. Reusing iconic lines doesn't make for great dialogue, it came off as lazy. They aren't giving us new other than a few new troopers or ships, they are just using our love of the original to trick us into liking the movie. All and all i give this movie 4 out of ten, don't believe the hype, try to make up your own mind if you like or don't like this movie,",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A rebellion well worth saving,"Loved the original 'Star Wars' films as a kid, still do. Especially 'Empire Strikes Back' while considering 'A New Hope' a genre landmark. Didn't think the prequel films were that bad personally, but they had a lot wrong with them and were a long way from great, especially 'Attack of the Clones'. Personally actually loved 'The Force Awakens', despite the vitriolic hate it's got.The latest 'Star Wars' entry, which is somewhat of a prequel, 'Rogue One' is a worthy prequel but seems to be intended as a standalone chapter and it actually fares even better in this regard. 'Rogue One' is not as good as the original trilogy, not being as much as a genre landmark or as influential but is certainly better than any of the prequel trilogy films combined and along with 'The Force Awakens' one of the better 'Star Wars' films since 'The Return of the Jedi'. With this being said, 'Rogue One' is going to be reviewed as if considered a standalone chapter.'Rogue One' has so many good things, even if the film didn't do much for me it would have gotten a 4/10 at least. For one thing, the production values (with a couple of exceptions) are amazing. Particularly good are the special effects, which are not only of outstanding and astonishingly real quality but actually drive and enhance the story and helps provide some great visual story-telling. It's wonderfully shot too, the cinematography being some of the most memorable and beautifully composed and transitioned of the year. 'Rogue One' similarly boasts a rousing, sometimes dream-like and atmospheric score from the always dependable Michael Giacchino, one misses John Williams of course and having a different composer takes some getting used to for someone who grew up with Williams' iconic themes, but Giacchino is a worthy replacement.Also impressive is a script that treats its audience with respect, rather than talking down, being bland and soulless or so dumbed down that it lacks brains. Tension, humour, action and pathos are beautifully balanced, the references and nod a delight for any 'Star Wars' fan and written in a way that is affectionate rather than shoe-horned. The story never felt dull (to me), maintaining a snappy pace and with a lot of heart and tension. There is a great combination of what made the original trilogy so great, something that Gareth Edwards fully understood, while having its own identity, this is not a re-hash yet there is an affectionate nostalgia reminiscent of the original trilogy's spirit. It makes sense, and is darker, more poignant and richer than the whole saga has been in a long time.Then there is the action, which is thrilling and has a real sense of purpose. The last forty minutes in particular are thrillingly epic. Nice to see footage of Peter Cushing and even more wonderful was seeing one of cinema's most iconic villains Darth Vader making an appearance magnificently voiced as ever by James Earl Jones.Mainly the cast are strong, with a feisty and likable heroine in Felicity Jones' Jyn, terrific support from Diego Luna and especially Riz Ahmed and Ben Mendelsohn's sterlingly played villain. The best characters are K-2SO, the wisecracking robot played with terrific comic timing and gusto by Alan Tudyk, and Chirrut, beautifully realised and 'Rogue One's' most interesting character characterised splendidly by Donnie Yen.Not without its faults by all means. Some characters are underused and underdeveloped, a few like Forrest Whittaker's (pretty wasted) Gerrera being pointless. Some of the pacing is jumpy and rushed which comes at the expense of making a cast of perhaps too many characters more consistently interesting.Design and CGI for Tarkin is ropey and distractingly artificial. While it was nice to see younger Leia again, it was cheaply recreated and like Tarkin sticks out like a sore thumb compared to the rest of the visuals, which were otherwise amazing as said.Overall, worthy prequel and a very good standalone chapter. A rebellion well worth saving. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Fan service can kill your film,"I was really looking forward to this film, as I love Star Wars but am very interested in seeing stories that don't involve a Skywalker as a lead. But sadly I was let down, so where to start?(SPOILERS INCLUDED)Fan Service: When you make a reference by placing a known character in a scene that doesn't need to be there, then you've just ruined your scene. Example: The rebels are on their way to the battle and tensions are mounting, it's getting serious as we approach our climax! Oh wait here's R2 and C3-P0, remember them, right? Then continue on with the scene. What was the point other than to pander to the audience? Having them stops the natural flow of tension that was building.The same with Ponda Baba and Dr. Evazan. Why were they in it? That city was then destroyed so they must of got out. They don't push the story forward in any way so it's wasted screen time, distracting too because it draws us away from our heroes mission, just to look at characters we know.It's sad that Disney feels the need to jam pointless fan service in, as it makes the audience seem stupid, like that can't understand it's in the same universe without seeing R2-D2.Darth Vader: Completely unnecessary, even if that lightsaber fight was fun. The first scene with him wasn't right, as he didn't look or sound the same. Plus he said a pun that was so bad I actually face palmed. When he shows up at the end of the film, once our leads have all died, he has an action scene? In a time that completely doesn't suit it. Before our actors die, yes, but not after as it overshadows their sacrifice.Overall: This film is a bit messy, going to maybe 8 different planets/moons/locations which just feels all over the place. It never takes a breather and the pace is too fast and I feel it would have benefited for another 20 mins run time. I found Jin unlikeable and forced, no pun intended, and I wish she had an extra 5 minutes at the start of the film of her life, maybe a scene on why she was arrested, then we could spend time with her and get to know her? Rather then just here's Jin, now you have to care about her cause her dad is a pretty cool guy.This film for me felt a bit emotionless, it lacked a real heart as nothing moved me, not even main character deaths, and that's a failure of the director. The only deaths that had any substance and weight to them were Chirrut and Baze'a deaths as they had such a tight bond and Chirruts faith, when facing his own death, gave Baze such strength.Recommendation: If you love Star Wars and don't care about the quality of what you're watching, you'll eat this up",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I feel like the void left in my heart by episode VII has been filled now.,"Maybe it's because I had higher expectations for episode VII and almost none for this one, I feel like this movie managed to achieve what the other one couldn't.I'm not saying that it was perfect, but it sure was good enough for me, and it will be good enough for many other die-hard SW fans. Leading female actor wasn't that good in my opinion, but otherwise this movie had everything a SW fan could wish for. Good old characters, good old places, and an overall good old SW feeling.

Goes back to Star Wars' roots,"As a Star Wars fan, I was a tad bit skeptical when I heard this movie was going to be released several years ago. I was, however, pleasantly surprised. I enjoyed this film. The acting was good, the characters were interesting, and the cast was ethnically diverse.The special effects were obviously gorgeous. There were a few surprising cameos that were made possible by CGI/animation. Unfortunately, there were moments when this particular animation looked amazingly realistic, and then there were moments when the animation looked eerily fake and borderline terrifying. (no offense, Disney animators) One reviewer online wrote about how the animation may not hold up with all the technological advancements that will come about in the very near future, which to me, is understandable.The story was rather simple, but it was interesting to me how this movie apparently takes place in between Episodes 3 and 4 (AKA, Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope). The wardrobe and props were fantastic. The casting was pretty good as well. It is in my humble opinion that JJ Abrams prefers British brunettes to be his galactic leads, considering he cast Daisy Ridley as Rey in The Force Awakens and Felicity Jones (of whom I am a fan) as Jyn Erso in Rogue One. Although, this point may not be entirely accurate considering the fact that Gareth Edwards was the director of this film (but possibly Abrams had a big role in this, who knows).*Side note: This movie was 1000 times better than the disappointing prequel/sequels (Episodes 1-3, Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, and Revenge of the Sith).",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I cannot understand them at all but apparently it's because they could communicate without the enemy knowing.Some action scenes in Rogue One are so shaky that i can't really comprehend what is going on.

A pleasant surprise amidst a destroyed franchise,"I don't know if it was because the directors were different than those in the new trilogy, but this was actually not bad at all, in fact this is the best Star Wars movie since the franchise got revamped. Being a prequel to A New Hope, it explores the events that took place immediately before Leia got her hands on the detailed plans of the Death Star, including its weaknesses. A ""gift"" only possible thanks to the efforts and sacrifice of many. They somehow managed to capture the atmosphere of the original trilogy, which felt pretty good. The cast selection was intelligent, with everyone getting along and portraying interesting and somewhat relatable characters that aren't your usual ""justice fighters"".

I am struggling heavily in my mind to allow myself to think that this is the best Star War movie ever.This movie is intense from start to finish. The storyline is great. The characters are terrific. The music is great. The visuals are stunning.Perhaps the dark feel and themes of this film put a lot of people off. They don't want to see so many characters die. Well, I think it played perfectly into the concept of getting the Death Star plans to Leia. In Episode 4 they talk about many lives being lost to get the plans.

Great Prequel to New Hope,"I've just returned from the midnight showing of Rogue One here in the UK. I was slightly sceptical after watching Force Awakens, while enjoyed FA it did lack teeth and flesh.Rogue one was a great prequel to New Hope.We know that Princess Leigh had the death star plans but how did she get them ??.Well now we know.A few minutes into the film I felt disappointed that there was no Star Wars theme or rolling credits. Once I got past this the film started coming to life and put you right into the star wars universe.There were nudges to the originals everywhere, old characters from New Hope were brought to live to return to the big screen.There was plenty of visual eye candy here and a climactic ending that was truly stunning. I want to watch it again to see all the little details.This is a dark and emotional film compared to others but it has its light hearted moments also.Without giving too much away we follow a rag tag bunch fighting against the Empire and Lord Vader. A lost girl, a rebel agent, a defector, a novice trainee of the force, a hot shot gunner and a reprogrammed imperial robot. Alongside the rebel alliance they discover the existence of the Empires latest super weapon and must a find a way to destroy it.The Bad -1.Some of the dialogue is wooden but this goes for all Star Wars film.2.

The Force is with me. I am one with The Force.,"""Rogue One"" functions as a bridge between Episodes III and IV in this ongoing ""Star Wars"" film series, telling the story of the ambitious plot to obtain the plans to the armored space station The Death Star and hopefully find a weakness. A character named Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) is recruited by The Rebel Alliance because it was her father Galen (Mads Mikkelsen) who helped to design the damn thing. Even after Jyn learns from a hologram of her father that it does in fact have a weakness (that he deliberately contrived), the RA won't lift a finger to help her. So she goes ""rogue"" with various soldiers, a Rebel spy (Diego Luna), a smart alecky droid (voice of Alan Tudyk), and an Imperial defector (Riz Ahmed).While it is true that the script isn't without flaws, ""Rogue One"" is a spirited enough adventure. We don't really get to know characters that well, but they possess a basic inherent rooting factor that does help. Director Gareth Edwards handles the scope of the material quite well, and this viewer, for one, didn't feel that his pacing was too sluggish. The expected abundance of CGI was actually fairly impressive, for the most part. The action steadily builds towards an ultimately large scale battle in space that is satisfying.Best of all, it's nice to see Darth Vader in full bad ass evil villain mode, even if his screen time is limited. Governor Tarkin is also brought back, using the digitized rendering of the image of the late Peter Cushing, and this effect turns out better than expected, if not perfect. Various nods are made to characters and details from Episode IV, such as those characters who pick a fight with Luke in the cantina.It really does throw you off at first, not hearing that familiar, majestic John Williams theme OR seeing an expository crawl at the beginning. (The score by Michael Giacchino isn't bad at all but it's nowhere near as memorable as anything Williams composed.) Fortunately, once the story kicks in, this becomes a solidly entertaining viewing experience.The performances from the international cast are decent. Tudyk is amusing as a droid who doesn't ACT much like a droid; he has a sardonic, sarcastic personality. Forest Whitaker is over the top as an extremist character who really doesn't serve much of a purpose.All in all, ""Rogue One"" shows the audience a fairly good time, right up until its conclusion designed to lead right into the opening of Episode IV.Seven out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Quick, spoiler-less thoughts from Hollywood Premiere Attendee","Rogue One was quite awesome, and quite different from the movies that came before. It was frightening, tense, very dark, VERY dirty (literally: maybe Mon Mothma was the only character without a layer of filth make-upped onto her face. And she looked so much like Mothma from ROTJ!) Some differences were somewhat striking, but overall it absolutely felt like a Star Wars movie should feel. Lots of familiar faces to see, super tense and exciting and beautiful.

There's never been a better time to be a Star Wars fan!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Rogue One is flawed, but still a hell of a time","Despite having a number of problems and flaws, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is a whole lot of fun and another solid entry into an already great franchise.Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is the first anthology Star Wars movie and what many are calling ""Disney's experiment."" If this movie succeeds, Disney can feel confident in releasing additional anthology movies, if it's not then Disney will need to reset their course of action. With it's release well underway, Disney can feel confident in the direction they're going.Rogue One simply tells the story of how the Rebel Alliance stole the plans to the Death Star and sets up the plot for the Original Star Wars.Now, there is a lot to like about this movie. This is a very good looking and well shot movie. The cinematography is beautiful at times. It's very well directed and the action scenes are breathtaking at times. The third act alone is incredible and is a visual feast.The movie also does a very good job at connecting things to episode 4. If you are familiar enough with the episode 4 and the Star Wars franchise you can hear a line, or see something happen that connects to it and it's just very cool. It's like finding a piece to a puzzle and watching it fit in to the rest of the picture.The CGI (for the most part) is incredible. When the AT-AT Walkers in particular are jaw droppingly realistic. The space battles are exciting and thrilling and while Darth Vader doesn't have a huge role in the movie, he does have one incredible scene in the movie that may just be my favourite Darth Vader moment of all time.The performances are all universally pretty good. Felicity Jones is very good in the lead role. The movie mostly rides on her performance and she does a very good job. Mads Mikkelsen is also very good in his role, I wish he was in the movie just a little bit more, and Ben Mendelsohn is really good as the main villain of the movie.However, while the performances from the actors are all great, the characters are not. There is absolutely no attempt to develop any of the characters save Felicity Jones' Jyn Erso. She's the only one we ever learn anything about, she's the only character we are meant to care for, and she still is not developed well. Everyone else is just so poorly developed. Take Donnie Yen's character Chirrut Îmwe. All we're told is he is very in tune with the force, he's blind and he protects the temple. His friend Baze Malbus we learn even less about. He's really good with his gun That's it.That's what every single other character is like. We are told one or two character traits and that's it.The Force Awakens cared for its characters so much more (I'm only comparing because both movies had to introduce new characters.) We learn so much about Rey, who she is, why we should care f0r her. We learn about what she yearns and desires for, we see her discover things about herself. We learn so much about Finn. Who he was, and his desires. Kylo Ren is probably the most interesting new character in the Star Wars franchise. We see this villain, so conflicted within himself. We learn a little about his backstory, his struggle. These are characters. These are well developed characters.Rogue One just puts people on screen and is like, ""here are some people. They're good guys and they tell jokes so you should care about them."" It just doesn't work. The characters need to be developed otherwise there is just no emotional weight in the movie. Just think of how much more emotional weight could of been felt in the last act. Sure there was some emotion, but I just found myself not really caring what would happen to the characters and I didn't feel the emotion the movie wanted me to feel and that is because of how poorly the characters were developed.The other big issue with the movie are the two CGI characters. I don't want to spoil who the characters are, but there are two characters from the original movie that make appearances and well, they couldn't really use the actors now so they had to digitally recreate them. As stated, the CGI in the movie is mostly incredible. I did however have issue with the two CGI characters. The one at the end isn't a huge issue. The other one was very distracting and he is in the movie quite a bit. Every time he was on screen I just kept thinking, ""He looks like a video game. It just doesn't look real."" It was very distracting and he is in the movie a lot and it just pulled me out of the movie every time.The pacing of the movie is also uneven. Within the first 5 minutes or so the movie jumps around so much from planet to planet and it feels very choppy. The movie also has a lot of exposition. From characters introducing themselves and saying who they are and what they do, to the movie literally putting lower thirds up to tell you where you are, it just felt kind of lazy.Overall however, despite the flaws the movie has, Rogue One is a really good movie with incredible visuals, very good performances, and thrilling action sequences. Plus, it's Star Wars.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The only modern Star Wars movie you need to watch,"Rogue One is an anomaly, an exception to the rule. After a mediocre prequel trilogy and a very unoriginal sequel with the force awakens this came out of nowhere and felt fresh yet familiar at the same time. It proved that was still possible to tell exciting stories in this forty years old sci-fi universe.Darker and grittier in tone, putting more emphasis on ""war"" than on ""star"", it might not be every fan's cup of tea but it was made with the deepest respect towards the existing universe. Accordingly it succeeds to enrich it instead of just plundering it for quick cash. Watching Rogue One makes re-watching the original trilogy even better.The movie isn't quite perfect, though as the exposition is rather long and confusing and some cgi-ressurrected actors are quite deep in uncanny valley.

"At last - a decent, new Stars Wars movie","What a return to form for Star Wars! I've seen this twice already and the second time was pretty much as exhilarating at the first. It's not just 'not crap' - it's actually great, and the first time in a while I didn't want a movie to end.I won't go into the story details. Star Wars fans should know what this is about and those who aren't fans are a bit hopeful by this point in time if they think watching the latest one will change their minds. Those who are somewhere in between are more likely to enjoy this than the prequels.Episode 7 had promise but Abrams' movie fell short. He fixed the issues that everyone had been griping about since the prequels, except that he brought a bunch of new ones instead (like too much pop culture and forced attempts at comic relief).Rogue 1 is really well written. There's such a huge difference between this and the prequels, or Episode 7. The story manages to stay interesting and coherent throughout, without glaring contradictions to itself or the rest of the franchise. The characters become interesting quickly, and you do end up giving a damn about them by the end of the film.Like kids in candy stores, Lucas and Abrams both made these movies with too much new technology at their disposals and too many potential ideas flying around; restraint was required on both their parts. Gareth Edwards, on the other hand has managed to get the ingredients right and, dare I say it, takes the franchise to a few new places.Rogue 1 is not the powerhouse of a movie that The Empire Strikes Back is but it does offer, ironically, A New Hope for the Star Wars universe.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Whoever didn't love episode 7 for any reason. This is your movie.,"What a ride. This review will be filled with hyperbole, but I won't apologize.I saw and enjoyed Star Wars: Episode 7 a lot. It wasn't perfect, but it was good, and got me back into Star Wars mode again. Rogue One, however, surprised me in probably being the best Star Wars movie produced in this millennia, and I'm being serious.First of all, manage your expectations. Rogue One isn't a new type of cinema experience, or unique. It's also a prequel, so the story has somewhere specific it has to end up.With that in mind, Gareth Edward's movie is pretty close to an instant classic, in my opinion. It doesn't rush along, but give us ample time to get some sense of characters and locations. It doesn't dwell on exposition, other through character, and actual plot.This is the story about how the rebel alliance acquired the plans for the death star, and it manages to give the plot and characters in A New Hope more meaning, and gravitas.It's hard to tell why it's so good without spoiling a story that was such a delight to experience unspoiled, so I'll sum it up really, really short:The only negative things I have to say about Rogue One, is that two CGI characters were 99% perfect instead of 100%. That's actually the reason I withhold my last star out of 10. It'll make sense after you've seen the movie.

Worth seeing.,"Rogue One a star wars story is just that, set squarely in the star wars universe and time line yet with it's own distinct tone, style, characters and story to tell. Unlike the past films this isn't about some young person who is handed a light-saber and then sets off to become a Jedi master, a hero who at the end of the film face off against a sith villain. Right from the go instead we're introduced to a family living on a bleak desolate world who are broken up, as the father is forced into finishing a new secret weapons project for the empire. The style of the film is pretty grounded, gritty with that lived in feel which the prequels really missed. There's a strong focus on the nuts and bolts aspect of the empire, how it's occupation breeds rebellion and the massive resources and power it has acquired. The rebels are also portrayed as being more fractured than before and there's less of a black and white approach to the conflict. The film plays out like a spy/war film and of course in war ethics doesn't always seem so clear cut.CHARACTERS
Jyn Erso is our protagonist, a young criminal with some serious daddy issues as she's effectively abandoned by both her father and then adoptive father. The acting and performances from the cast were all strong, I really liked the villain too and it was refreshing for him not to be sith. Felicity Jones as the lead was okay, a little bland but going with the more grounded feel it worked well. Her transition from loner to someone loved by her new friends and inspiring confidence in them was smooth and nicely handled, over the film she grows increasingly idealistic as she understands the sacrifice which will be required for the rebellion.The supporting characters all worked really well in the Rogue One team though I would say there isn't much character development for them. There's also a nice element of diversity too them without it ever becoming annoyingly PC, one of them is blind for example but without a big deal really being made about it. They are an usual bunch of misfits though and I liked this aspect. To me they felt like real believable fighters not a team of generic cinema action stars. Darth Vader was smartly underutilized too, he appears for about 4 minutes and I was fine with that, any longer and it starts to become fan service. There was something slightly off about Vader though, whether it was the costume or his dialogue I don't know. Ben Mendelsohn as Orson Krennic was superb as the power-mad villain among the squabbling bureaucracy of the empire.SPECIAL EFFECTS
The CGI used with the space sequences and some of the machines was all pretty seamless, very impressive and smartly utilized. Things get a bit digitally heavy at the end but up until that point it's all very restrained and natural looking. The technology on show all pretty much matches the 1977 sci-fi feel- lots of levers and switches, droids need to plug themselves into things, there's no touchscreen or wireless.PACING AND STRUCTURE
In terms of the pacing and structure, the first 10 minutes I found a bit confusing, lots of characters are introduced and some of the editing is a bit choppy but once the main story gets underway with our protagonist off on a mission to find her father and find out the truth about the Death Star things really get going. The first weapons test of the death star was pretty chilling and gives a perfect added element of time running out for the rebels. The destruction of a planet always felt a little abstract but seeing a city vaporized was in ways more impelling. Seeing the imperial officers watching the scene unfold as if it they were watching the viewing the launch of the new Apple I phone also nicely emphasized their detached and jingoistic mentality, to them it's just the latest toy to play with.The overall look and tone of the film is definitely darker, gloomier and more grounded end of the star wars spectrum. All in all the action sequences, music, set and costume design and visual effects all deserve strong praise, a little more character development would have made it even better though.On an aside the film also has a nice British connection, with an English director and lead plus some of the film also being shot in the UK.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Some of the best action scenes we've ever seen in a Star Wars film, but ultimately a thoroughly flawed effort.","This could have been good. Amazing, even. Director Gareth Edwards delivers some of the best action scenes in any Star Wars movie. He shows us a side of the saga we haven't seen before: the ugly face of war. He shows us that the Rebels aren't all good, cannot be all good. That, in order to accomplish the things they need to win the war against the Empire, they must cross the line. It is a very refreshing take on a world that has become all too neatly divided into good and evil. Dark, dirty, gritty. All the buzzwords. We also get to see more of this vast galaxy as Edwards takes us to plenty of new planets and locales, from the ancient Jedi world of Jedha to the beautiful if deadly beaches of Scarif. Make no mistake, this is a very beautiful and sometimes breathtaking movie.However, it falls flat in several respects, none of which are really Edwards' fault. Let's start with the most obvious one: the score. Michael Giacchino had the unenviable job of scoring the film in only four weeks after composer Alexandre Desplat had to leave the production due to scheduling issues. And it shows. The score is perfectly adequate, but nothing more. No one will leave the theater humming a specific tune from this flick. In fact, it wouldn't surprise me if some started whistling ""Enterprising Young Men"", the theme Giacchino composed for 2009's Star Trek - he seems to have reused some of his old motifs.The next problem is the film's lack of engaging characters. While it mixes things up by making the main droid not a cuddly candidate for a bestselling toy, but instead a cold-blooded (cold-wired?) strategic analysis bot with a fondness for zingy one-liners (K-2SO, voiced by Alan Tudyk), the rest of its ragtag band of heroes is an assortment of cardboard cut-outs and clichés. And in no character is that more obvious than in its nominal hero, Jyn Erso (played by Felicity Jones). Here's the thing: a girl who shoots things is not automatically a strong character. A character is someone who has agency, makes her own choices, and deals with the consequences of those choices. That is the foundation of any good story. But Erso is a hollow vessel, a ball that gets passed from one plot point to the next. At no point does she make a choice - that falls to the male characters, who naturally are there to tell her what to do. She just executes plans. All this, however, is at odds with how she is introduced: a tough survivor of Imperial terror who had to learn to survive on her own. It's a shame that the writers dropped the ball so badly when it came to characterizations, since on paper Erso and her squad of rogue rebels should have been a team to rival the Serenity. But from Diego Luna's Captain Andor to Forest Whitaker's Saw Gerrera, none amount to much more than simple plot devices.The final - and worst - issue is probably one caused by studio intervention: trying to tie the movie back into the original trilogy. The movie, for all its faults, would have had the strength to stand on its own, but for some reason it was deemed necessary to include not only nods to the old films, but vigorous headbanging. It starts with Darth Vader, but it doesn't end there. Going into detail would spoil major surprises, but suffice it to say that each and every scene with Vader could be cut from the movie and it wouldn't make a narrative difference. There are many more instances of blatant and very costly fan service that don't really add anything beyond the slight ""aha, I know that guy!"" moment, and more often than not even detract from any enjoyment because they are just so badly done. And then there is Darth Vader's newly found love for puns. No, really.All in all, this is a movie that feels more like a fan-film with a generous budget than a proper entry in the Star Wars saga. Rogue One does a lot of things right but ultimately chokes on its own aspirations.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Rogue One is a treat for Star Wars Fans.,"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (a.k.a. Rogue One) is an epic space opera film directed by Gareth Edwards.

When she grows up, she joins a group of resistance fighters who aim to steal the Empire's blueprints.Rogue One is a stand alone film of the Star wars franchise It depicts the story of how the Rebel Alliance found the plans to the original Death Star and introduces time directly before Star Wars: A New Hope.The plot of the film is good and has a decent balance of action, comedy and a pinch of romance and is equally supported by stunning execution which will keep you engaged throughout.The engaging screenplay is beautifully supported by stunning CGI and visuals and marvelous acting.This is the type of star wars film that you want which will keep you engage thoroughly.

Star Wars as it should be...,"Unpopular opinion: Rogue One is the best Star Wars movie.OK. So Empire Strikes Back is 'THE' Star Wars movie and the original is, well, undeniably original but Rogue One is Star Wars for a modern audience. It 'looks', 'feels' and 'sounds' like Star Wars but isn't silly and doesn't subvert the tropes of the universe whilst telling a proper story that actually supports the larger arc. It has enough 'fan service' to scratch that itch but brings plenty to the saga without derailing it or undermining its power, story or characters.Easily the high point of anything Star Wars beyond the original trilogy.

Very predictable film that seems to just jump from a fight to the next one,"In overall enjoyment I rank this film on par with the last one, was it ""a force awakens"" or what, who keeps track of this franchise that bloats like a pie in an oven.I think the story was actually pretty nice. Tell the story of the rebels who stole the plans to the death star and gave Luke and friends a chance in the original. Tie this up seamlessly (literally!) with the original film and it works out pretty well.Characters were a bit of a mix. The main hero and her companion make a good pair but the sidekicks are pretty much taken off the shelf which reads ""useful generic sidekicks"". The robot that tries to replace C3PO got the biggest laughs in our theater but it was all too predictable. It talked bad but turned out to have a big heart, just something we've seen all that often.The film is literally just one big chase, where the heroes are never in a moments peace or rest. I liked the scene in the original when they travel in Millennium falcon and play that game of theirs and just talk. This doesn't have any of that, just explosions. Rogue one also tries to milk in on every possibility to awaken some sense emotion, but obviously so transparently that a critical movie goer will just feel embarrassed.One thing of note is the VERY low level of CGI when they re-created some of the characters from the original movie. It was literally the same as watching a trailer of a new computer game, like Uncharted or something. Totally broke those scenes for me. What if they would have just showed these characters from the back and left the rest for imagination?The film is 100% what you would expect from a money making machine, doesn't inspire you and doesn't totally let you down.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

One Word: Underwhelming.,"A rather formulaic, dull epic that is a regular paint by numbers film as we have been here before countless times. Still, a couple of great cameos dating to previous Star Wars films are memorable and enjoyable. The only likable or interesting characters here are Director Orson Krennick played by the always effective Ben Mendelsohn, Galen Erso played by ""Hannibal"" star Mads Mikkelsen & a very sarcastic, dry imperial droid voiced by Alan Tudyk of ""Firefly"" fame. Personally I would have liked less dull action battles and some better written, more fleshed out characters, but at least we have Krennick even though he sadly is not given much to do. If you have seen the previous 7 films you will most likely be disappointed unless of a younger age, or know what will happen well before it happens. Sometimes it can be fun, but here it is often tedious and annoying. However, take what little enjoyable parts you can and enjoy the last minute, which is great. Could've been a lot better but is decent considering the fact there is not a ton to the plot, so make do with what you have.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

It's a shame that Star Wars 8 & 9 weren't as good as this, but at least Andor is.

You know you're in trouble when it doesn't even play the Star Wars theme at the start,"I haven't read other reviews or discussions yet, having just come back from watching this, but I'm surprised at the high score it's received on IMDb, when both the person I was with and myself came out being far from overjoyed with what we'd just seen.The good:The special effects are outstanding, particularly bringing back characters from A New Hope using CGI, which is near flawless.The last 5 or 10 minutes, where it sets up the story of A New Hope, is very well done.We see Darth Vader in melee action against the rebels.The bad:The pacing is terrible. It alternates between shows of action or battles and people making profound speeches (during which the action seems to stop), meaning that big set pieces that should be spectacular end up becoming tedious. There is way too much talking and conversation, which serves purely as filler and exposition, when the film should be focusing on showing us what's going on and not telling us.The director does not seem to know how to film action scenes or set up what should be epic set pieces properly. Even the prequels, for all their disappointment, never actually bored me and this had me looking at my watch on numerous occasions as a lot of it managed to be dull in spite of the tremendous material the film had to work with.The music seems to make a point of not reusing standard Star Wars themes as much as possible, it's nearly like they weren't allowed to and had to come up with a completely original score. There are a few themes that are reused, but they simply serve to highlight how inferior the soundtrack is to the other Star Wars movies.There is virtually no characterisation of even the main characters, much less the supporting ones. This means that the viewer doesn't care a lot about what happens to them.The ugly:The dialog is worse than anything George Lucas wrote in the original or the prequel trilogy. It's properly cringe worthy at times.Characters break the 4th wall on more than one occasion to speak straight to the audience to either deliver an ill judged comedic remark about what's going on or offer exposition about the events unfolding (I was half expecting one of them to look straight at the camera and ask ""Everybody got that?"")Darth Vader speaks too much.The actors playing the captain and pilot come across like they're reading direct from a script.While storm troopers have always been known as being terrible at aiming, it's taken to new heights here with their combat ineffectiveness being near comical.Overall:Mediocre, and disappointing. It's worth watching on the big screen for the visual spectacle and nostalgia factor as you'll remember the story from the opening crawl of A New Hope, but that's about it. It's a definite cash-in with little care given to quality in terms of plot, direction,characters, or acting.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

What a disappointment...,"Some already say this is the best Star Wars ever... I must have a problem somehow, because I have never been so bored watching a Star Wars movie. I expected nothing from this movie, but the cleverly made trailers did it, and I found myself wanting to see it quite badly. Ah the lure of going back to a galaxy far, far away... Well, if it were not for the cleverly sprinkled not so private jokes any dedicated fan will appreciate, the familiar universe, a quite good space and ground battle (but come on, Return of the Jedi anyone ? Déjà vu, déjà vu...), a surprisingly daring ending (I am not taking of the very last shots, one of which features a beloved returnee) leading to a nice relay to pass along the Death Star plans, this movie would be a complete waste of time.

Wrong walk, wrong moves, wrong shaped collar under the helmet, everything about this Vader is off, except James Earl Jones's voice ! This Vader is supposed to be the one we see entering the Tantive 4 with his stately, slightly heavy walk, not sauntering about like a young man ! He is not the youthful, strong Anakin Skywalker who duelled with Obi Wan, he is a 40something years old cripple who moves thanks to his armor ! Really, no one bothered to check how Vader moved in episode 4 ?! When I think how Episode 7 was dragged into the mud, how Abrams was charged with ""killing"" Star Wars, and now this boring mess is hailed as ""the Star Wars we were waiting for""...

"Utterly moving, most powerful 'Star Wars' story since A New Hope","A sequel to 'Revenge of the Sith', a prequel to 'A New Hope', 'Rogue One' is essentially a bridge that resembles to a colossal effort to accomplish three functions: explain the past, predict the future, create a tangible link between them, the last of which, this Gareth Edwards-helmed sci-fi giant is able to pull off with a brimming sense of nostalgic sentimentality. Often dark and brooding, there is an appealing force that emerges from its layers, continuously drawing us into the depths of 'Star Wars' cosmic saga that started to storm the box office, four decades ago. The 'force' persists in its riveting presence all throughout the film's visceral development, a monumental feat that itsTony Gilroy and Chris Weitz-written screenplay is able to preserve, even in the absence of the Jedi and Ewoks, Jar Jar Binks and the iconic opening crawl. In effect, the stand alone film manages to break down barriers, provide solutions to old puzzles, while practically presenting new ones that even non-religious spectators would be engaged to solve. That its motives is primarily enforced by the breathtaking visual renders of the film's explosive sequences, is out of the question, but the singular element that propels the film into action, is the story's protagonist, herself, and what she represents.Driven by a female hero at its reins like last year's 'The Force Awakens', this 'Star Wars' story revolves around petty criminal Jyn (Felicity Jones) and the band of misfits she gathered- -one that includes rebel spy, Cassian (Diego Luna), a reprogrammed imperial droid named KS2O, who shares the biggest chunk of the film's comic effort, and a blind monk whose martial arts-adroitness seemingly dares to put Matt Murdock's echolocation expertise to shame--to steal the plans to the 'Death Star', a deadly weapon, so powerful it can obliterate an entire planet. The emotional weight of the narrative is gathered across the length of Jyn's ambitious mission, which the film's primal campaign itself, labeled as a 'rebellion built on hope', a screaming hint to the looming much bigger movement led by Princess Leia, that sets the whole course for the original trilogy.Faithful to the tradition of female- centric narratives, Jyn's motivations is largely fueled by the traumatic childhood she endured: she saw her mother died at the mercy of an imperial superior, and the capture of his father who was forcefully recruited to engineer the empire's deadliest weapon--the Death Star. In the absence of an initiative, she courageously leads a highly-volatile expedition of recovering the plan to the Death Star, whose small but utterly significant flaw--one that could help the Rebel Alliance stop its cataclysmic power--is revealed by her father.Save for Jyn's uninspiring fight- for-freedom speech, only because it sounds monotonous, the whole run of 'Rogue One', is a glaring testament of what a mere hope can muster in the wake of a ruling authoritarian regime. The film then becomes a picture of a political atmosphere, infested with injustice and oppression, that bears a striking recognition. 'Trust the force', says Jyn's mother, in a tone that almost makes us believe that a movement always remains smoldering, only waiting to be ignited by small but resilient flames in the hands of courageous beings, awakened to rise by the screaming social malignance and political malfunction around them.The first of 'Star Wars' stand-alone films, 'Rogue One' is bold and moving with its lingering sense of humanity, nostalgic in its almost flawless integration with the saga's established structure, and ingeniously innovative in creating a whole new sci-fi space-war narrative that isn't devoid of the familiar 'the- force-is-with-me' sentiment. At its final moments, the film practically inserts a missing piece between the end and the beginning of the second and first trilogies, ending with a powerful one-second scene that can potentially make a voice in every spectator's head chant ""I am with the force; the force is with me"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Excellent addition to the star wars universe (spoiler free),"First off, this movie is taking a totally different direction than The Force Awakens. It's way more serious and adult orientated, and I for one loved that it did that.Parts of the movie are a bit slower during the newly introduced characters history / buildup but I did not mind that at all, and once the action gets going it looks amazing and is filmed and directed beautifully.There is also some comedic release especially from one character in the movie that works absolutely every time. The acting overall I'd say is always good to great especially from the main characters and I feel like Felicity Jones did an amazing job as Jyn Erso.Overall I'd probably give this a 9.25 / 10 and it's still behind Empire Strikes Back and a New Hope for me, but I'd say it's better than Force Awakens (which was another movie I loved) and I might even like it better than Return of the Jedi.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A movie caught between a director and the studio,"Rogue One is a movie that wishes to tell the story of the Rebellion's darker side, the anti-heroes who don't care who gets caught in the crossfire be it Imperial or Civilian.The story follows Jyn Erso, the daughter of Galen Erso, the lead scientist who created the Death Star. In a quest to find her father, she learns that Galen left a critical flaw in the Death Star's design. Jyn joins the Rebellion in hopes to fulfilling her father's wishes.Director Gareth Edwards tends to focus more on characters rather than spectacle, as seen in his previous films of Godzilla and Monsters. Here, the reverse happens. While Edwards' mastery of scale is something to behold, the large cast of characters have barely a moment to flesh themselves out. The stand-out is Alan Tudyk's K-2SO, a reprogrammed Imperial Droid that can't help but say what's on his mind and Donnie Yen's Chirrut, a devout believer in the Force who cannot wield it.The film reported a number of reshoots and they can't help but stick out. Just when Edwards wants to take an original turn in the Star Wars universe, a surprise cameo or two pops out of nowhere. Just as the film wishes to go darker, K-2SO says a funny one liner. It feels as though Disney is so afraid of fans disliking their film, they go the opposite direction and stuff it full of fan service, regardless of how it relates to the actual plot.I don't know if Gareth Edwards' original cut of the film would've been any better, but get the feeling there wouldn't be so much tonal clash if it did.

They were as flat as the characters that kids create when playing with Star Wars action figures.Also I prefer a plot that is THREADED and not just episodic.

""ROGUE ONE"" is something else.It's the ""Empire Strikes Back"" of all the other Star Wars films that have followed 'The Return of the Jedi'It is the film I have re-watched over & over again more than any of these others that came after Jedi.How this guy (Gareth Edwards) has not been put in charge again of another Star Wars film is beyond me, like many others here reviewing this film we know this is damn well nearly PERFECT.I shall whisper this quietly but for my money it is the 3rd Best film in the entire Star Wars saga & even then ONLY JUST and at times I do even feel it deserves to be right up there with the Original Star Wars film & it's fantastic sequel EMPIRE.This was director Gareth Edwards last cinema release film!!!How very, very strange & then one learns that this film ranks as one of only 50 films to ever make it past the ONE BILLION DOLLARS mark (said in a Dr Evil voice of course) perhaps it was Gareth's choice?I noticed his next film is due for release next year (some 7 years after Rogue One) called ""True Love"" which seems to be a sci-fi love story.Best of Luck with this one Gareth, but what in the world happened here?Most Star Wars fans have a real LOVE for what he created here, the atmosphere, the direction, the story, the acting, he's a special effects guy (a good one too) and he probably even had a hand in those too? Yet he seems to have been shunned after this film was released despite it becoming somewhat of 'cult' classic already.A cult classic that became one of the TOP 40 movie money makers of ALL TIME if we can have such a thing? Well, if we can? Then this is it.Let's show some LOVE for Mr Gareth Edwards who really did bring STAR WARS back to something akin to those originals we so fondly remembered.The folks at Disney could create much good will if they got him back in the director's chair...can you image COMIC CON & Gareth back as director of a Star Wars film?

The Star Wars Movie We Never Knew We Needed!!,"Rogue One is the best Star Wars stand alone movie to date!! It gave both A New Hope, and therefore the entire Star Wars movie saga, a shot in the arm by addressing one plot flaw that even legendary writer/director George Lucas missed when writing his groundbreaking Star Wars treatment back in the 1970's. That simple mistake, & the McGuffin or idea hat drives Rogue One, is how could something so powerful, something so expensive, something that took so much time and so many people and lives to make as the the super battle station the Death Star be defeated by a simple proton shot by a small X-Wing fighter flown by a dust cropper farm boy. Of course we learn through the movie there were inside men on the job and a team that stole the plans to the Death Star that eventually allowed that farm boy to destroy one of the most powerful weapons in all of the Star Wars universe!! Fresh new characters led by Felicity Jones as Jen Erso and Diego Luna as Cassian Andor bring new energy to the Star Wars universe and add gritty and realistic acting styles to Rogue One that take you back to the original trilogy only in a more desperate time!! Filled with moments that will take you back to the original trilogy (the gas giant planet Yavin, REAL Stormtroopers, the REAL Darth Vader in a scene that will blow your mind and is something out of your dreams - or nightmares) Rogue One is one of the most important and most well done Star Wars movies out there!! Good action, good costuming, very good acting, good sound editing, good soundtrack, excellent writing and directing make this movie both fun and something that has consequence for Star Wars fans!! 8 out of 10 stars!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I have never walked out of a movie in my life until now,"Just like the title says I have never walked out of a movie in my life, until now, and I am 42 years old. I have seen a ton of movies in my life in the theaters. I have also never in my life asked for a refund for a movie, until now. I felt cheated, lied to, so I politely asked the manager for my money back and was given it. THIS IS NOT A STAR WARS MOVIE. This is a cash grab. I quickly came home popped in a REAL Star Wars movie and tried to forget the atrocity that I just walked out of. Disney you have ruined what was arguably the best movie franchise in history, and most likely you will continue to do so. This is THE LAST star wars movie I will see in the theater until you prove otherwise.

Boring,"nothing happens the first 45 minutes.forest whitaker thinks he's in a Shakespeare play.this movie was basically a rip off of episodes 4,5 and 6.very dull movie but the sheeple will say they like it because they have been programmed by the media to like whatever you give them.this movie would not have been made 30 years ago, it would have been laughed at or gone straight to VHS.it has no soul no substance and no originality. is the art of film making dead or is just about cashing in? mr lucas must share some blame for selling up to Disney.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Has all the magic of the original trilogy,"There's been some pretty average efforts from Disney recently with the Star Wars movies. And in my opinion, bringing The Emperor back in Rise of Skywalker was the biggest crime in movie history. But this movie, Rogue One, is amazing. Great pacing, insane action sequences and it's just an end to end brilliant film. It has that magic that hasn't been scene since Return of the Jedi. It perfectly ties into the beginning of A New Hope, the story has weight and meaning, good humour, and there's none of the childish crap that always finds its way into the other Star Wars prequels/sequels. This movie slaps, I highly recommend.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The BEST Star Wars movie since Episode VI,"Finally they did it right. I had high hopes for this movie and I wasn't disappointed.This movie is everything you had hoped since they announced SW Ep. 1, almost 20 years ago. It feels right, it's not a kid's movie, with comic relieves, trying to please everyone, with charismatic characters and fluffy things. It feels real, a war between the Empire and the rebellion, and we now who should win.The acting is great, there's no waste of time trying to be funny. There's no battle droids doing stand up comedy, no out-of-touch aliens making you laugh though the movie. The plot is thick, very well written and makes sense.If you are a Star Wars fan, this movie will absolutely make you cry of joy. It has action, coherent dialogs and is well paced. I hope the other Star Wars movies to come learn from this masterpiece.TL:DR: It's worth every single cent.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Extraordinary,"After hearing many good reviews about this movie, besides planning to see it on the big screen, I had high expectations and oh boy, they were worth the wait. We were a bit disappointed by last year's The Force Awakens and Rogue One brought us a much needed breath of comeback in the Star Wars saga. Even from the beginning and till the end you never stop admiring the beauty that this movie is. Gareth Edwards managed to show us why we started to love the Star Wars universe in the first place and he did his best to raise the bar high. For myself, I loved this movie and I hope that every new one that will be launched in the future will be as great as this one. Probably my favourite scene was the ending where Vader goes mayhem, in an environment that might be familiar to us (the beginning of A New Hope).",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"I mean, I guess it's entertaining?","So I'm a massive Star Wars geek, love it, but I had some issues with this one.The first 10 minutes introduces you to far too many characters and planets for a normal person to make much sense of. It's just all too much - visually stunning, but mostly unnecessary. Come to think of it, the first 30minutes as a whole are a little big higglty-pigglty jumping between here and there, character to character. It was really hard to focus on any character without that firm footing, and I felt like they missed an opportunity to help the audience connect with the characters.I personally felt no connection to Jyn; I didn't understand what made her tick, her motives, or why she did what she did in some situations. If they meant for her to be a lovable rogue, I'd say they failed. She was more of an enigma. Even in the last few scenes I was trying to figure out why she was doing what she was doing. But OK, if we put that to one side and just take a 'hero' pill, you can mostly ignore the poor scripting and lack of character development and enjoy another dive into the Star Wars universe.The movie is very slow to get going, but as it went on, the better it got. The last 30-40 minutes were fantastic, and I thoroughly enjoyed the ending.If you're a Star Wars fan, there are plenty of nods and 'in-jokes' which you'll enjoy, and the battle scenes are epic, but overall I was quite disappointed to be honest.I mean, I guess it's entertaining? But I was disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Rogue One: Star Wars without glowing swords?,"Rogue One is an odd creature.I saw it with a couple of friends not really expecting anything. I love Star Wars and I even partly enjoy the notorious prequel trilogy, but I forced myself to not have too high hopes coming into Rogue One and the result was... decent.It's annoying that I couldn't really love this film because by all accounts I should. Rogue One offers the audience a more in-depth look into the Star Wars universe, it offers a glance behind the scenes and what happens with normal people, or at least more normal than Jedi and Sith Lords. Jyn Erso, the main character, isn't some 'chosen one' or powerful jedi, she's just a girl who's daddy worked and now works for the Empire.In fact none of these characters are particularly special in that sense. The other members of Rogue One, although not all delicately expanded, are still relatable and most are good fun, most notably K- 2SO and the rebel member, Cassian. The villain, Orson Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) is also not someone particularly special, just an influential individual in the Empire. It's not the 'Vader Show', an easy trap to fall into.But despite this there's something about this film that just doesn't do it for me. The character of Jyn Erso is far superior in terms of characterisation to last year's 'Rey' but there's still much left to be desired. These characters, although plentiful, are not all that interesting and when the film tries to make the audience see that in some respects the Rebllion is no better than the Empire I feel it focuses on the wrong aspects and misses the mark.I feel Rogue One wanted to introduce a moral grey to the Star Wars universe, a sense that although the Empire is bad and Rebels good that the Rebellion doesn't exactly employ totally moral means to always achieve its aims, but I rarely ever felt that. By the end of the film it felt like the same old boring 'good vs bad' with an awfully predictable ending mainly due to the fact that 'A New Hope' exists. There's no tension regarding whether the Death Star plans will be recovered because everyone already knows they will be.I was originally going to award this film 6 stars but the last five minutes of the film (anyone who's seen it will agree) is so well made I had to give it an extra. It's not as good as the originals in my book, probably not as good as 'Force Awakens' and maybe not even as good as 'Revenge of the Sith' but it's still a pretty fun show with some nice gems here and there. I just wished it could've gone the extra mile and kept the gems coming throughout.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""Rogue One: Revitalizing the Galaxy with New Heroes","After watching the Skywalker film series and the ""Obi-Wan Kenobi"" mini-series for the first time in 2024, I was hesitant to continue. I was quite disappointed with the Obi-Wan series and wanted to avoid further disappointments.However, ""Rogue One"" turned out to be an excellent film, even better than the last two films of the sequel trilogy. It had a straightforward story, solid acting, and interesting new characters. Unlike recent projects, it didn't rely heavily on old characters-though a few familiar faces appeared, they weren't the main focus, which was refreshing.This is what recent Star Wars projects have been missing: the introduction of new, intriguing characters rather than relying on the old ones. While ""Rogue One"" has its flaws-it's a bit too long for such a simple story, and some action scenes felt a bit tedious-it was still a solid film overall. I hope they explore this direction further in the future.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great special effects,"As ever the special effects were outstanding. However don't believe the 10/10 ratings these are likely to be from people with a Star Wars shaped void in their lives living for the next release. There are numerous new characters in this episode, all with their own stories some of them very interesting unfortunately possibly too many characters to develop any affinity with as they feature all to briefly. This is despite the story being quite long and meandering. Enjoyable battle scenes and nice to see the resurgence of the 70s/80s moustache for the fighter pilots. However the lead characters are weak it's difficult to develop any empathy for them or really care what happens to them. Diego Luna......... Why? He has the charisma of a wet rat in this film. Enjoyable as a family film but ultimately disappointing for my 11 year old who usually leaves talking about the best characters or machines or robots. No one is outstanding here actor wise, the characters back stories are undeveloped the stars are the special effect coordinators and designers here.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Tedious but pretty,"I went into this fill fully expecting to enjoy myself, but right from the beginning I couldn't get into it. The beginning was really choppy, with no character set up or development for the protagonist -- we jump straight from her as a little girl to as an adult with nothing in between. (And never do we get any. The main antagonist has more of a character arc.) In the meantime, there are a lot of choppy cuts to different places we know and care nothing about.This movie was dull, dull, dull. I never cared about any of the characters, the plot, when not chopped to pieces, was a combination of cliché, predictable, and idiotic, the dialogue was extremely forced, and the comic relief character had plenty of hackneyed one liners but no actual personality to support them. (Actually, the comic relief character was basically a self-aware version of Guardians of the Galaxy's Drax. That self-awareness and deliberate comic timing made the character basically a stand-up comedian, and not a particularly good one, instead of an actual character.) Of the dozens of jokes told, maybe three got a slight chuckle out of me -- and none of them had any real value.I will say this: the visuals were stunning. There was also a brief sequence near the end I quite enjoyed. But that wasn't nearly enough to stop me from frequently wondering throughout the film when it was going to end and thinking extremely sarcastic thoughts when something uncommonly idiotic or cliché (usually both) occurred.What a disappointment.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
In the 'Top Four'!!...,"...Just watched this for third time and enjoyed it immensely again...easily, one of the Best SW films...no politics just fun, fast-paced action with a handsome, talented cast which included some surprises,(...one of my fave Martial Artist's of all-time the brilliant Donnie Yen...),which was a big plus, for me, when I first saw this flick...I really enjoyed watching him showcase his amazing skills for people who may never had seen him before. There were some fantastic Battles with some truly breathtaking vistas on view as our heroes battled the evil Empire and while I disliked the film 'Monsters' which brought the Director to the Fore,(..kept waiting for something...anything...to happen..),I thought he did a Fabulous Job with this little Gem....

Star Wars Episode 3.5. Brilliant film!,"Very well thought out film, fits in nicely with A New Hope. Loved the end where Rogue One meets New Hope. Such a shame CGI was used for a couple of characters but understandable to tie things together.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An misunderstood Neologikos to the Saga,"Rogue One is a bold and original film that stands out from the other Star Wars films. It is darker, more realistic and uncompromising than the typical adventures of the Jedi and the rebels. It shows us another side of the war against the Empire, a side full of shades of gray, sacrifices and moral questions.The plot revolves around a group of mismatched heroes who join forces to steal the plans of the Death Star, the ultimate weapon of the Empire. The main character is Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones), the daughter of a scientist (Mads Mikkelsen) who was forced to build the Death Star. She is recruited by Cassian Andor (Diego Luna), a spy for the Rebel Alliance, and accompanied by a colorful bunch of characters: the sarcastic droid K-2SO (Alan Tudyk), the blind warrior Chirrut Îmwe (Donnie Yen), his friend Baze Malbus (Wen Jiang), the rogue pilot Bodhi Rook (Riz Ahmed) and the radical freedom fighter Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker).The film is packed with spectacular action scenes that take us break to the music by Michael Giacchino which fits perfectly with the tone of the film. The film is also full of references and connections to other Star Wars films that will delight fans. Especially noteworthy are appearances by Darth Vader (played by Spencer Wilding and Daniel Naprous, voiced by James Earl Jones) and Princess Leia (brought to life by digital magic) and Team Leader Red. Those Guts!Rogue One is more than just a filler. It is a standalone film with its own identity and message. It shows us the price of resistance against evil and the importance of courage and hope in dark times. It also shows us the diversity and complexity of life.Thanks.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Speechless...,"Rogue One has left me speechless...The characters were written to the extent that you would feel for them, and the actors/ actresses playing said characters enhanced that effect.To say that this movie was amazing would be an understatement-- I'd go so far as to put it as my third favourite Star Wars movie, only behind The Empire Strikes Back and Revenge of the Sith.This is an easy 9.5/10, which is pretty damn close to perfect.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Underwhelmed,"Rogue One is not a bad film but it certainly isn't a great film. The film has excellent digital effects and looks great on screen and this is where its strengths lie. The pacing of the film was completely off and I felt the main characters were all quite flat which resulted in me not really caring what happened to them unlike the characters in the excellent 'The Force Awakens'. I suppose it is quite strange when the best performance in the film is from a CGI generated human being (the original actor died over 20 years ago). I think the lack of a John Williams score was extremely noticeable and the film suffered due to this. I have read reviews where some people have said this is better than 'The Empire Strikes Back', I know everyone has their own opinion but I find that astounding. If you like plenty of action etc. you will enjoy the third act, unfortunately you will have to grind through large parts of the first two acts to get there.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Corny in parts but good.  Mainly for kids.,"I went to see Rogue one not knowing what to expect. It takes place immediately before Star Wars and the entire crawl on Star Wars is the synopsis of Rogue One. there are a few things I noticed about Rogue One. The Storm Troopers may as well not even have armor. The armor is completely ineffective against even being punched much less shot at. My friend Jason Houston saw it and agrees. Also, I noticed that Darth Vader in his Bacta Tank was a neat scene but I was hoping that we could see the tank empty and then look at Darth without his costume. I was also hoping that the guy who plays Hannibal Lechter would have had more of a role. Forrest Whitaker's character was really funny. The way he spoke will be imitated for generations. He reminded me of that villain from Mad Max - Immortan Joe. When he had that blob like octopus read the pilots mind, I thought it was Jabba the Hutt at first! The Death Start was really neat looking. I liked all of the graphics. I am sorry I had to go to the restroom when R2D2 and 3PO made a cameo, ugh. I thought that Felicity Jones's character was so so. All of the accents bugged me. Danny from Bloodline was a so so villain. The scenes on the ""beach"" like planet reminded me of the D-Day invasion to an extent. Darth Vader only has 10 minutes of screen time. He sounded more like James Earl Jones than ever this time around. Grand Moff Tarken was silly looking as CGI and so was Princess Leah. Like I said, one thing that is good about this movie is that it's good special effects but overall, it's a a little hokey. Lenny said she liked how they resurrected Grand Moff Tarkin and the movie kept her attention more than the others. I like the Darth Vader light saber scene at the end.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"I expected a new take on Star Wars films, but this your average action flick","I am a huge fan of Star Wars universe and when I first heard about Rogue One and the amazing lineup of actors - including Mads Mikelsen, Forest Whitaker, Ben Mendelson, Donnie Yen and others, it felt as this movie could be an independent, almost artistic take on Star Wars galaxy.I know I must be delusional but I strongly believe that this is what the Star Wars in 2016 era needs. A step away from the action, CGI flick into something much more intimate, atmospheric, with much less CGI. To me, Rogue One felt as any other modern comic superhero flick.I remember Rogue One being advertised as a different take on Star Wars, being a ""war movie"", a movie about small scale warfare and a band of rebels taking on a small operation. But as I watched it, it felt like the last Episode in different clothes. Do we really need two of the same Hollywood blockbuster movies?As I walked out of the cinema, I thought to myself how awesome it would be if they used half of the budget and actually had Neil Bloomkamp direct this - his sense for tactical and grand sci-fi but placed within a small intimate story of few individuals (think District 9, Chappie, Elysium) would be a perfect fit for a Star Wars spin off film, one that Rogue One was supposed to be.And I write this only because I felt the whole plot and drive of Rogue One was so lacking. And the actors I had such high hopes for and I absolutely love them, had such small part and such lacking lines in the movie, I do almost feel robbed.And Donnie Yen - I mean come on, we get one action sequence from him. He had such a potential for a non-Jedi bad ass role in the story but one short fight scene is all we got.It's not a bad movie, but average at best. If you are a die hard Star Wars fan, you'll like it. And there's some great cameo appearances although they came off a bit cheesy for me.But I wrote this as I believe Star Wars needs something different. I hope we get it one day. Disney, please give Neil Bloomkamp a new set of Star Wars stories, micro-stories, something set away from the plot of the main movies. Please.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Rogue One, is a class scifi film.","Of all the recent Star Wars films, this one is the best for me. Yes, the ending should be familiar to anyone who has seen Star Wars films before. But here the rare synthesis of bringing the old films together in a new time succeeds. Something like the computer game ""Alien Isolation"". That the prehistory is taken seriously, the plot is carried on consistently and real heart and soul is put into the project. That's why the film feels so good and is watchable several times. Not everything is perfect, but the bar is very high. This film stands on its own in the Star Wars universe and it looks like it won't change much anytime soon. I'd like to see more of that, but unfortunately we get annoyed with such cucumber series like Bad Batch, Obi Wan etc. Movies like Solo: A Star Wars Story are coming out, they would be rejected by me in the planning stages and don't even get me started on the other recent movies.

Rogue One (2016),"General Notes: Rogue One was marketed as an action-war film that happens to take place in the Star Wars universe. That is what I was hoping for and for the most part, it delivered.Positives: I enjoyed a few of the secondary characters. Imperial droid K-2SO stole every scene he was in. He was very snarky and played off the human characters very well. The interplay between blind warrior Chirrut Îmwe and mercenary Baze Malbus was also very well done. The third act of the film was excellent as it really did feel like a war movie. Rogue One is at its best when it is focused on the rebellion against the empire and not on fan service. More on that below. I do like the fact that the Disney took a chance and tried to make a different kind of Star Wars film. The tone is much darker and emphasizes the war aspect of Star Wars. HoweverNegatives: The character development was lacking. I watched Jyn Erso's story, but I really never liked her as a person. Felicity Jones' performance was flat and uninspiring. This is not what you want from your lead character when they are is supposed to inspire a reluctant rebel alliance. Captain Cassian Ando was basically an ass throughout the first half of the movie, and then he suddenly wasn't. His abrupt change in personality did not work for me. Another reason it was hard to relate to the characters, is the fact that it is almost impossible to identify anyone by name. While watching the movie, one of my favorite side characters was ""the Asian-looking blind martial artist"". It was never Chirrut Îmwe, which is a horrible name by the way. Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Lando Calrissian are memorable names and roll of the tongue rather easily. Chirrut Îmwe? Baze Malbus? How are you supposed to pronounce those? Plus, I do not ever remember the names being used in the film.Mixed: I am somewhat torn on the use of Darth Vader in this movie. While it was nice to see him back on the screen, he was not critical to the story and he was a bit of a distraction. Part of the problem was his voice. Although he was again voiced by James Earl Jones, something did not seem quite right. In fact, after the movie, I had to check the Internet to make sure it was really him voicing Vader. This brings me to another problem I had with the movie, excessive and unnecessary fan service. A movie set in the Star Wars universe would be remiss if it did not include some things that we are familiar with. Lightsabers, AT-AT's, dogfights in space, Stormtroopers etc. are welcomed and are somewhat expected. However, Rogue One goes too far by including things that can be found in a more in-depth spoiler filled review. Lastly, I was surprised the in inconsistency of the special effects. There are times, especially early in the film, when the star destroyers look like unpainted models bought from a hobby shop. It just looked a bit unfinished. This was a $200-million-dollar movie. There is no excuse for that. There are few more comments I would like to make, but I do not want to spoil anything for those who have not seen the film.Overall: Is Rogue One a bad movie? Absolutely not. Is it a good movie? Wellmaybe. At the time of this writing, I am less than 24 hours away from seeing the film. My feelings on Rogue One may change over time and upon a second viewing. For the most part, I found the movie enjoyable, but it had too many flaws for me to give it high marks. I give it a rating of 6.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Not too bad but nowhere near Lucas own films,"Well, it was not as bad as Force Awakens, it was quite watchable. However, I agree with all those who say that this film has not recreated the original magic in the films written, directed or at least produced by George Lucas himself. Whoever makes the film puts the stamp of their mind and imagination on it and neither of two films made by Disney has the feel and magic of George Lucas Star Wars world. In spite of any flaws that Lucas films had, he created a huge gallery of very interesting, unique, memorable characters and different worlds in universe. His films were always full of surprises. It was easy to remember all the main characters. Both in Force Awakens and Rogue one we have a bunch of greasy looking fellows, and they always come in a big pile and are hard to remember as most of them are quite boring. A lot of places in the universe look too much like Earth. Rogue one was definitely better and more intelligent out of the two made by Disney, but still, it had too much confusing, all-the-same looking action, predictable and clichéd storyline. Still, it was OK to watch at Saturday evening.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Only modern Star Wars done right,"After the original Episode 4-6 trilogy, it's been all downhill, let's face it.I'm rewatching this at home many years after watching it in the cinema on original release. This is such a good movie with an excellent original story and characters and performances, that ALSO ties up directly with Episode IV beautifully - without any cheap fan-service and cringe.You get to see hard boiled rebel fighters with no ""hero-candy"" on them, you get to see hard sacrifices for the Rebellion in the time of their desperate need, and you get to see all of this with heart and charisma and no cheap stuff.The Stormtroopers are no meme here, they may not be the elite warriors out there, but they're not cartoonish either.Another aspect is: even though there's little ""Jedi"" / Force stuff, it feels true Star Wars in a way other stuff doesn't.Also, this movie just blends in so naturally into episode IV it's like you are watching security cam footage - no aggrandizing, just the bare stuff that in itself is good.And if you like space battles with capital ships and fighters and crazy piloting maneuvers: you got the best here in spades.Again, after this movie, I've felt it has all been downhill. I'm glad I came back to this, maybe one day one true Star Wars film will be great again.After 8y and a new trilogy and many TV series I go back to this movie and yep: this is still the modern best, BY A MILE!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Very boring unless you're a teenagers and don't know any better,"Let's be clear, it is not up to the level of entertainment, and expectations, of the last installment of the revived franchise. Last year, there was trepidation at the thought of a new star wars movie. This episode goes back in time thus it is pretty well done as far as the times it describes but frankly, it was pretty boring. I do love my fair share of spaceship battles or ground fights, rebels against the evil forces of the Empire but this episode is not much fun or entertainment although I would not accuse it of being badly done. It is only its lack of ""soul"" if ever entertainment had one, or more precisely humour and relationships between the characters whom have just met and are engaged in a battle for their survival. So it is clear there was no time to build relationships or give much depth to the characters. Even the robot wasn't as cute as most of them in the franchise, and R2D2 is more fun to listen to, even though we don't understand a single word rather than the humorous lines of this one. So it was well done, professionally, but flat and, rather boring. I was particularly disappointed in the lack of ""scariness"" of #DarthVader, of all evil ! The magnificent voice is there but it's the allure, the frightening allure of the least human of all dark forces that did not match the usual way we see him.

Best Star Wars movie of the Disney Era,"After the disaster that was the Last Jedi and with the entire ""new"" trilogy in shambles Rogue One is now clearly the best Star Wars movie of the Disney Era.

Ignore the rage-blinded critics...,"Whether you're a fan of star wars or not, this is a worth-while movie! There are amazing qualities in this film: from soundtrack to plot, character development to visuals; this film does a great job at balancing it all out. Are there elements which give great tribute to fans? Duh. Does it takeaway from the story and leave MASSIVE plot holes? No. The story was clearly thought out.

Insanity,"There are two characters in this movie that are supposed to look like human beings. Instead, they look like mid 90's Playstation computer game characters. I fail to see how a production with a budget of 200 million can screw this up. It is utterly laughable.Also laughable, the manner in which the story is told. Mostly by characters that more or less explain it like they're reading children a book. ""Hey, remember that you need to do this and this so this and that will happen which was all planned for by your dad and he did it all for the best of us all.""I want to go on but I can't effing bother anymore. The world has gone to shite and it's all because of Disney!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Fun At Times But Flawed and Unnecessary,"I was really excited for Rogue One, I was fully aware that this movie was not necessarily needed but I wasn't to concerned about that as long as it was entertaining and had good characters and only to a certain extent did they succeed. This is not a bad film but it's just not all that great and will not stand as one of the better Star Wars films. But there was plenty of good in this film for one it looks incredible, Gareth Edward did a fantastic job at blending special effects with real life and was seamless, he is also a master at showing scale and making his films seem gritty and real. This is a war film and it made the world seem more grounded in reality. The performances were pretty good, Felecity Jones was really good and had a nice arc to her, Diego Luna was also really good and was an entertaining character, I haven't seen much of Donnie Yen but he really impressed me in this film and his character was a nice way of showing how the fall of the Jedi effected more than just the Jedi themselves. But easily this films greatest performance was Mads Mikkelson, he's one of my favourite actors and he was just perfect in this film as a father and as a man faced with an impossible situation. The last act of this film is easily its best it's directed amazingly you are invested in the plan and is easily the best thing about this film. But for every positive in this film there is a negative and this film has plenty. For one the character for the most part remained undeveloped, other than Jyn Erso not enough backstory and motivations are provided. I love Forrest Whitaker but he was so bad in this movie, his voice and mannerisms were completely over the top and was not a necessary character. Like I said I loved the last act of this movie but the first two were dull, slow and uninteresting for the most part. Obviously one of the things people are most looking forward to in this film is Darth Vader and he is a fantastic presence when he was in the film and I truly think that he could have been used more as the scenes he was in he added nothing to the plot other than fan service. Star Wars has a bit of a tradition of adding comic relief through droids and this film follows that tend but fails at it, K2SO was funny at first but after a while became really annoying and his humour was really forced.I loved The Force Awakens and I was hoping that this film would tide me over until Episode 8 next year but it really hasn't, its an entertaining enough movie but far from one I'm going to be dying to watch again soon, if your a Star Wars fan you can at least appreciate it but it fails to live up to other entries in the franchise and doesn't give me a lot of hope for future anthology films.66%/B-",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Such a similar feel the the Original Trilogy😁,"This movie has such a similar and brilliant feel to the original trilogy and that makes me extremely happy! I'm a massive fan of Star Wars and so are my parents, the both of them said that it reminded them of the original trilogy and made them want to watch A New Hope straight afterwards. It did the same for me!

A story and characters that won't hold up on the small screen,"""Rogue One"", as an actual Star Wars movie, left me surprisingly cold. I guess it all came down to the core group of characters, none of whom really clicked for me. Their whole campaign was a generic motley strike team story, seen before and done better in other films. It's actually kind of a snooze until the X-Wings show up. Prior to that, it's just hopping from one planet to the next.But these characters aren't all that important, are they? this is another chapter in Disney's Cinematic Expanded Universe, and we're all here to see the lead-up to the original '77 Star Wars. In a way, this is almost more fan-fiction than ""The Force Awakens"" was. Everything's a nod or a reference, and to be honest, that's what's honestly satisfying about all of this; it's played to calculated effect. I got a kick out of seeing Darth Vader, not to mention the Tantive IV; the recycled '77 footage was nice touch; we had James Earl Jones and the red lenses again; and they actually did a decent job ""reanimating"" Peter Cushing.But are they actually going to do something new with Star Wars or just keep playing on our nostalgia?6/10Leia didn't fare so well in the CGI department, but given the recent loss, the ending carried an unexpected poignance.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best Disney Star Wars,"Rogue One is the best Star Wars prequel, striking a balance between pushing this franchise forward with bold ideas and having a clear affection for what's come previously with so many easter eggs. It brings some moral greys to a universe that's usually so clear in its good & evil whilst still being about hope deep down.Felicity Jones gives a great lead performance, there's enough depth to her character with a nice arc as well. Diego Luna is so good with only a little depth, trying to make amends for a dark past and ironically, Alan Tudyk is the most human character of the group plus he's such a strong comic relief.Donnie Yen is just so cool as usual, made even better by his solid chemistry with Jiang Wen which leads to some pretty emotional moments. Ben Mendelsohn is obviously a perfect villain, using his rage in an attempt to make up for his overall lack of control and dominance.Gareth Edwards' direction here confirms that no one communicates scale like him. The Death Star and Star Destroyers have been in so many films but they're scale has never been felt like this. The handheld camera for the action really works but Edwards wisely chooses to shoot Donnie Yen's action as cleanly as possible.The CG is honestly pretty faultless, blending the practical with the CG so well and going to great lengths to make it look like models. Being the first non John Williams Star Wars score is no easy task but Michael Giacchino succeeds effortlessly, crafting something distinct that's more mournful but still sweeping and full of hope.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

By far the best Star Wars movie since the original trilogy,"Upon my first watch I wasn't totally sure about Rogue One, but every time I watch it since my view becomes more positive. That's especially true when compared to the CGI over reliant prequels and the disaster sequels and the frankly woeful Solo.This actually has a solid script which ties in nicely to the other films (unlike Solo where there is no consistency), it's extremely well acted, balances the tension of the story, which is darker in tone the most films in the universe. The two leads Felicity Jones and Diego Lima were little known at the time but are amazing in every sense. The supporting cast are all great too without the need to childish humour or dumbing down. You realise they are in a fight for survival for different reasons and willing to do what ever it takes to succeed.The film ends perfectly but you have a bitter sweet feeling.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The greatest Star Wars movie after the original trilogy,"Wonderfully it captures the spirit, tone and immense universe of the trilogy with being original and fitting perfectly into the original lore and canon, every single character has meaning and purpose and every death on screen is felt like a lightsaber slash, rebels and imperials alike. Why on earth the other Star Wars movies cannot have been written like this one??? What a shameful waste. Why all the hate and ridicule imposed on beloved characters? I loved the very strong leads regardless of gender and identity, multiculturalism is still there to reflect the universal scope of the many races portrayed on screen. Watch it and watch it again to remind yourself what a wonderful experience is Star Wars. And forget what garbage is being vomited these days.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
At least it is better than The Stupid Awakens,"We all know what is going to happen at the end of the story. We just don't know how it will happen.Rogue One certainly isn't the best Star Wars movie but at least it is better than the abomination of The Farce Awakens that dares to have the title of Star Wars.With a 2nd Star Wars movie released by Disney it is crystal clear now that all this company cares about is money (of course) and force their political liberal leftist narrative into this beautiful universe. Anyone who denies this is either stupid or a liar.Some words about the content of the film now. You get an action packed adventure with as much Empire and Rebels you can wish for. Felicity Jones is a bad actress but hey, that's Dinsey forcing females into the main role. There is also a lot of violence and I can imagine it would have been much more without Disney's censorship. The CGI for the space battle were bad. I really don't understand why they did them so lame. There was no speed and excitement about them (the missing Lucas touch is once again obvious here). The rest of the action scenes are good and anyone can enjoy them.Having said this, if you are a fanboy, desperately in need of some fan service, then you'll get plenty of that with Rogue One. There are many surprises that will make you happy, from the beginning to the end of the film.If you are a fanboy who wants something original and daring like George Lucas did with the prequels, then don't spend money to watch Rogue One because you will be disappointed. Better wait until you can watch it on TV. Rogue One still misses the mythology, philosophy and history that surrounds the Star Wars chapters made by George Lucas.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Force is Strong with this one,"I will admit after a certain disappointment with Force Awakens I had low expectations when going to this... In fact I was terribly afraid I'd have the same depression for a week like after watching Force Awakens, but mate, how wrong I was...Cinematography : From the first shot in space you see, this is a space scene done the right way... The director puts the shots and lighting in a way so that it all looked as if you actually lived out there...Story : we all know how it ends pretty much, yes it's a simple story it was obvious from the trailer, but believe it or not there are moments that will make you feel for both heroes and villains, there is a sense of danger, you know the stakes are high and you know any of these characters can die any time...Characters: By the end of the film Jyn will become your Joan of Arc in Star Wars universe... Every single sarcastic moment will come out of the mouth of K-2SO, he will make your day... Ben Mendelson did a great performance as villain, the decisions his character made are not as good as what Thrawn would do but, his last moment will be epic!!!Attention to details and Universe: Now I will say, George Lucas will be proud, the space battle in the end is on an epic scale, no lame dark shots like Force Awakens, the battle is in the Orbit of a Blue planet, every detail on every ship looks great, the fleet operations are stunning, special thanks to Ramming Frigate!!!Resurrected Characters : Those will make your jaw drop...In Conclusion I should say, yes they took a lot of ideas from Return of The Jedi, but mate, they made it right and improved upon it...A must see for every true Fan, more than once...Jyn Forever!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

End of an era,"It was actually a very nice movie. If it was called anything else then Star Wars I would have cheered the quality and the entertainment value of the movie and would probably rate it with an eight or a nine.The problem is, it is a Star Wars movie.When I am going to see a Star Wars movie, I am not going to see a movie, but I am going to check out how they have been, what they have been doing, how the empire is developing, are they gaining more power? Who is taking the place of the fallen on both sides, who is now taking a stand against the empire who is going to make an effort to crush the rebels? Or is the evil now in the run are the Jedi's now rising in numbers, are of will they ever come back if so how etc. etc. etc....At the very beginning of the movie, I was very disappointed and didn't recover form.

Finally a Star Wars movie to put on the same shelf as the originals!!!!!?####,"Star Wars Rouge One is at last the prequel we've been waiting for. It retains Lucas's flavor and at the same time isn't afraid to be original. The action sequences rock, Darth Vader was better then ever. The only problem was the Japanese samurai warrior and his bamboo stick. However as a whole this movie had a simple plot, like a the original Star Wars movies, the characters were very well crafted and lovable. And all the criticism about the CGI is crap, rouge couldn't of done without it. The film has all the right story elements which makes it not only a great Star Wars film, but a awesome movie. The film also should've at least been nominated for Best picture, but being that it's on the surface apolitical it couldn't be nominated. Instead Moonlight and fences are nominated, two crappy films with the same agenda. Well maybe Star Wars 8 will scrape a nomination.

An unworthy cash-in,"I write as a dyed-in-the-wool Star Wars fan. I hated this movie.The actual story is tissue-paper thin and could have been done much better. There is an awful lot of padding - some scenes are as painfully long as an in-game cut-scene that you can't get out of. To make up for lack of story, lots of CGI has been thrown into the mix to try to create a ""wow"" factor. It doesn't. All it does is emphasise how weak the story actually is. For me, an adult fan (I'm 50), it was pretty poor but my 6 and 13 year old nephews seemed to enjoy it. Most of the adults seemed to think it was ""OK"".This is not a worthy addition to the canon, unlike The Force Awakens, which was.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Excellent. A Fantastically Exciting New Star Wars Adventure,"BLOWN AWAY is what comes to mind with Rogue One as yes i grew up on the Star wars franchise but this movie is a more grown up & darker in tone & actually gritty & a real sense of danger so to me it's actually as great as the classic's as it holds its own as a darker more mature installment.The group of rebels are excellent & the story is exciting & dangerous so the atmosphere is very dark & often emotional!!!A fantastic sci-fi Thriller not just a great star wars movie as this is a brilliant sci-fi film that's excellently directed & it looks amazing.Rogue One stands out as easily the best of the franchise, yes even better than the original Trilogy, here this movie feels like a War film or a mission movie which it is both & has a dark overall atmosphere. I love men-on-a-mission movies or ladies & gents-on-a-mission such as DC's Suicide Squad & Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds or Black Hawk Down or Triple Frontier among many others & Rogue One fits in perfectly to that sub-genre.The battle scenes are fast, frantic & furious with gritty impact like a battle would be like & for a fantasy sci-fi Thriller it's one exciting & at times emotional wild ride.The cast is great as is each interesting character & performances especially from Felicity Jones as Jyn Erso, a daring freedom fighter & the heart & soul of the movie & Diego Luna as Cassian Andor the rebel spy & they with the others band together to go on a desperate & danger mission to steal the plans to the Death Star, which is the prequel story to the very first ""New Hope""
Yes the other movies are of course iconic classic's but this is an new exciting piece of Star Wars art & a brilliantly crafted sci-fi adventure/Thriller with meaning & a much more urgent excitement feel to it & in my opinion a better more grown up star wars film & a perfect film in the franchise.

Rogue One #morecash #boredom,"I find overall 2016 not so very successful about blockbuster movies that came out, but deep inside I told myself maybe Rogue One could come close to the unanticipated success of The Force Awakens. Nevertheless in the end we all asked ourselves ""Is this movie really necessary?"". After watching it, I believe the answer is a big ""No"".The story is about how the Rebels got the plan of ""Death Star"" in order to defeat the Empire and save their galaxy. The daughter of the main engineer of Death Star is Galen Erso, played by incredible Mads Mikkelsen, is put up a difficult task. His tiny little fierce daughter named Jyn Erso is given the task by the Rebels to capture his father as well as the plans to Death Star. The Rebels intend to destroy the biggest war machine through this little girl by giving her a quite impossible mission.So by taking a look at features of Felicity Jones, you might say Daisy Ridley wasn't tall or an Athlete either. However, Daisy Ridley in The Force Awakens was very convincing in her role as a scavenger and was a muscular, agile fighter. With Felicity Jones, from the beginning I had no belief or whatsoever that she could take down one Trooper with a single hand , or could fight them off with only a stick. Something with her is really off-putting, I'm sorry but she is really not meant for action roles. Even during her speech in front of a group of Rebel soldiers was far from convincing, her facial expressions and her voice sounded.. amateur.The other characters had all problems as well. I think the main problem starts with the script which was heavily loaded with clichés such as countless repetitions of ""Hope"", not getting killed during prayers (and how come is this a Jedi thing?!), slow motion deaths, Deus-Ex Machina moments and so on. The movie was so predictable that no one could really care about any deaths in the movie. You will be like ""Yeah, that was coming"".After all, I think this was a huge waste of time and a very unnecessary addition to Star Wars series which proved that Lucas wants more cash and that's all about it. By that, I don't know how much more money, I mean, they are super rich right? Just stop! And for Felicity Jones, sorry but it was very unfortunate that her lead came out after great performance of Daisy Ridley. She shouldn't be in action movies.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, fan service with terrible pacing","My favorite Star Wars movie was always The Empire Strikes Back, not only because it is the best Star Wars film but because it is a well crafted movie as a whole. Through the eyes of a fan everything can be good except maybe for George Lucas' green screens, but it's an obligation to watch and review it as a movie, not as a hype product. That's why The Empire Strikes Back is so great, it doesn't matter from what perspective you are viewing, either Star Wars fan or movie buff, it is still a masterpiece.Rogue One tells a very messy story with uncharismatic characters about something that didn't need to be explained. The movie has poor character development leading to them being boring and irrelevant to spectators, including the protagonist Jyn that lacks charisma even for a role in a meaningless spin off. Every character feels shallow and the acting doesn't help to change that, just makes it worse.The pacing of the movie is were it shines, it's so utterly bad that establishes a whole new level of terrible pacing in movies. Half of it's duration being slow paced scenes with failed character development, making it very tedious, and the other half being so chaotic with so much rushed action scenes that it also succeeds on being tedious. It's also worth noticing that this movie uses some of the most unconvincing plot devices I've ever seen, like a necklace, leading me to question if the script was lazily written or that they just couldn't think of anything better.With the two main characters being abysmally acted and uncharismatic the movie feels dragged with very few good scenes, almost none of them being in the first half. A lot of the time I didn't even care about what was being shown at the screen, this includes all of the cheesy death scenes. How can someone be emotional about a death scene of a character that meant nothing to the spectator the whole movie? Cramming almost all of these death scenes at the last 30 minutes felt rushed, mainly because none of these characters could be left alive since none of them actually existed in the Star Wars universe before this movie.Besides all of these flaws, and the force brainwashing used in at least 4 scenes, the movie presents a good photography, and great use of special effects.The whole experience could be better but it does what it was meant to be done: to give fans another Star Wars movie. Not for the sake of being an excellent movie, like The Empire Strikes Back, but for the sake of being another Star Wars movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Almost as bad as the prequels,"If you are a true Star Wars fan (if your benchmarks are A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back), don't even bother going to see this one in the theatre. It's basically just a bunch of explosions and fight scenes, and of course, the end is a foregone conclusion.My biggest beef with Rogue One is that it lacks the ""mystery"" that we've come to expect from the really good Star Wars movies. Part of this is due to the fact that you already know what's going to happen. But part of it is also because the scriptwriters did a lousy job of keeping us guessing and entertained throughout the whole movie.As was shown in the previews, Rogue One features the return of Darth Vader. One detail about his appearance here made me angry. Disney did not use Darth Vader's original mask design from the early episodes. As fans will remember, Vader's mask originally had sharp angles and spikes that made him look somewhat alien. When Lucas did the prequels, he decided to change the mask design to give him more ""rounded"" features. The end result was that Lord Vader's face looked decidedly smaller.After all the criticism that was directed at the prequels, the fact that Disney chose to use the new mask design just baffles me. For Star Wars to work, the audiences need to be scared when they see Lord Vader. I find he looks silly with the new face, and if Vader looks silly, then the whole premise of the movie just falls apart.It's too bad, because the acting and the directing are stellar (no pun intended) in Rogue One. But my general feeling of emptiness when I left the theatre reminded me of how I felt after watching the prequels.Hopefully the upcoming Episode VIII will bring the franchise back to its original greatness.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Rebellion was built on THIS!,"Rogue One (2016) -I love this film! I know so many people that don't like it or don't see the point of it, but I think that it was almost as good as the original trilogy.I believe that it was a love letter to the fans. A tribute to all of the nerds that really love the franchise and know who all the characters are, the ones that have read every book and even all of the comics, as well as the volumes that contain specs for each of the vehicles and backstory's for all of the characters. I'm not quite that obsessed, although I probably would be if I could, but it was so great to see so many fantastic nods to the other films/TV series in this one and some moments that were worth watching the film just to see, things that made me gasp and my jaw drop upon the first viewing. It was clearly made by fans of the franchise, was exactly what it needed and held true to the style of George Lucas.With all of that said, I'm not actually a fan of Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) or Cassian (Diego Luna) and having seen 'Andor' (2023-) I didn't feel that series had added anything to his character or explained the chip on his shoulder, that was still obvious, watching this film afterwards. Although it did set up some great character arcs for Mon Mothma (Genevieve O'Reilly) and Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker), key characters in this film.I also don't like Ben Mendelsohn as an actor either, but I suppose that helped to make him a decent bad guy in the role of Director Krennic. I certainly wanted him to get his comeuppance.None of that made a difference to how much I enjoyed this film though, because everything else was so spot on - the soundtrack, the filming, the action and the lighting and all of the supporting artists.K-2S0 (Alan Tudyk) was brilliant for comic relief and Chirrut (Donnie Yen) and Baze (Wen Jiang) were awesome additions to the Star Wars Universe.There was a great use of well known and existing characters too, either in full or as cameos, including some surprises due to CGI and other special effects.And actually the CGI was absolutely brilliant as well as the use of older footage from 1977, polished up and recycled. The care and thought that had gone in to every detail, including costume, props and locations was glaringly obvious. Nothing about this film was half arsed.The finale was absolutely awesome, so unexpected the first time around and it still gives me goosebumps when I rewatch it.Overall it managed to maintain the ideals and values of the original trilogy, whilst also managing to bring it up to date, although the franchise has never really been known for being backwards.It also tied in with the extended universe
following on perfectly from 'Revenge Of The Sith' (2005) and incorporating elements of 'The Clone Wars' (2008-20).To the nay sayers I reply that you are wrong.

"Un pour tous, tous pour un","As you are reading this, you are quite probably: 1) a likely viewer of this movie, 2) a recent viewer of this movie. Falling in the category 2) myself, I understand you are probably browsing reviews in order to take comfort you are not alone in thinking that most of the more acclaimed critical reviews are wrong, as what you just watched was a pretentious and unentertaining film. If you are in category 1) I reassure you I will not reveal any plot elements and I wish that my review will at least encourage you towards a critical viewing.Rogue 1* is pretentious because the authors tried very hard to make the characters appear interesting and nuanced, instead they just come out as ambiguous, confusing and -worst of all- fake. An example can be found in the character of the spy/assassin of the Alliance, a character whose moral changes over the course of the movie according to...plot convenience; fortunately I have watched at least once all the previous SW installments, otherwise I wouldn't have known for half the movie who was I supposed to side for. Pretentious (and annoyingly so) is also the John Williamesque musical score, which is booming in almost every scene of the movie to remind us we are watching SW. And it's really too bad that when the imperial march comes on, it only succeeds to provide evidence that we are watching a parody of the original SW.The back story of the main character is unoriginal and heartless, her words and rhetorics having such an uninspiring effect that she reminds me of a recent female candidate for the US presidency, who likewise was talking to an imaginative audience which had no correspondence to the real one. I do not think a female lead is, as such, a bad choice - I recall f.e. the empowering performance of Sigourney Weaver in the Alien franchise - but I am convinced, simply out of common sense, that although we might have unisex shirts, jackets and trousers there is no such thing as a unisex character/role. And even though I wouldn't ascribe myself in their ranks I believe that an heroine who behaves exactly as a hero is an insult to the true liberals and the true feminists that Disney is trying so hard to please. I am not going to argument further on this topic as I think I stated my point clearly enough. Quoting a common phrase in Italian: ""chi c'è c'è, chi non c'è non c'è"", who is here is here, who is not here is not here.Rogue 1* is unentertaining because it is too complex and it has no heart. The plot in each of the original SW trilogy movies was linear and simple, the dialogues edging often to a ridiculous level of naivety, overall it was a script that could have been written by a kid in junior high. And yet it talked so deeply to our hearts, it possessed such powerful mythology that it became - and understandably so - an object of cult by many. That this movie has lost that naivety and simplicity can be observed already from the absence of a substantial opening crawl, which was fundamental in creating that bonfire-tale effect and in establishing a framework for the plot. Instead the viewer is thrown directly into the plot, a plot so contrived and badly narrated it becomes a pain-staking effort for the viewer to figure out who exactly the characters are and what are the reasons of their actions. In fact, as usual these days, we are served with minimal character development and maximal...Armageddon. How many cathartic scenes can there be in a good movie? 1 or 2, right? At which point of the movie are we supposed to expect such scenes? Towards the end, right? Well it seems that recently most authors (and/or most producers) for the big screen think they should cram as many cathartic moments as the length of the movie allows. And once this path is taken not even a Diane Keaton or an Al Pacino (let alone this new generation of actors, who are to older generations what production line workers are to experienced artisans) could help keeping character consistency from flying out the window. The result is that I found myself laughing sarcastically at scenes that could otherwise have kept me at the edge of my seat, simply because the empathy stakes were non-existent.In conclusion I would like to add that this is my first and only review on IMDb, which I decided to write as I consider Rogue 1 to be a perfect example of what is wrong with Hollywood blockbuster movies nowadays, thus the title ""One for all, all for one"".",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Much Needed New Blood And A Masterful Stand Alone Story,"Being a ""Star Wars"" fan since 1977, I was reluctant and not quite sure what to expect from this film. Was this movie created just to be a cash cow? No! The new "" A Star Wars Story"" saga is a return to glory for ""Star Wars"" fans. It's the best film since ""The Empire Strikes Back"". The new blood pumped into this series was much needed. Especially with the film being helmed by Gareth Edwards. This film has excellent direction, cinematography, special effects, screenplay, editing, score and acting. It's an action packed thrilling ride. All the actors portray interesting, captivating and remarkable characters. The plot revolves around the origins of the Evil Empire's most feared and devastating weapon, the Death Star, and tells the journey that is taken to destroy it's completion. It provides an outstanding backstory to the, ""Star Wars"" saga. ""A Star Wars Story"" is an ingenious stand alone series however in the end we find out it is the prequel to Episode 4 which was never quite delivered by the inferior Episodes 1, 2, and 3.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Move Over J.J.,"I would have given this 8.5, but they won't let you do that, so I gave it a 9. Why not?I was very pleased with Rogue One, especially after walking out of the theater feeling a little disappointed last year. If nothing else, Rogue One tries some new things, which The Force Awakens didn't do much of at all. It also features an arguably better balance of old and new characters, and one of the best scenes in Star Wars history near the end. The special effects (both CGI and practical) are also amazing, some of the best I've ever seen in fact, and one particular aspect of them may change the way movies (especially sequels/prequels) are made FOREVER. I'll be shocked if Rogue One doesn't win Best Visual Effects at the Oscars this year, because it totally deserves it, even though Doctor Strange is a worthy contender.As for negatives, there aren't many. Some may argue that the new characters are largely flat, but I would point out that this is a standalone story, not part of the main series. These characters will not be featured in any other movies in the foreseeable future, so not focusing on them as much left some time for the old characters, as well as what we all came for, the epic battle scenes, which are much better than those in TFA. And I actually grew to like several of the new characters more than I thought I would. The first act is a bit hectic, jumping around all over the place very quickly. There are also a couple scenes that are quite strange, even for Star Wars standards, but these are all fairly minor complaints.Rogue One is a new hope for Star Wars fans that were disappointed with The Force Awakens. It's definitely not perfect, but it's a heck of a lot better than it had any right to be, especially considering that any fan of Star Wars knows exactly what's going to happen. It stays grounded in what we know and love while branching into just enough new territory simultaneously. I will eagerly be awaiting the next Star Wars story!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Gritty. Logical. Fills in the gap....,"This movie tells the tale of how the Death Star plans, ""......were acquired at great cost!"". Now we know what a handful of individuals paid for those plans.

Generic blockbuster,"Rogue one didn't give me any emotions that i would get in really good movies. It had way too much forced humor possibly to compansate for the darkness and sadness it had. Also i felt the music was too underwhelming for my liking – again the music didn't give much emotions with the movie and seemed overall just too mild at least for my taste.The story itself was made to fit it's purpose as a filler story between E3 and E4. Thats what it did and i think it did that job fairly well. It also gave some possible plothints for the coming star wars Episode 8 – something to talk about for the next year while waiting.Rogue One delivers what you expect from a big blockbuster these days. Blockbusters always come with downsides. When the goal is to please the maximum amount of people everything ends up being milder. Overall good movie, not bad but not really good either. Safe to say it servers it's purpose at the Star Wars movie family but fails to deliver anything special.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The second most beautiful Star Wars film to date!,"Personally, Rogue One falls second to The Empire Strikes Back in my list of the best Star Wars films. This film was meant for the fans, but after watching it again, I feel anyone can enjoy the story without having seen a SW film. The various nods to both the original and prequel trilogies will make any fan jump with joy, but they're not crucial to the plot; so, again, as a standalone film, the average movie-goer will not be lost.The first half contains a great deal of exposition; with so many diverse characters to introduce, the film can't help but quickly and plainly explain what it needs to. The pace is rushed here and there and some issues solved effortlessly, but the story picks up as it goes. The third act is simply incredible. The love for the franchise becomes crystal-clear here. You can feel the film's eagerness to reach this point in the story and have fun, offering satisfying character/ story arcs. The action scenes, especially the space battles, are wonderfully shot, providing striking cinematography not seen (or fully enjoyed) in other SW films.I cannot praise the film's use of practical effects enough, and Rogue One ties-in flawlessly with A New Hope. It's a great time to be a Star Wars fan.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Just Okay. Don't expect episode 7.,I was hoping that the big budget would fill the movie with constant eye- candy. Its there; just not much of it.

I had a hard time following who was who (I don't read books or plot summaries about movies).Last half has more action...but its basically just pew pew pew shoot 'em up.Its not a bad movie. It just fails to deliver a 2016 Star Wars budget fantasy.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"(spoiler free) Overall the greatest Star wars film, and one of the best films I have ever seen","This movie is everything I had hoped it to be and far, far more. Literally every choice they made while making it was a right one. The cast acts well and creates excellent, lovable characters. The visuals are incredible. Writing is beautiful. Action is perfect. Story is original, well-crafted and at the same time manages to fill in some plot holes in later set films.I have tried very hard to find even a single thing I disliked about the film and only came up with one minor thing. The music. It is by no means bad, but it's not extremely memorable. As it's a different composer, he didn't use much of the classic star wars tracks (with a few exceptions here and there). Often there's a track that starts similarly to the old ones, but goes in a different direction. And while it's not bad, it just didn't feel as powerful as the classic music did.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Putting the ""Wars"" back into ""Star Wars""","Expectations have been sky-high for this first in the 'add-in' series of Star Wars films. But with director Gareth Edwards at the helm, whose past movie track-record includes just the low-budget ""Monsters"" and the less than memorable ""Godzilla"", I was frankly concerned.But the English guy (with the Welsh name) has seriously delivered!""Rogue One"" (I have omitted the inane and irritating suffix "": A Star Wars Story"") tells the story behind the story of the original Episode IV: ""A New Hope"". Felicity Jones (""The Theory of Everything"") plays Jyn Erso, daughter to Imperial weapons expert Mads Mikkelsen (""Doctor Strange"", ""Casino Royale""). An interrupted childhood leads the delinquent Jyn on a personal journey to become a leader in the fragmenting Rebel Alliance, as a small band of heroes battle to obtain the plans for the Empire's planet-zapping Death Star. Will they succeed (this is hardly a question worth asking given the start of Episode IV!) and at what cost?I'm throwing it out there. this is the best Star Wars film since ""The Empire Strikes Back"". The story (John Knoll and Gary Whitta) is almost Shakespearean in its scope, leading to a moving and memorable finale. As a standalone episode within the Star Wars canon – chronologically positioned as it between ""Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith"" and ""Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope"" – the film marvellously knits the two together bringing in cameos from Episode III as well as (very surprising) cameos from Episode IV, now nearly 40 years old. The screenplay (by Chris ""About a Boy"" Weitz and Tony Gilroy, writer of the ""Bourne"" films) is whip-smart with great lines.For Star Wars fans the film is also chock full of 'Easter Eggs' from the original Star Wars. All of these are great fun but – frankly – some don't make a lot of sense: for example, a chance encounter with a character in the streets of Jedha City doesn't gel with what happens an hour or two later.After Rey in last December's ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" we again see another kick-ass heroine and a further cinematic nod towards girl-power in the movies. But this is a nuanced heroine with more than a hint of darkness about her. Felicity Jones plays her perfectly, reflecting her transition from teenage rebel to rebel-leading teen.In general, the darkness continues throughout the supporting cast with some of the heroes – notably the impressive Diego Luna (""The Terminal"") as Cassian Andor – managing to do some very anti-heroic things at points in the story. The rest of the cast, and especially Donnie Yen and Wen Jiang as dynamic martial arts duo Chirrut Îmwe and Baze Malbus, generate the warm fuzzies enough for you – as the audience – to really care for what happens to them. This even extends to the lump of metal in the frame – the droid K-2SO (voiced by Alan Tudyk) – who could be the film's Jar Jar Binks but manages instead to steal the best comic lines in the film.Elsewhere Forest Whitaker (""Arrival"") is underused as rebel guerrilla Saw Gerrera; Mads Mikkelsen adds gravitas to a key strategic role; and Ben Mendelsohn makes for a memorable Imperial villain. The only slightly irritating character in an otherwise stellar ensemble cast is pilot Rodhi Rook (played by Riz Ahmed from ""Jason Bourne""): more for the rather pointless way his character is written than for the Londoner's portrayal per se.An equal member of the cast is the sublime music of Michael Giacchino, having the unenviable task of following John Williams into the Star Wars franchise. But he does a great job. After the shock of the non- traditional opening (and an abrupt and rather out of place Title shot) the style settles down, with some of the swelling music in the closing reel adding tremendously to the emotion of the finale.The film is not quite perfect though. The first half of the film could have moved on a bit quicker to get to the breathtaking finale. And even though CGI has moved on significantly from the stick men and women walking around on the deck in ""Titanic"" in 1997, the state of the art (no spoilers, but you'll know what I mean if you've seen the film) still has room for some improvement. (Perhaps the first of these scenes could have been as subliminal as the last for better effect).An outstanding effort, and one I definitely want to watch again. The Bluray version will also be a 'must-buy' when it emerges, since – with 4 to 5 weeks of re-shoots done in the summer, and many scenes in the trailer not appearing in the final cut – there must be an enormous number of deleted (original?) scenes that may tell a very different story from the one we saw this week.Disney must be so, so pleased at their very expensive investment in Star Wars, and fears that the Mouse would trash the brand seem to be – thankfully – unfounded.(For the graphical version of this review, please visit http://bob-the- movie-man.com.

Amazing,"The flow: in episode VII we got a very fast movie where it seemed they didn't take the time to explain, build story and allow the viewer grow emotions for the characters. In this movie there was the fast action and there was the slow rhythm and the combination of them was fantastic.The CGI: There where two characters that were made with CGI that were really detailed and awesome, but their animations were horrible. There movements were so jerky, artificial, on rails. They failed bad here, and what annoys me most about this is that the models were perfect. but somehow they messed up the animations.Battle CGI didn't disappoint, though. The battle effects were off the charts. The battle choreography work with the transitions.One thing I liked very much were the scenery and settings. They were so well built. all the details made them feel so real and inside the universe.The Acting: top-notch. Not just because the film took care to slow down where it should but also because the actors played so well we really feel what's going on. We understand what goes on their head and heart.

The descent into Darkness Continues,"After the heartbreaking disappointment that was episode 7, Rogue One does very little to get Star Wars back on track. Rogue One fails on every level with the exception of a few cool action scenes.Just like how Force Awakens is a rehash of A New Hope and Legacy of the Force, with Rey and Kylo Ren acting as the replacements for Jacen and Jaina Solo, Rogue One is just a rehash of Dark Forces, with Felicity Jones and Diego Luna being replacements for Kyle Katarn and Jan Ors, just nowhere near as likable or endearing as the originals. In addition, the premise itself is predictable and uninspiring, and the movie doesn't add anything to the overall mythos.Do yourself a favor,and just don't watch this movie. It is not worth it. If anything, this movie is confirmation that no matter what we want, we are being given one thing, and that's what they're telling we want. This movie will leave you with this crushing sense of inevitability, like the fans don't matter.

A worthy Star Wars movie,"This movie had everything. Perfect amount of nostalgia along with great new characters, especially with the addition of the Andor series which gives a bit of background to Cassian.I was really impressed with how they created a movie that exists within another movie, yet they were able to create this brilliant plot. It was simple, but I wasn't bored for one second. It goes to show how a story doesn't have to be complex to come out good (something that many producers could learn from).Another aspect is the fact that they didn't have to use any flashy lead characters, instead, the whole movie circled back to ""the greater good"", which ties the whole movie together and makes it perfect.All in all, this movie is a great insight into the world of Star Wars and the Rebel Alliance.

"Good movie, forgettable Characters","Overall this movie is very good. It has great action, both in the ground and in space. It has a story that fills one of Star Wars' biggest plot holes, and is edited nicely and has a great score too. It even has some nice callbacks/cameos to rebels and clone wars characters. The only problem with this film is the main characters are kind of forgettable. Jyn or Cassian don't really offer anything new in terms of characters in the Star Wars characters and while characters like k2 or Chirrut have some great lines and moments they're kind of just gimmick characters with no real depth. The others on the rouge one crew hardly get their name dropped much less getting and sort of character arc.

Middle-ing Star Wars Fun,"""Rogue One"" is the definition of a mixed bag. I find myself in a similar position with this film as I am in regard to ""Solo."" I like the movie but would never dream of defending it as a great film.It really is a mess. The characters are mostly uninteresting, the connection between father and daughter that should be the core of this film feels anemic, and the progression of the plot from one sequence to the next is done in an incredibly slapdash way so that even after multiple viewings, I found myself having to refresh my memory about basic plot points.Luckily, this film is not without its bright points to make the ride more fun. The first of which, for me, is K2-SO. Alan Tudyk (""Serenity"") does a brilliant job voicing the reprogrammed Imperial droid with sarcasm, near nihilism, and an endearing love/loathe relationship with Jyn (Felicity Jones, ""Inferno""). In fact, K2-SO has become my personal favorite amongst the droid characters of the Star Wars universe. The most meaningful and moving scene of the film may actually be the sacrifice of this character who is more human than the humans in this movie.Another character to highlight is that of Chirrut Imwe (Donnie Yen, ""Hero""). A non-Jedi force believer who harkens back to Blind Swordsman or Warrior Monk tales of Japan and China. His role in the rebellion on Jetta and Scarif is minor but flavorful and brings out the depth that is hinted at in other films when they speak of the force and the legend of the Jedi Knights.Sadly, this film leaves little more for us to enjoy when it comes to characters. The protagonists are thin and change motivations on a dime. They eat up screen time with their monologues and leave us wishing we got additional time with the minor characters, who are more interesting and endearing.Another high point of the film is the climactic sequence on the planet Scarif. Not since the assault on Hoth (""The Empire Strikes Back"") have we been treated to a battle so engaging and complex. Ground forces tactical movements, an orbital battle that recaptures the magic of the battle over Endor, and numerous moments of personal sacrifice, twists of fate, and moments of triumph make this sequence one of my favorite Star Wars battles. Period.I for one am not a big fan of using CGI to insert original actors into new films. I personally think they should get other actors to play the part or even simply write around those characters. That being said, the CGI is remarkably good. A few moments of wavering believability do not erase, for me, the incredible achievement that this film has managed to pull off. Grand Moff Tarkin looks great, Leia, a little less so but still solid and serviceable. Even using footage from ""A New Hope"" to supplement and create the illusion that the fighter pilots from that film are the same as the ones in this battle.To be fair, though, that is the majority of what I like about this movie. I wish these Star Wars Stories were not so plagued by production, script, and directorial difficulties but they have been and they have suffered for it. Rogue One is no exception.It has suffered but, if you wade through what is a wildly uneven film, there are truly wonderful aspects of this film to enjoy.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A chick and a guy with a Spanish accent try to save the galaxy.......,"This movie is absolutely awful. And that is a very nice thing to say about it. The people who have watched the other episodes 10 or almost 40 years ago will agree with me. They say Disney hasn't destroyed the movies, I say they messed it up big time. The acting in this movie is so terrible that I don't even know where to begin ( and they say Hayden Christensen did a bad job in the prequels, he was marvelous compared to this). This was just ruining peoples childhood and taking their money. Okay, the story isn't that bad, but it's really terribly acted out and there are some parts that are so boring that you forget that you are watching star wars. Too many emotions and emotional speeches, I mean isn't 'May the Force be with you' the whole point of this movie, you don't need a speech if you are a so called rebel. To sum everything up, the main characters were awful the supporting characters were the ones who made everybody laugh so that they don't leave the cinema.

A complete disappointment,"I had little hope coming in to see this movie, one might even say that I had a bad feeling about it, but that's a good thing because most of the time when I watch a movie and my expectations are low I get to enjoy the good parts more. Unfortunately, this film has almost no good parts.Now, I am not the type of fan that read the comics and the fan made books and so on, but I did watch all Star Wars movies, with various degrees of enjoyment. I even did a marathon of all the films and I have to say that both originals and prequels felt in the same vein: a bit silly, over the top with ""the vision"" of Star Wars, with the technology that looks like in the 1960s if they had a lot more lights on every gadget and star travel, with the black and white battle and the balance of the force. Even the stupid J.J.Abrams version had something to be said about it.Rogue One is clearly worse than any of the films mentioned. Forget the horrible CGI for Tarkin and princess Leia (I've seen better animation in PC games from 2000), forget the scenes that were in the trailer to get you in the cinema and then removed from the theatrical release, forget the scenes where dozens of extras in plastic plated pajamas ran right in the blaster fire and died, forget all of that and instead focus on the characters. The best actor in this movie is, by far, Alan Tudyk. You know who that is? The robot!The young charismatic beautiful female (gender swap! yay!) lead character starts off as nobody, does a few inconsistent flips of behavior, is used as a pawn by just about everyone, and ends as nobody. The father and hero figures are just as unsure of which side they are on and just as uninteresting. The villain is a force-less bureaucrat that somehow ends up in all the scenes, even the action ones, bringing absolutely no charisma or element of intrigue. The Alliance is a joke. The references to the other films just thrown out there randomly, with no consequence whatsoever. I cared for NO character in this film. None! They might just as well been all bad CGI characters with a common backstory of forgotten computer animations that ended up in a movie. I. did. not. care.Bottom line: Donnie Yen's character is a joke, but he is always entertaining when he moves. Alan Tudyk is great as the sarcastic robot. I even liked Riz Ahmed enough to care just a little bit about his character. The rest is utter boredom, waste of time and potential.

Leading to the Jedi,"Rogue One takes place prior to Star Wars: A New Hope and it finishes with events leading up to the first film. It is a stand alone film that focuses on the rebel alliance before Luke Skywalker joins them.Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) is the daughter of Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen) the man who has been forced to complete the Empire's Death Star, the planet destroyer but he has also designed a weakness, an Achilles heel.The Rebel Alliance sends Jyn and a team led by Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) to steal the designs for the Death Star so they can exploit its weakness and destroy it.After 2015's The Force Awakens it was a risk to go back to a time before The New Hope given how underwhelming the prequels are regarded.At an entertaining level the film works, it is well paced, lots of action, plenty of humour especially from a robotic character, a personal journey for Jyn and plenty of appearances to keep Star Wars fans happy including some stirring bits of John Williams original themes. However it is cynically placed there to keep fans happy and bask in some nostalgia, a blink and you miss them CP30 and R2D2. The biggest surprise is a Grand Moff being digitally resurrected and Darth Vader definitely showing his dark side when he goes all out with his lightsaber.On a production level there are some good grimy bits, the rebel alliance have that industrial rust that such a scavenging group would have, clothes being old and ripped for a start.There is some interesting use of location photography, desert photography in Jordan, shooting in Iceland and also some shooting in the Maldives which certainly is different as it is so seldomly used for movies.Yet the movie is no more than disposable entertainment, maybe that is how it should be.

This one had the feel of a made for TV drama without the suspense, strong character development, action and excitement that we've come to expect from a star wars movie. You just can't get involved with these characters. They don't have that vulnerable side that is mixed in with their distinct strength that allows them to be relatable. Again, the movie was flat, low energy, slow moving, nothing new story wise, weak character development and cgi was terrible in certain scenes and characters looks like they came out of an old xbox game from the early 2000's. About halfway through this movie you'll look at the clock and realize, ""nothing has happened yet..."" What a shame and what a dud... Sorry. But I was hoping for more even though after the last SW movie my hopes weren't up at all. I now know not to expect anything at all from future SW's movies. It just how it is now. This has become about the studios marketing a brand instead of making great and exciting movies. What a disappointment!",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Thoughts on the movie,"This movie is a MASTERPIECE, regardless of the amazing Star Wars story, this movie checks all the boxes on the list of what makes a movie a cinematic masterpiece.

"An improvement after Episode VII, but not without a cost","I went to the theaters with a skeptical thoughts because I certainly didn't like Star Wars: The Force Awakens. I almost hated it, but not because of production values (in that aspect, it's well done), instead I think it had too similar plot structure as Episode IV, too much nostalgic pandering, old characters we know looking tired and depressed, poor world building and there were too many idiotic moments that took me out of the movie. Also, Rey. I hate overpowered characters and she was most likely given that because otherwise, it would have been offensive and sexist. But anyway, as a movie, Episode VII was for me 6/10, but my enjoyment level were more like 4/10. With this in my mind, I guess I'm not a Star Wars fan and I'm not going to be one of many people who praise the way Disney goes with our favorite franchise. Apologies, if my review is messy. I'm a really messy person, you see.This is a first (official live-action) spin-off Star Wars movie we have and next one is coming at 2018 if I'm correct (after Episode VIII in 2017). Yearly Star Wars. It's really sad for me, because it seems that Disney does it just because of the money and the people who just take it without any questions. But is the movie good? The answer is; yes, but it's not as ""good"" as some people will say. For me, it's better than The Force Awakens for different reasons. I'll do my best to not spoil the movie and tell what is good and what isn't. I prefer not to into the route some people go as to just say ""My review: It's good. Go watch and see it."" I don't consider those as reviews.I'll start with the positives:Scenery, backgrounds and set designs are all well done. Sure there are some moments where you can tell what is CGI and what isn't, but overall, there isn't really anything wrong in it. If there something Gareth Edwards does right, it's the huge backgrounds and action. Shots look great and it's easy to see whats going on, not to mention the fact, everything looks big (for example: AT-AT's). This movie is going to be compared to Godzilla, which is directed by the same guy. It's a good thing and most likely it's going to be a trademark of Gareth Edwards directing. I really like the fact that all references and other nostalgic elements are kept subtle. They are not thrown at the audiences and are just a part of the movie. They clearly took a lesson from The Force Awakens. I liked some characters in Rogue One. The imperial Robot was good. The pacing is OK for the most part. I knew what was going on at least at the final moments. This is however the problem with the first act. The feeling of Star Wars was there compared to previous entry. Stormtroopers have their old voices and behavior. The set designs also have a part with this. Action was pretty standard but at the final 3rd, it got really good So...the final 3rd is the best part due to many things happening, keeping me interested. I guess you can figure it out yourself, what's going to happen, if you have watched any movie ever.There are other things that kept me interested in this movie, but It's hard to mention other things because being precise is important for me and I don't like to spoil too much. There was certainly some scenes that I even loved, but I think you'll understand why. This review is mean't to be read by an average person who wants to find out if the movie is good or not with reasons. (I mean, without shouting that movie is garbage or that it's the best Star Wars movie)Now, here my negatives. Rogue One was at some points boring. There wasn't much happening despite having a chance to develop the characters. While acting wasn't bad really, but they didn't have that much emotions to make them believable. It wasn't the only problem. The characters didn't have much screen time and they are not likely to be recognized for their personality. They were lackluster. Now that I think about, the writing was not that great. Some things were explained pretty well and can be considered well explanations for the Episode IV. They were contradictions though, which were annoying. While CGI was good, there are a few scenes where it was too obvious and distracting. While Vader is not the main point, I think there should've been more scenes with him, since he's one of the best movie villains and all scenes where he appeared, were amazing. There are too much planets with scenes that are only like two minutes long. What was the point of crediting them anyway? It's not suppose to be a standard Hollywood movie. IT'S STAR WARS!!! There were a few distracting moments and even some weirdness. You are going to hate the sentences when it comes to The Force. At the end, there were some ""forced"" scenes too. Contradicting as I mentioned earlier.But really at the end of the day, the movie is good and I consider it a part of the Star Wars saga, unlike The Force Awakens. I might write a review for that movie later when I'm not lazy. I walked out of the theater satisfied and happy. Not sure if my thoughts are the same when I watch it again from Blu-Ray, but who knows. I recommend Rogue One to anyone who likes Star Wars movies, games and books or any other form of entertainment. Most people love this movie and I understand why, but please....you should accept that not everyone has a same opinion as you have.7/10The future looks better with this one",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Great Stand Alone,"Forget the naysayers. This movie, based on one paragraph in a new hope's crawl, is absolutely great. Yes, I know they had a female hero. So what? This shows the answer to the Rebel Spaceships, striking from a hidden base. How did those plans get nabbed? Who did they go to? The final battle over Scarif, as well as showing just how really relentless and evil the Empire is, as well as Vaders appearance at the end made this an instant classic. Just an excellent movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
For Star Wars devotees,"Rouge One is fine. For Star Wars devotees that is. And for them it was made. The rest of us will recognize it for what it is: basically another mass produced sci-fi hindered with issues, some of them surprising given the budget.It's all action that does not make much sense but is entertaining enough not to make you bored (a lot at least). Everything feels very rushed at times (especially the first act). Totally forgettable characters are the biggest weakness. It's been a week since I saw it and I already can't name even one of them. The only standout is the cynical black robot. All of this defines any modern popcorn blockbuster, which ironically, is capable of earning a lot of money at the same time.However, dear Disney, CGI you created is simply offensive – I am looking and you Tarkin and Leia. I mean, the CGI-ed faces look horrific and are the worst I have seen in ages: plasticky and not natural. Funny enough, even TV series (Westworld) and movies of lesser category (Fast and Furious 7) were able to present a much better implementation of the technique. Rogue One will be remembered for those couple of scenes where Tarkin looks like a last year's Playstation4 character. Truly a massive let down and I couldn't get past that at all.Costumes could be better as well: Darth Vader looks silly in comparison with the previous designs, though the cameo is nice and appreciated.The score which was always top notch in SW movies thanks to John Williams and his imagination, is below average this time. Michael Giacchiano is a great composer but even the best can't do much when acting as a last-minute substitute and given just 4 weeks to create something memorable. Pity.I am sure that we will get more of this corporate product that Disney is force-feeding us with. People used to go to the cinema once to watch the future. Now it is just to dwell on nostalgia.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A True Star Wars Film,"I was so grateful for the release of Rogue One after the disappointment of Ep7 The Force Awakens. The latter currently scoring just slightly higher than Rogue One on IMDb (at 8.1). Sure Ep7 serves a purpose and clearly satisfies it's contemporary demographic. But it's one that I do not associate with, myself being a massive fan of the original trilogy from back in the day.Rogue One really understands the Star Wars ethos and plays out all the beats of the originals, staying true to the lore with integrity and originality. You know watching Rogue One that the director is a fan and is 100 percent invested, making it all the more easy for the viewer to invest also. And that I did.The real highlight of this movie is the return of Darth Vader, who's ominous presence is felt throughout and as the tension reaches it's climactic crescendo he gives us a moment of such awe and dread it's right up there amongst his most iconic scenes.With all the superficial remakes and expanded universe franchises being churned out today. Rogue One took us back to that familiar world of A New Hope, where the sense of peril and wonderment is back to it's visceral best.Kudos to Gareth Edwards for this standalone movie. It is so well crafted, brilliantly acted and tidily scripted. But more importantly it truly is the love letter all Star Wars fans have been longing for.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A surprising Gem in the Franchise.,"A stunning entry in the franchise, which frankly comes as a massive shock following Disney's previous entries in the franchise. This film manages to rewrite the EU canon in a satisfying way that up to this point was inconceivable from modern Star Wars writers and producers.The casting is great, the acting is on-point, the effects are generally phenomenal, and the use of practical effects really grounds it in the OT Era. The setting of the final battle is gorgeous, both in it's landscape and the Imperial Installations. The space battle is phenomenal with extremely creative tactics combined with awesome cinematography.Darth Vader is the most menacing he's ever been on screen. The finale hits the best emotional pitch since ESB and ROTS. Even the CGI de-aging while imperfect is satisfying enough to justify it's inclusion.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Not perfect, but nails Star Wars better than any of the recent episodes","Especially after watching Episode 9 Rogue One may not be the most entertaining of the new Star Wars movies, but it is by far the most coherent, since it has a perfect balance between realism, fantasy, humor, action and character development. I wished episode 7 to 9 were that good.Rogue One is a complete Story with good characters and an interesting story idea. The overall look and feel i enjoy the most and it overshadows a bit a lack of overall tension - in a positive way.It may is an advantage that Rogue One did not need to tie into the Skywalker Saga, just being a side story and have an independent story to tell with new characters.Although i generally did not like the type of ending they choose, it's the perfect and best choice possible and it's also different from any other Star Wars movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The Star Wars Universe is back on track.,"I'm a little late to the party, but for what it's worth, here's my two cents on Rogue One, the direct prequel to the original Star Wars, which shows how a brave group of rebels risked all to acquire the plans to the Empire's latest weapon, The Death Star.After the disappointment that was The Force Awakens, I went into Rogue One with low expectations, which only served to make a very good film even more of a pleasure to behold. What we have here is a vast improvement over J.J. Abrams' unimaginative retread of A New Hope, a standalone spin-off story that is surprisingly dark, violent and gritty, especially considering that it is a product of the House of Mouse. Director Gareth Edwards tells his gripping tale of hope, bravery and sacrifice with an assured hand, delivering engaging characters (with a droid—K-2SO—stealing every scene 'he' is in), pathos, humour and, of course, excitement, the excellent action set pieces a marvel to behold (the rebel X-wing fighters attacking the Imperial Star destroyers is breath-taking).If this is the standard that Disney has set for future films in the Star Wars Universe, then I'm back to being a faithful fan. 8.5/10, happily rounded up to 9 for IMDb despite the patently CGI Moff Tarkin and Princess Leia.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Episode 3 1/2: the non-Jedi story,"The first thing to note about Gareth Edwards's ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" is that it takes place in the same universe - or faraway galaxy, as the case may be - as the rest of the franchise, but it doesn't focus on the characters who dominate most of the series. The main character is the daughter of the Death Star's unwilling designer, making this the first movie in the series to have a woman as the main character. There are no Jedis or emphasis on the force. It's all about how Jyn Erso and her cohorts try to destroy the Death Star.More importantly, this is not the same sort of movie as ""The Force Awakens"". That one had more of a see-what-I-did-there? side to it, probably with the aim of entertaining the nerds and geeks. ""Rogue One"" is likely the most intense entry in the franchise, with a lot of violence.Otherwise, there's the usual sort of stuff that we've come to know (including a few surprise appearances). It's not a masterpiece, but an enjoyable movie nonetheless. Felicity Jones, Diego Luna, Ben Mendelsohn, Donnie Yen, Mads Mikkelsen, Alan Tudyk, Riz Ahmed, Forest Whitaker and the rest of the cast turn in some fine performances.Finally, unlike with ""The Phantom Menace"", I understood the plot (with TPM, I didn't understand the plot until I heard ""Weird Al"" Yankovic's song ""The Saga Begins"", a parody of Don McLean's ""American Pie"").",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Well i'll be damned,"Not going to be much of a review, just some quick thoughts, right after i just saw the film.To be honest, i didn't think Gareth Edwards could pull it off. After i saw the god awful Godzilla, which i consider to be the worst movie of all time if you count in production cost, i saw no hope in this movie, what so ever. Also i didn't like ""The Force Awakens"" which i gave a 4, and it's top 3 most rated review for that movie here on IMDb.So the way i saw it, failing director meets failing franchise, what can go wrong?. Well apparently, it went surprisingly well. This is in fact one of the best Star wars movies to this date, probably the third best only beaten by ""Empire Strikes back"" and ""A New Hope"". And wow, that was not what i expected at all.Where ""The Force Awakens"" leans too much on nostalgia and has very little fantasy and originality, this movie stands much better on it's own feet. And i criticized ""The Force Awakens"" for having yet another Death star in it, they do have that here as well. But in this movie it's different, as this is the direct prequel to the original Trilogy.This movie has surprisingly well made battle scenes, i just had to get that off my chest, it's made the right way. I feel i get to see what i need to see most of the time. The camera angles, the view of the battles and the pacing, is all well done. It feels like the director really knew what he was aiming for, not just throw in mindless explosions whenever they feel appropriate.Rogue One is a breath of fresh air. Not a masterpiece my any means, the movie has to much of the usual stuff to be called that. There are few surprises in the story. Except the ending, which was quite nice, i could not predict that one. :) Everything else is just as you expect. It's classic star wars, it has good acting (for the most part anyways), it has a good plot, it has great visuals, a flamboyant soundtrack, impressive spaceships, immense action scenes, awesome villains and some nice surprises.This movie could probably have been lifted up one more star if it dared to be a little more original. But hey, it's not a big deal, for many kids watching this movie, what they are seeing is completely original and never been done before.7/10 - Quite Good",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best Star Wars Movie since Empire,"This is the type of movie I was hoping the 1999-2005 prequels would be. The story is tight, the drama is visceral, and the characters have a vividness that was lacking (or replaced caricature) in the other prequels. It is the best Star Wars movie since Empire. The third act alone was worth the price of admission. I wish I could have seen my face during the last five minutes of the film -- I'm sure I was bug- eyed and my jaw was nearly on the floor. Yes, there were a few campy moments -- a VERY few -- but the saccharine tone of the trailers was absent in the final cut. This was the most gritty, tragic, hard-to- watch-but-can't-take-your-eyes-off-it Star Wars of the whole saga.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Visually Breathtaking In Every Sense Of The Word. Superior To The Previous Star Wars Film The Force Awakens.,"This is the film that links Revenge Of The Sith(episode 3) with A New Hope(Episode 4).In other words the correct order would be Phantom Menace, Attack Of The Clones, Revenge Of The Sith, Rogue One, A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back and Return Of The Jedi.In a nutshell the film is about an Imperial Engineer Galen Erso(Mads Mikkelsen). He has been living hidden on the planet Lah'mu with his wife Lyra(Valene Kane) and his daughter Jyn(Felicity Jones).Imperial weapons developer Orson Krennic arrives to press him into completing the Death Star. Galen refuses to work on the project. However his wife is killed in the ensuing argument and he is forcefully taken prisoner. Galen's daughter Jyn escapes and is taken to safety by Rebel extremist Saw Gerrera(played by Oscar winning actor Forest Whitaker).Galen soon finishes the Death Star. Realizing the enormity of destruction this weapon would unleash upon the universe, he implements a flaw in the design of the Death Star whereby it would be destroyed by a single lazer blast at a specific point.Fifteen years later, cargo pilot Bodhi Rook(Riz Ahmed) defects from the Empire, smuggling a holographic message from Galen to Gerrera on the desert moon Jedha. Rebel intelligence officer Cassian Andor(Diego Luna) frees Jyn from an Imperial labor camp at Wobani before bringing her to the Rebel leader Mon Mothma(Genevieve O'Reilly), who convinces her to find and rescue Galen so the Alliance can learn more about the Death Star. Cassian is covertly ordered by General Draven(Alistair Petrie), an Alliance military officer, to kill Galen rather than extract him.Watch the film to find out what happens next... This film has incredible action sequences you have to see to believe. The very latest of CGI imagery is used to bring the character of the late Peter Cushing, the Grand Moff Tarkin to life. Sound effects and background music score are spot on. Gareth Edwards who has worked on such movies as Monsters(2010) and Godzilla(2014) has managed to keep standards the visual brilliance of the Stars Wars saga alive.Verdict: Though The Empire Strikes Back is still my all-time favorite, this entry is my third choice, whereas Revenge Of The Sith is my second.More Space Movies To See: 2001 A Space Odyssey 1968, 2010 The Year We Make Contact 1984, Alien 1979, The Black Hole 1979, Nightflyers 1987, The Last Starfighter (1984), Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (1991).Thanks for reading my review, live long and prosper.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"""Rogue One: A Gritty and Thrilling Addition to the Star Wars Saga""","""Rogue One"" is a 2016 film that stands as a remarkable entry in the Star Wars franchise, offering a fresh and daring perspective on the galaxy far, far away.

Fantastic spinoff,"Gareth Edward's entry into the Star Wars universe with his spin-off 'Rogue One' is a bold move, getting rid of the Skywalker family completely. In place of them are a group of unmemorable characters who are an exciting story filled with many callbacks and use of nostalgia. 'Rogue One' is a very good Star Wars film, with an exciting score by Michael Giacchino, and a creative fun 'Saving Private Ryan' take on Star Wars, showing the war aspect of the saga. The comedy in this film works with the main cast and the fight scenes are very well done, and the acting is very good among most of the main cast. The only fault I see with this installment is the lack of reason to care for any of the main characters other than our main heroine. The film introduces these characters very quickly and gives them a quick sad story. It will be difficult to walk away from this film saying that you remembered all of the main characters names.

"From the five I watched thus far this one was the weaker one, still good though.","After so many years of postponing I finally decided to watch all the Star Wars movies. Since there are different ways to watch it I'm going for the chronological order and not the release date order, that just makes more sense to me. Maybe I watched a couple movies when I was young, I probably did, but I don't remember anything about it so to me it's all new and maybe one day I will understand the whole hype about the Star Wars saga. After watching The Phantom Menace, Attack Of The Clones and Revenge Of The Sith, Solo: A Star Wars Story, it's now time for Rogue One. I read some reviewers stating this was one of the best one but from all the ones I watched by now I thought this was the weakest one. It's still good enough for me though, just found the story confusing sometimes. By watching the saga in chronological order you appreciate every movie better than in order by release date. It's just a better way to watch the whole saga, it's much easier to follow and for somebody new to it like me it's just much more appealing. The best thing about this movie and probably all the others are the different characters, races of aliens, and the different spaceships and weapons, I just love it. The CGI's are better than in the earlier movies, what makes perfect sense as the technology is just better now. I can't wait to watch the next one, will probably binge watch the eleven movies and will probably squeeze The Mandalorian between it, as long as the chronological order is respected.

Cannot fault his performance.Felicty Jones as the main lead in Jyn Urso was also a true master stroke by the team. She feels authentic, not cheesy at all. Has a few lines that could potentially come across as dodgy and/or weak but the way she delivers and comes through is great to see.It is packed full of good characters with interesting arcs i felt genuinely interested in, which is rare in the Disney Star Wars content.The way they sewed the end of Rogue One into the beginning of EP IV was brilliantly executed, and really does demonstrate Disney do have access to talent that can create top shelf content, respect the source material AND entertain the fans.Then to watch stuff like Book of Boba and Obi Wan leaves you gutted, disillusioned and wanting to throw in the towel...Rogue One is the best Star Wars content Disney have created, by a country mile.

One of the better movies from Disney/Star Wars,Even though I still do disapprove of Disney and Star Wars having that merger. I really enjoyed this movie it was a good tie in to Episode 5 and it explains how the plans of the death star were saved.My favourite bit was that scene with Darth Vader not going to say which one thought.It had good acting.Good special effects.It is very promising to Star Wars fans.There will be reviews for Episode 7 and 8 I will be doing but they won't be friendly or positive whatsoever. There will be a review for Solo as well once when I have got round to see it.If you want an example of a good Disney Star Wars movie I would highly recommend Rogue One.Have a good day everyone and may the force be with you.,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Legacy.,"Star Wars has been through one heck of an ride over the decades. It has gone from underground nerdom to global phenomenon. From merchandise cashgrab to labor of love and back to merchandise cashgrab, to social confusion.The original trilogy will always stay treasured and loved. The prequel's upset the more diehard fans but opened Star Wars to the masses in ways no-one would have anticipated, and the prequels are suddenly loved even by the diehard fans that as previously stated had issues with them, because of the nosedive the new films did (episode 7 and 8.)I wasn't alone in feeling a sense of death of a franchise we all loved.Then Rogue One was announced.Somber wait.It released, and we went to see it.It revived my love for Star Wars all over again. What an absolute gem of a movie, made with love and it shows.A epic tale, set right before A New Hope.If you haven't seen it, maybe because of fear that it would be yet another Star Wars movie that hammers the proverbial nail of sadness into the coffin? Don't fret, don't be afraid. The movie is amazing. Cast, acting, score, atmosphere, they nail it all, it feels ""Star Wars"" right to the bone.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Unnecessary Sacrifice,"Recently Star Wars Universe has become more laid back and entertaining. With younger auditory oriented animation series, Rebels and Clone Wars, and the greatest fan fiction of it all, The Force Awakens, Star Wars seems to loose its burden of tragedy and titanic struggle of few against many. So, Rogue One is an effort to remedy this...Nabooo sunshine with some inferno of Mustafar.Does it work? Well, what does work is a path well trodden - establishing a likable company of heroes, to become the core of future movies and probably TV series. Felicity Jones is energetic, dark, impulsive and virtually non-stoppable. Diego Luna is absolutely stunning and very charismatic. Donnie Yen is a great addition to Star Wars universe, his role is sadly smaller than it should be but he is definitely an actor and martial artist new Star Wars need.And thus, the company gathered, and they all together proceed to...And here follows a strange turn of events. You see, true tragedy lies not in numbers but in depth. There are many deaths in this movie. And they all sort of look like...unnecessary. They all happen in period of ...about 20 minutes of movie time and look more like a hasty wrap-up of urgent movie production issues than a coherent movie story.Agreed, sometimes numbers are in place. In episode III, the massacre of jedies was in tune with the dark storyline, descending into the abyss, but here....it doesn't work.Jyn Erso's struggle to clear her father's name and to become his legacy of freedom and redemption, aspiring higher and higher up to the top of Scarif tower, is impressive and visually symbolic.But the sacrifices....however justified by the highest goal and the better good...do not, historically look like the Battle of Iwo Jima, but more like the trenches of World War One...",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
SO much better than 5 of the last 7 movies,This is an adult movie for an adult audience.Not the putrid crap with Jar Jar Binks running around.A massive improvement on every Star Wars movie released since The Empire Strikes Back.For mine this is the 2nd best Star Wars movie ever released - second only to the original Star Wars.Finally !!,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Best Star Wars Film since Empire Strikes Back,"Rogue One is the best Star Wars film since The Empire Strikes Back, and the first film made since 1983 that can truly rival the original trilogy,It's better than the Prequel Trilogy (not that high of a bar other than Revenge of the Sith).It's better than the Force Awakens and it's even better than Return of the Jedi. It might even rival or be better than the original Star Wars.It's the first Star Wars film aimed at adults (although smart kids will enjoy it as well). The characters are the most realistic we've seen in a Star Wars film, but the characterizations are subtle and you have to actually pay attention to the film to truly appreciate it (which is sometimes a problem for modern audiences).The effects are pretty easily the best we've seen yet and the space battle is the first space battle to rival the one in Return of the Jedi (amazing considering that film was made in 1983).The last act of the movie is incredible, arguably the strongest act of any Star Wars film and the final sequence is simply amazing.If you are a Star Wars fan and haven't seen Rogue One stop what you are doing and watch it now.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""Rebellions are Built on Hope""......and Sacrifice","This is a ""War"" Story...A Star ""Wars"" Story.Its Template is of Rag Tag and Grit. Dirty, Disheveled, and Dour, the Movie Feels like the Only Thing going for the ""Rebels"" is Hope. This Supposedly ""Stand Alone"" Film does No Such Thing.It is Directly Tied into the Beginning of the Whole Darn Franchise. This is a Prequel and it Presupposes what Happened in the Immediate Past just before ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" Premiered On Screens in 1977.The Synopsis of the Film is that Opening Crawl of the George Lucas' Game Changer.This Film is Dark, Violent, and Desperate. There are many Highlights and a Lot of it is Shot in Low Light. Although Filmed Digitally it takes Great Pains to Shoot Practical when it is Practical to do so.There are Grand Battle Sequences and at the Center of the Story is the Plans for the ""Death Star"". There are Cameos from Familiar Characters and much of the Hardware of the Original is at hand for Suspense and Sprawling Sequences of Mayhem.Some Complain that the New Characters are Lacking, but this is a Group Story. Names of the Rebels become Elusive as does the Places and Planets, because in the End this is about One Thing and One Thing Only...Hope...for the Survival of the Rebellion and the Elimination of an Awesome Weapon of Mass Destruction and the Sacrifice it took to Get the Job Done.Overall, it is not as Kid Friendly or as much Family Fun as ""The Force Awakens"" (2015).

Much Better Than The Force Awakens,"I enjoyed Rogue One significantly more than The Force Awakens! I liked it so much more because it was a notably more balanced film. Rogue One has a great stand alone plot that seamlessly integrated into the Star Wars universe. The characters were great and I bought in almost instantly. Even with the new characters and plot they gave the original trilogy some great background. The writers also went a little easier on the nostalgia this time compared to TFA, which was one of my biggest complaints about Episode 7 (but don't worry there is still plenty to be nostalgic about). Definitely go see it in theaters because the visuals are stunning!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The best of Disney Star Wars so far,Yes! Now this feels much more like proper Star Wars than the other Disney Star Wars movies (Episodes 7-9 and the Han Solo story).

My first positive review about CGI. Put to good use here.,"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is the first of the stand alone movies in the Star Wars 'Universe' from studio Disney. All in all it's a decent effort. You need some back knowledge of the Star Wars films to get the most enjoyment from it in my opinion. A good excuse to revisit them perhaps?OK. The film uses CGI. Particularly in bringing back to life an old character. Now I'm not usually a fan of the practice in most films but here it is perfectly warranted and put to amazing use to quite literally breathe life into people! The film sets up the original Star Wars Episode IV - A New Hope (1977) concerning plans for a new deadly planet destructive weapon called The Death Star being developed by the evil Empire. Non Star Wars geeks keep with me! The main character is called Jyn (Felicity Jones who I only remember off the forgettable Chalet Girl). Just think of gin and tonic. She is aided by a multi-cultural cast of 'rebels' to find plans for this Death Star project and deliver them to the rebellion. Jyn's father (Galen Erso) is played by Mads Mikkelson, the Danish actor who I have seen in The Hunt and Casino Royale. Thumbs up for the film. I just fear that Disney will chase the pounds/dollars and release to many of these films.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Possibly the best Star Wars film since the 1980s,"After the good but slightly disappointing effort that was Force Awakens I was not expecting much from this film, and so left the cinema surprised at just how good it was. I fall very much into the sceptic group regards this money machine franchise, but there was something fresh and invigorating about the latest film. It felt as if we were living in the universe created in 1977, but were getting to see different parts of it and learn unexpected things about it. The ships, droids and aliens fitted perfectly with the feel of the 77 picture but there was something new about it too, as if the Zero-Dark thirty vibe Edwards was aiming for was somehow able to mesh perfectly with the space fantasy without either aspect becoming too strained or giving way. I particularly loved the old, ancient Jedi temples, which brought the sense of wonder I felt watching the originals many, many years ago.It really is episode 3.5, as much as it is a spin off. As well as Mothma and Bail Organa from episode 3 ROTS, we have 2 members of the Skywalker family, and you probably know which ones by now so hopefully it is not a spoiler. I did not really want to see Vader in this episode because we have so much of him already on screen and I felt we would just get cheap repetition; but yet again they managed to do something different and totally new. I don't mean the pun but the sheer brutality Vader shows; his utterly brutal fight scene is something we have never seen before and actually adds a dimension to the character. I loved seeing certain pilots on their pre Yavin form, and the new X Wing and Y wing pilots actually had characters for the first time in a long time. Talking of space battles the use of models in place of CGI gives the spaceships weight and gravitas and the complexity of the battle lies somewhere between eps 4 and 6. This film has actually interested me in the world of Star Wars in a way I have not been since 1983: Edwards has genuinely breathed new life into a pre existing universe.As for the reshoots, go and look at the trailer released before the summer. Things are different: Whitaker's hair, the lines they give to Mon Mothma and certain plot points seem altered. The older footage gives no mention of the father-daughter arc which may perhaps have been the focus of Gilroy led reworking. Whoever did it, and however they did it, I personally thought the family angle worked fine and did indeed humanise and soften the film considerably. They played it convincingly and the platform sequence (you know something tragic is going to happen when a platform is involved) was genuinely sad and moving, because we realise Galen's awful, no win predicament and genuine good heart. Maybe if you have good actors, they can still do fine work even in a last minute rush. Finally, we actually have a decent Imperial officer; the depth of this character is important, he is motivated properly, he wants the death star to bring final victory for the Empire, it is his baby, and he wants personal control over it, a man fighting to save his career, but out of his depth against the wily politician Tarkin. I'll save Abrams blushes by making no comparisons between Ben M here and the counterpart villain in TFA. The makers of Episode VIII must be quaking in their boots after seeing this. Let us hope they do not choke on their ambitions.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A film that successfully answered some questions from the original Star Wars.,"Years ago, when Disney acquired Lucasfilm, I had worried that they would ruin one of the most beloved sci-fi franchises ever to grace the big screen. That being said, Lucasfilm's prequel trilogy showed us all how it could happen. Around the same time, I started to notice the quality of Disney's animated fare was drastically improving, even outpacing Pixar. The proof to finally win me over was the way they have expertly handled the Marvel Cinematic Universe. With all this in mind, I was curious how this side-story to the main Star Wars saga would play out.First off, anyone worth their salt in nerd-cred knows that the original Star Wars is based off samurai films. Gareth Edwards (who directed the Godzilla (2014) reboot) certainly made this influence obvious in Rouge One, especially in the opening sequence and with the inclusion of a Zatoichi-like blind swordsman. At this point, all he needed was to add in the ""war"" to Star Wars, and suddenly we have a gritty plot that ends exactly how those who have seen A New Hope (1977) expect it to. In fact, there were moments where these scenes could have been the beaches of Normandy or the jungles of Vietnam, it was so easy to see the references.While I found many of the characters to be somewhat one-dimensional (since their main objectives were either survival, duty or revenge), I did appreciate the scene-stealing K-2S0 (Alan Tudyk) to lighten the otherwise oppressive mood of the plot. Visually speaking, the battle sequences (especially in space) were phenomenal, and the first firing of the Death Star was a fantastic scene embedded in my memory for its sheer awesomeness. Even so, the CGI Governor Tarkin was still on the edge of the uncanny valley, even if it was on the more realistic side.A film that successfully answered some questions from the original Star Wars, I give Rouge One 3.5 stars out of 5.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
So bad! I want my time and money back!,"I've seen a lot of bad movies in my time, and never did a review - if it's bad, it's bad. But this movie... A few times during it my mind started to wander, that's how bad it was. No light saber duels, no Force using, no Jedi. And the design of the new ships is just lazy. Last year somebody indeed said that Disney would ruin Star Wars - well, they finally did it. And all the actors. Another bad choice. The actors should not be Hollywood super stars, bu rather unknown characters so that the movie keeps the mystery. I want my money back, my time back and to forget this awful experience. Maybe it's interesting as a sci-fi action movie, but for a true Star Wars fan is just a big disappointment.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Spectacular Film,"Out of all the Star Wars movies made after the originals, Rogue One is without a doubt the greatest. Its nostalgic feel brings you just as close as you can get to the original trilogy, but unlike The Force Awakens(still an amazing movie but lacking in originality), you're presented with an entirely organic and fresh plot that keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the movie. Not only is the plot refreshing, but the cast is as well. The diversity is truly worthy of special praise and admiration for anyone that enjoys seeing as many different types of racial representation on the movie screen as possible. I can honestly say that Rogue One was a special treat and an all around fantastic movie experience.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Rogue One is a prequel to A New Hope that tells the reality of war with a terrific cast of characters, there's also plenty of tension and suspension - My Ultimate Review","Rogue One is an all-new epic adventure directed by Gareth Edwards and written by Chris Weitz and Tony Gilroy. In a time of conflict, a group of unlikely heroes band together on a mission to steal the plans to the Death Star, the Empire's ultimate weapon of destruction. But this film is so much more than a prequel to A New Hope which revolves around the Rebellion trying to destroy the Death Star. With well written, morally grey and likeable characters, but also lots of characters from the prequel trilogy and the Clone Wars tv show; like Bail Organa, Mon Mothma, Saw Gerrera, Vader, Tarkin and a bunch of cameos. But it's the new ones that leaves a mark; characters like Jyn Erso, Cassian Andor, Orson Krennic, Galen Erso and K-2SO. The main cast consists of Felicity Jones, Diego Luna, Ben Mendelsohn, Donnie Yen, Mads Mikkelsen, Alan Tudyk, Forest Whitaker, Riz Ahmed and Jiang Wen.Rogue One: A Star Wars story is Star Wars at its best because of many things, there's plenty of tension and suspension and the war genre is a big reason of it, the franchise was built on war and this film stays true to the war aspect and the director and his crew made a superb Star Wars film. It gives depth to A New Hope, but also to the whole rebellion and years fought, and because both the dark and heroic parts of the Alliance & Rebels are explored. Moreover, this is a movie worth seeing for its own catchy plot, full of revenge, family and quest for redemption. It was based on an idea first pitched by John Knoll ten years before the film entered development, Rogue One was made to be different in tone and style from the traditional Star Wars films, omitting the customary opening crawl and transitional screen wipes. Thus making the film more grounded and like a war movie as Edwards stated ""It's the reality of war. Good guys are bad. Bad guys are good. It's complicated, layered; a very rich scenario in which to set a movie."" Having critically acclaimed cinematographer Greig Fraser onboard makes for a stunning and literally mesmerizing film. Michael Giacchino is no John Williams but his musical score and orchestra brings a different yet similar in some way to the franchise, Michael's music fits the war genre and the story Rogue One is telling. The action sequences are all excellent, with the various of planets used, there are a sense of world building and expanding the galaxy. With planets like Jedha, Eadu and where the climax takes place, Scarif. The climax sequence on Scarif is some of the best Star Wars I've ever seen, what transpires there is what turned out to be the Rebel Alliance's first effective victory against the Empire, first referenced in A New Hope's opening crawl. There's some real emotional weight in Rogue One, the story is just superbly told. Gareth Edwards have created something memorable, something that's visually stunning and entertaining to look at.I've said that the well written characters are a huge reason why this film works so well, it's also the actors who play them who make them work on screen. Felicity Jones plays Jyn Erso, a flawed and human character that at first could be seen as a dislikeable character but what Rogue One does well is its character development that makes these morally grey and human characters into such interesting and ultimately characters. Other well acted performances are Diego Luna as Cassian Andor, a Rebel captain and intelligence officer, Ben Mendelsohn as Orson Krennic, the director of advanced weapons research for the Imperial military and Mads Mikkelsen as Galen Erso, Jyn's father and a research scientist. Whilst Forest Whitaker's role is smaller than I would have wanted as Saw Gerrera, a veteran of the Clone Wars and a friend of the Erso family who had mentored Jyn in her later childhood years. His presence is felt throughout the entire film, Whitaker's take on the character that have been in both Clone Wars and Rebels and now Fallen Order. He's still terrific in this film, playing this old man who have fought his entire life, it's a performance felt through his emotion. The comedic relief comes mostly from Alan Tudyk as K-2SO, a former Imperial enforcer droid who was reprogrammed by Cassian Andor to serve the Rebellion. But the character is also quite great, I just love the actor and the work he did for K-2SO.Rogue One has everything a film in this franchise needs to have and they do it perfectly. It brought us a spectacular and cinematic experience at the cinema but also back home, thinking back to my first viewing and now on my forth, it's still amazing. It's my first time watching it on 4k Bluray and it almost matches the experience at the cinema. It also spawned a prequel tv show called Andor which focuses on the title character's adventures in the rebellion before the events of Rogue One. My criticism is a spoiler so I won't go into detail but the film's flaw is the writing, but Gareth Edwards' makes up for it, it's mostly one decision the writers took but most of the dialogue were fixed during reshoots which saved the movie. Other than some of its writing, I think Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is a strong candidate for one of the best Star Wars films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Went in with low expectations. Was completely blown away.,"I actually had an IMDb account since 2010 but deleted it in anger when they did away with the message boards. However, I had never written a review before. I usually relied on the message boards to get a general feel for the movie as I found it hard to trust reviews. Since this is our only way now I read through the reviews before checking it out. I saw many either very good/ or very bad ratings. I tend to be pessimistic when it comes to Hollywood so I gave it a go with very low expectations and was very pleasantly surprised at the outcome. I decided to remake an account to help others who may be needing average Joe opinions.You will know very few of the characters aside from a few that are brought in from both the originals 4-6 and the newer Eps 1-3. I won't give away who they are but you will have a few nostalgic moments and smile when you see them.Let me state that this movie was created with substance and storyline and forewent the graphical technology so prevalent in Hollywood over the last decade or so. For me this was a breath of fresh air and something that has been sorely missing for quite some time. The less is more was evident here. The story itself was very intricate. It wasn't shallow and built just as a popcorn flick just to make an easy buck. I felt as though they really put their hearts into creating something special for the audience. The acting was spectacular from all involved.Here's something else I was pleased with. I have really gotten sick of franchise films (or films in general) such as Marvel and the newer Star Wars movies relying on the cheesy nostalgia gimmicks, cheesy humor/ joke scenes, and general fear of making serious story lines that aren't basic formulaic packages they feel the entire family of all age groups can be brought to. Where's the serious story lines that really encapsulate the thinking person. Do any of you go into a Marvel movie and get swept away in imagination like you would in a really good book or do the cheap ""same old formula"" movies like Marvel and the new Star Wars movies make you groan with their attempts to win you over with their overkill of ""humor scenes"" and CGI?This Star Wars was made for those who fell in love with the original Star Wars 4-6. Who were swept up in the story and were in the movie for its entirety. This movie, in my opinion, stands up there in greatness with the original Star Wars trilogy unlike eps 1-3 and the newer Star Wars Ep. 7. It had that ""feel"" to it you only got from the original episodes 4-6.Sorry if I made this review a bit long, but I didn't know what to expect with the either extremely high and low ratings. I watch a ton of movies and shows and so I have pretty high standards. I want to see movies with substance and storyline and could care less if they have over the top graphics. I wrote this review for those of you out there like me that look for the same. I rated it 10 stars, but have a tendency to do that for any movie or show I really enjoy. I would imagine most who look for the things I do as mentioned above would rate this an 8-10 star though. We don't have the message boards anymore so hopefully more average joes like myself begin writing reviews. I'm not looking for ""professional critic"" like reviews, just honest opinions.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A Galactic Mess,"Star Wars, Star Wars what have you become? You've always been there for me through the good (Revenge of the Sith), the bad (The Phantom Menace) the unintentional laughter (Attack of the Clones) and the highs (The Empire Strikes Back). But along the way something went wrong you're not the same franchise you used to be. Whilst never entirely reliable you were something I could rest easy with particularly when a certain George Lucas was not at the creative helm. But this is different, Lucas is out of the picture forever and now you present me with this garbage from the trash compactor? Why? Why now? Star Wars should be at new heights and The Force Awakens showed us what love, care and fan service (albeit too much) could do for a franchise that was thought to have had its day. Enter Gareth Edwards, that's no Director, that's a hack!Rogue One is exactly how you would reasonably expect any Star Wars film to begin (minus the title crawl and John William's music) in Space! Jyn Erso is a rebel on a mission to grasp hold of the Death Star plans and bring the Empire crumbling down. Helpless and frail. It ends how we expect it to end, begins how we would assume it to begin. As for the middle, the plot beats can be neatly charted on a graph for sheer convenience, how kind of Edwards. It's certain that this is not your father's Star Wars, because well that would require a reasonable amount of thinking and thought processes to have taken place.I will take this moment to bring up where this film excels. Don't worry this won't take me long. The music although it pales in comparison to John William's weakest scores is still admirable, although I do tend to think great things of Michael Giacchino and sadly this does not bolster his reputation so much as hinder it. The cinematography is gorgeous, not to the extent that the originals or Episode VII were, but better than the prequels all the same. Is that high praise? I doubt it. Mads Mikkelsen although given severely little to do is intriguing enough that we want to care about him, yet due to the scripts numerous shortcomings we never in fact do. Or feel any emotion for the main characters themselves, an irksome trend with Edwards's films to be sure. Remember 2014's Godzilla? Same treatment is given to the best characters here, they are put on a backseat whilst the endless CGI drivel is chucked at the screen hoping and praying that something does indeed stick with the audience to the very end. Here's a spoiler it doesn't.That's the main gripe I have with Rogue One; not its story or its cringe inducing acting (minus the voice of James Earl Jones, thank the gods) but its characters. The group that Ersa becomes a part of is so ill defined that I thought George Lucas must have scrambled in, hijacked the script and completed rewrites. They don't even fit into specific character archetypes because quite simply they have ceased to be characters the moment they step on screen, utter some of the worst one liners in recent memory and stumble out of the frame, promptly leave the scene and try not to look too embarrassed or ashamed with themselves. At this point it's practically a panto. All glitz and glamour, forced heart and humour with no blood coursing through its veins, just dried up oil and a script that I would be surprised if they spent more than a good day on. Yeah, it's that much of a shambles. Because this is what Star Wars is under the watchful eye of the corporate giant that is Disney; manufactured by robots with fake emotion sprinkled throughout, the resemblance of some plot and a plethora of characters all of whom are the comic relief and serve one purpose. To sell more toys! This is what happens when you put the by-products of a film before the actual production itself. A mess, a disaster and something that even Yoda couldn't fix with his wide assortment of powers.I'm not expecting for anyone to heed my advice and leave Rogue One to play out its life cycle in the cinema whilst you sit back at home and watch the originals in pristine high definition picture and quality. That would be the wisest thing to do, but believe me we both know that's never going to happen. So here's what to do, watch it as soon as possible so you can be spared further pain and then watch all the others minus I, II, III. (Delete where applicable). I'm saving you a world of pain. Who wants to try a Jedi Mind trick on Disney? Maybe we can stop them from causing this disaster that they so clearly want to make. Episode VIII is a mere zap away from becoming a reality and maybe this is the point of the sequel trilogy; to be our shining beacon of hope that will redeem the standalone projects when they inevitably fail and if we are lucky flop too. As for me I'm not holding my breath. You shouldn't either.D+",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Terrible,"Was JJ Abrams involved with this too? Honestly I went to the toilet and missed the credits but it was such a hack fest. The only positive thing you can say about this World War II in space - yes I said WWII - is that it was better than Episode VII - but then what isn't? Disney is going to churn out one of these every year until we are all old and grey so we better get used to the non-cannon, irrelevant, cash bilking very very sub-par offerings. I am not against women or people of color or immigrants or whatever at all. In fact, I am as against trump and his army of inbreds as anyone out there, but this whole leading women trend (Ghostbusters, Episode VII, Star Trek president, Fantastic Beasts president, black and east Asian people in Thor yes in THOR with Odin, etc etc) is really getting old. I mean this chick was running around the whole time with no skill.Does Disney not care they are ruining the legacy of Star Wars? More importantly, do people care that Disney is doing it to Star Wars??OK its action-packed and full of violence which is great but come on Hollywood give us a break. You need to earn respect and you are not.By the way it is not so much a spin off than it is a prequel, but as mentioned the class and brilliant imagination of the original Star Wars is not something Disney can create.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A Star Wars Dirty Dozen movie,"Without going into details, this was a refreshing and enjoyable departure from the main Star Wars films. It plays more like a war movie (think The Dirty Dozen, the Guns of Navarone, A Bridge too Far or even The Magnificent 7) than a sci-fi genre movie, especially when compared to the rest of the series. Characters have flaws, things go wrong and no one is truly a hero for most of the film.

"From the five I watched thus far this one was the weaker one, still good though.","I finally decided to watch all the Star Wars movies. Since there are different ways to watch it I'm going for the chronological order and not the release date order, that just makes more sense to me. Maybe I watched a couple movies when I was young, I probably did, but I don't remember anything about it so to me it's all new and maybe one day I will understand the whole hype about the Star Wars saga. After watching The Phantom Menace, Attack Of The Clones and Revenge Of The Sith, Solo: A Star Wars Story, it's now time for Rogue One. I read some reviewers stating this was one of the best one but from all the ones I watched by now I thought this was the weakest one. It's still good enough for me though, just found the story confusing sometimes. By watching the saga in chronological order you appreciate every movie better than in order by release date. It's just a better way to watch the whole saga, it's much easier to follow and for somebody new to it like me it's just much more appealing. The best thing about this movie and probably all the others are the different characters, races of aliens, and the different spaceships and weapons, I just love it. The CGI's are better than in the earlier movies, what makes perfect sense as the technology is just better now. I can't wait to watch the next one, will probably binge watch the eleven movies and will probably squeeze The Mandalorian between it, as long as the chronological order is respected. This was the fifth movie of eleven in barely 48 hours for me, next one tonight will be A New Hope in the hope the quality stays the same, looking forward to it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"""I am one with the Force, and the Force is with me.""","FILM: 7.5
When Rogue One: A Star Wars Story was announced, I was sceptical. After all, telling a story about a small moment in Star Wars history with the outcome already known didn't entirely sound exciting. Fortunately, it's about that, but it's about a lot of other things too.The film delves into themes of ambition, destiny, resistance, and morality, examining these concepts quite well. It's better at exploring these themes than the prequels were. The action is excellent and quite visceral for a Star Wars film, making everything feel more tangible compared to the prequels. The ending is unique too, and stands out in the franchise.The performances are all solid, with Felicity Jones being a fine lead. However, Diego Luna's performance doesn't wow me. Donnie Yen and Alan Tudyk, on the other hand, steal the show with their captivating performances. Mads Mikkelsen's brief appearances elevate the film, as he always does.Despite these strengths, there are several issues. Even with extensive reshoots, there are some story moments that don't hold up to scrutiny. Would the film have been better in its original cut? Who knows. Still, the ending is extremely well done and offers some fan service, but it's delivered in a way that doesn't feel like pandering.The film manages to balance its introspective themes with the excitement of the Star Wars universe. The exploration of these deeper themes, combined with the tangible action sequences, creates a compelling narrative that stands out within the franchise. In that respect, it does earn its right to exist.In the end, Rogue One is a solid entry in the Star Wars saga. It's a film that offers more than just a small moment in history, exploring larger themes that resonate with the broader narrative of the series. Despite some flaws, it's a rewatch that I find both enjoyable and thought-provoking.FORMAT: 4K Ultra HD Blu-rayVIDEO: 9.5

Very Mixed Feelings,"Now, I'm not an old Star Wars fan. I didn't grow up on the films, and to be honest, I only watched them for the first time a couple of years ago to prep for Episode VII, and never even got around to watching VI all the way through, but I loved them. IV and V were so amazing, and yes, the prequels had problems (a lot of problems), but I understood their place and what they were trying to do. I adored The Force Awakens, and I went into Rogue One (albeit late) with high, high hopes. And then... Well.The first few minutes were stunning, impactful, and I was eagerly waiting to be sucked right into the storyline. And then we saw Jyn. And I just felt myself drifting further and further away from what this movie was trying to make me feel.I didn't care about Cassian, and I cared about Jyn even less. It takes so long for her to show any emotion, any motivation, that by the time that she did... I couldn't connect with it at all. I had no reason to feel anything but a vague shadow of sympathy that she lost so much, but then it was so... distanced. It felt as though it were a story that a friend of a friend told me about this one person that they met once, rather than this person that I'm supposed to empathize with and admire as a hero.That isn't to say that I disliked all of the characters. My heart hurt for Bodhi, and I fell in love with K2 and Chirrut and Baze, and I thought most of the references to the original movies were wonderful, but the fact that I couldn't connect with the two main characters seriously hurt my appreciation of where the film went.The climax, I thought, was wonderful. As soon as the battles picked up, it was a bit overwhelmingly hectic, but that to an extent served a point, showing the chaos of what they were trying to do. I did expect the ending, to a degree, and it have an effect on me... But to me the real saving grace was the last five or so minutes, when the connection to the first films became clear. The way that they tied things together, the line of emotional connection that they managed to pull with the assumption that you know what happens, after the film ends? Wonderful. But it just doesn't make up for everything wrong with the first 2+ hours.Overall, this movie could have been a lot worse. It very nearly was. But it could have been so, so much better, at least in my opinion.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Rogue One: A Star Wars Story - Review,"I enjoyed it. It's not a hard nuanced movie, I'm not a die-hard fan of this franchise, so my rating isn't that high, but surely a solid film with some beautiful visuals and a nice CGI. The characters are likable, not that developed or something. Liked the storyline, Darth Vader was cool and his hallway scene is among the best scenes from this movie, but it could've been a bit longer. Still sad the main new trilogy was so big misstep in quality, again, not much of a massive fan, actually really liked the first two, but The Rise of Skywalker was such a mediocre movie with some atrocious decisions like ""Somehow Palpatine returned."" lines (oh gosh). I hope that Waititi will reborn this franchise in style, not necessarily the best choice in my opinion, but of course a decent one. Emilia Jones was good, K-2SO was a very useful droid with some nice lines, and overall a very nice experience in this world. Maybe going to watch Solo, but we'll see.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The last 2 minutes salvages a 4/10 rating from a 3/10. Nothing you haven't seen before.,"Its very pretty special effects but no substance, when you begin routing for the Dark Side to win things have gone seriously wrong with character and plot creation. The opening 20 minutes flits about trying to build a plot which is very weak but OK-ish (its hard to write without spoiling for others) how much can go wrong? the rest of the movie is spent where the heroes are bungling oafs and the baddies incompetent. Don't talk the hero to death, when you have the chance - shoot them and ask questions later! Another triumph for hype over quality. Not a patch on 4,5,6 or 7 but way better than 1,2 and 3. Any honest person having seen Rogue One cannot hand on heart say it is good movie, it may take a day or two before you finally admit it!

Real Star Wars,"I absolutely love this movie because of how deeply involved it makes you feel in the Star Wars universe. It's pure Star Wars, far better than the newer movies with Rey. This film captures the essence of the galaxy far, far away while showing us a different, grittier side of the saga. It's not a kid's movie, and that's what makes it stand out for me. The darker tone and grounded storytelling make it a refreshing and much-needed change for the franchise.The cinematography, courtesy of Greig Fraser, is absolutely stunning-every shot feels like a piece of art. The actors are fantastic, and their performances elevate the film even further. It's the kind of story that reminds you how expansive and rich the Star Wars universe can be.

A lot better than Episode VII,"I don't get the hate on this movie. It actually poses a great chance to introduce people who aren't Star Wars fans yet to the world, as it is the first completely independent movie, that introduces all characters seen. At the same time it does a great job at delivering the Star Wars world we fans know and love.The major reason why Episodes VII and VIII are bad in my opinion, is because they completely mess up the continuation of already existing characters from the original movies, they do a poor job at creating new characters and they consistently made the wrong decisions with the design, making everything look more cheap and childish. Don't even get me started on the horrible ""hero moments"" and ""punchlines"" that felt out of place.
On the other hand, Rogue One didn't do any of these mistakes. It perfectly delivers the feel of the Star Wars Universe, with more flashy effects of course, but without fundamentally changing parts that shouldn't be changed. Funny scenes are only placed where they are appropriate. Character development and behavior is the way we know it from the original Star Wars movies, but with new Characters and a new Story of course.The bottom line for me is: this movie is great for both people who have never seen Star Wars movies before, and for the people who have seen Episodes 1-6 and are curious what Disney has pulled of since buying the franchise.

There are some short-living but stunning views from the cockpit of an X-Wing fighter that really stood out. Special effects are terrific throughout, though I disagreed with some of the decisions on CGI powered characters (a more subtle approach would have sufficed in my opinion).Empire Strikes Back remains King because it is so enduring but if you remove that from consideration, Rogue One is the best Star Wars in my opinion.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"This movie went rogue, alright.","I had high expectations for Rogue One after hearing from people who said it was their favorite Star Wars film. I am not really sure what movie they watched, but the movie that I saw left me disappointed when those expectations weren't met. This movie had a sluggish pace and its seemed to struggle to tell a story that could have been told much more swiftly.Most of the supporting characters were under developed and lacked the heart needed for me to genuinely care about them. Felicity Jones on the other hand, delivered as protagonist Jen Erso. That said, Erso's relationship with Cassian Andor, played by Diego Luna, felt forced, unconvincing and lacked sparks of anything. Han Solo and Princess Leia they are not.The character's use of the word ""force"" felt misplaced and a little misguided. The climatic space and ground battle scenes in the second act is where this film clearly shined.The deliberately darker tone in this film stands as a stark contrast to Lucas' prequel trilogy.

"Uh...calm down folks, it's just OK.","I waited a while to watch this movie because the trailer looked like generic characters doing generic plotty things in a star wars universe.And that's pretty much what it is.It LOOKS awesome though. Cinematography is astounding. But after a while, the pretty images don't make up for some hollow characters and a tired old story line.There is also some nice use of real props and prosthetic costumes which blend well with the CGI.Again, the craftsmanship is great, they just needed some more of it in the script. But it's Disney right? They know just the right amount to get away with.However, there is some god awful CGI as well, when they digitally recreate dead actors. It's very unsettling. I'll have nightmares from it now.The characters have no chemistry. They're just plot devices. No character bonding, no quiet moments between action scenes. All the lovable qualities of the original characters are not apparent.I guess it's a serious Star Wars movie, but does that make it Star Wars? It didn't really feel like a Star Wars movie.It is enjoyable though, but it adds nothing new and exciting to the franchise.Star Trek rules!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Another dull 200 million $ Hollywood movie.,"Nothing new.Characters are nonexistent, story-line doesn't make much sense, edition is limp and sloppy (for instance : some ships start to fight 20min after the beginning of the assault) - I think a lot of edition problem is also because of a sloppy screenplay - and finally, images are really inconsistent : in a lot of scenes, there are close (ugly) shots on main characters, that are well-defined, and the rest (world, crowd...) is blurred (but we can guess it's pretty generic)... Feels like a movie made for TV. So you think you can finally see new worlds in the best universe ever, but...The Force Awakens was doomed at the start : plagiarism and McGuffin, no stakes nor credibility. TFA is useless. However, this Rogue One had everything to please : people giving their lives for their believes against the Empire, at what could be the most exciting Star Wars timeline.On screen, you get a bunch of archetyped heroes we don't care about because story-line is illogical, sloppy and therefore actors have to overplay, because there simply is nothing to feel.Rogue One, despite a basic story-line, had everything to be a very high quality drama and spectacle, but instead we've got the second abortive child of the Industry's new milking cow :Rogue One : A Star Wars TV movie.

I'm a kid again!,"I won't ramble on or try to use big words to demonstrate how much more valid my review is than anyone else's but I had to add to the voices rating this film. I grew up watching the original Star Wars films and they became part of my treasured childhood memories, revisited regularly. I didn't heavily rate any of the new movies - even seeing Han and Chewie popping up in the last film didn't quite match the magic of the older films, and so I expected Rogue One to be in the same vein. I was wrong. Rogue One made me laugh, cry and gasp like an excited kid all over again.

The Most Star Wars Star Wars Film,"For those who remember, for those who will never forget, and for a whole new generation that will experience it for the very first time... THIS FILM WAS THE DEFINITION OF STAR WARS IF YOU LOOK IN THE DICTIONARY. As a life long fan of the series, I was moved by the attention to detail and the care taken into keeping authenticity. This was a film made for the hardcore fans, the fans that read the books and watch the TV shows, the fans who even like the prequels because it's more Star Wars, the fans that dissect everything just to get the most minute details. Everything fans of Star Wars love is in this film. Great characters, strange worlds with amazing creatures, intense battles, deep emotional pulls, and wonderful jokes. There are lots of new faces and some old ones too, but it all feels cohesive and like it was always this way. It's almost like they dug this out of the archives at Lucas Films it fits in so well with everything we already know of this galaxy far far away. It grows the universe as well, everything I saw made me want to know more, what's that guys story, what's that guys story, what's that guys story. The camera work and effects were some of the best I've seen and the re-shoots were almost un-noticeable. This film was so much fun, and left me wanting more. It is a great time to be a Star Wars fan.

"I'm One With The Force, The Force Is With Me","Disney acquiring the rights to the Star Wars franchise from George Lucas back in 2012 was a decision that turned quite a few heads and had more than a few people tugging at their collars. On one hand, it was a good thing that the series was being taken out of Lucas' hands after his unquestioned creative control lead to the prequels becoming one of the most disappointing spectacles in cinematic history. On the other hand, people were afraid that the series was going to become overly sanitized under the control of Disney, and while The Force Awakens was well received and made all the money, they did play it a little too safe by making the plot a retread of A New Hope, which didn't assuage any of those fears. While I have faith in Disney since they were able to turn Marvel into a well oiled machine with a track record so good that even its missteps are easily glanced over, it's way too early to be making judgments on the future of Star Wars after only two film. But Disney has other plans for the galaxy far far away. While we are looking at a future with a new Star Wars movie nearly every year, they're trying to keep things fresh by pulling double duty and maintaining two storylines. Even years will present the main story with Rey, Finn, Kylo Ren and BB-8, while odd years will contain stand-alone tales within the Star Wars universe. And this Christmas, we were given the first chapter of this anthology, Rogue One.Our story takes place right before A New Hope and follows Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones), the daughter of an Imperial science officer (Mads Mikkelsen) who was one of the architects of the Death Star. Separated from her family as a child and raised by a freedom fighter deemed too radical for the Rebel Alliance (Forest Whitaker), Jyn has lived the life of a criminal until she's tracked down and broken out of prison by the Rebels when they find out her father is planning to leak the Death Star's secrets to them. Along with a Rebellion intelligence officer (Diego Luna), a reprogrammed enemy droid (Alan Tudyk), a former Empire pilot (Riz Ahmed), a blind monk (Donnie Yen) and his bodyguard (Jiang Wen), she goes on a mission to find and rescue her father, unbeknownst that her handlers were assigned to assassinate him. When things goes south, the ragtag crew carry out her father's last wishes to steal the blueprints for the Death Star, thus playing a small part in kick-starting the major events of the original trilogy.Right from the very first shot, we know that we're not in for a typical Star Wars movie. Stylistically, Rogue One is so radically different from its brethren that if it weren't for some of the iconography like stormtroopers, X-wings, or the Death Star, you probably wouldn't even tell it was a Star Wars movie. From what I can tell, the anthology movies are a way to play around with this universe and tell stories not intrinsically tied to the trappings of the main saga (the Jedi, the Sith, the Force, the Skywalker family etc.). In the case of Rogue One, we're treated to a straight-up war movie with a focus on espionage. The world director Gareth Edwards created looks more raw, grizzled and lived in, like it's a place that's not unfamiliar with Star Destroyers looming in the sky, or where stormtroopers stomping down the streets are just an everyday occurrence. While the whole series hinges on a universe that's constantly at war (I mean, it's right there in the freaking title), the actual war part is mainly just a backdrop for the mores spiritual journey of the main characters or a catalyst to show off the capabilities of the Force. Here, we're following the people who have to do the actual fighting. Of course, what makes things different this time around is that our ragtag band of scoundrels are a fringe too rebellious for the rebellion, a veritable motley crew of murderers, thieves and borderline terrorists who do the dirty work that make the hero's job possible, who have nothing to lose and nothing driving them but hope. It adds touches of gray to a story that hinges on a good vs. Evil dynamic, showing that the side of good isn't afraid to go a mile when given an inch.Of course, this is still a Star Wars movie and thus people are going to have certain expectations of it, and while Rogue One definitely has its own identity, it still slavishly adheres to the principles that George Lucas laid out. Gareth Edwards knows what makes these movies work and goes out of his way to remain loyal to the source material while also adding his own stamp. In an interview, he said that there is a very fine line in what makes a true Star Wars film, and here I think he finds a great balance. But I'd also be lying if I said that most of the references don't take me out of the experience a bit. For one, there is a cameo from two minor characters that makes me wonder how they survived considering the place they're at gets destroyed a few minutes later. There are also two major characters from the original trilogy that were recreated with CG since their actors are either dead or have aged considerably, and they look pretty amazing even if they teeter on the edge of the uncanny valley. But it's counterbalanced by fleshing out certain aspects that have been itching at the back of the minds of fans, like why the Death Star has such a fatal design flaw. There was also a bit of hype about Darth Vader's appearance in the film since he was a big part of the trailers. I can't say much but I will say this; he's not there for very long, but what little screen time he has is used very effectively.Speaking of characters, you can't really have a Star Wars movie without a cast of memorable characters. Our dramatist personae this time around is sort of a mixed bag. The audience favorites are definitely going to be K-2SO, the reprogrammed droid whose blunt observations and droll delivery provide the bulk of the series' humor, and Chirrut Imwe, a badass blind monk in tune with the Force who, despite having an armored gunman with him everywhere he goes, is more than capable of handling himself. My personal favorites would have to be Saw Gerrera and Bodhi. Forest Whitaker gives an incredibly memorable performance as the defected terrorist and I really wanted to know more about his character. Apparently he's a carry-over from the Clone Wars animated series, which means that I'll get my wish and the entire extended universe hasn't been completely retconned. (Yay.) I also really liked Bodhi, the defected Empire pilot who plays a big part in the heist by getting them through enemy lines undetected. Riz Ahmed has been an actor I've been keeping a loose eye on since he's appeared in two of my favorite movies of the decade (Four Lions and Nightcrawler) and hopefully he'll get a lot more work after this. The two characters that I felt left more to be desired were our two main leads, Jyn and Cassian. Nothing against Felicity Jones and Diego Luna, both are great actors, but it felt like there were some key moments missing that would've fleshed them out a lot more. (Since the movie underwent some major re-shoots, which also led to some minor inconsistencies in cinematography, that very well may the case.) But then again, Luke Skywalker was kind of a bland character and that wasn't nearly enough to bring the experience down and it certainly didn't bring anything down here.Overall, Rogue One is a welcome addition to the growing Star Wars legacy that mixes things up and brings its own unique flavor while still ostensibly remaining a Star Wars story. If they can keep this experiment up, then the future of the series is looking pretty bright. I would tell you to go see it, but let's face it, most of you are probably going to do that anyway regardless of what I said.8/10.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Empire Strikes Back = Rogue One > Force Awakens,"Rogue One is simply one of the best thing that could happen within this franchise. It successfully accomplishes to be a Star Wars movie without relying too much on mass Easter-eggs as Force Awakens did, but it also extends the lore with its new story-line which in the end perfectly docks to the beginning of the New Hope.Do you remember how was it like when you played the Jedi Knight Outcast for the first time, or a more fitting game, Rogue Squadron? Or read some of the novels of the young Obi wan Kenobi, when he was a Jedi padawan, or any of the Dark Horse comics about Luke's dark side? It gave wider perspective to the universe that the Star Wars movie anthologies represented. It's just a refreshing feeling when you experience the happenings of new characters in different places of different galaxies, reminding you that not only the universe of the movies exist in this franchise, and that there is a lot more beyond that line abundantly more.And here we are, Rogue One, a story which is the prequel to the New Hope, a sequel to the new trilogies about Anakin Skywalkers failure. A story where we see a totally different side of the Rebellion, a lot more dirty, darker, with its morally questionable members who struggle to bring justice to their galaxy which is under the rule of the Empire. We can feel this blooming hope, as we watch these people throughout the movie, where we see the most credible representation of this repression, as non-stop tension rules around the forces of empire walking around of people's everyday life. I assure you, non of the prequels could present the oppression in such effective way as this film.The storytelling is beyond amazing with examining every cliché a Star Wars movie could possibly do, and with that it could re-think how even the most minor action scenes would be exciting without making the audience yell: damn, this again!""; Here we go again!"". The characters have also interesting dynamics between them, and makes us feel attached to easily, making them well understandable in most of ways.The cinematography is really distinguishes itself of the Star Wars norma, but with an understandable purpose: The monumental scenes never felt so monumental EVER in any other Star Wars movies, or it is just executed in a way as it is should be nowadays, making these scenes Huge, and Wide. It was really a long time ago that I had ever been so touched by the visual presentation of any movie. That's how amazing it is.With these elements listed above this movie perfectly works as not just a Star Wars movie, but also as a motion picture which wants to be a Sci-fi/fantasy. And that is what Force Awakens looked over, to be not just a movie that relies on being a Star Wars movie, thinking that it is enough to be a sci-fi nowadays, but a production, which has to be a Sci-fi in the first place and THEN Star Wars. With this thinking I believe it could be possible to bring a totally new, fresh feeling to a film within this franchise, to think a bit out of the box, and not being afraid to tell new stories, to be INDEPENDENT from the Star Wars norma.The narrative is a blast from A to Z, it is fast phased, but still comprehensible, enjoyable. It has seemingly many stories but perfectly built around the main story: which is to steal the famous plans of the Death Star. To understand the hugeness of such action the movie made us to understand the Rebellion. To understand the Rebellion we had to believe that the Empire is indeed repressing the people and maintains the stress-fullness in people's everyday life. The story perfectly gives you these right information at the right time. Everything is perfectly built on each other, the narrative has never been that complex and yet understandable in a Star Wars movie in my opinion. It just feels natural to watch and it's simply enjoyabe. So that's all you gotta do when you go watch this movie: To enter this world and let it tell you the story the way it wants to do it. You will hardly be disappointed.There are also flaws of this production though, but mostly minor ones. Only one big issue I had with this movie is what every other reviews are talking about: The CGI faces, but you will understand when you watch this.Overall it is a Star Wars movie, gave me such emotional waves at places that couldn't resist me saying in my head Oh MY GOD, oh MY GOOD! Is this really happening?!"". And sometimes made invisible ninjas cutting onions. But what's the most important thing in my opinion: I just couldn't take off my eyes from the big screen that was presenting the One and Only real Star Wars I have waited for long, giving me feelings that even Force Awakens couldn't accomplished. And that my friends is a HUGE thing for a Star Wars fan.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Force Is Strong With Rogue One!,"What a movie! The wait is definitely worth it. As the first stand-alone movie related to ""Star Wars"" it's a glimpse to what we may see in this franchise after Episode IX.

Not good,"I know that I will be in the minority on this one, but I found this movie to be boring and the characters to be flat and uninteresting. Perhaps we were expecting too much, but we left the cinema with my wife and I both saying how awful this movie was. Forest Whitaker, who is a great actor came across as a caricature and brought nothing to the movie. It seems like he should have played a much larger role, but it looks like much of his performance may have been left on the editing room floor.Even Mads Mikkelsen who is a tremendous actor seemed uninterested and brought little to the screen.The fact that none of the truly famous characters we saw in the last movie play a role in this one meant that they could have skipped making this movie in its entirety.It seems to me that this was simply a way to extend the series and extract as much money out of the public as possible.Honestly, I would not recommend this to any movie goer. To me, the only people that are rating this so highly are die hard Star Wars fans whose lives revolves around the series.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This is the Star Wars film I've always wanted,"After seeing Empire Strikes Back in the early 1980's I wanted more of that moodier, sobering atmosphere. Return Of The Jedi went in the feel-good, comedic direction. I didn't care for it. Episodes 1, 2 and 3 were focused too much on technical and political things, so I never liked them. The Force Awakens I felt was okay, but my hope for another dark Star Wars film was all but squashed. Out of seven films, I only cared for ESB, so I stood in line to watch Rogue One with my expectations set to the lowest levels. I was pleasantly surprised! Rogue One is dark, serious, and has a sobering conclusion that I found utterly satisfying. This is now my all-time favorite Star Wars film. The lack of many of the familiar Star Wars elements such as the opening Star Wars logo with accompanying text scrawl, or even John William's familiar movie scoring (he does the music in Rogue but it's nothing familiar) made me feel I was watching a fresh, new and improved Star Wars. I loved the movie immensely from start to finish.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An excellent Star Wars film,"I just got home from seeing Rogue One, and I must say, it was excellent. I grew up watching the original trilogy and was pleasantly surprised at just how well this fit into the Star Wars saga. The acting was superb, the costumes were outstanding, and there were several moments where I was taken back to my childhood by memories of Episode IV in theaters. This was a bit grittier than the rest of the series, but it also had more to do with the actual rebellion/empire war than with the Skywalker family. There was a real human element to it, with some of the backstory that gets revealed as the plot moves forward, as in, not everyone in the Empire is evil, and not everyone in the Rebel Alliance has pure motives. That being said, the characters have real flaws and real virtues, just like any normal person. If you have not seen it yet, I highly recommend it, if you have I would say it is worth repeated viewings. All in all, it exceeded my expectations and was thoroughly enjoyable.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Bored One. Let down... too many dark (low-light) scenes.,"Once you've seen the special effects of the other Star Wars films, this film was no big deal. We went to see it this afternoon, and both of us were ready to walk out after about 45 minutes. Way too many scenes in the dark. On this line I'll say that it's OK if you've not seen any other Star Wars films. On this line I'll say that I wish I didn't have to write a minimum of 10 lines. On this line I'll say that we rented the latest Jason Bourne film and watched it when we got home and really liked the excitement... really liked THAT film better than Bored One. (Preview my reviewing...) Oh, come on! I have to include more lines? Well here goes. I recognized the beach and palm trees scenes, partly because the palm trees were perfectly set in nice rows.

Well directed with lovable characters.,"The positives-Lovable and memorable characters. The sass of K2S0 and the smart ass remarks by the blind warrior along with the witty banter between the characters were treat to watch. You understand and relate to the characters and don't question their motives. Something lacking in most modern action movies.-Good direction with camera work, pacing, tonal focus-Comprehensible plot that is somewhat interestingAnswers some questions related to the franchise in a satisfactory way-Don't try to soften the blow when it comes to the necessary sad parts of the movie-Decent dialogue with some quotable lines-No silly forced romances.-The right amount of screen time for original characters and references to the other movies. Ie very minimal, unlike the heavy reliance on nostalgia by Force Awakens. Darth Vader is on screen briefly but is a bad assThe negatives-The action is nothing that you haven't seen before. It's good but not much in the way of new or original action scenes that will impresses you-It's a well-made, enjoyable movie. But nothing unique or groundbreaking about the movie to make it special.Overall: 7/10For comparison sake, I would give Force Awakens 5/10, the prequels 2/10 and the original trilogy 9-10/10. In a decade filled with countless movies centered on super-human heroes that are sub-par, it's nice to see one that's well made. In comparison to others this year, I would put this above Dr. Strange, Civil War, Suicide Squad and Startrek but below Deadpool.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Good Star Wars film!,"Star Wars Rogue One is a prequel to A New Hope. The plot revolves around Jyn Erso, the daughter of scientist Galen Erso, who is forcefully hired by the Empire to develop the Death Star. Galen was working for the Empire before and decided to hide with his family, but he knew eventually they would find him, so he prepared a contingency plan to have Jyn free. Jyn eventually meets the rebels and realising they are not so united as they seem, she seizes this one opportunity to get her hands in the plans of the Death Star on her own, which results in the name of her team: Rogue One.I can't say more without lots of spoilers. This film is similar to the prequels in the sense that we know more or less how it will end. And probably that is precisely what many people think is wrong with it. But I don't see a problem because I didn't watch the film for its conclusion, I was interested in what was Jyn all about. And I was pleasantly surprised: Jyn's story is an original one, not the same old boring Star Wars receipt of ""silly stormtroopers vs typical hero friends"" kind of story. It can sound cheesy, but it is about.. hope. Disney will make sure you know it: they say several times the rebellion exists because of hope, and yet they really delivered the message in this film.I will try to explain: Jyn finds herself in a really oppressive regime. Here we don't see much in the sense of comic relief moments and outrageous luck. Here we watch how creepy the imperial army can be, parading with a tank to intimidate people, enforcing ""law and order"" and how rebels can be easily put in the position of terrorists. Of course most of these messages are not tossed at your face, but they are implied.Rogue One is different because it is a sad story. Don't expect happy endings. If you are a great fan of the original Star Wars, you are in for a treat: here you will see what princess Leia means by ""this is our most desperate hour"", and you will understand how Darth Vader knows she carries indeed the plans to the Death Star and has to dodge bureaucracy to have her arrested her crew killed. You will understand why the Death Star has such convenient weaknesses and you will see the last of Senator Bail Organa. All of that respecting some Star Wars cannon most people don't even know.I must also point out the fact that some characters are brought back to life with CGI, most notably Grand Moff Tarkin (this is hardly a spoiler since he appears early in the film). It looks somewhat fake though, I guess the jaw doesn't move as it should, or perhaps the skin around the lips is not convincing enough. Maybe we still don't have technology for that, but I respect their effort. Apart from this weird impression, it was otherwise very well done. When Tarkin walks about and is not speaking, it looks like Peter Cushing is alive and well. Even his voice is convincing.All that said, I don't understand why people are so annoyed about recreating the original Star Wars universe. Some people say that liking these films is like clinging to the past and refusing to change, to move forward, to create new stuff. But hey, what's so bad in reliving the old Star Wars experience? If you don't want to, feel free to not watch the films and carry on. Sure, some things in life are meant to change and move forward, but this is cinema, don't take it too seriously. Also, character reconstruction like Grand Moff Tarkin to me seems like a very new initiative. That's called experimenting. I see no problems in attempting some new tricks with good old stories and watch the results. So, it is an old-fashioned look at Star Wars? Yes, I suppose. Is it a new approach? Yes, I think it is also a new approach. The story is good, give it a look.About the other characters.. admittedly there's isn't much there I suppose. Probably because there isn't enough time. But Jyn is the focus of that story (all others serve the purpose of giving her a team), and I think her story is well done, so I'm happy with it. I am giving this film an 8 out of 10, because it lacks some character development and the CGI is not mature enough for a 10. I'd risk saying this is probably the best Star Wars after Empire. Fascinating.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A lack of meaningful characterization drags this film down,"""Rogue One"" is a simple movie: A group of rebels have to fight against the Empire, and steal the Death Star plans in order to deliver a fatal blow to Vader's evil regime. You've heard about this in ""A New Hope,"" and in ""Rogue One,"" you get to see the group of rebels responsible for pulling off this daring act. But is it actually worth watching?""Rogue One"" in an interesting flick. The first hour of the film is relentlessly mediocre and forgettable, filled with practically zero interesting scenes except for one or two cool action sequences. The character building, except for Donnie Yen's character, is practically nonexistent, with almost zero substance being given to our main protagonist Jyn Erso, played by Felicity Jones. Truth be told, all of the characters in this movie are not very well fleshed out, and are pretty boring to watch, except for K-2SO, who is absolutely hilarious and entertaining every time he is on screen.That said, the movie moves along at a steady pace for its first hour, mostly because of how gorgeous it is to look at. The special effects are top notch, and are stunning to see. The movie looks so immaculate that you can almost forgive the boring first hour... almost.When the second hour comes into play, ""Rogue One"" picks up exponentially. The last act of the film is full of explosive action and riveting set pieces. ""Rogue One"" has been described as a war film set in space, and that's what it feels like. People engaged in combat play dirty and use guerilla tactics, and the violence feels more real than you'd expect in a science fiction film. The movie has a dark edge to it that sets it apart from other films in this franchise. However, because of the lack of meaningful characterization, I found it hard to care about what was happening, because frankly, I didn't care about any of the characters.Also, the movie ends with a very obvious scene of fan service, but it's fantastic fan service. The final few minutes of this movie are truly jaw dropping, and contain a scene so intense that you'll find yourself overwhelmed. I applaud them for including this scene in the film, but I couldn't help but feel like it was tacked on, as the film ends shortly after, and rather abruptly. However, the movie does end on a remarkably high note, which is always a plus.""Rogue One"" is a good Star Wars film, but it isn't great. It has a disappointing lack of characterization, and as such, is not very engaging throughout. However, if you want to see a cool action film set in the Star Wars universe, you can't go wrong with this.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Not so much of The Force Awakens, but at least that one felt a little bit more like the originals. Rogue One is good for the Star Wars fans who want to watch one more movie, and whatever it is, if it's under the Star Wars name, will do.

It lacked the magic that Star Wars used to have when George Lucas was making the films (the 1st 3 releases; before the singing teddy bears and the politically correct nonsense).

Decent effort,"Quite how ""The Force Awakens"" can poll 8.1 while this only achieves 7.9 is beyond me. I'd award Episode VII at best 6/10. This one is significantly better - perhaps on a par with Episodes II and III - weaker than the original trilogy though.So what did it get right, and what did it get wrong? Well, the original movies succeeded so well because there were only a small band of characters to get to know - e.g. in the first film: Hans, Luke, Leia and Ben. This one introduces so many characters it's hard to know who's going to be important - then even when we work out who the main characters are, the interplay between them leaves a lot to be desired - there simply isn't enough TIME for them to properly build the characters and their relationships - everything feels a little rushed.Because of the nature of the plot, it's considerably darker than any of the other SW movies - there's very little for kids. It feels a bit like the later Harry Potter movies did - same material, but a more serious and sometimes disturbing presentation. Definitely more Terminator than Wizard of Oz.The cinematography and soundtrack are excellent - it doesn't come across as a SFX showpiece - everything feels just right - in this respect it is by far the highest quality SW movie to date.If you're a SW fan, you'll really enjoy this movie - it's almost good enough to make you forget how bad the last one was. Just not perfect. Next time, please can we focus more on a small group of characters and their interactions please!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The one Star Wars film I really like,"Dark. Bold. Divergence from the usual, and appreciated.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Good, even very good....but not great","This is definitely a very spectacular movie, some scenes are breathtaking, the photography and special effects are superb. I liked the dark atmosphere, slightly different from the typical StarWars one, You can find all along the movie several references to other cult movies of the past, on top of some nice cameos from the previous StarWars: Apocalypse Now, Blade Runner to mention only a few. Yet, the movie has some downs, the action gets somewhat confused at times and some scenes are definitely overlong (especially the final battle...).

Well its says Star Wars in the title.........,"*****Spoiler Alert..........First Rogue One is a good movie....... but is it really part of the Stars Wars franchise? Well its says Star Wars in the title.........In short the first 30 minutes of the movie is really slow and had little to do with the Star Wars, the next hour is a little better and the last 20 minutes, the movie kinda of remembered it was a Star Wars movie and it was great through to the end.The comedy elements are there with a good performance from Donnie Yen and K-2SO was funny. The scene with Darth Vader at the end of the movie was great.As I say Rogue One IS a good movie ...... but a classic Star Wars movie - it is not",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A triumphant prequel worthy of the Star Wars name,"The hype has once again awakened with the next Star Wars film in Disney's latest entry. Rogue One, the backstory of how a brave group of rebels transmitted the evil Empire's Death Star plans aboard the rebel ship in what we know from the opening of Star Wars (aka Episode IV). I want to start off by saying I really enjoyed Episode VII last year, I thought it was a good spring board for Disney to find their footing in reinvigorating this franchise that was considered dead by the majority of fans. I can understand why they wanted it to feel similar beat wise to Episode 4. To really introduce us to that familiarity of Star Wars we remember. One of my biggest problems however with the film was knowing that the First Order, will never be like the Empire, Kylo Ren will never be like Darth Vader. It just didn't give me that feeling of a new threat, but rather a less interesting impersonator. My first positive about Rogue One is that there's a sense of warmth and familiarity seeing the original Empire again with their variations of armor like the classic white, or the scout troopers from Endor. Whether you enjoy this movie or not, you gotta give props to the people who designed the sets, the costumes, and whoever cast the old characters from the original trilogy because wow. All these factors felt like it just never left the 80's and it makes the world feel timeless and authentic, Garreth Edwards already gets a gold star for doing that. The performances are another strong point, the obvious standouts were Donnie Yen as Imwe along with his partner and Alan Tudyk as K2SO( holy cow was he fun to watch). However I have to say both the film's leads I feel like aren't getting enough positive feedback, Felicity Jones plays a relatable scoundrel in Jynn Erso who understandably has depth with the amount of weight on her shoulders. I don't want to spoil it here but it just goes to show how Disney isn't just giving us perfect female characters with no strings attached, Jynn has a lot of blood on her hands and understandably so. Diego Luna as Cassian Andor was a surprise for me because he brought an interesting spin on someone you expect to be this daring hero of the rebel alliance. There's a moment in the film that genuinely made me question if the rebels were always in the right, the Empire ruined the lives of many people and this movie did a good job of showing how much the alliance was willing to put on the line no matter what it took. It gave me a sense of truth that maybe these guys weren't always perfect and that they made decisions they weren't always proud of, especially through a character like Andor. My last major positive of the movie was indeed as everyone is saying, the third act. It puts the War in Star Wars and contains some of the best action in the series to date. It's explosive, it's exciting, it feels urgent even though you know what's going to happen. And the finale is just so well done it's almost alone worth the price of admission. Now unfortunately as the movie has a lot of good, the film is flawed but then again so is the original Trilogy no movie is without sin. The absence of John Williams is really noticeable here and I can tell Michael Giachino tried his best emulating the Williams sounds and beats, but it most of the time just lost it's way and didn't provide any really unique pieces like Episode VII did. The film's plot got a little muddy in the beginning because I was really lost in the first act with all the character introductions. We jumped from one planet to the next in a guardians of the galaxy like montage with a small title telling us what planet it was. This was just super distracting to me because not only was it moving too fast for the first act build up, the montage just didn't feel Star Wars like at all. They already got rid of the opening crawl and just gave us the opening title which was fine, but there was something off by introducing the planets through subtitles that seemed unfitting for me. Like ""Yavin 4, headquarters of the Rebel Alliance."" Like really? How could someone not know what that is if they've seen episode 4? Anyway, so where does this movie stand for me compared to the others? Well I would say it's fantastic and enjoyable enough to be in my top 3, better then 1-3, and I will say I liked it better than 6-7, but not better than 4-5. I think the hype might be getting to much to people, I'm looking at you Kevin Smith. Overall though Rogue One was one hell of a ride and the important thing is I felt the Star Wars, it had this emotional punch that made me want to go right back in and see it again the third act was unfreaking believable. Even with the absence of a Jedi hero, the Force was strong with this one. It just goes to show me Disney is continuing to give the fan base the good stuff, hopefully this movie will open doors for them to explore more characters and potential stories that go beyond the Skywalker family because it's such a magical world that always sucks you in no matter what movie it is. It's not a perfect movie, but it deserves that 10/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Prequel In Disguise,"At first glance Rogue One looks the part. However the great cinematography, interesting locations, and classic Star Wars aesthetic are merely a veneer, a carefully crafted charade that hide the superficiality underneath.The film is not devoid of value. The action sequences are good and certain elements of the story are interesting.Possibly its best but least explored dynamic is the class divisions within the Rebellion itself. At the top are upper-class elites who are timid about getting their hands dirty and on the other side are hardened extremists like Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker) who is an inverted Darth Vader, kept alive by a mechanical apparatus.However, despite a few genuinely fun moments, the film does not stand up to hard scrutiny upon second viewing, nor does it actually add anything of significance to the franchise.The dialogue is clunky and repetitive.The characters are two dimensional and none are really given enough time to develop.The plot is generic and doesn't take any stylistic risks, sticking to a very familiar Star Wars structure.The pacing is too fast, constantly moving from location to location.The music lacks the subtlety, sophistication, and acoustic quality, of A New Hope's.The cameos are buoyed by unconvincing performances that, for a film so obsessed with banking on nostalgia, should have looked and sounded exactly as they do in the following film.Rogue One could have been an interesting experiment into fusing different genres into the Star Wars franchise, but it ended up as a generic filler film that fills a gap in the narrative no one needed to have filled.As a mindless action film that puts you in the space of the Star Wars Universe it's effective, but as a story that adds any value to the Star Wars lore it isn't.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Loved it!!,"Non spoiler Rogue One review: I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Rogue One. It's simply amazing movie. Battle scenes are most amazing battle scenes in any STAR WARS movie, because you feel for characters and even for soldiers you don't even know. Characters are very unique and lovable, also, not every character is good or bad, characters have their flaws, and they are not perfect, and that's what it's so amazing about them. Last 10-15 minutes are my favorite minutes of STAR WARS movies, space battle is best space battle in any STAR WARS movie, and Vader is simply amazing. I couldn't even dream to see what he did in last 5 minutes, even he has only 5 minutes of screen time, You won't be disappointed by Vader. Score is not so great, and especially one character feels weird to look at (You will know why) but after all, after first viewing yesterday, For me it is better than The Force Awakens, because they gave us something new, and they are not afraid to risk, while TFA played on nostalgic a lot, even I liked it a lot. There are some cameos I loved, some Rebels vehicles and characters appear or they are at least mentioned, humor is great for the most part, and nothing felt forced. You can literally watch Rogue one, skip A new hope opening crawl, and watch A new hope, cause it ties perfectly together. I would give Rogue One 9/10.

Finale can't redeem underwhelming buildup,"The creative team goes ""Rogue"" during 2 acts of Rogue One. If you think that pun was bad, wait until you see the film.Those 2 acts move along with the bare minimum of character and story development which results in the audience wondering if there were re-shoots for the entire film, not just the finale. In particular, Forest Whitaker's appearance as Saw Gerrera feels completely unnecessary and underwritten, as do most of the characters. I found these 2 acts lacking in energy and momentum overall.Felicity Jones puts in a fine effort as Jyn Erso, but is let down by the disjointed and cluttered screenplay which seems more interested in globetrotting than establishing a much needed rapport between the main crew.The 3rd act is, admittedly, a rousing action piece that gives a jolt of life to the film. Unfortunately, it is not enough to erase the forgettable buildup that preceded it.In the world of Star Wars, I wouldn't hesitate to place Rogue One at the bottom of the pack. The majority of the film is as jarring as it's computer-generated characters.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Great idea, but feels a bit boring","A team of scoundrels from across the galaxy team up to do some good. Great setup, interesting charaters, and incredible visuals. Still, this movie comes off a bit bland. Having seen it, I didn't find it nearly as memorable as any of the other movies in the Star Wars franchise. It's just a fun one-time watch, and something I don't think I will try to see again, or buy on bluray, despite owning the entire Star Wars franchise on it. It's fine. Just a little sideline story that should have come out much sooner for it to be relevant. If you like Star Wars, watch it.

"""Pure Star Wars Magic""","Just when you thought Episode IV was always the right film to start if you wanna properly feel the Star Wars experience. Rogue One draws you in with something new, dark, epic and fulfilling, that truly makes the 3 paragraphs in the opening crawl of Episode IV feel like a film we should've seen first.The film soars in it being appropriately being titled ""A Star Wars Story"". Although some might see that the ""Star Wars"" franchise name it carries will obviously hold the film back and limit it to just setting up for sequels and pausing moments for nostalgia. The film does this naturally and it does not hold back at all with a tone that differs from the usual hopeful text book heroes' journey space opera of the previous films in the franchise. It does not need to set up for an even greater sequel because it merely needs to set up an already beloved franchise that has already had its high and low points. The film also doesn't stop to boast a nostalgic reference, they're there with subtle hints, nods and blends in with the over arching story. Simple nods like showing familiar faces appearing by having them blend in the crowd or be part of the rebel fleet, people playing Dejarik, and even fixing plot holes that have haunted the franchise for years. The film also does even better what ""Force Awakens"" did best, which was the introduction of the new characters, but what Rogue One does special was to not have the sequel do its job for them which is to develop each individual in the same movie. (because obviously the sequel already exists). Jyn Erso played by Felicity Jones works perfectly well in a film that aims for a darker tone and with her story directly contrasting Luke's humble beginnings of eventual greatness. Along with Cassian played by Diego Luna, Chirrut (Donnie Yen), Baze (Wen Jiang), Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker) and Bodhi (Riz Ahmed), they bring a whole new perspective and layer to the rebel alliance which we previously just usually saw from the eyes of our protagonists like Luke, Leia, and Hans. The film does a great job capturing themes of extremism, internal struggle within the alliance and how under powered they felt during the creation of the Death Star. They also capture a whole lot more context with what goes on within the Empire with Orson Krennic, Ben Mendhelson's character. Starting off as sort of a ""Hans Landa"" esque type of villain, his character highlights the flaws of the Empire and their eventual downfall. Also who could forget K-2SO voiced by Alan Tudyk who carries the comic relief and probably the best jokes along with Donnie Yen's character. But probably one of the strongest part about the film is how much it strayed away from usual Star Wars clichés and generating a feel like no other. Sure, probably the biggest flaw of this film is the first few parts which starts off slow and sort of inorganically introduces and sets up each character, but as the film progresses, it evolves the characters through emotional and dramatic moments delivered astoundingly by its lead actors. Every time the film delivers a climax, they are filled with strong emotions that were properly set up and developed before hand and this pays off incredibly well in the last 15 minutes of the film (more on that later). The cinematography and scale this film delivers is also off the charts and is probably THE strongest part of the film if not the latter. Gareth Edwards who also directed Godzilla (2014), is an absolute genius in creating massive set pieces and making your jaw drop in each establishing shot. Each shot drips of the epicness Star Wars created a legacy on, each shot feels like a film that definitely comes before a 1977 film, each shot has subtle nuances that make it even richer in detail. Along with the beautiful cinematography also came the fluid action scenes that were well paced and directed. The last 15 minutes of this film will absolutely leave you in awe, bring you to the edge of your seat and even make you cry because of euphoria. Gareth Edwards absolutely needs to direct every action scene, whether in space, on the ground or hand to hand combat, his style is what Star Wars needs to elevate their game.In the end, the pay offs that this film will give you both as a Star Wars fan or even a casual fan are complete pure movie magic. Having not been born during the original trilogy or experiencing them in the theaters in the 70s-80s, I think this film is the closest I can have to having that inexplicable feeling of joy, wonder, excitement and refreshment this franchise has YET to offer.Verdict: 9.7/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Entertainment for a bored afternoon, lacks depth and imagination","Entertaining, but ultimately retains the patterns seen in the previous movie. The lack of imagination of these new SW's movie is unbelievable. I can't overstate how tired I'm of people saying what a SW experience ought to be, that the fans will be pleased, which is just utter rubbish. I shan't waste my energy saying what others have already pointed, such as the fact that SW has become a juvenile franchise - the reason thereof is of no importance to evaluating the movie itself, so I don't care - other than pointing the pathetic portrait of the Empire, or of the Dark Side, really.The greatest feat of this movie is to show how plenty of resources and direction of the movie itself can be used to get the worst, or just plain mediocrity, of the actors. No acting can be complimented; nothing is impressive or new. The plot is as dull as it can be.G. Lucas is no Tolkien, let's be honest, but we all tended to forgive incoherencies and the sheer incompleteness and apparent laziness of the wonderful universe he brought to life. It holds still great potential. There's no sign that Disney will explore it. If anything can be said at all, is that one has to learn how be detached, lest one will be disappointed with such insulting pieces of garbage.I heard some chatter before watching, such as one about the diversity of the cast, but I couldn't care less about that, it's 2017, this is getting old, who cares; I guess Disney should be more concerned with the making of actual good movies rather than ""shocking"" people.I gave it a 5, because it provided decent entertainment. It's probably a fair, if harsh, a rating. With its pockets full, hopefully Disney will gradually make less horrid SW movies each time, this one is better than Force Awakens.

Not quite a Star Wars great but Rogue One is still mightily impressive,"Bold and brave, just like the set of characters the film follows, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is a Star Wars film but not as we know it. Set just before 1977's A New Hope, this doesn't continue the saga, instead going back to show a pivotal moment in the Rebel Alliance's fight against the Empire.Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) is a criminal and daughter of Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen), a weapons designer forced by the Empire to complete their super-weapon, the Death Star, a weapon rumoured to be capable of destroying entire planets in one strike.With the Empire having such a powerful weapon at their disposal, the Rebel Alliance recruits Jyn to work with a team, led by Cassian Andor (Diego Luna), to infiltrate the enemy and steal the design schematics for the Death Star, to aid them in taking down the Empire.Yes, this is a Star Wars film but that doesn't stop it from being a massive risk. Rogue One has the challenge of being set so close to the fantastic original however, Gareth Edwards does a great job in delivering a film that pays homage to events in the original trilogy while stamping its own fingerprint on the franchise.This is a war film within the Star Wars franchise and Edwards certainly makes it certainly look and feel like one. The production design is full of dirt and grit, totally missing from the prequel trilogy, and there is some quite wonderful cinematography from Greig Fraser, honing in on the close proximity of war all while still managing to make this feel like a Star Wars film. Like The Force Awakens last year, Rogue One possesses some magnificent shots that I won't be forgetting anytime soon.The combination of both of these with the special effects certainly make Rogue One such a visual treat. There were two uses of CGI that I absolutely hated and they really did distract me from what was happening in the film, one character getting a lot more screen time than I thought they should have had and the other almost looking as if no work had gone into their appearance.The writing in Rogue One, in terms of story, allows the film to move at such a brisk pace, leading to an enjoyable experience at the cinema. There are plenty of references to other Star Wars films and it all concludes with a final act that you just have to sit back and applaud. If you have trouble seeing Rogue One as a Star Wars film, this final act will persuade you to change your mind.I found the the characters to be the one thing that really held this film back from being a great Star Wars film. Jyn is just about the only one who gets any element of character development, meaning it's tough to really root for them all. There is a severe lack of characters for people to fall in love with, unlike the best of the Star Wars films. There is one returning character in Darth Vader, who I was particularly excited to see on the big screen again, and believe me when I say, there is a Vader moment that will make you lose your s**t. It's just amazing.Coming to the performances, Rogue One definitely possesses one of the greatest casts ever assembled for a Star Wars film. Felicity Jones truly brings a lot of steel to her good performances as Jyn Erso, Alan Tudyk steals a lot of scenes with his often comedic performance as K-2SO, a reprogrammed Imperial droid, and Donnie Yen finally gets his chance to shine in a major American blockbuster, taking it with plenty of style too as Chirrut Imwe, a blind warrior.The other disappointing aspect of Rogue One is it's score, this time composed by Michael Giacchino. John Williams' scores bring a certain kind of magic to the Star Wars films but I just didn't feel that same sense of magic with Giacchino's score here. Disappointing for me when I know Giacchino is such a capable composer.As a whole, Rogue One is a risk well worth taking for the Star Wars franchise, opting to attempt and deliver a distinctly separate film from the rest of the franchise. It has a few issues holding it back from being great but I will certainly be heading back for repeat viewings.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
How They Brought The News From Aix To Ghent or Better Call Saw,"Star War buffs should be aware that this story of how the plans for the Death Star were put in the hands of the Rebel Alliance, stars Felicity Jones as the scrappy young heroine, with the usual pair of young men chastely lusting for her. It's nicely done and I started ticking off the stolen shots, from All Quiet on the Western Front to Hiroshima, Mon Amour that should please all us people who are so proud of having seen so many Great Movies (and many more crap ones). With Allen Tudyk as Marvin the Robot and Forest Whitaker as Nathan Bedford Amin, one can only admire the facility with which they plaster Peter Cushing's face on a living actor and duplicate his voice.However, what made this more than another interesting technological artifact detailing the doom of real actors (and, indeed, of SW canon, as I spotted a vehicle with WHEELS!) is the battle that makes up the second half of the picture. After the people in charge of the army decide not to go after the plans, a small group of people volunteer to steal a ship with Miss Jones, just going in and inevitably drawing the hotter-headed members of the Alliance as a small chance opens up. And since it is a very small chance and since no battle plan survives contact with the enemy, what happens when you're doing an Indiana Jones and making it up as you go along? The most messed up battle sequences since the opening of Saving Private Ryan.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best Star Wars films since the 80's borrowing heavily from Miyazaki,"I was awed, spellbound, moved and impressed. This movie did what none of the other recent Star Wars films have done. It was one of the best told stories in film that I have seen in a long time, but it also just happens to fit in the Star Wars universe. Like the Force Awakens I felt like it borrowed heavily from Miyazaki films (growth of a young female scavenger discarded by society and forced to live in a world of war that is beyond her power, epic worlds and beautiful visuals, heavy thematics with a focus on environmental impact). And the pace of the story increases and accelerates to a perfect crescendo and ending. I loved every minute of it.I will say I did miss the crawl during the credits but that's really a small quip. But what I didn't miss were the clever winks and nods to fans of the newest Star Wars films. The plot is very dire and grim at times and it doesn't hold back from being emotionally heavy. The action sequences were gripping and the characters were morally ambiguous at first. I thought all of it was very well polished and the final third was breathtaking.

Almost......,"Excellent but not quite. Tonally a very different film to what you may expect but part of the Star Wars universe for sure and different in its look and feel. Although it beautifully shot and acted my issue with it is not an an issue with the film, its the fact that its prequel to one of my favorite films. So throughout the movie your waiting for those familiar moments to connect it to the start of Episode 4 and don't get me wrong this does deliver. However its all a bit anti climatic, did I really care about all the cliff hanger moments leading up to the start of episode 4? ...Well no actually I didn't care for them at all because I knew they would succeed in their mission and their ultimate fate either way didn't bother me...and that ultimately bothers me. I should care about the characters, I want to care about the characters. Thererfore for me it wasn't really a story worth telling. Its a geeks dream with lots of little easter eggs all over the place. Overall it was like a trivia movie that answers questions that I didn't ask e.g. Did you know who invented the death star and have you ever wondered what their story was? Did/do you want to know and do/did you care ? If you did or do then this film is amazing and tells it in a brilliant way. Its a disjointed film, dark for a majority of its run time but then constrained too not fully unleashing in the way that it could have done - they should have been a bit more braver and gone darker.

It's not a problem if you don't look up,"There's two kinds of Star Wars fans in this world: Those who think that Rogue One is easily the best Disney Star Wars film so far, and those who are wrong.Okay, I'll try to get off my high horse for the rest of the review.Rogue One, to me, is the perfect example of giving fans what they expect in a Star Wars movie, while simultaneously putting a new take on the franchise. Here we see characters who are jaded and war weary. Characters who believe in the ends justifying the means. Rogue One did for Star Wars what Deep Space 9 did for Star Trek. While some will criticise the film for this I personally think it was necessary to allow for the continued evolution of the series.Nobody wants to see new Star Wars films be nothing but a hollow rehash of previous films in the series (Hello Force Awakens). Nor do we want to see a Star Wars film completely destroy what came before it in a nonsensical and childish way (hello The Last Jedi). Rogue One skillfully skirts between these two traps and shows Disney exactly where the franchise should be headed.Ultimately Rogue One gives us enough familiarity to keep us in the Star Wars universe, while simultaneously giving us a reason to watch new films in the series.

He seriously had less screen time than the Joker did in Suicide Squad.Disney knew exactly what they were doing when they bought the Star Wars franchise from George Lucas. It's only about the money. Sadly, we are only getting more of these films, every year for at least the next 4 years.Sure, this is a big screen, big sound, movie, and if you only go to the movies for these types of films, then you should go see it.

'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story' Is an Arresting New Chapter for Fans and Newcomers to Relish,"The ""Star Wars"" universe is a world of endless possibilities about what stories you can explore, with an unprecedented amount of quality thematic elements that can be examined. With ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,"" Lucas Films and Walt Disney Pictures have started the analyzing elements of looking at different ways to tell the stories of some of our most beloved characters, while introducing new ones. Gareth Edwards' firm direction, in partnership with Greig Fraser's stunning cinematography, makes for a lavish and intense new chapter in the ""Star Wars"" mythology.The first of the Star Wars standalone films, ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" tells the story of a group of unlikely heroes that band together on a mission to steal the plans to the Death Star, the Empire's ultimate weapon of destruction.Boasting an impressive cast that is led by Academy Award nominee Felicity Jones, it is one of the film's best attributes. Diversity in film has been called upon by every corner of the cinematic community and ""Star Wars,"" Lucas Films, and Walt Disney do not get enough credit in being of the first to fully embrace this notion into its most profitable franchise. As Jyn Erso, Jones leads with intensity, delivering a near heartbreaking interpretation of the most unlikely hero.Of the players, the fanboys of the universe will scream the names of Chirru Imwe, played exquisitely by Donnie Yen, or K-2SO, played with spunk by Alan Tudyk. You'll have your fill with Cassian Andor (Diego Luna), whose stern presence isn't always a standout, but Bodhi Rook (played by Riz Ahmed) seems like a spirit animal of Poe from ""The Force Awakens.""Villains here have no shortage of complexities, as Ben Mendelsohn's Orson Krennic is sensational, given alongside some other ""amazing"" surprises. I'll leave them for you to experience yourself.Technically speaking, this is one of the franchise's most vivacious productions. The aforementioned Greig Fraser delivers grit and action in his abilities to capture them with the lens. John Gilroy, Colin Goudie and Jabez Olssen cut the film to an impeccable action- adventure that stands toe-to-toe with anything delivered in 2016.Having big shoes to fill in John Williams' illustrious classic score, Michael Giacchino rises to the occasion and then some with his compositions. It's one of the year's best works. Doug Chiang and Neil Lamont's production design opens the doors to a new world that doesn't feel too familiar or too standard for the average fan.""Star Wars"" is only as good as its story and script. Chris Weitz, Tony Gilroy, John Knoll and Gary Whitta lay the foundation down for an alluring tale. On paper, hearing about how the rebels acquire the Death Star plans is not particularly compelling cinema that we are running to see, but this group accepts the challenge. With the exception of some shoehorned entries of new and classic characters, ""Rogue One"" finds its balance in presenting this world to an avid die-hard fan and a casual movie-goer that is walking into this universe for the very first time.Early reports of a ""darker"" and ""more gritty"" film have been around for months. We definitely have that here, but the insert of comedic beats often feel inserted so the audience can feel some joy in this tragic tale. It's safe to say that we are more than prepared for a devastation story that wrecks the minds of viewers everywhere – perhaps with ""Episode VIII?""Here is the main takeaway: this film has perhaps the best Darth Vader scene in franchise history. Let's talk about it in the comments after you see it.""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" successfully achieves everything it sets out to do. Action-packed and glorious in its engaging and oftentimes exotic dimensions of storytelling, it is absolutely stirring. Fans will be overjoyed and it becomes another classic chapter that we will be able to revisit in a weekend-long marathon somewhere in a galaxy far, far away.GRADE: (★★★½)",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I watched it 3 times on all possible screens at the theater.,"I am 42 and a normal sci-fi loving fan. Not the comic-con or anal retentive prick (i.e. comic book guy) who loves Star Wars and has never had much issue with any of them and loved Empire of the first 3 releases.This is a truly inspired film that (FOR ONCE) was made for the fans (by what I assume are fans) and some very fresh thinking on the telling of the story. Me...bored on Saturday morning went to Matinée and it was packed. I had no idea this even came out (shows how nerdy I am). I sort of remembered the last movie as being wicked fun at the box office but only OK back at home on 2nd viewing.This had me so confused until the end but in doing so I was hinged on every moment trying to wrap my head around it all. Then as the end ""happens to unfold in rapid succession"" I literally broke out in tears!!! I was simply astounded by the gripping nature of the action (similar to Edge of Tomorrow) and depth of the story development. It had something that TROUNCED my sci-fi mind and all I can say is that someday an AI will be examining all things related to MAN and MACHINE. The AI will know I cried once at the death* of a machine.All I know is that I am so often let down by paying to go the theater I hardly ever go. This is one stop I will never regret making and have now gone back to see it on IMAX 3D twice.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A good way to make Vader mad! An okay prequel that sets up ""A New Hope"" just fine!","Being a ""Star Wars"" fan I had to check out this new film called ""Rogue One"" and though nothing great still it entertains and fits into the saga just fine as it leads everything into episode 4 just fine. Set just after episode 3 and just before the happenings of ""A New Hope"", this chapter centers around the rebel alliance and a risk type of a move to steal the ""Death Star"". It kind of involves ordinary and common people, combined with warriors and of course rebels and rogues who come together to work as a team! It's all speared by Jyn(Felicity Jones)along with guidance from flight fighter Cassian Andor(Diego Luna)and droid K-2So. Along the way plenty of battles are fought with gunfire and skill. Yet behind it all is a plan and plot to help the rebels overtake the ""Death Star"" from the evil empire, overall pretty simple story that entertains and reveals a path and gateway to launch the other chapters of the saga, plus the appearance from ""Lord Vader"" was a presence shattering feel of doom and command for any viewer.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not enough words to describe,"It is difficult to write a review for Rogue One because I could talk about it for hours. So, summarised:Firstly, this is as Star Wars as it gets besides the original trilogy. It compliments the original trilogy in all the right ways that it needs to.Secondly, the visual effects are absolutely amazing, watching it on a high quality system, and when it came out in the cinema, the immersion is unrivalled.The Immersion is massively complimented by the music. The soundtrack by Michael Giacchino is immaculate, and in my opinion, one of the best film soundtracks of all time.The plot is dark for a Star Wars Film. But the deeper roots of the plot only serve to compliment it. Excellent cast, fantastic flow with no obvious plot holes unlike the prequels, and I strongly believe it would work as a stand alone film too, which is a very admirable quality to have.When I first watched Rogue One I hated it, so I thouroughly recommend watching it a couple of times over before forming an opinion. Very very highly recommend this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Probably the worst star wars movie ever,"Star wars has always been something fans look into, a fantasy world which set the standard for the genre back in the day. The first 3 movies set the stage to a series which was often viewed by keen followers of all ages. But this movie is a disgrace, its nothing but a cash cow for the Disney to pound on since the die hard fans will watch as along as it says star wars. The last three movies weren't the great, but still watchable. But this one is almost like a B grade Vietnam war movie. The director lacks the imagination at least of the anime series ""star wars Rebels"" and certainly not the creativity of the earlier movies. The star wars universe provide so much imagination and characters and star systems but the viewers are forced to watch a all human cast saving the day. It seems Lucas was right about the white slave masters. How ever in this case it is the fans that have been abused. The force does not exist with this one.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Spin-Off Done Right,"Rouge One could have been a by-the-numbers spinoff that did just enough in order to make millions, as most spinoffs are these days. However, thankfully, the film is instead a powerful and interesting look into the grittier 'war' side of Star Wars that represents well how terrifying the empire can be when you're just a normal individual instead of a force-wielding hero. It works perfectly as a standalone and thankfully will not ever be diminished by direct sequels.

The Odd One,"Although I would rate this episode very high in terms of visual effects, cinematography and production value, however, it was difficult for me to place the story on the time-line of the Star Wars series. As we were given to understand that it's a prequel to 2015 release ""The Force Awakens"" – I was expecting something like the background of characters like Rey – or a story that would extend into the near past of episode VII. However, the plot is completely disconnected with the latest episode and there is an entirely new set of characters whose relation with the existing set of characters, as we know in the Star Wars saga, is at best unclear and vague.If you are a fan of science fiction movies and love to watch fancy space ships, humanoids, droids, friendly alien species, interplanetary warfare, then you must watch this movie.However, as a Star Wars fan, you will find absolutely nothing that would qualify as any meaningful addition to the original tale. Nor there is anything you could expect to see in any subsequent episodes.After enchanting us with The Force Awakens, Disney has given us Rogue One as a filler, perhaps with a message: ""Hey, we're working very hard on the real one – The Last Jedi – till then, here's a Star Wars story you might like""",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

This is how you make a prequel,"This film had the advantage of us as the audience having no attachment with the main characters. This allows the story tellers to create past and present lore that doesn't interfere with what we already knew.Rogue One beautifully weaves in and out of the pretellings of A New Hope without forcing jigsaw pieces in to places where it doesn't quite fit properly.The first part of the film is a little slow but builds up to the final 2 acts which are filled with excitement, adventure and emotion.As a fan, this film is in my top 3 (maybe joint).My only frustration, is why nobody from Disney learned anything as to why this film was a success when making all future developments. As of 2022, the only production close to ""doing it right"" is Mandalorian.If you haven't seen this film but love the originals, stop what you are doing and watch it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Great ground battle footage. It felt believable. I didn't like most characters at the beginning but by the end found myself mourning along side them.

In fact, if they could erase the other 4 star wars movie and just leave this one and the original 3 and that would be perfect. Rogue One is a great movie, no doubt about it. The only thing I didn't really like is the choice to use Diego Luna as one of the main characters. I've never seen him before but I wasn't impressed. He seemed like a one-dimensional character throughout the whole movie and was not up to the standard of everybody else in my opinion. He just had this annoying grumpy face in every scene and weird accent which was a bit annoying and monotone.

Another Star Wars movie (yawn!) - but another Peter Cushing movie too!,"""Rogue One"" is officially a ""Star Wars Story"", which means we get many familiar elements: a rollicking (and explosion-filled) adventure in outer space, almost human androids, switches to pull, chasms to leap and weapons to destroy, and dehumanised stormtroopers to kill (the fact that stormtroopers are hidden behind protective uniforms including face masks makes them more frightening adversaries, but also removes any moral complexity associated with their annihilation). The original Star Wars movie was partially filmed in the North African desert, and a desert environment has also featured in some subsequent movies in the series; in this one, a substantial section seems more inspired by the experience of American troops attempting to police Baghdad. The film contains various other nods to previous films in the series, without recapitulating their plots as shamelessly as 'The Force Awakens' did; as an immediate prequel to the 1979 film, it also uses digital technology to resuscitate now dead actors to reprise their roles, including Peter Cushing (brilliantly) and Carrie Fischer (less successfully) - perhaps the fact that Cushing's character has aspects of the undead in the original makes it easier to bring him back to life. The ending is nicely judged in theory but marred by the failure to lift the digital Fisher out of the uncanny valley.The film features a feisty female heroine, praised by many for providing gender-balance to the previously masculine Star Wars world, but she's a bit too perfect for my liking. One of the things that made the original work for me that none of the naïve Luke, the money-grabbing Han nor the sarcastic Leia are obvious role-models. We also get one character who channels the force to become a martial-arts superhero; I much preferred the subtler demonstration of the force's power shown by Obi-Wan Kenobi in the original film (and indeed, the theme of the force is much stronger, to my reckoning, when presented as the power of self-control and focus than when it appears to confer mystical powers).'Rogue One' is considered by many to be their favourite 'Star Wars' movie since the original trilogy; for me, the shtick has grown a bit tired (I loved 'A New Hope' on release, but I was seven years old at the time!). Still, the film mercifully lacks the over-busy aesthetic (and tedious dialogue) of George Lucas's later films in favour of something closer to the mood and spirit of the original; it works as entertainment, even if I suspect this fictional universe doesn't really have much new to show us beyond what has already been done.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Terrible and so boring...,"Well this is honest review, ignore all the paid ones that you read around internet. So let's start..This movie, is uneventful and boring. I saw it in IMAX yesterday with my friends, and almost got out half way trough. There is no real story, there is nothing exciting, there is nothing funny, special effects are OK, but nothing new, it's same old, same old...What I was expecting was, exciting new characters (there were none). New plot (there is no plot, it's all spinning around original 3 movies, chewing and re-chewing same old thing). Some epic battles (not mega boring ones).The only reason why I went to see this movie is because of old glory (as majority of people probably did). This is one great example how Hollywood is recycling their old stories, over and over, and trying to milk the franchise as much as possible.All in all... Those were 2h.20 min of pure torture.

Overwhelming movie,"Saw this movie tonight on German sky pay TV, expected an fx focused / headed prequel to the 1977 movie. The old movies where focused on the story, fx was a helper, not the focus, that changed in episode 1, clone wars and the sith movies, my opinion, they just closed the story line. Rogue One is the absolute revival of the old movies and a perfect prequel to the original 1977 movie. The story is the main focus and extremely intensive like the first movie and empire strikes back which are my all time favorites, saw both at that time more than once in a Buenos Aires cinema, and I'm adicted to science fiction since then. Fx just helped the story look better. This is why I also love Star Wars Rebels hoped this series would keep longer, 4th season is last and shorter than awaited. Back to Rogue One, I am really impressed, this one makes it to my all time favorites. I would have watched this one in a 3D cinema multiple times having my tonight's experience.This one is best STAR WARS original tradition movie and this really impresses me, thought such thing would never come back on business regards, money makes the world go round, it seems Disney found a way to combine both, 1 billion gross box office 'til today (boxofficemojo.com) let me hope this tradition will become popular.Best, not less, not moreBest regardsRalf",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Perhaps A Little Too Much Spectacle,"It's difficult to look back at STAR WARS and view it critically . It's a film we've all grown up with so what anyone says here doesn't matter in the slightest . People will flock to the cinema to watch it on their millions and if nothing else it might just erase the cynical memories of the trilogy we got at the turn of the centuryTruth be told I'm indifferent to the franchise . I felt bitter disappointment in seeing the original but with THE FORCE AWAKENS the mainstream view was that the franchise just got good again . The word from the neutrals in that trying to get to basics TFA was a carbon copy of A NEW HOPE so I decided to give it a missI don't know if this has impaired my enjoyment of ROGUE ONE but it did seem fairly self contained . The Imperial Empire develops a new planet destroyer ray gun and the only thing stopping its use is that the engineer who built it is now in hiding . If nothing else it does allow a cameo from Mads Mikkleson , one of cinema's most underrated actors over the last decade and just before the title comes up we see Forest WhitakerThis gave me hope we'd be seeing a character driven film with some intense performances but then we get the curse of event movie making and the studio second guesses what the public wants and gives it to them in bucketloads and is usually the case it's high spectacle . Lots of explosions , space fights and other high powered noisy set-pieces . Too much so for my liking but to be fair I did feel I was still watching a big budget movie rather than a video game which happens too far often when I'm watching Hollywood blockbusters but I still hoped for a bit more story amongst the carnage and high body countOne thing I would have liked to have seen developed more is the throwaway line about a rebel who broke away from the alliance and is fighting his own war against The Imperial Empire . A maverick rebel using his own army to fight against the enemy ? A sort of good guy version of a fighter in the Al Nusra Front splitting from former allies and building a Jedi Knight version of ISIS theocracy ? Just think of all the potential that type of story could come up with but it's a franchise event movie involving STAR WARS .

A very nice rehash of episode iv,"So Lucas tried to update his ugly muppets and restored the original series. But it seems they needed Disney to bring the visuals up to date. So you have about the same story line. With about the same decors. Luke's planet is a desert (talking about a simplistic approach), this time it looks like Ireland. Luke is on a remote farm, farming sand as we can see. Here they are farming moss for unknown reasons. But everything is about the same, only looking better. As usual the physics are cheap comic style version, meaning if you can draw it, than this is how it happened. This way a shuttle leaving can blow anybody alive over the landing dock, but not the dead. Which makes perfect sense as the dead can't hold on one hand over the abyss.As usual, the story is not the best part of a Star Wars movie. And the dialogue is also way below the story. Which does not mean this is not better than most of the movies in the series so far. And I do appreciate the toning down of the comic character.Actually, there is nothing beyond the visuals. Probably this is an overall issue with the rigidity of Hollywood in general. An advanced civilization that can cross the universe and build these huge ships, some sort of transport cities. Yet, people battle with swords and people are in badly need of mobile phones. Well, maybe the roaming is excessive. The military strategy is a bit beyond the Napoleonic Wars, yet certainly below 1914. With laser weapons, the best Lucas' team could imagine back in 1977. As for communication, they can do cross galaxy radio, yet moving data needs some homing pigeons.Contact me with Questions, Comments or Suggestions ryitfork @ bitmail.ch",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The only star wars Disney mobie that i really enjoyed so far,"When i was watching it for first time i turned it off in half and wasn't thinking for... 3 years maybe? But when i watched it again... I was in shock how awesome was it. The concept of direct prequel for New Hope was something that no one asked, but everyone needed. I liked an idea that they left all of jedi concept out of that, so it could be something really new, different from main movies. Everyone in ""Rogue one"" squad was unique, there is a tank, blind guy etc. And the villain, oh the villain (Krennic) was amazing, the way how actor portrayed him was marvelous, you could really feel his emotions, that's why i can remember most of his lines.

"Not Bad, Actually","In the Star Wars lexicon, the new release Rogue One—not designated with an episode number but subtitled A Star Wars Story—inhabits a time roughly thirty years after the conclusion of 2005's Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, and just prior to the beginning of the original 1977 picture:In Rogue One, the oppressive Galactic Empire has designs to build a massive new spaceship called the Death Star, a craft already familiar to fans of the original picture. The Death Star will contain a weapon capable of reducing an entire planet to rubble with one single shot. But the primary architect of the Death Star escapes from the Empire's service before the weapon is functional.Sometime later, the Empire tracks down the architect and conscripts him to return and complete the weapon, leaving behind his young daughter. Years later the daughter, now an adult, is recruited by the anti-Empire Rebel Alliance to locate and enlist the services of the father in destroying the weapon, toppling the Empire, and restoring peace and liberty to the galaxy.Rogue One is a fairly impressive movie in the fantasy genre, not as good as the best entries in the Star Wars series but better than many. Actress Felicity Jones is cast in what is nominally the leading role, as Jyn Erso, the adult daughter of the Death Star architect.Jones' Jyn Erso is consistent with the Star Wars tradition of strong female leads, from Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia in the original pictures to Daisy Ridley's Rey in last year's The Force Awakens. Erso is seemingly a little more indifferent to the niceties of good versus evil, but the character's carefully-maintained ambivalence seems to inspire the audience to desire even more her eventual conversion.But Jones is only the headliner in a strong ensemble cast which includes Mads Mikkelsen from Casino Royale and television's Hannibal, the always-engaging Forest Whitaker, Ben Mendelsohn, Riz Ahmed, Donnie Yen, and Genevieve O'Reilly contributing memorable characterizations. Mexican actor Diego Luna is effectively cast in the swashbuckling role of Cassian Andor, a resourceful pilot working for the Rebel Alliance.There's very much a sense of unification about Rogue One, with appearances by a variety of characters from both previous trilogies. At least one character from the original 1977 picture reprises his role posthumously, via the not-quite-persuasive magic of computer animation.Certain of John Williams' familiar musical themes are repeated from the previous seven pictures, although the actual music score for the picture is credited to composer Michael Giacchino. Giacchino, who also scored the recent Star Trek pictures and Guardians of the Galaxy, already seems to have been so influenced by Williams that his name in the closing credits instead of Williams' is a mild surprise.Rogue One director Gareth Edwards has proved his mettle for putting legendary film characters through their paces with his work on 2014's Godzilla remake. And certainly Edwards' sure hand keeps Rogue One moving along at a pace brisk enough to almost disguise some of the more preposterous turns in the film's script, credited to Chris Weitz and Tony Gilroyalthough twenty minutes could've easily been trimmed from the picture to bring the running time to under two hours.In October of 2012, seven years after the release of Episode III: Revenge of the Sith—which Star Wars creator George Lucas assured us would be the last installment in the franchise—the entertainment world was stunned to learn that a deal had been finalized for Lucas to sell his Lucasfilm Ltd. corporation to the Walt Disney Company. As part of that transaction, the Disney organization also acquired ownership of the Star Wars series of films, released originally by the 20th Century-Fox film studio.Simultaneous to the Lucasfilm acquisition, the Disney Company announced the production of new entries in the Star Wars series, beginning in 2015 with Episode VII: The Force Awakens. The new picture would reunite most of the cast of the original three pictures, and Lucas' services would be retained by Disney as a creative consultant.The first clue that Rogue One is not a typical entry in the Star Wars canon comes in the picture's opening seconds. Although the Lucasfilm Ltd. logo appears prior to the opening shot, as well as the familiar legend ""A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away"" there is no opening stab of John Williams' iconic theme music, no words crawling from the bottom of the screen to the top explaining the story so far.But the differences between Rogue One and the earlier Star Wars pictures are not limited to the modified opening moments. Since 1977 the pictures in the series have grown progressively more somber, developing a mythology almost as complex and challenging as Tolkien's Rings novels. Last year's The Force Awakens seemingly only barely avoided an R rating, with a My Lai-style massacre at the beginning of the picture and the violent death about halfway through of one of the saga's most enduring and beloved characters.Parents conducting young children to a Rogue One screening should be warned: Even the darkness of vision revealed in The Force Awakens doesn't completely prepare the viewer for the unflinching loss of life and disturbing images in the picture. Rogue One works hard to earn its PG-13 rating: Characters we grow to like are killed on screen, and the graphically-depicted results of the Death Star weapon are more reminiscent of a nuclear holocaust than the bloodless big bang we remember from the original picture.Those who professed wonder or surprise at the 2012 sale of Star Wars to Disney shouldn't have been—George Lucas always did profess admiration for that studio's entertainment heritage.More perplexing at the present time, and especially while viewing Rogue One, is the knowledge that when the Star Wars saga began to explore its darkest and most disturbing themes and images, it did so under the Walt Disney flag of wholesome family entertainment.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Score the FORCE,"Does a Good movie need over the top hype? Does a Great movie deserve more hype? Is that how movies are to be judged now? So much hype - it's got to be good.Real world doesn't work that way boys & girls.This movie is an example. It's just another 'comic book' movie. 80% special effects, 10% plot, and the other 10% equals sleight of hand to make up for the first 90%. The good guys/girls, the bad guys, the machines, weird looking characters are all the same, always the same in SW movies. There is no innovative quality to this movie. It's ho-hum. And why is it ho-hum? Because Lucasfilm Ltd. and Disney know they will make MILLIONS, maybe billions, on anything released even close to being SW in nature.This film doesn't have to be Great, let alone Good, because the production/money people know we clones will pay to see anything SW related. Love that IMAX 3D don't we!I personally have always loved the SW music, but this movie even blew that. For the first time I can honestly say the score was too much. During the showing I caught on real quick to the fact the musical score wasn't complementing the action, the music was trying to LEAD the action and those scenes really fell flat. After a while, a musical pattern developed and I could tell a good scene had hit the cutting room floor and was replaced by over the top music.

The best Star wars movie by Disney,"I love 'Rogue One' and gave it an 8/10. The acting was solid, with Felicity Jones and Diego Luna leading a capable ensemble cast. The music by Michael Giacchino added depth and emotion, while the casting and character diversity brought a fresh perspective to the Star Wars universe. Cinematography beautifully captured the gritty, war-torn setting, and Gareth Edwards' directing delivered epic battles. The writing created a compelling standalone story but occasionally felt rushed in character development. Its strength lies in its unique perspective on the Rebellion's sacrifices and the stunning space battles, while it faced challenges in pacing and character depth. 'Rogue One' is a remarkable addition to the Star Wars saga, offering a fresh take on the beloved universe.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This is what rebellion is built upon:Hope,"I still feel this is one of the greatest stories that came out of the ""Star Wars"" franchise. ""Star Wars"" is ultimately a story about a rebellion and in its core it's a story about hope and I feel that this movie came out of that realization, that although they gave us a beautiful space Odyssey, they simply had to give us a movie that celebrates the essence of ""Star Wars"". It remains true that in order to enjoy this movie entirely you have to have watched at least the original trilogy and know the lore of the universe, but still it is a beautiful tale about a rebellion with a great cause. It can be enjoyed as that, a fight for a cause and hope. Having watched ""Andor"" is of no question why and how it came to be, it simply is a story that needs being said. ""Rogue One"" is the most important ""Star Wars"" movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Rogue One: A ""Star Wars"" Story","This was my most anticipated film for 2016. I was more excited for this film than most people were, which is why this is so heartbreaking. I know I'm in the minority for this; a lot of people are enjoying this movie and I hate to rain on someone's parade, but I've got to be honest; I didn't think this was that good of a movie.The first trailer they released back in April (the one with the chill-inducing Empire sirens), before the re shoots, include like 50% of footage that didn't even make it into the film. Where are they? I get it though, re shoots are common; most big-budget movies do them. However, re watching that trailer again and remembering how f'in excited I got from the possibility of seeing a hard-hitting, war-central Star Wars movie with a dark, ominous tone just made me even more disappointed with the film we actually got.I loved 'The Force Awakens'. Yes, it borrowed excessively from 'A New Hope', but at least it felt like a Star Wars movie. ROGUE ONE on the other hand feels like a number of different things all thrown together; at times it was a gritty war film, other times it was a lighthearted comedy, and then we also got a space opera in there as well. This inconsistent and, honestly, incongruous mesh of tones ultimately brought the film down, which is frustrating given that when it focused entirely on one of the three aspects, it worked to a tee.Without giving away any spoilers, there was a certain CG character that, when you first see, is really quite shocking and uncanny. But my issues with it are more than just how it was done; it's why it was done. Personally, and this is just me, I thought what Disney/Lucasfilm did was unethical and wrong.If I were to rank the strengths of this film, Ben Mendelsohn would end up quite high on that list. He was such a different, yet remarkable Star Wars antagonist; if there was one character I wanted to learn more about, coming out of the theatre, it was without a doubt Orson Krennic. Other standouts included Donnie Yen, who has more than a few character-defining moments, and Diego Luna, who added a lot more depth to an otherwise underdeveloped character. In fact, I found most of the characters here underdeveloped and rather two-dimensional. I guess it's my fault I didn't take the time to read 'Catalyst', which is a novel in the Star Wars canon that apparently leads straight into ROGUE ONE. But then again, a movie should stand up as a movie and not rely on additional material. Do I really need to spend an extra 20 bucks and invest in hours of homework to 'get' this film and care about the characters?Apart from a couple scenes where she's actually quite good in, Felicity Jones just didn't do it for me; she consistently felt too one-note and passive in critical moments where I wanted her to step up and just blow the roof off the place. Someone else that was disappointing was Forest Whitaker. I love the guy as an actor, but what on God's green earth was he doing with his voice? It was so cringe and off-putting that I was pulled out of the film a number of times.Death Vader isn't featured much in the movie, but his looming presence is certainly felt. It's just; I'd be lying if I said I wasn't disappointed by his minimal involvement. But I understand why he was used as sparingly as he was.One thing I thought ROGUE ONE did better than 'The Force Awakens', and absolutely deserves credit for, is expanding on the universe and enriching it rather than playing off it and making it feel smaller whether it be with characters that are not the obligatory Skywalkers or Solos, gorgeously imagined worlds, and novel thematic explorations.This is a Star Wars movie I believe kids won't enjoy as much; this is definitely more tailored to adults. And while that may have originally been a good idea, now having seen the movie I realize that was the wrong move. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for a different change of pace. But Disney, if you're going to put the ""War"" in Star Wars (I hate myself for using that phrase) then don't half- ass it. Don't get cold feet halfway through and re shoot the movie in order to lighten up the tone because then we end up with a film that doesn't know what it's trying to be.With all that being said, I have to admit that as many faults as this movie had, the final act is pretty incredible. They made some bold choices I didn't think they'd make but that felt right for the story, and I applaud director Gareth Edwards and Lucasfilm for that. In fact, the last few minutes are some of the greatest minutes in any Star Wars movie, leading into and tying very nicely with 'A New Hope'.Overall, this is a movie I don't feel inclined to rush back and watch on the big screen. The only reason I ended up investing (kinda) in the characters is because of the actors playing them; the writing under services everyone except for a select few like Krennic and K-2SO. I appreciated the tone they went for with the 'war' aspect, but the constant tonal clashes pulled me out and the action, while some of the best we've ever seen in a Star Wars movie, got repetitive pretty quickly. If for nothing else, the last thirty minutes of ROGUE ONE is something to cherish. Now that's a movie I'd watch over and over again.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
New Look for the Series,"Rogue One is a very interesting new installment in the uber-famous Star Wars series. It is a true prequel, taking place immediately prior to the events of the original 1977 movie, and in effect tells the story of how the Rebel Alliance obtained the plans for the Death Star and why it has a technological weakness. The characters are relatively minor players in the Star Wars universe, but they rise in the movie to take a special place in Star Wars lore.In past installments, Star Wars movies generally stress character development and conflict as much or even more than the galactic struggle. Episode III, for example, is all about Annikin Skywalker's fall into evil, Episode IV is about Luke Skywalker's rise as a challenge and foil to that evil, Episode V their battle to convert each other to their respective sides of the force, and Episode VII the new awakening of the force in Rey and Kylo Ren as they become adversaries.Rogue One starts on this path--in the opening scene, a 7-year-old Jyn Erso watches the villain of the movie, Imperial stooge General Krennec, murder her mother and imprison her father in order to make him finish his scientific work on the Death Star. We might immediately assume that the main conflict of the movie will be between these two characters, and that she will become possessed of ""the force"" like Luke Skywalker, but it actually does not happen that way. Jyn later in life is forcibly swept up into the struggle as the Rebellion is trying to get their mitts on the plans for the Death Star--they want her to enlist the assistance of her father and also the terrorist Saw Gerrera in that task. We learn that the Rebellion is fractured--consisting of outlaws, do-gooders, former Republicans, and other forces. A remarkable ensemble cast begins to assemble that sees the Empire as a common threat, and this ensemble, a roguish band, will become the actual main protagonist of the movie. The band will include a Rebel Spy--Cassian Andor, a converted Imperial tactical droid--K-2SO, an Imperial-pilot turned defector-- Bodhi Rook, and a random blind warrior--Chirrut Imwe, strong with the Force.What follows is a surprise--the ragtag group goes on a mission to retrieve the Death Star plans, and the suspected character study turns into a full-blown war movie/ensemble Western. The models for this are movies like The Magnificent Seven or Force 10 from Navarone, where a small gang of soldiers goes on a quest against impossible odds. The interpersonal stuff underlies a huge action picture with awesome war sequences both on the ground of a tropical planet and in the space above. The cliff-hangers and special effects are awe-inspiring. The ending is something of a surprise, even though it makes perfect sense given the plot of Episode IV that occurs right after.I really liked this movie, primarily because it takes the Star Wars series into some truly uncharted territory. This is really an exciting war movie above all else, a battle between good and evil on a different plane than the other movies. For those who might have thought Episode VII was a bit derivative, this is really something new.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The movie has definitely structural issues.,"I went into this with an open mind, wanting to love it more than The Force Awakens. Unfortunately I did not.One undeniable positive is that the effects all look very real and good except 2 things that you will understand.The movie has structural problems. It's beautiful to watch but it has no heart, no character development. You don't care about anyone that much even Jyn Erso. Now I understand why the had to do re-shoots, it needed it and it was not enough.Also the score by Michael Giacchino was not very memorable. What can you do when you have to do it in 4 weeks.******* Very small spoilers follow: They should not use CG humans. It looks bad especially in a movie that is going for gritty and reality.

This movie has a set of almost all anti-heroes as the protagonists and still makes it work. The CGI is breathtaking!

Should have known better,"Okay, there must be two types of Star Wars fans who see the universe completely differently. First, there are the children of the original trilogy generation, which includes myself, whom adore Star Wars as a keystone of our early development; as penetrating as any religion, if not more so. I saw all the original movies in the theater, multiple times. I played Star Wars in the schoolyard, and had the compulsory toys, games, accessories etc. Star Wars was a part of me and my friends daily conversation. That being said, we never read a Star Wars book or comic, nor did we dress up in goofy SW uniforms (except at Halloween). We balanced our childhood pop culture fantasies with healthy sports and activities. To us, Star Wars and the NFL were both cool. There were very few geeks that I was aware of. We knew immediately that Return of the Jedi was only half as good as the first two, mainly because the story really betrayed Lucas' need to pander to kiddies. I was 13 by the time of ROJI, and I needed my Star Wars universe to continue to get darker and more intense, not more sickly sweet.Now, enter the second set. Geeks. I hate you. You have hijacked and ruined that part of my childhood Star Wars memories as described above. You have immersed yourself in fandom in a way that has lit up dollar signs for George Lucas, Disney and every other big corporation that has had a hand in reviving Star Wars for the geeks. You actually liked the prequels (or parts of them) as well as these last two installments. You read all the fan novels, graphic novels and whatever else; and you have PhDs in the Star Wars universe. Good for you. Just because you know about all these new characters and story lines doesn't make you a real Star Wars fan. You're just geeks if you don't know a good movie, Star Wars or otherwise. And geeks generally don't know good movie storytelling, you are too hung up on the video game and graphic components.I watched a review by some geek group on youtube who praised Rogue One as being really good. It sucked. There is so much going on on the screen at any one time it becomes distracting, characters are underdeveloped, score is overused, and the whole thing is edited together at breakneck speed. And this is nothing new. This is what the video game/comic book/geek masses consume endlessly. No wonder the studios keep serving up the same old drivel. Watch Empire Strikes Back again. Note how much care is taken to allow characters to fill space and time. The pace is pitch perfect, and there are beautiful moments of quiet (not silence) that allow you some breathing room to absorb the story. Geeks, all I can say is, I hope you're mass influence is on the downswing. Oh, and you owe me my money back.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"The Most ""Rogue"" of all Star Wars Movies For Sure","Rogue One is the first stand alone movie to be released in the Star Wars franchise, and with that comes some new expectations for the series and more specifically for this movie. With the exception of maybe episode 1 and episode 7 the viewer has had a pretty good idea of what they were going to get from each individual Star Wars movie, we would continue the story from the previous movie and unravel more of the saga. Rogue One tells a very specific story that happens to take place somewhere in between episode 3 and episode 4, but this is not episode 3.5, it is more fleshing out possibly the most beloved universe in movie history, and for the most part it is a success.One of the really difficult things about how to tell the story of Rogue One is that it does not really have the massive amounts of fan service to draw from. It takes place in a bit of a dark period in the galaxy, not just because it is a war torn galaxy but because we don't know much about the events during this time. There are a few things here and there that are to service the fans, but for the most part this movie introduces us to some new people and places that we have not seen previously, and I think the movie is better for it. It is nice to see what people without the last name of Skywalker are doing, and maybe creating some new characters to inhabit the galaxy.Rogue One also has the difficult job of being the makeshift bridge between the prequels and the original trilogy, and as stated before they do a great job of not trying to explain everything that happened in that time and instead giving this movie a more focused vision. From the start you can tell that while this movie is about the Star Wars universe, it is definitely has it's own feel. Rogue One is more a war movie than any of the other Star Wars movies. This means a darker tone and a less fun time at the movies. This is not necessarily a bad thing, it helps to separate this movie from the main series but will certainly make it a less enjoyable affair.While not as well casted as episode 7(few movies are) Rogue One introduces some new characters to us and while I won't go nuts about the acting chops in a Star Wars movie, Felicity Jones holds her own as a bonafide star in Rogue One, even though her character has some likability flaws at the beginning. Another thing that would be silly to judge harshly in a Star Wars movie is the writing. The overall plot has some holes that are covered up in some of the laziest ways I can possibly imagine, and the dialogue is mostly forgettable, but the overall scope of the plot is great, and will satisfy almost every fan of the first 7 movies.Star Wars has been up at the top of my favorite movie franchises since I was a tot, and just the fact that I get to see a new movie with Darth Vader and storm troopers in it makes me very happy, but Rogue One is not a perfect movie by any stretch. The main thing that I think was missing from episode 7 and hopefully will play a bigger part in the coming movie was space battles. In a movie titled Rogue One there better be some high level fighter pilot battles, and while there is a decent battle at the end, I still felt shorted a bit. This is kind of the overall feel of Rogue One, yes its a good Star Wars movie and yes Vader is in it, but the twist at the end of the punch is missing. All in all I am pretty happy that we are getting solid Star Wars movies almost yearly now, and to be honest I saw keep them coming.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Dour,"A lot of my facebook friends were declaring this the best movie in the Star Wars series, so I was surprised when I saw on metacritic that critical reviews were mixed. But now I understand. Even the reviews of my girlfriend and myself were mixed; while she really liked this film, it left me cold.Rogue One is a surprisingly dour movie for a series that usually embraces a fun aesthetic. The empire and rebel leaders are almost equally unlikable, and the story is a grim slog.While my girlfriend spent the movie planning her Jyn Halloween costume, I found the character fairly bland; far less interesting than Force Awakens Rey or the original's Leia (or even, for that matter, Phantom Menace's princess). I cared for the rebel soldier in charge of the mission even less.The best characters were easily the blind Chirrut and K-2SO. These two characters had the humor and heart I expect from Star Wars characters.The basic idea of building a movie around something briefly mentioned in the original movie is a good one, and the story is pretty solid. But I never felt invested in the characters and little of the action actually excited me.I don't understand anyone who claims this is the best movie in the series.

It would have made a lot of sense that characters like Kallus, Syndulla, Zeb etc. Were major leaders of the rebellion at this point in the timeline.2. I absolutely despise the CGI retrofitting the faces of deceased actors over those of the new ones. Completely disgusting. Disrespectful to the original actors, as you are exploiting them when they are not alive to give you permission. It is even more disrespectful to the current actors whose performances are wasted. Especially worse in this case as Guy Henry would have made an excellent Tarkin in his own skin. He looks and sounds so similar. What a waste of great casting.

A Standalone But Autochthonous Rebellion,"Ten years after the terminal insertion into film cosmos begot by George Lucas (""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith"" in 2005), settled down the first usufruct of Disney's shrewd acquisition when it purchased Lucasfilm—studio which is interpreted as the most remarkable franchise in pecuniary terms—by a reasonable value (USD $4 billion). ""The Force Awakens"" was the channel Abrams applied to flourish the torpid force in the warsies' heart after the futile prequels. Starting with this one, Disney took it upon itself to purvey an annual movie within litigating film release schedule. Kathleen Kennedy (co- founder of Amblin Entertainment and current President of Lucasfilm) and formidable crew of the factory covet with making an empirical universe about the preternatural galaxy far, far away; and to achieve this, they have concluded to try its luck with Edwards' war experiment in order to elucidate whether it is beneficial to create a line of independent events out of the Skywalker family. Fall 2016 was reserved season to release invigorating and unsafe new invention; ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" opens by far a feasible wave of dissimilar films of a galactic anthology while focusing and securing its strongest point in the director's fervent declaration: war film which does not drink neither George Lucas' nor J. J. Abrams' lymph for manufacturing a deferential, nostalgic, cogitative, and sometimes dispiriting extension in Star Wars mythology.Despite economic success is safeguarded even with the most negligible work around this captivating constellation, its narrative or plot component emulates the scale clichés of the original trilogy: an inspiring princess, a humorous robot, a bold misanthrope, a strife between the dark side and the light side and of course theatrical display of spaceships assailing each other furiously. Conversely, this compact design takes risks as for inquiring into primitive and uncommon perspectives of the galaxy, which foster a fortification of a deeper concept around this mythology. And although as a last resort is a war celluloid more than remarkable—in spite of it merely sketches certain characteristics and focuses its plausible references in ""The Dirty Dozen"" (1967) by Robert Aldrich—does not manage to be a corporeal Star Wars movie since it's constantly held on by fan service and generates a quite primary treatment to the development. A prime look to unfamiliar areas from a standpoint's as ordinary as opposed, a wit tinged of tribulation and grief and one of the most honorable final thirds in a sci-fi/action/adventure blockbuster in recent times are the unforeseen top ambitions by a filmmaker who, respectfully, did not have good expectations on his hands owing to the controversial final reshoots, the script reformulations by Disney and doubtlessly the trembling replacement in musical lead from Alexandre Desplat to Michael Giacchino's baton, however, it's never too late to shut up a few individuals.It takes place before the events of ""Episode IV,"" ""Rogue One"" came up from a shallow idea of visual effects supervisor and CCO at Industrial Light & Magic John Knoll, which consisted in clarifying the time- space around what was the itinerary of the Death Star plans until being in Princess Leia Organa's hands , route somewhat named in ""A New Hope"". So this is the story of those ordinary beings who achieved the extraordinary. Innocent Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) opens with a retrospective scene about her girlhood, underlined by tragedy and misfortune. Thereon, it introduces her as a redeemed prisoner who is moved to a Rebel Alliance HQ. There, a transcendental mission has commended her in order to make contact with his fading father for locating and discovering the nature and the place of a substantially powerful weapon. And as if it were ""Suicide Squad"", ordinary people clan gradually takes form, finding its cardinal mover into the force. Although the fabled team bounces from a planet to another for terminating its commission, we figured out exiguous details about the crew captained by Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) —who made me very proud;—likewise, most fans clamor for more background in Saw Gerrera's story, the leader of the Onderon rebels; something completely similar to what happened with the Joker in ""SQ"". Despite the fact that the depth was an authentic reverb, character designs and performances are what many fans were waiting for. Displaying a heterogeneous and multicultural acting cast, which delves into each contemporary civilization, the film takes advantage of the cultural range to generate a vast human-racial universe inside its world, in the same way, each performer gets its moment of glory before the decisive and evocative ending. Their performances made the audience proud, so much so that was ineluctable not yell in the credits of the motion picture.More suitable for adults than infants, more suitable for warsies than mass audiences. If it were action and conflagration scenes, the near-perfect third act would lead the film to the sublime, sadly, its burning and high-octane last forty minutes aren't enough to keep afloat lack of enthusiasm and the multiplicity of the beginning and exposition, opportunities lacking in momentum and vigor that exclusively are notable for performances and special effects. In time record, Giacchino composed an entrancing, nostalgic and fortifying soundtrack, which is assembled with the dark tone of each frame, also it testifies him as the first author in breaking John Williams' musical canon. ""Rogue One"" is more a war product, in where its spectacular music, sparkling performances, and nearly excellent action sequences invade unexplored lands and nothing irreverent in Star Wars world, also, the film gives a message of hope and encourages all us, who this year lost a great woman: imposing Carrie Fisher.

""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" -- the first of many planned off- shoots for the rejuvenated franchise -- goes back in time to tell the story of Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) and a crew of rebels who are tasked with finding the plans to the original Death Star, all leading up to the franchise's ""proper"" beginning, ""A New Hope."" Not your kid's ""Star Wars,"" this story is a little deeper and a lot darker than the fare we've grown accustomed to since ""Return of the Jedi"" and the cartoon-ish prequels.Stepping into the director's chair is Gareth Edwards, who brought us the revamped ""Godzilla"" just a few years back. His strong visual sense serves ""Star Wars"" well. While the script doesn't always deliver much for surprises, the lush landscapes and mind-bending special effects more than make up the difference. Unlike, say, ""The Force Awakens,"" this is the sort of movie you could put on mute (or, better yet, isolate the soundtrack) and still get sucked into. Showing a restraint with CGI that few filmmakers in this day and age understand, Edwards even somehow manages to make CGI renderings of two iconic but absent actors -- a dicey proposition -- without slipping into some Playstation 3-grade graphics (think Arnold Schwarzenegger's ""cameo"" in ""Terminator: Salvation"") or offending the viewer's intelligence. As always, your mileage may vary, but to the unbiased eye, this is as good as it gets. It helps that these elements are used sparingly and only out of necessity.The merry band of rebels here are a varied bunch. We get Forest Whitaker playing a kook and loving it, while Mads Mikkelsen works towards shedding his typecast role as a creepy villain. Fittingly, the best of the bunch would be Alan Tudyk's turn as the droid K-2SO, who steals virtually every scene he appears in. We also get a taste of Darth Vader (James Earl Jones) and cameos from C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2 (Jimmy Vee stepping in for the late Kenny Baker). Heck, we even get Bail Organa, as played by Jimmy Smits in the much maligned prequels. There's just enough fan service to whet our appetites but not so much as not to distract from the main story. Likewise, keep your finger on the pause button for all of the visual callbacks and sight-gags sprinkled throughout.While it's true that the film has a built-in audience, it is definitely not for everyone. It has humor, but goes darker than ever before, which may be off-putting to some. However, if your love for the series begins and ends with the original core trilogy, this one's for you. Lean, mean and a feast for the senses, ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" is more than just a distraction or a place-holder until ""Episode VIII: The Last Jedi"" comes out later this year. It's so good, you'll almost forget there were other prequels.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Great Franchise is Built on Hope,"Through and through this is more grim and dirty war story than the whimsical sci-fi adventure we were expecting, and that darker tone serves the film's thematic onslaught against everything we've come to expect from a Star Wars movie. Every character grows and changes over the course of the story, saturated in such gritty realism and told from a perspective we've never seen before, making this one of the most deeply personal experiences in the Star Wars saga; so lovingly crafted on a cinematographic level and boasting some of the greatest land and space battle sequences since the Battles of Hoth and Coruscant before it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Brilliant movie from start to finish!!!,"I'm no movie buff expert but I have high respect for brilliant movies and rogue one is one of my so many all time favorite movies.Why? For the respect it has shown in creating the movie around a story that started nearly 40 years ago :) for anyone who grew up with Star Wars (now known as a new hope) would know the iconic beginning of the movie.Rogue one is created back to back with a new hope with a gap of nearly 40 years and end only minutes of the next movies beginning.Another thing I love about the Star Wars movies is the respect of creating the universe around the previous movies to detail and the continuity with characters and small/big details.The cast was superb and the cgi of Tarkin and Leila is amazing!!Can't wait to see the next Star Wars - the last Jedi and it's story line :)Well done Garth Edwards, cast/crew and team :)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Better than Force Awakens but not great,"Hmm, where to start, after Force Awakens hit the theaters last year, i said that i will not watch anything new that comes from Disney and has Star Wars in the name, i was so disappointed, even George Lucas prequels where magnificent achievements when you compare them to JJ Abrams directing. But somehow when Rogue One came to theaters in my town i said to myself i would go and watch it, and yes i must admit i had a great fun but nothing more from that, it is action and just action, like watching Rambo movie just set in galaxy far far away. I must admit i like the look of new planets especially planet Jedha, yes you can see the middle eastern influences especially city of Jerusalem but i like that a lot, that part of the movie reminded me on maybe the best star wars video game Knights Of The Old Republic, and yes i had a feeling from the beginning to an end that i am playing some good star wars video game, not watching movie, like mix of Rogue Squadron, KOTOR and Battlefront. Acting in movie is just i don't know what to say but there is no acting, maybe just from Ben Mendhelson as main Villain Orson Krennic, he really looks like ambitious man of Empire real villain without emotions, and Mads Mikkelsen as father of Jyn Erso, others are not worth mentioning, maybe Forest Whitaker but his role was too short. The biggest down was acting of Felicity Jones, so dumb and one of the worst acting i have seen on big screen. Even with all this flaws this movie is better 10 times than Force Awakens and feels more like Real Star Wars, but not expect too much, you will not find great acting, story and emotions and spiritual deepness like in first movies, but if you just want to watch good action, great filming locations, bunch of star destroyers and TIE Fighters these movie is for you. I give it 6/10, even Edwards is better director than Jar Jar Abrams.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A Fantastic War Film,"Next step on the Star Wars review series is the first live action spinoff Rogue One: A Star Wars Story and this is my review for the film. The premise of the film sees a group of misfit rebels attempt to steal the Death Star Plans from The Empire.Main Character
Felicity Jones plays Jyn Erso the lead in this film and she is really good in the role, her character has plenty of depth to her and you really support her as the main character. You see her really develop over the film and it makes her journey a fascinating one to watch and makes you care about her as a character.Supporting Characters
This film has a huge supporting cast and Diego Luna as Cassion Andor is the main one, he introduces a new side to the Rebellion and it is great to see this more morally ambigous character associated with the Rebels as in the original trilogy they are presented as the squeaky clean heroes when it is clear there was more to them. Him and Jones has some good chemistry together and I liked how they interacted and how their characters develop during the film and bring out different sides to each other. Alan Tudyk voices the droid K2SO and he is the funniest part of the film, he makes you laugh plenty in the film but you also grow to care about him as he has more character then possibly any other droid in the Star Wars universe. Donnie Yen and Wen Jiang play Chirrut & Baze in the film and I really liked their characters, they have a really interesting dynamic together and I especially thought Yen's character was really interesting and a part of the most entertaining action scnenes in the film. Ben Mendelsohn plays the main villain Director Orson Krennic and he is the perfect Imperial in The Star Wars universe, he is very dislikeable and despicable making it easy not to like him, but it was interesting seeing his role in The Empire and how it affects him as a character.Story
This film's story does a really good job of building the group and making you care about each of them, it also adds depth to them and develops them as characters. It is an exciting story and feels like a war film scenario where you care about the characters survival and want to see them succeed. Also this film does a great job in making A New Hope's plot better and adding more depth to it. However, my main criticism for the film is that the story isn't that interesting for the first act and jumps all over the place making it hard to focus on a particular journey but it improves as the film progreses.Script
The script is great for this film, as mentioned it adds moral complexity to the rebels that makes them more human and more relatable to the audience. The drama feels very real and it adds to the emotion for the characters that you have especially in the last act. The humour is also well done mainly through K2SO but it was funny and felt appropriate for that character in the film.Style
The film looks fantastic, the war like action scenes are brutal and exciting at the same time. Whether they are on land or in space they feel epic in scale and exactly how war should be shown in The Star Wars Universe. To help this film has possibly my favourite action scene in any Star Wars film and a film that kept me on the edge of my seat.Overall
Overall, this is a fantastic Star Wars film, it feels like the most warlike film in this universe and does a great job showing the earlier stages of the rebellion and how the wheels are set in motion for A New Hope.Rating - 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Force Awakens shouldn't have a higher score than this movie..,"All I can say is that out of all the new Disney movies I have seen thus far, (solo, VII VIII and rogue 1) this was the best of them. This and The Mandalorian show are the best things to come out of Disney thus far. The fact that the Force Awakens has a better score than this movie is a testament to the mental capacity of our society. I don't feel like writing a long-winded review as most people do on here. The movie is well done and was a great prelude into the original Starwars trilogy. It had a good story, suspense a lot of action, great battle scenes and a compelling climax that leads perfectly into episode IV.. Including past characters from the old Trilogy throughout the movie was also a nice touch.. This was simply about a good story and movie without all the other crap.. The only progressive part they stuffed into this one was to make the radical rebels resemble Muslim Freedom fighters, but other than that it was just focused on the story..
In summary this was a more riveting and serious take on Starwars that felt authentic, yet less juvenile. ...Force Awakens in contrast had a very teen ""Disney"" feel throughout the movie with a cast you would expect from Disney..If our society made sense, the ratings would be similar to

THE BEST STAR WARS FILM IMHO,"Star Wars Rogue One is my favorite film of the genre. They were able to stick with the genre's core roots while adapting to new cinema technology. This movie felt the most like the original three films. I only wish they would have adapted this style if film making when they shot Star Wars episodes 7 through 9. I've always enjoyed J. J. Abrams films, but the story got lost in the last 3 episodes. Rogue One has become and instant classic in my eyes. I hope future adaptations look to this film for inspiration along with the original films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Mostly Unwatchable,"Watching Star Wars Rogue One reminded me how stubborn the entertainment industry is. They come up with a bad idea, which is often a move backwards, thinking it is creative and ignore public backlash against it. First we got that hand-held, shaky camera idea which hasn't gone away. The newest ""invention"" is making movies so dark, we may as well have a radio play instead. Visually, Rogue One is way too dark making one strain the eyes to see what is happening which has become the trend in Hollywood. It's like Hollywood has lost all confidence in its movies and insults the viewer by letting him not see the actors and what is going on. Beyond this, the brightness and contrast are out of whack, colour is drained out, and it looks all blurry. Rogue One looks just horrible. It's very ugly and unattractive.The second annoyance I had was the dialogue which was delivered in a very wooden style and way too long in most scenes. Okay, we get it, let's move on. The director had the actors ramble on and on when this was supposed to be an action/war movie.The previous Star Wars films worked because the dark evil spirit and the contrasting good/light spirit were delivered not by tinkering with the cinematography but allowing us to see the actors' faces and thus the emotions, motivations, and attitudes that protruded. We could see how they treated each other, how they felt about each other, something we can't see in Rogue One because of the fogged up murk.The film's only saving graces were Donnie Yen and the final battle scene. I give it 2 stars for those two out of 10.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The way Star Wars should feel,"After a lot of talks and a lot of rumors all over the place regarding this side-story for the Star Wars Universe. Finally, we get a fitting SW story that feels gritty and looks amazing.Rogue One has three acts where it first introducing the characters, second part developing the characters to react to each other and set up the mission. Third part an epic battle where the actual plans get stolen. (yeah real spoiler ;) ).The whole universe of SW in this movie just fits the rest of the original trilogy. The costumes the way the world looks like, the struggles on both the rebel side as the imperial side. It all fits good together.With the introduction of so many new elements some fall a bit short especially how certain characters interact with each other. Maybe on that front Rogue One wants to push a bit too far. The movie is not long enough to put as much in it as it wants.So lets talk about the third act. The third act is where the most action and the best visuals during the movie come in. The space battle in this act is just great, visually stunning and great use of the characters. Some you will recognize from EP4. A lot attention went into making this a solid SW set up, there is a battle in the sky, a battle on the ground and a battle in space taking place all at the same time.The main bad guy shows divided side of the Empire, where you see people are still trying to take control of the powers within the Empire. I myself loved this, the struggles it shows the early stages of dominance. Vader is not used as much in the movie as the trailer might say, but I think this is a good thing. Vader is such a powerful character which would have taken away almost all screen time of the rebels or make the movie a Vader movie. Luckily, they used him for the right moments and the right times.Again, the gritty atmosphere and the different locations this movie takes places are awesome and a welcome addition to the whole diversity of SW planets. You read about them in books but to actually see them represented in the movie is just awesome.All in all, the movie was a great experience and if this sets up the rest of the spin off movies than keep them coming. Don't expect a 10 out of 10 movie because there are too many plot holes and other little things that make less sense. But a solid SW movie it is. I would put this one right after Empire Strikes Back in my SW list.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It's what it is,"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is the first in a line of probably many Star Wars spin off movies, that the people don't really need, but still somehow want. With that being said it's absolutely going the same way as the Marvel cinematic universe and taking something with a large fan base, then hiring competent enough writers, that can write around the franchises core and come up with a product, that doesn't seem like complete fan pandering shlock. None of the movies of such calibre are really worth a spot in a movie canon, but since all entertainment is audience pandering to some degree, we might as well look at it and evaluate it's worth. With that out of the way; Rogue One is fine overall. The movie is kind of pointless. We know it's outcome and where the story goes afterwards and you can easily predict the outcome. It's up to you to decide, whether you'll just take the information you get in ""A New Hope"" or whether you'd rather have this 2 hour movie do that for you. By taking the long road, you get a cast of characters, that while interesting on paper, still lack some interaction and chemistry for it to eventually lead into a satisfying climax, a plot that doesn't feel like rehashing the originals, some of the original's style of immersive world to get surrounded by, some good action scenes, bunch of cameos, you might have wanted or maybe didn't and the obvious fan service, that matters the most to some; Darth Vader. If that's the stuff, you'd want to spend your 2 hours of free time on, then you might just have a blast with it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Making the Franchise Fresh Again,"Rogue One is the best Star Wars movie since 1980. The general consensus of last years Force Awakens was that the spirit of the original trilogy returned. However, the problem with Episode VII is in how the spirit is captured identically. In having returned so reverently, the franchise needed to display a willingness to tinker. Enter the newest cinematic addition to Star Wars. Rogue One is a balanced movie of hope and despair. The last Star Wars movie to find this magical balance in tone is The Empire Strikes Back. Likewise, Rogue One finds a unique synergy between old and new. The first anthology Star Wars movie works in its inevitable lead-in to an almost forty-year-old classic with a sense of invigoration. The movie smartly covers up modern filmmaking conventions with amazing throwbacks to the original trilogy. Seventies style facial hair can still be found on the Rebel pilots while a few smart cameos make the Star Wars initiated feel at home. The amount of Star Warsness to the film allows director Gareth Edwards to comfortably recton A New Hope. A problem with Rogue One is how the film can only be best enjoyed by a Star Wars fan. Rogue One is a decent enough war movie. The dogfights are exciting. The characters are charming and funny enough. The overall plot can't be fully enjoyed without having seen A New Hope. In addition, the cinematic impact the film has on the future of this storied franchise also can't be appreciated by an outsider. Rogue One features the most diverse cast of any Star Wars movie... as well as the franchises more intense scenes. The mentioned scenes make up some of the best moments in a Star Wars movie to date. Rest assured the future of the franchise is in the very capable hands of Disney. Rouge One is how a franchise should make the old become relevant.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Soulless Cash Cow,"I am not a Star Wars fan, but must say that the old trilogy was and is very viable and cool, whereas newer trilogy started well, but then plunged into a total mess of a horrid making.

With its 2 endless hours run and very boring slow scenes it seems an eternity. Honest. The plot? Ah, rubbish, the obvious exploiting of far too well known scenery, places and even monsters. The main hero? Nay, she is just okay, but in a deeper sense, she is none above average and is paled into insignificance when displayed in relief of better stars. The effects? Good, but again, we have seen it all time and again. So, what remains? Nothing, in fact.

I felt the chemistry and tension between Jin and Cassian worked pretty well, although the reprogrammed droid was probably the most interesting character. Darth Vader's appearances are pointless and uninspired. ""Rogue One"" is an interesting chapter in the Star Wars saga, but the battle scenes do go on a bit.

A fantastic standalone Star Wars movie,"I saw this movie at the cinema last night. Overall I think Rogue One is a very good movie. It was certainly more enjoyable that last year's outing, which was in itself pretty enjoyable. Last year's movie was more of a rehash. This movie just feels more fresh, it's a new independent story and that seemed to allow it a lot more freedom. The tone of the movie is also not something we have seen in a Star Wars movie before, especially the latter part of the film. This film shows us more of the realities of war on the ground level, something we have not seen before in Star Wars. I think the story worked very well. As you know this movie is set before 'A New Hope', the 1st Star Wars movie ever made. The story managed to weave itself in and around plots that we are already familiar with, but from this movies perspective have yet to happen. I felt this aspect was handled really well, blending the existing with the new. It passes the baton on neatly to 'A New Hope', so much so I felt like watching 'A New Hope' as soon as I got home.I enjoyed the performance of all the lead actors. There has been some rumblings around the leading lady, Felicity Jones as 'Jyn Erso', I had no qualms with her performance at all. She is not going to win an Oscar but it was a good performance, she was believable, sincere and rugged when needed (which was a lot). The same is true for the other main characters in the Rogue troupe. Specific mentions to Diego Luna as 'Cassian', the mentally tortured rebel soldier, Donnie Yen as 'Chirrut' who brings some real charisma to the role of a blind Jedi with martial arts skills and also to English actor Riz Ahmed as 'Bodhi', the Imperial pilot defector with a conscience who mutinies for the good of the alliance. Very solid all around. We are introduced to a lot of different characters in here, some of them we get detail on, others not so much. The director did as much as he could in the 2hr running time. There is a lot of witty one liners and good humour, mostly from the new droid K- 2SO. I think he is going to be a firm favourite with most. He is a reprogrammed Imperial droid, so he looks quite menacing, however he is witty and quite cheeky. Echoes of C3PO, but in his own way very different. He is certainly not bound by the polite protocols of C3PO. He made me laugh out loud quite a few times. There are brief cameos by established characters here and there, just enough to make the hard core fans smile but this movie is really about the characters contained within the story.The film starts of at a steady pace, setting up the plot, then grows steadily as the movie progresses, finishing in a massive crescendo at the end. For the first 2/3's of the movie I thought to myself 'this is a solid movie', however the final 1/3 of the movie takes this film to another level. There is lots in the final 1/3 that will be familiar to Star Wars lovers, epic battle scenes in space and on ground but what is very different is the tone, these are scenes of a real gritty war. This movie takes us to a place that no Star Wars movie has ever taken us before, and for me this is what makes this movie so special. I will not say any more as I do not want to spoil anything for others but the last 1/3 of this movie takes it to a whole other level of drama and intensity. Very surprising and refreshing. There are a number of standout scenes throughout the movie that will please the hard core fans. Epic battle scenes with the Death Star, Star Destroyers, Scout walkers, Terrier walkers and so on. Arguably one of the best 'big battle' scenes in Star Wars happens in this very movie. There is lots to get excited about. This brings me to the special effects which were magnificent. I saw the movie in 2D. Quite often in modern films the special effects are overwhelming, it sometimes feels like you are being hit over the head with visuals until your eyes are spinning in the sockets. No so with Rogue One. There are scenes where everything on screen is special effects but they make it work in a more believable way. Its not over the top like 'Attack of the Clones' or the other movies from that Trilogy. The sound is also really good. They have added lots of new sounds to the space crafts, low, guttural bass heavy sounds as they take off and land. Sounds you will be familiar with from modern sci-fi movies that work really well here. We are also introduced to a new musical score which sounds very similar to the Star Wars theme but it not quite the same. It's familiar in a nice way but also refreshing that it is new.Overall I really enjoyed the movie. I would give it 8 out of 10. I intend to go see it again in 3D to see how that affects my enjoyment of the film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not bad but not good either,"I did not know what to expect when I went to see Rogue One. I heard fairly good reviews, notably that this new movie was better than the Episodes I, II and III but that's not hard considering how lame those were. While Rogue One turned out to be not too disappointing, it really lacked originality: you still see stormtroopers walking around all Imperial premises (to kill time I presume), the rebel base sees plenty of activity with ground crew running around the X-wing fighters although there is no battle to prepare for (yet), the characters go from planet to planet at the rate of an organized tour, all of which have a different climate/atmosphere, etc. Another thing which also disturbed me was the amount of new uniforms, spacecraft, all of which will not appear in Episode IV which follows directly Rogue One.On the positive side, the movie starts without the traditional scrolling text, John Williams' music is not too present although you hear at times themes which were written for the original trilogy (saddly Michael Giacchino's new score goes unnoticed). The story is simple and straight-forward, unlike the prequels which had too much blah-blah and subplots without much to care for. I also like how a few short scenes manage to tie this episode to A New Hope (although they could have been slightly longer and ultimately leave the impression they were rushed in for transition purposes).To summarize, Rogue One is not a bad movie but it lacks true originality to make it a memorable Star Wars franchise film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It's well made. But the script is one big disaster. Laughable.,"Why this movie gets all the high ratings is beyond me. To me this movie is awful. It's one big box of clichés and it does not even try to hide it. I know for sure that every single line of the script can be traced back to another movie. It's one big copy-paste of movie one-liners. And not even the best ones. The line of actors is great and it's staggering to see these actors play in such a crappy movie.Don't get me wrong: it's very well made, but the script is laughable. 'Predictable' doesn't ever cover it. I watched the movie in a big theatre with hundreds of other people. There was only one moment when there was a little bit of laughter audible. Gosh, how we miss Mr. Ford and his great timing.Go watch it if you want to be in the Star Wars bubble. But don't blame me if you are utterly disappointed.

Rogue One,"It takes a pair of Death Star-sized balls to release a Star Wars prequel at this point. Gareth Edwards, director of 2014's Godzilla, did it. He has this got-to-know curiosity that the most hard-core Star Wars fans have always had. And he rewards us with a thrilling adventure that's every bit as satisfying as The Force Awakens. The thing that has always made George Lucas' ""Galaxy Far Far Away"" so unique is its richness. Every character, every planet, every plot line and technical spec seems to have been considered. It is a thoroughly imagined universe, full of tiny details and arcane backstories. There are no answerable questions just untold tales - and unmade movies.This first stand stand-alone chapter in the franchise is set just before the original Star Wars ""Episode IV: A New Hope"". Of course, that was our introduction - our gateway - to Lucas' world of Wookies, droids, rebel heroes and imperial villains. But the thing about that movie was, more you watched it, more questions it raised. How did Princess Leia come to possess the plans of the Death Star? Where did they come from? And that one tiny missing puzzle is the entire narrative of this new instalment.This is a whole new stable of characters operating on the fringes of the world we all know by heart. As in The Force Awakens, Rogue One screenwriter's centre on a female warrior, driven by destiny to take on the mightiest power in the galaxy. In fact, this film is ultimately Jyn's story, she is a fierce fighter, a rallying leader and the kind of role model any movie-going parent would want to expose their daughters and sons to. Felicity Jones plays this character with warmth and turns her into more than just a chest piece. She makes her human. Plus, alongside Jyn there is a droid named K-2SO, who is a more useful, resourceful and sarcastic than C-3PO. Beautifully designed and voiced with wit and exquisite timing by Alan Tudyk. He is the most useful of Jyn's cohort, as well as the most entertaining. However - and I can't believe that I am actually writing that - the film might lack a strong and charismatic male character (such as Han Solo or John Boyega's Finn) to balance and supply Jyn with a sparring partner.Though, the jaw-dropping resurrection of the late and singular British actor, Peter Cushing, who played the role of Grand Moff Tarkin, the Imperial leader first seen in 1977's original. Cushing, who died in 1994 at age 81, pops up here with matter-of-fact naturalness and complete credibility, playing the same character he did before with fresh dialogue. It is the art of CGI taken to new and perfected lengths and it has to be said that this actor dead now for more than 20 years, give a better performance than some other actors in the cast. More importantly, the Dark Lord of the Sith's appearance is more impactful than ever. Undoubtedly contributing a couple of entries to future Best Vader Moments lists and finally answering the question ""Who would choose to live in a fortress with a lava waterfall?"".Shot on a more spontaneous-feeling manner than his predecessors, it keeps the energy high and both the actors and the audience on their toes. Edwards builds up to a gigantic third act showdown. Moreover, Rogue One is loaded with allusions to other films in the franchise, without ever relying on them too much. It is fun, but the risk is to make it too elaborate and complex-to-the-point of confusing space opera, which will only appeal to the already converted. This film has undertaken extensive and very publicised reshooting and you can tell sometimes. Lastly, younger generation might be bored, confused, or both. But for the original generation of Star Wars fans who were not sure what to make of episodes one, two and three, Rogue One is the prequel they always wanted.Overall, Rogue One is a Star Wars film, yes. And it feels epic. But what it really is at its core is an Ocean's 11 in space. It perfectly connects events we already know by heart with ones we never even considered. Mix that with loads of actions, great effects, good comic relief and stunning locations, you get a perfectly entertaining movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Pretty good,"I thought The Force Awakens was a highly entertaining film, but it also suffered from being way too derivative and formulaic. As a result, it hasn't stood to be as memorable as one could hope. Rogue One does well in limiting the amount of humor (there was too much in Force Awakens), but it also sometimes comes off as too serious. It also has some trouble in developing this new story and the new characters, it becomes a little too jumbled. Once it settles in, it becomes more enjoyable. The one thing is has over Force Awakens is that the visual and special effects are absolutely fantastic, and the action set-pieces really impressive. The story here is a bit lacking, but more than enough positives make up for the negatives.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good to see a story outside the classic Star Wars saga,"It was good to see a story outside the classic Star Wars saga for once. The movie had a great cast and great potential. The story worked itself up to the climax a little too slow to my liking, but the third act makes the wait worthwhile. Despite the fact that the ending was a little bit too dramatic for me and took a chunk of credibility out of the movie, it was still a good and satisfying movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great addition,"This is the movie that fills in some gaps between episode 3 and episode 4. It takes place pretty much immediately before A New Hope. It shows how the rebels actually got their hands on the Death Star plans. This is a great self contained story, as it introduces many new characters. This is also a bad self contained story, as none of the newly introduced characters appear in any of the other films, so you kind of know who will be killed off. It is for this reason that I gave it seven stars. Had the movies been released in order, this would have been a solid 9.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
STAR WARS IS BACK after 11 years !,"To be very honest with you, after The Force Awakens, I started losing hope for new STAR WARS movies because it failed to bring the essence and spirit of SW to the screen. It wasn't a continuation of the saga, but a shallow reboot without any depth, substance, mythology or spirituality.ROGUE ONE however is a different story. I was immediately fully immersed in this gritty somber atmospheric universe, where you feel you are watching a STAR WARS movie. It did capture the spirit and essence of SW. The planets had a great vibe, you felt the oppression of the Empire, the breath of Darth Vader giving you goosebumps. The characters in ROGUE ONE were fantastic and the actors did a great job. They were a diverse group of strong individuals fighting for the same cause and it was inspirational. That's this other thing about SW movies & myths in general that they should speak to your inner hero's journey, inspire you, move you and touch you. ROGUE ONE DID THIS. The soundtrack was very cool, camera was great and special effects were phenomenal. John Knoll is a true VFX master and he really knows his craft. Hats off to him and his team for being able to pull up such amazing shots. Another super cool thing is how brilliantly it expands the story that leads to the beginning of A New Hope. There were also these cool fan service moments that will make you happy but I don't want to reveal anything. But I can say that it's such a shame they did not include Obi-Wan and Yoda in at least one epic scene (communicating through The Force for example). That would be the cherry on top and I'm sure Ewan and Frank Oz would be both very happy to do this.To sum it up ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY is a gritty version of STAR WARS for a more mature audiences and has a great vibe. In the words of Vader: ""I sense something. A presence of STAR WARS I've not felt since Revenge of the Sith.""",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the worst star wars movies ever,"Its clear that Disney is strictly into money grab now, they lure the fans with The Force Awakens that was really nicely done and saga continues.The Rouge one on the other hand is completely pointless movie, really badly done not deserving the Star Wars title at all.Instead of continuation of The Force Awakens story they decided to place it in parallel with Return of the Jedi.One of the biggest disappointments.

Rogue One Delivers,"Rogue One delivers a gripping, timely scry into a world that is - and is not our own. World class plot organization, artful direction, and acting finesse come together to produce something original, entertaining, and raw. The powerful emotions of desperation, dread, loss, and hope are heightened - not muted - by the sense of finality and horror that accompanies knowledge of the story's role in a larger saga. This fast-paced, moving work of cinema is appropriate, educational, and relevant for ages 7- 107. There is sufficient tension for lovers of drama, ample battles of multiple styles for the action- focused, and plenty of twists and unknowns. This movie manages to steer clear of several annoying star wars tropes - and is refreshingly canon. A strong cast and solid screenplay makes for an experience free of eye rolls that can sometimes accompany beloved, but clunky performances of the star wars universe.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Absolutely amazing,"This movie was absolutely amazing. I was hooked from the beginning to the end. the movie was surprisingly fast-paced considering that all the characters in this film are brand new. I really enjoyed all the references to the prequels and the originals but I won't go into what happened because I don't wanna spoil or ruin the moment for anyone. this film had a surprisingly dark tone to the story which really worked. This movie really showed the ""war"" side to star wars that have never been done before. in previous star wars films a lot of the battle scenes seemed a little cartoonish and didn't come off as like a life or death type scenario where as to this movie all the battle sequences were dark and gritty and even though you know how the overall story is going to end you still have that feeling of is it going to work out or not sort of thing. This has got to be my favorite star wars film since empire. I have seen this movie about three times now and every time I'm finding more and more reasons to like it. Overall I really enjoyed this film, I liked how it connected the prequels to the originals nicely, and it brought back that classic star wars feeling that hasn't been around in a long time.

Graphics, CGI are remarkably excellent, and yet without excessive overuse. The story is surely simple, but solid, good enough. For the sake of the fun, a new robot is introduced, with better entertaining qualities than the previous R2-D2 IMO. Also in general the humor is appropriate and adds to the fun.

Yeah I know the gripes and complaints but....,"Really not too bad compared to the other (the force awakens, last Jedi, any of the prequels). It actually delved into the force a little bit which was refreshing. Rather than people having super powers you didn't know they could do until the plot demands it; they had a good look at what the rebels actually want. Not all of them want to be Jedi's some of them just want to fight with laser guns and space ships too. Honestly that's more interesting to me than anything Jedi related. And that's what was cool about Star Wars to begin with! They appealed to people on both sides like Luke and Han!

Pale and with exactly the same story as all Star War franchise have,"Guys - I can't believe you're giving this 8.1 rating ???? This is not worth going to the movies. The king is naked! We must say it! This movie has nothing original in it - NOTHING. No new ideas, pale acting, soapy, thin to no story, just a big disappointment. This movie is basically with exactly the same story which is in all Star War franchise movies so far! Grow up. I know there is kids who would like it but even they will say this is nothing new. Granted, this genre is Space Opera (which has 1% SciFi in it) but with all that money they've spent on making Rogue One - I am SURE 100% that Christopher Nolan (Batman Begins, etc.) would make a much better film. Finally - I just cannot believe there is not a bit of creativity in making this movie - scenery is the same, narrative is the same, duplicates of the similar characters are everywhere, sentiment is weak, and technological background is stuck in 70s. For God's sake can we have some breakout from this overflow of cliché wanna-be SciFi movies in Hollywood? Someone?

Not your father's Star Wars,"Some good friends of mine went Thursday evening, and only said, ""Dark, we won't be taking our children to see this.""I add the word ""Brilliant"".If you need fluffy fantasy space opera, you're not going to enjoy this. If you need Jedi masters and Sith lords doing the impossible, there's not much here for you.If everything absolutely, positively has to be all right at the end credits, you probably should stay away.If you're prepared to face the reality that evil sometimes becomes strong and the only way to fight it is to fight to the death, literally to the death, you may find this as good a movie as I did.Right from the first, there is no blaring fanfare, no yellow letters running diagonally back, back, back into infinity. My first reaction was, ""Hmm, that doesn't sound like John Williams music."" And it wasn't. Michael Giacchino, who gave us the fine music for the latest Star Trek movies, scored this. There are the necessary referrals to John Williams' music, but no more than is necessary.Then there is egregious murder and ruthless Imperial bullying. There is the gritty life of the underbelly of those who either resist, or at least don't cooperate with the great Empire.So much has been made of the blind monk Chirrut Imwe, played by Donnie Yen. He's a great character. He's no Yoda, but he doesn't need to be. In fact, for this story he needs NOT to be.The great revelation to me was K-2SO, a reprogrammed Imperial droid, whose voice is provided by Alan Tudyk. I wish that had been C-3PO's character! I can show his character in one line, spoken with that flat, almost-depressed tone: ""I'll be there for you."" (Jyn looks surprised) ""The captain said I had to.""Most blessed of all, there is no one who has never had any training but who, suddenly, miraculously, is a master of the force, and no one is more surprised than she/he. There are none of the rabbit- out-of-a- hat surprises that Star Wars has done better than any other franchise. For instance, when suddenly the grim, grizzled veterans look to pretty young Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) for leadership, it makes perfect sense.Lastly, in order to defeat an almost-omnipotent Galactic Empire, somebody's going to have to die.

"Rogue One is the movie that puts the ""War"" in Star Wars!","Non-Spoilers Review :) Arriving from my first tasting of the tape directed by Gareth Edward, I can tell you with certainty that we have just entered a new era for the saga, in which there are no limits to the type of stories, tones and styles that can be added to the universe Created by George Lucas and in turn, ""enhance"" the experience of the unsurpassed classic trilogy.Although the film evokes well-known visual elements, it is far removed from the style of the 7 episodes of the central story. It brings us a narrative comparable to Saving Private Ryan (1998) or The Guns of Navarone (1961). Moving away from the adventurous and cool tone of its predecessors, the film immerse ourselves in a militarized and ruthless universe, which shows even more than the original trilogy, the coldness of the iron fist of the empire and the battle for survival of the rebellion.The story was interesting, the acting was great, the music was different, the effects both practical and digital were flawless, the tone was on spot, the little fan service was put in elegantly, and Vader was... well, you'll see ;). It has a bit of a pacing problem in the first act (maybe because of the re-shoots) but it gets better as it goes.Rogue One is a welcome addition to the Star Wars universe, which manages to entertain, amaze and move!

"A welcome addition to the universe, but misses the greatness of the better Star Wars movies...","After the resounding success of ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" Lucasarts Studios has rewarded the loyal Star Wars fans with a film that would introduce us to the story about how the rebel alliance exactly got to the plans of the ' Death Star' in the beginning of the movie where it all started. In this way, the film builds on the success that Star Wars with her first 3 films has amassed, which is a very smart choice. We can't exactly say the same about the prequels sadlySay what you want but the pre- quels were now not really a bull's eye. The story focuses around Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones), who from an early age since losing her parents, took on a rebellious path which has proved quite troublesome for The Empire apparently. When she meets Cassian Andor (Diego Luna), a member of the Rebel Alliance, she unwittingly lands into a plot against The Empire. Gradually the two in contact with various individuals who all have reason enough to join the group. The most notable of which are the duo of Chirrut Îmwe a blind (force wielding) ninja-like fighter, his best buddy Baze Malbus and K-2SO ( a hilarious re-programmed Empire-droid, with a great use of sarcasm). The mission sounds simpler than it seems: getting a hold of the plans of the Death Star to prevent the whole Galaxy being under the power of The Empire.The 'Star Wars '-label on this film is both a curse as a blessing: on the one hand it brings the return to this ""Galaxy far far away"" nostalgia back. The grim post-apocalyptic atmosphere that the original trilogy had as well,finds its roots deep into this movie as well, the visual effects, the costumes and the overall atmosphere throughout this movies is a joy to watch and something you don't really find in a lot of movies nowadays.On the other hand, the fact that this film was clearly as a story 'leading up to' (although is already 40 years old) A New Hope, makes the film also firmly limited in its freedoms: While this movie has created so many things you want to know more about, the movie simply doesn't have enough time to go into much dept about them. The characters suffer the most here. Outside the main character, Jyn Erso, none of the Rogue-One group members get a lot of time to develop their backstory, their motives of really much of an arc. So you feel little to no involvement when they are in danger during the suspenseful scènes. You just know too little about these characters to experience a real commitment. When u have already seen the original trilogy (as I suspect you did), you also kind of know where this whole story is going. While this is not fully deal-breaking, it does take away a bit of it stakes throughout the movie. The film is also rather slow start during the first part and it really takes a while to get the movie going. The first half of the movie does need quite a long time to orient the events in the universe and sometimes this feels orchestrated. I had a feeling that throughout the movie the paths of the characters were already pretty much set and this gave me a a bit of a compromising experience. However, the biggest problem that this movie will probable face is the fact that it made bad use of its. By putting our most favorite bad guy in the Galaxy in the trailers a lot of Star Wars fans had high expectations for the screen time that Darth Vader would receive during the movie. Unfortunately Darth Vader only appears 2 scenes. Although one of the scenes was absolutely amazing to watch (you will know it when you see it), I can't deny that I was a bit bummed out by only seeing him this much. That being said, Rogue One does contain at his core something where every Star Wars fan instantly falls in love with. The fact that Rogue One also answers some questions where a lot of fans have been waiting for 40 years for, does make this movie relevant. There are also some very nice treats for the very attentive fans amongst us, who will be rewarded for knowing and remembering all of their Star Wars-trivia (bonus geek points!) Last but certainly not least the movie is also surprisingly funny, much credit here for goes to the sarcastic droid K-2SO (voiced by Alan Tudyk). All in all this movie is a welcome addition to the Star Wars universe. Star Wars fans that don't get their expectations too high will undoubtedly enjoy this movie. If you previously, however, weren't Star Wars fan was, this movie will not suddenly win you over.Conscensus: don't go with too many expectations to this movie (not sure if you have a lot of Darth Vader expected). The film comes when slow start but once the action starts, both action-fans as Star-wars lovers really enjoy this movie.

Outstanding!,"Without doubt, the best addition to the franchise since 'Empire strikes back'I was skeptical about this film because the amount of hype and following disappointment of 'The force awakens' left me with no hope at all for any upcoming star wars films... but Rogue One, you've given me a New Hope!The whole structure for the film was thoroughly constructed, nothing dragged on, and each scene played and important part. I was constantly on the edge of my seat that my partner had to tell me to calm down every so often! If you're a huge fan of the franchise, you will notice a lot of great nods to the original 3, but ill let you discover those.The acting was superb, I didn't cringe once from any line given, but out of every character, K-2SO won my heart!You don't want to miss this one in the cinemas, so grab a ticket before it's too late!

Will surely please hardened fans and newcomers in equal measure,"Following their procurement of Lucasfilm and the Star Wars franchise with it, it didn't take long for Disney to announce an all-new trilogy, continuing the legacy that was somewhat tarnished by George Lucas' terrible prequel trilogy beginning back in 1999. J.J. Abrams' The Force Awakens, aka Episode VII, predictably made a ton of money in 2015, despite being a thinly-disguised re-hash of Episode IV with a few new characters thrown into the mix, and soon enough announcements were being made of spin-offs and origin stories aplenty. Many rolled their eyes at what appeared to be an easy money-spinner, but many more were excited to see this vast universe - which had been explored to no end in books, video games and comic- books - come to life on the big screen, and Gareth Edwards' Rogue One is by far the finest Star Wars movie since The Empire Strikes Back.Set some time after The Revenge of the Sith but just before the events of A New Hope, the universe lives in terror as the Imperial Empire, led by the feared Darth Vader, seeks to crush the Rebellion and rule the galaxy. Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen) is forced by Imperial weapons researcher Orson Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) to complete his work on the Death Star, a device the size of a moon capable of destroying entire planets. Galen's young daughter escapes the Stormtroopers and is raised by Rebel extremist Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker). Years later and now a young woman, Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) is freed from a labour camp by Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) and is taken to Rebel leader Mon Mothma, who convinces her to help persuade her father to defect so they may learn more about the weapon he is building. Joined by a rag-tag gang of fighters and criminals, Jyn unwittingly finds herself at the centre of an impossible mission to steal plans to the Death Star, and playing her part in rescuing the universe from oppressive rule.Continuing the series' line of strong female leads after Carrie Fisher and Daisy Ridley, Jones' Jyn Erso stands out by not being a princess or a 'Chosen One' character, but a tough orphan without any stand-out skills other than sheer will and determination. She doesn't get any special treatment due to royal connections or suddenly start wielding the Force, but must shack up with an equally gruff and battered gang of unlikely heroes to stand any chance of survival. Her companions are as equally memorable and played by strong actors, without ever being defined for a unique attribute. With C-3PO off elsewhere, the comedy robot is K-2SO, a re-programmed Imperial droid voiced by Alan Tudyk who offers the movie such much- needed comic relief. There's also blind spiritual warrior Chirrut Imwe (Donnie Yen, who really looks like he's enjoying himself), his gun-wielding mercenary pal Baze Malbus (Wen Jiang), and defected pilot Bodhi Rook (Riz Ahmed).Any fans who adored the Easter eggs barely hidden in The Force Awakens will be pleased to know that there's no change here. As the timeline inevitably crosses over with A New Hope, many faces and events will be familiar. Even Peter Cushing is brought back via some impressive CGI work as Grand Moff Tarkin. Edwards ensures that these crowd-pleasing moments of nostalgia don't distract too much from the central plot, and he really goes all-out with the action scenes. Apparently, futuristic helmets were placed upon the heads of real soldiers in old war photographs by Edwards as an idea of how he felt the aesthetic of the battles should be. They pulled it off, as there's a real immediacy and grit to the fighting. and a clarity in the way it is captured. Donnie Yen going to town on some Imperial soldiers with a staff provided, for me at least, the film's highlight. While the film does move too fast for its own good on occasion, this is a thrilling experience, with characters far more interesting than those involving in the main story. It will surely delight hardened fans and newcomers in equal measure.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Possibly The Worse Movie Ever made,"I am a huge Star Wars fan. Rogue One is totally lame. This is the worst movie I have ever seen, forget Star Wars for a second, even as a stand alone movie it was utter rubbish. The acting in general was good except for Forest Whitaker who was way over the top and cringe worthy as was Donnie Yen. The CGI was good and gave the movie the Star Wars feel but the script was criminal and weak.If you are a fan of Aliens and the movie Predator, as I am, and somehow found yourself watching AVP and being hugely let down then Rogue One will have the same effect on you.It was so boring, i felt like going home and opening YouTube and watching a fan made Star Wars movie instead, they are no worse than this garbage.We all know that Star Wars movies have got worse over the years but to make a film as bad as this takes skill! I cannot believe movies like this are allowed to be made. It was a monotone attempt.

The Prequel That Should Have Been,"""Rogue One"" is somewhat an anomaly; it's the first non-Episode Star Wars film, set before the events of the original 1977 film, that is meant to show what led up to those events occurring, portraying the mission to retrieve the Death Star plans. The question is, does it live up to what it sets out to accomplish? In my opinion, yes, with a few issues along the way.One of the things this movie gets right is how much it ties into the Star Wars Universe. You have characters from both the prequel and original trilogy showing up here in the form of cameos or even as main plot devices. While some of these additions can feel forced at times, I would not have taken any of them away, and it reminds how connected this film is to the others.I also enjoyed, for the most part, the new characters. Felicity Jones does a good job as Jyn Erso and carries the movie well. We get to know a great deal about her backstory and the connection with her father (played by the always awesome Mads Mikkelson), which plays a huge role in the film. Diego Luna does a good job in the supporting character role, and his characters shows you a different side to the rebellion that we haven't seen before. Alan Tudyk is great as the comic-relief robot K-2SO, and Donnie Yen is great as Chirrut Imwe, who was a cool, almost Jedi-like character (he's not, in case anyone is wondering).The action is intense and fast paced, particularly in the film's final act, which is outstanding. You feel the intensity of every moment and the grittiness of the war that is going on. I'm not sure I would go with those who are saying that is a totally dark movie, but the film does end on a very bittersweet note that actually packed a lot of emotion within it. Visually, the film is also stunning, with most of the visual effects exceeding. Again, I love that they are using both practical and visual effects, something I look forward to see more of in the future.The film also does something that most prequels (including the Star Wars ones) fail to accomplish: it adds to the original. It fixes plot holes that were found in the original, but it also adds weight to the events found in A New Hope. You understand the gravity of this situation, how important it was and how much sacrifice went into it. It's nice to see this film accomplish that.And then of course we have to talk about Darth Vader, who plays a small but significant role in the film. This is the first time in the history of Star Wars that I was truly afraid of what Darth Vader could do. He's not in the film much, but nonetheless this is some of the best we've ever seen from the character, making you forget about the whiny Anakin from the prequels.Of course with any movie, there are flaws, and Rogue One's problems mainly have to do with its story, the character development in particular. There are some characters who were fleshed out fine (Jyn, Cassian, etc.), but then there were others where you didn't really get to learn the motivation behind their actions. I would have liked to have learned more about some of them. I also felt like the story, while overall consistent and well-written, was edited together very oddly. In the beginning of the film, we jumped from several different moments within the span of a couple of minutes. This may be due to the re-shoots that occurred a few months before this film's release, but still, it did feel like it could have been done better.Also, as good as the visual effects were in this film, there was a case of motion capture that I felt didn't work. I won't reveal which character they recreate, but anytime that character was on screen, it took me out of the movie. Sometimes it looked fine, mostly when the character was standing still, but whenever we saw their mouth move or their facial features, it reminded me of a video game. Another time it was used for a different character and it looked really good, but still, I think the motion capture could have been worked on a bit better.However, despite my problems with the movie, ""Rogue One"" is a phenomenal addition to the Star Wars universe and is, in many ways, the prequel that should have been. This is what many people, including myself, wish the Star Wars prequels had been, because not only does it connect the dots between films, it also adds weight and importance to the events of the original Star Wars. It may not be perfect, but with this film, Lucasfilm continues to prove that Star Wars is back and better than it has been in a while.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. And What a Story.,"Rogue One is a Star Wars film wholeheartedly, but it does make its own through showing a story that is an entertaining and necessary entry in the classic saga. This is a Star Wars movie unlike the ones, in that there is no opening crawl; instead we have a prologue developing some backstory on what's to follow. That may throw some audiences off for a bit, but what follows is a ride and a real experience and mandatory big screen viewing.I loved this film. Rogue One surprised me; and I'm sure it will surprise many others after the majority of audiences have seen it and finally give their thoughts on the movie. Despite the reports of reshoots covering a reported 20-40% of the story, Rogue One overcame all of those problems and gives a thoroughly entertaining experience that doesn't feel at all like boring or by-the-numbers canon; and for that I congratulate Gareth Edwards. If only I could actually shake his hand with him in person.Is Rogue One flawless? No. Does it need to be? No. Does it provide genuine entertainment and escapism for your hard-earned cash? Yes; absolutely. And don't worry. It doesn't bog down into unnecessary exposition or anything like Episodes I & II suffered from. Rogue One gets right down to the action and shows a story of war and the devastation it leaves in its wake. But never forget that there's always hope.'Rebellions are built on hope'- Jyn Erso.And yes; The Force is strong with this one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Had a Blast!,"I usually don't like war movies, they're something my dad and younger brother like very much, but for me, they are too loud and the camwera never stays steady and there's little to no romance or cuteness. Not in the Star Wars universe! Especially under the watchfuil, talented eye of Kathereen Kennedy. This smoothly moviing epic tale involves a love story, family matters, cute aliens, mean villains and lot's of heart. The excellent lead character , Jyn Arso is a heroine I could get behind, as a girl she reminded me of me and I was instantly involved in her sweeping story, filled with adventure and excitement as soon as she is freed from her *spoiler* prison and asked to join the rebellion team in which she bravely and bodly accepts! You won't be let down by this blockbuster, as good as the best of Star Wars, especially The Force Awakens! The supporting cast was fun too, especially the robot guy.

The only Star Wars series I like since the original or first one of the trilogy's!,"It's not always the plot or the story that makes the movie. It takes a special kind of personality like Felicity Jones ! Being Italian gave her looks. Growing up in the industry got her step in the door industry.

His disciple Peter asked if the parable was for just them or for everyone. Jesus replied with another parable in which He defines the ""faithful and wise manager"" as one who gives out food and other allowances ""at the proper time."" When the master returns and finds the faithful servant managing his resources well, he ""put him in charge of all his possessions"" (Luke 12:42-44). We have been entrusted with certain things, and faithfulness requires that we manage those things wisely and unselfishly.God gives us resources such as finances and time, talents such as culinary skills or musical ability, and spiritual gifts such as encouragement or teaching. We should ask God for wisdom on how to use those resources and commit ourselves to expending them according to His will so that He may be glorified. In regards to spiritual gifts, Paul said, ""We have different gifts, according to the grace given to each of us. If your gift is prophesying, then prophesy in accordance with your faith; if it is serving, then serve; if it is teaching, then teach; if it is to encourage, then give encouragement; if it is giving, then give generously; if it is to lead, do it diligently; if it is to show mercy, do it cheerfully"" (Romans 12:6-8).

Mind blown. I thought I'd never experience Star Wars this way again since 1977,"...when I was 3 years old.This movie had me literally at the edge of my seat, hands sweaty.

I felt fear when the most famous bad**s of all time was back. I was exhilarated. I cried. I cheered. I had a new hope at the end of it all.This is what the prequels should have been, instead of the garbage Lucas dumped on us. This is what we deserved all along. This is Star Wars, all grown up.

Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,"Rogue One is the first film of a set of anthology films that is based during the Star Wars saga, when it was announced people were eager and anticipating the possibility of what the film offers, safe to say that what we see is nostalgic, epic driven and a true prequel that puts the original trilogy in place.Taking place between the film events of Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope, we are introduced to the events that lead to the very beginning of AHP. Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) is rescued by the Rebel Alliance to help locate her estranged father, who was earlier abducted by Imperial Empire and was a key creator to the Death Star, the Empire's ultimate weapon to conquer the galaxy. With new allies on her side and enough hope to change the future, Jyn and the Rebels race in time to find the weapon's schematics, thus setting the events of the famous first film we know and love.What I really enjoyed about this film was Gareth Evans's eye on detail and representation to the continuity and universe of the franchise, he does manage to make the film feel as closer to the original trilogy than the recent episode VII (which is pretty much a year old now), he gives a fresh coat of new characters, intriguing concept and a satisfying style that gives light for the film. The cast as a whole handle themselves to the level of great and convincing, with Oscar nominated actress Felicity Jones playing the lead female hero, Diego Luna (Blood Father) playing her ally and Rebel Intelligence officer Cassian, Australia's own Ben Mendelsohn (Bloodline, Killing Me Softly, Animal Kingdom) as the convincing villain with a purpose Orson and Alan Tudyk (I, Robot, Wreck It Ralph, Tucker & Dale vs Evil) as K-2SO being the standouts.The visual effects we know from Star Wars is as amazing and incredible is present again, with incredible use of practical and CGI work that takes it to a level of respect for the series. The music score by Michael Giacchino (Doctor Strange, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes) is engaging throughout, with use of John William's original music from the trilogy incorporated to key moments.Lastly, the storyline itself pretty much summarizes how a prequel should work if you take it to heart of the original trilogy (take note of the first three prequels). With moments of character connection, development, action set pieces and set ups to AHP, this literally should have been the only prequel to be made rather than Episodes I, II, and III.Overall, Rogue One is an epic piece of pure nostalgia and fun for all old and new fans of the franchise, with a solid eye on direction, story, production value, visual effects work and key references and connections to the original trilogy. Well worth the ticket price to watch, even for its engaging and action packed climax.4.5/5 - The Autistic Reviewers",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"For once in a space age, a decent Star Wars movie.","I had nearly given up on these maudlin Star Wars movies but this one, is indeed very good (if not at times, exciting). A tight script, nice action sequences and capturing some of the magic of the very first three.

A must see that you already know how it ends.,"Wow! What a phenomenal movie to see. It ends exactly where ""A New Hope"" beings at creating a perfect story line leaving out very few details. The last 45 minutes were surely the best, with the last 5 minutes being edge of the seat action. You know how the movie ends but getting to that point will blow your mind with some of the best effects, scenery and action that have yet to come out of a SW movie. Keep an eye out for quick cameos, they are all over during the movie as well. This movie is far superior to ""The Force Awakens"" which was minimally decent at the most.

Absolutely Incredible!,"This film is the epitome of a fan's movie. Director Gareth Edwards has been a fan of Star Wars his entire life, and has described making this movie as being able to play with his action figures again. And let me just say that this movie is the visual representation of that statement. I was in awe of just how spectacular the visuals were. The third act of this movie consists of the Rebel's attempt to retrieve the plans, and it turns into an all out war, and it's absolutely magnificent. We are really at the height of Star Wars, simply because we now have the technology to portray the audaciousness of the idea of the franchise. We can show space battles and X-Wings and AT-ATs in the true way they were meant to be shown, and it makes for some of the most visually compelling and gripping imagery ever shown in a Star Wars movie. I cannot stress enough just how great the third act truly is. I will say in full confidence that this film has the best action sequences from any Star Wars movie. Others in say A New Hope or The Empire Strikes Back are more impressive because of what they were able to accomplish with their means and limitations, but Rogue One has the greatest looking sequences Star Wars has ever put to screen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Not your typical Stars Wars movie,"OK so to start we really were excited to go see this. With it like making a billion dollars in total sales it must be awesome. First of all its a long movie 2hrs 13 minutes long and with the 9 previews close to 3 rs. Second Expecting the John Williams soundtrack with the powerful horns and strings intro. NOPE its a new score of some sort. Reminds me of the sound someone was suppose to come with each time you entered the building in Transformers Age of Extinction uninspiring and flat. Then of course the black space shot pan up or down planet or battle shot. We pan down to a planet and an imperial ship landing on it. This movie starts out slow. Really slow compared to the other ones. So sit back and wait for it. Finally we get to meet Sau Gurerro. OK Hess like the rebels Darth Vader but not terrifying like Darth is. The facial overlays the CG isn't that good Clearly their faces are lighted differently than the surrounding lighting.Now here's the important part. A lot of people die in this film. possibly billions of them. Anyone you get attached to in the movie, well Don't cuz they DIE. Everybody dies. WTH? This is the most depressing of all the films. No Jedi no force no sabers other than vader. Its really cool we find out how the Deathstar weapon is designed and what powers it. This thing is terrifying. We get to see up close very up close shots of what it does and how the planets are ripped apart.One thing I wish they did differently is not show us Anakin in his recovery chambers without the Darth life suit on. I don't know without Georges touches and Abrahams guidance on it. its turns into basically the battle of Iwo Jima and the quest for the Enigma box.WE do get see a very well done battle though a very long one. That was a new site to behold. Also loved the new U wing fighter transport and yes my fave the Y wings show up in this to. It does segway right into Episode 4 really well. I don't know if I'm adding this to our collection in the future. WE have every version of the other Star Wars movies.If you are expecting the old Star Wars film style. Don't.

A Decent Movie,"Star Wars: Rogue One isn't like the normal Star Wars Films you see. Rogue One is unique and original. If you were looking for a backstory on the older series, then that is not what you'll find.The movie itself is a little boring, and they drag the story on and on, until the watcher wants to slam their head against the wall. They put it into two hours, when the backstory is simple and could only take an hour, maybe an hour and a half.The movie is nice though. If you were looking for special effects, you have possibly one of the best movies for that.I'd give it a 7/10, clearly lacking, but still enjoyable.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Unnecessary but entertaining,I guess you would call this an insertaquel as it is inserted between episode 3 and 4 and fills in a couple gaps leading to the very first movie released. There are certainly some characters from previous movies throughout this one. It does take 2 hours of your time to fill in the background on how the information for attacking the death star came about. That could have been accomplished in about 10 minutes. There were some good battles with good graphics and they sure were better shots than any of the other movies. I think the biggest benefit will come in marketing new toys of the new spacecraft that appear in this movie,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A very pleasant modern nod to  classic Star Wars.,"The prequel sequel spin off movie set before a New Hope, arrives following the journey of the group of Rebels who are on a mission to steal the plans for the completed Death Star.Gareth Edwards (Monsters) executes a perfectly superb Star Wars spin off, the old and new. Bringing Star Wars fans on a history trip back in time to the excitement of Star Wars in the early days, and packing a real exciting punch. With a brilliantly developed ensemble cast, led by Felicity Jones, Rogue One transports us across the galaxy into a fantastically moving and fun journey.Jyn Erso (Jones) is an orphaned rogue criminal lost in her way, until she is recruited by the Rebels to help fight against the Empire and find out about this new ultimate weapon. Allying with a very diverse group of Rebels, they must all come together to bring hope to the galaxy and face the dreaded Empire.Now that Disney have brought back Star Wars, they are going to do as much as they can to squeeze as much money out of our pockets. Buts it's worth it if they make dam good movie. Therefore Rogue One very much is an introduction to the future planned prequels on the way.The main inescapable issue with prequels and sequels, especially if they are part of a franchise that's about 30-40 years old, there is clearly going to be a change in the tone and atmosphere of the films depending on when they were made. So its sometimes hard to believe the events your watching are meant to take place in the same universe as a film that came out in 1977. But Rouge One pulls it off with a sensational final act, expressing the full and beautiful pride that us geeks and fans have in the Star Wars Franchise.Rouge One is its own story, but is still Star Wars, with a relatively slow and averagely entertaining first act, and second act, the film build us up to the ultimate climax. With the Force Awakens only being released a year ago, Gareth Edwards shows us that they have not forgotten the original series that started it all. Thankfully with an appropriate amount of jokes as well, mostly derived from the obnoxious droid K2SO (Alan Tudyk) I personally much prefer this to Force Awakens, as it captures what I love in Star Wars. I do like the Force Awakens but I have a lot of issues with it.Although fairly rough around the edges and a final act that makes and steals the whole film, Rouge One is what the fans want, a modern yet classic Star Wars tale, with a several cameos, and the pure pride of being Star Wars. 9.0/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Great addition to Star Wars, and hopefully the first of many...","Rogue One, being the first of many to come in Disney's new anthology to act in conjunction with the main 'Skywalker' branch is really anything but a spin off. It is a film that fits seamlessly between episodes 3 & 4 filling in gaps and possible plot holes of the original film ""A New Hope"".In many ways this film is episode 3.5 due to its ability to fill in and reference points from the original trilogy, and with lingering throwback shots of C3-PO, R2-D2 and blue milk aside, some of the reused sequences featuring original trilogy cast members in unison with amazingly done CGI work: as most Star Wars fans could probably attest to the fledgling nature of it's practice in the prequel trilogy, were used to great effect in bringing back minor and major characters alike. Of particular note being Grand Moff Tarkin originally portrayed by the great Peter Cushing, who is just about brought back from the dead to aid new cast members.Felicity Jones and Ben Mendelsohn among others were inspired casting choices that paid dividends in bringing the film to life, with each and every character requiring, almost disappointingly, brief introductions before the main plot line, that inferred their place within the Star Wars universe paving the way for a visually powerful story that serves to unite them as The Rebellion.The imagery was astounding with particular emphasis on scenery establishing shots that really showed the depth of planetary source material available to Gareth Edwards's, with the opening scene on Lah'mu being an excellent example of traditionalist Star Wars trope emphasizing that although this is not Star Wars, it still remains within the same world. And as always, a classic orchestral score, this time composed by Michael Giacchino: a worthy successor to John Williams, aids in the creation of a powerful atmosphere in unison with costume design to recreate that original Star Wars feel that Lucas and others formed over 3 decades ago.Ultimately the story of Rogue One was entirely predictable, obviously leading into A New Hope, but that did not stop this film from providing laughs, thrills and intrigue that have become synonymous within Star Wars mythology and as a great fan of the series I can only hope that each iteration of this new anthology is as good as the last.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best since Empire!,"This is my first review on IMDb, here goes nothing!The bottom line is that Rogue One captures the essence of the Rebellion. The spirit, sacrifices and urgency of events are serious and as a watcher of the film, you do feel connected to the characters and their cause in fighting the Empire.This film to me was finally a return back to the gritty, believable elements that my personal favorite Empire Strikes Back, and A New Hope covered so well. The characters, there actions and the feel of the film was realistic and natural. It was not forced (no pun intended!!), gimmicky or glossed over with that Disney type feel so nobody's feelings are hurt. Even the comic relief is delivered in a very believable, well thought out way.I hope they don't change the Rogue series formula! Great job by everyone involved to keep to the true roots of the original Star Wars films.If you liked the original Star Wars Movie ""A New Hope"", and felt for each of the Rebellion Pilots (such as Red Leader) as they attacked the Death Star, you will love Rogue One! If you liked Empire Strikes Back and felt for the Rebellion fighters on Hoth (such as Dak Ralter), you will love Rogue One! Finally, a film fully dedicated to the ""normal"" men & women of the rebellion. Enjoy!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A worthy addition to the canon,"I caught myself, as the final battle of ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY was enfolding, smiling to myself.  I had a warm feeling in my heart and realized that THIS is the Universe I wanted to spend more time with.You can have your MARVEL CINEMATIC UNIVERSE or your DC UNIVERSE or even your HARRY POTTER UNIVERSE, for me the best universe is the STAR WARS UNIVERSE.And, following the bright return to this universe of THE FORCE AWAKENS,  ROGUE ONE is a welcome addition and really gives me A NEW HOPE for this expanded world (see what I did there?).Telling the story of how the rebels stole Death Star plans just prior to the original Star Wars movie (now called STAR WARS EPISODE IV: A NEW HOPE), Rogue One follows plucky heroine Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) who leads a rag-tag group of misfits (is there any other kind) who plan a daring raid to steal the plans to the Empire's newest weapon THE DEATH STAR.Jones is fine (if a bit bland) as Erso (but I think it is the way the character is written), HOWEVER,  it is the band of misfits around her that really shine.  Diego Luna is solid and stalwart as gung-ho Rebel Leader Cassian Andor, Riz Ahmed is sensitive and caring as Bodhi Rook, an Empire pilot who defects to the Rebellion and Baze Malbus and (espcially) Donnie Yen as friends and compatriots Baze Malbus and would-be Jedi Chirrut Imwe.  These 5 are fun to watch together and I, for one, would like to see more of their adventures.But, stealing this movie from all of them, is the 6th member of the gang - Alan Tudyk's marvelous motion-capture droid, K-2SO - an Imperial droid that has been reprogrammed to work with the rebellion.But these heroes wouldn't be worth it if it wasn't for the villains they are up against.  Ben Mendelsohn is at his Ben Mendelsohn-y best as opportunistic, ambitious Imperial Director Orson Krennic, the mastermind behind the Death Star.  Also, the filmmakers found out a way to bring back long dead Peter Cushing as Grand Moff Tarkin.   I've heard some negative things about this CGI attempt to bring Cushing back, but it worked for me.  And, of course, there is a certain heavy-breathing, dark-cloaked Super Villain that shows up to bring menace, fear and some kick-buttery.And that is another thing that works for me in this film, the way the filmmakers brought in other elements of the the original Star Wars film and melded it very well into this film.  It was fun the recognize these Easter Eggs when they occurred (though, on 2 occasions, they were jarring and took me out of the film).Is it a perfect film?  Well...no.  The middle sags a bit and I felt that both Forest Whitaker and Mads Mikkelsen were wasted in their roles (the filmmakers could have easily found an interesting ""no name"" to play these roles), but these are nits as director Garth Edwards brings the action at a fast and furious pace, throwing in bits for the fanboys here and there and delivering a story with real stakes that dovetails nicely into Episode IV.  As a matter of fact, we went right home and popped in our well used DVD copy of Episode IV and my 16 year old daughter stated that this film made much more sense to her now.Which, I think, is what the filmmakers want.  Skip Episodes I, II and III but see Rogue One ""the prequel that always should have been"" - a well made addition to the Star Wars canon.9 (out of 10) Star (wars) and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"After watching Andor, it makes rogue one mediocre at best","Andor is without a doubt the absolute best Star Wars show that Disney's ever produced , and it might be the best show on TV this year.In comparison it makes Rogue One look silly, especially the first half of the movie which doesn't make a lot of sense and has very poor plot points and explanations. Although the final battle does make up for the poor beginning.As an aside when Cassian is locked in prison in the holy city there's a major inconsistency that's pretty funny, he says he's never been locked up like this before lmao.They made a big mistake letting Garreth Edwards direct Rogue One, he's not very good at directing actors. Disney should have given it to Tony Gilroy from the beginning, not only that he should be given production oversight to to any future Star wars productions he just gets it and his written dialogue is excellent.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I have a really good feeling about this!,"Spoiler free and brief review:Pros:Ip Man Kicks Butt - Donnie Yen, who plays Chirrut Îmwe, a force sensitive blind monk who outmatches any opponent.Story - Most Star Wars fans know the general story line and how it answers the opening crawl of 'A New Hope.' I strongly feel they covered and told the story line phenomenally with 'Rogue One.'Character Development - The characters are very interesting and had me seeking to know more of their back stories, especially the story behind Chirrut Îmwe, portrayed by Donnie Yen. Overall, with character development I strongly feel that 'Rogue One' gave us a great understanding of all the characters part of the Rogue One team and the role they played in such a critical mission.Special Effects - One word.. stunning!Acting - The acting was as expected, it was great and met standard, especially with that cast.. ""bad acting"" is unheard of and impossible.Vader - He returns yet very briefly in 'Rogue One' but the scenes are well chosen for how he is portrayed in the film. Vader lovers are in for a treat! Trust me, one of the scenes with Vader will have you in tears because he has returned!Cons:Character CGI - Easily noticeable, was a little iffy at first, but I can now accept it for what it is. It's a minor thing and it will only improve in the future.Have to wait another year until the next Star Wars film.Conclusion:Go see it, you'll be amazed! I am already seeing it again on Monday!Gareth Edwards, my hat is tipped off to you. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best Star Wars movie in any trilogy,"Hands down, ROGUE ONE replaced Empire Strikes Back as the updated all time Star Wars movie of all time, bar none. From start to finish this is an exquisite and refined production with attention to detail. I also commend the superb casting, it could not have been any better IMO. This movie should stand as the Star Wars standard for a long time until maybe a better one comes around but I doubt it.The editing of this film was paired down to the bare bones as I could see it. Some have critisized it as squeezing in some time at the end when it was merged with SW'ers ep#4. But as you can see, there was plenty of allotted time at the end to tell the end of the story.Enjoy!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Now witness the firepower of this fully ARMED and OPERATIONAL battle station!...Again...some more...,"To be fair, it IS the same Death Star from ANH, so technically there've only been three of them out of (now) eight movies. Yes, this is a prequel (Episodes I-III being prequels *wasn't* what the problem was with those movies), but thankfully it's the GOOD kind. Though you more or less know what's going to happen, it's the journey that matters...and it's one hell of a journey. Felicity Jones, as always, is absolutely lovely in her performance here as Jyn Erso (to those haters: bite your tongues, heathens!). Her father, Galen (Mads Mikkelsen, making the most of his screen time and sharing some emotionally effective scenes with his daughter both young and grown-up), finally addresses the exhaust port ""plot hole"" in the Death Star from the previous movies that was subject of much parody.Jones, who was done a disservice in Inferno, is given better material to work with here (though I'd hoped for a different ending with her this time around). Her ability to convey the emotional/physical sides of Jyn convincingly shows why she was cast as the hardened 'badarse'. Jyn isn't 'perfect', doesn't do 'everything'/things nobody else can; she's flawed/makes mistakes and doesn't save the day all by herself. She's supported by a diverse group of characters who each bring something to the table, starting with Diego Luna's character, Cassian Andor, who's equally the hero Jyn is. They play off each other well; they fight/argue, rescue each other, and save the day together. Both actors do a remarkable job of giving their characters complexity, depth and building a believable relationship in enough time that by the end it truly resonates on an emotional level.The same goes for the rest of the 'Rogue One' team. The best of which is robotic K-2SO, brought to life by Alan Tudyk. His dry line deliveries provide much of the movie's humour, but his character's also useful, his different relationships with Cassian and Jyn allow for many good moments, and he's definitely a character you'll care for by the end. Donnie Yen is also excellent as Chirrut Îmwe, who is ""one with the Force"" (and the Force is with him). Plus, he got the biggest laugh in my theatre. Rounding out the team are Wen Jiang as Baze Malbus and Riz Ahmed as Bodhi Rook. Each one's important and given time to shine, their camaraderie is earned over the course of the movie so the ending has maximum impact (people in my cinema had obviously grown attached to these characters, given their reactions). The movie truly feels like an ensemble piece. Those with less screen time, such as Forest Whitaker's Saw Gerrera and Genevieve O'Reilly as Mon Mothma (the spitting image of the original actress), are also good in their roles. Meanwhile, Ben Mendelsohn clearly knows exactly what type of movie he's in with his portrayal of Orson Krennic.There're numerous character cameos (from both the OT and PT), some de-aging and even resurrecting of certain actors from the OT (which is quite the feat/impressive, although over-use of the latter spoils it a bit), and shout-outs/callbacks to the previous movies. Stormtroopers still have their classic bad aim. Darth Vader's in a small scene partway through the movie (he has a castle!), not reappearing until much later, but when he DOES...it's glorious/all you've ever wanted to see from him and *then* some. Watching him go to town with his lightsaber will make many fans happy, I'm sure. It's good to see him being scary again (the incomparable voice of James Earl Jones is as awesome/menacing as ever) after the PT nearly ruined him. Thankfully, there's no one word exclamations that make him sound like a sad cow this time. The directing's exciting (Gareth Edwards uses scale well), the action's thrilling, there's some great set pieces, the scenery on the different planets looks amazing (especially Scarif) and it's so good to be in this universe again, as Star Wars does 'space opera' like nobody else can (my audience was made up of a variety of different people, all clearly Star Wars fans, who cheered at various points throughout the film and applauded when the credits rolled, commenting how great the movie was). However, I wish that not such a significant portion of scenes/lines/moments from the trailers were missing from the actual movie. The music/score was also a bit much at times.To those with issues regarding Jyn Erso as the film's 'lead', comparing her to Daisy Ridley as Rey, and/or whining about the use of more than one British brunette female character in the new SW movies, Felicity Jones said it best: ""They both have dark hair and talk funny to you Americans and they're both in Star Wars...but, yes, remarkably two young British women CAN exist in the same cinematic galaxy. I know, CRAZY!"". The ""Is Jyn Rey's mother?"" question is also answered definitively. As for the ridiculous claims of ""too many of the same 'type' of woman"" in the new movies, I'm sure there being two American males as the leads spanning across six movies wasn't regarded as ""repetitive"", so why so here? Why are there those threatened by women playing fictitious lead roles in movies when it's so often been men previously? Does the anger stem from there being CHANGE from what you think Star Wars 'should' be? And anyone who disagrees with your assessment has the same lazy over-used terms such as ""Mary Sue"" (apparently used for female characters who are skilled at more than one thing or get any sort of focus) and ""Social Justice Warrior/SJW"" tossed at them in place of actual solid justifiable arguments. There's this thing called 'confirmation bias' where, once you've made up your mind, everything will feed into your existing beliefs/theories/interpretation and you'll ignore anything you don't wish to hear. A word of advice: get over it. In the end, this is a movie about hope, and as for the naysayers...I find your lack of faith disturbing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Expanded Universe becomes official spin off,"The Star Wars canon has been revived (following earlier tangents for the Ewoks), with miscreant Felicity Jones recruited by the rebellion to help locate the Death Star's famous weakness which is the spine to the climax of the original episode A New Hope (ANH). In the Star Wars lineage, Rogue One occurs between Revenge of the Sith and ANH.Reckon Flick Jones is going to be crowned most feisty/sexy Star Wars female character in the galaxy once this goes viral, such are her cherub-like facial features tempered by the grit and attitude of a space cowboy. She's no princess, but a package of galactic goodness all the same. Aussie Ben Mendelsohn is also inspired casting, a menacing Director Krennic whose tactical positioning in the Empire hierarchy adds another layer to a character that could easily have just become another cliché. The remaining cast has depth and there's a couple of surprises in supporting roles which might evoke some fond memories of the original trilogy, though I'm not too sure the CGI character was such a good idea, despite perhaps being well intentioned.Overall I was pleased with this retrospective; it wasn't as derivative as TFA, Flick Jones really stands-out from the new breed acting crowd, and was a good balance of homage and originality. Whether the franchise has enough original material to crank these out in annual procession til 2020 is seriously debatable, but Rogue One is a pretty decent benchmark on which to start a new generation of spin-offs.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A New Hope for the Alliance,"""Rogue One"" relates the events leading up to the beginning of ""A New Hope,"" explaining how the Rebel Alliance got its hands on the plans for the Death Star. In tone, it's far more somber than any of its predecessors. The characters are all beleaguered revolutionaries, and the predominant mood of the film is gritty resolve. By definition, this means that this entry is lacking the sense of whimsy and adventure that defined the original trilogy, and its biggest flaw for me was the absence of compelling and colorful characters.But on its own terms this is a worthy entry in the ""Star Wars"" canon, and I think I liked it more than ""The Force Awakens."" While that film certainly had fun and adventure to spare, it was thinly written; in contrast, ""Rogue One"" has a much richer and more sophisticated screenplay. The last quarter of the movie is incredibly exciting, taking the story right up to where ""A New Hope"" starts, and I dare any true ""Star Wars"" fan not to mist up at the very last scene.I had a lot of trouble getting past the absence of the iconic ""Star Wars"" themes (John Williams did not do the music for this one). Brief strains of them occur here and there throughout the movie, and the main theme plays during the end credits, so I'm not sure why the original music couldn't have been incorporated more robustly into the entire film.Grade: A",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good but not special,I really didn't know that to think going in. I really had no idea what the movie was even about so I went in with little in the way of preconceived notions.Rogue One is not quite the fanboy orgy that Force Awakens was. Though it is there you just have to look a little closer. The beginning is very jumbled and a bit clunky. Not a deal breaker though. The ending in my mind has the greater sin in trying really too hard to tie hen into A New Hope. So forcibly is it tied in that it renders part of the start of A New Hope into contradiction.The characters are good but nothing really to make you feel all that much for any of them.I really wanted to like them but nothing.Really this film I would say is on par with Revenge of the Sith so a middle of the road film that does it's job but won't really be remembered. Heck it doesn't even get a number. Though considering that that number would be 0 I suppose I can get why they went this way.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Remove ""Star Wars"" label and this is a total FLOP","Yikes, I kept looking around the packed theater wondering, why are all these people here? Totally boring movie, bad acting, awful character development, silly plot, same old tired space fights and fake drama, no emotion, nothing uplifting or meaningful to it. If this wasn't part of the Star Wars brand, it would be an stunning and total flop. Nobody could realistically watch or enjoy this movie on its own merits. But slap the Star Wars label on it and it gets massive reviews and box office success. Absurd! I was with 3 kids.

This should have been the Star Wars comeback of 2015,"Warning: Possible spoilers ahead.I've been an IMDb user from day one but this is not my primary account. Since the forums were shut down I only visited the site with this one. Anyway...My comment would not be a review if the forums were still alive but here it goes.This movie is truly a respectable tribute to Star Wars. It should have premiered before that awful episode 7 from J.J. Abrams. And definitely should be the box-office hit that episode 7 was.The story is believable, the narrative is well paced and has a clear direction. The characters are well introduced. The casting is great. The actor's performance was amazing (Forrest Whitaker, although I love the guy, might have overacted a bit). Donnie Yen was amazing. I would definitely watch a movie with his adventures.Lots of throwback moments: great sceneries, loads of vehicles (Tie-fighters, X-wings, AT-AT, Shuttles, Imperial Destroyer, Death Star,...), Darth Vader (he even fights rebel troops!), R2D2, C3PO, dogfights, storm-troopers vs rebels, etc.My only pet peeve was the human CGI characters (Tarkin and Leia). Although the animation was great you can clearly notice they are CGI. They could find another way of tying this story to the other story lines (eps. 1 to 7).That's pretty much it. Money people should give this director some credit and some more monies and let him do his thing.(bring the forums back m0r0n5)",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Star Wars is back, baby!!!","Episode 7 had me disappointed big time, and any interest i could have had for the future episodes of Star Wars was already in drain. Apparently, that is not case with Rogue One. If anything, it has rekindled the lost interest in Star Wars.Most importantly, it is nice dedicated finish to fit the classic Trilogy that was much missing earlier which is now complete. Dare i say, this is indeed complete set of Star Wars saga. I urge everyone to watch this movie especially those who are disappointed with Episode 7 can seek to relive on Rogue One.

The first Star Wars anthology works well,"To preface I did read Catalyst: A Star Wars story before watching the movie so my opinion is through that eye. This movie for me was amazing. I mean I really loved this film quite a bit. I don't think I enjoyed it as much as I did with Force Awakens, but I still came out with a huge grin on my face when it was all over.The film starts a little bit slow. It takes time to introduce all the characters and tie up some plot points that were left in the book. The movie is a bit bumpy with the lack of a opening crawl which I felt was a huge issue for me and something this movie could of used to better set the scene and explain to fans where this movie takes place in the Star Wars time line.But from the second act to the last the movie really ramps up and gets really intense. Characters die at the hands of enemies. Things start to falter very quickly as the rebels fight to make sure that the death star hands don't get back into the hands of the Empire before it is to late for things to change.The character of Krennic is a really interesting character who you can't help but feel bad for. This is a man who wanted nothing than to be accepted by Darth Vader and Tarkin as a equal, but sadly was never able to do that as the two absolutely shun him away, and never hear him out.Felicity Jones I thought could of used a bit more depth to her character though. We get some idea of what type of person she is and her back story, but it sadly isn't enough to really make us care about her in the way we do for some of the other characters.This whole film really is lacking in the character department as it focuses a lot on plot. And that is a little bit of a hindrance and makes it not as fun and vibrant as the Force Awakens, but even so it is still a very strong film that is a much needed add on to the rest of the Star Wars universe.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
overly melodramatic,"This Star Wars movie is for all those who didn't see the original episodes IV, V and V, because if they did they would already know how the rebels got the information about how to destroy the Death Star.

Once you seen one imperial walker and X-wing fighter battle you've seen them all.I felt really bad for Forest Whitaker, this is a terrible role; good thing he wasn't on screen long. The only good performances were by dead Peter Cushing and the re-purposed imperial droid. It's time for some new ideas Hollywood.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

New hope...,"""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" is an Action - Sci-Fi movie which is also a prequel of Star Wars in which we watch a desperate mission of the Rebel Alliance against the Empire. The mission's goal is to steal the plans of a new super weapon that the Empire has, the Death Star. Since we already knew that Princess Leigh had the Death Star plans, we will now watch how she got them and what exactly happen.I liked very much this movie because it had an amazingly interesting plot with many plot twists that I couldn't even imagine. Since I had already watched all the previous Star Wars movies I had some questions and one of those questions was how Princess Leigh had the Death Star plans, and in this movie, this big question is explained. Regarding the direction which was made by Gareth Edwards, it was simply outstanding with many great scenes, much of action and plenty of mystery. About the interpretations, I have to admit that I had high expectations from Felicity Jones who played as Jyn Erso and not only reached her potential but I also believe that she was simply amazing. Some other good interpretations that have to be mentioned were Donnie Yen who played as Chirrut Îmwe, Diego Luna who played as Cassian Andor and Wen Jiang who played as Baze Malbus.Finally, I have to say that ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" is a great prequel movie which answers some very important questions. It has a very interesting plot, many great interpretations made by its cast and an outstanding direction. If you are a fan of Star Wars then you just have to watch this movie because I am sure that you are going to love it and you won't be disappointed at all.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An Honest Review,"So, there seems to be two main points that the real haters are focusing on.1) Fanfiction 2) SJW propaganda.Now, I do believe these are both reactions to, well, The Force Awakens. The first just being a hatred for Rey, who was a Mary Sue and one that gave the entire movie a fanfiction feel.And where that is true for The Force Awakens, its not Rogue One, at least it is not Rogue One if we are staying in the Star Wars universe...it COULD be fanfiction if someone warped Saving Private Ryan into the Star Wars universe and...yeah, not, It's not fan fiction.The Second point, the SJW one, well, that could honestly also be a backlash against The Force Awakens as, yeah, anyone that called Rey a Mary Sue was accused of being a misogynist for, well...reasons.Specifically for reasons that had NOTHING to do with why they didn't like Rey--at least why most people didn't like her...most.And, in Rogue One, if the cast is multi-cultural of ominous political agenda reasons...it doesn't really feel that way. The diversity works and it works because you don't really notice it unless people point it out to complain about it.....and the people that do, yeah, it is likely because of The Force Awakens and they are forgetting that this takes place in a Galaxy Far, Far Away and, well, by definition they are all aliens anyway, so, you know, trying to force diversity in a movie entirely comprised of according to Hoyle aliens...wouldn't that mean a LOT more alien looking aliens? So, a lot of that is lingering from The Force Awakens and, well, some of it is understandable, if not for the movie itself than because of the backlash against people that thought Rey was entirely too perfect.Another reason for that hate could be a lack of lightsaber battles and, I really feel the fanboys on this one...but, no, really this was a Star Wars movie that felt like a war movie and the lack of blatant force powers and lightsabers until the very end worked...In fact it worked so well you did kind of get a Saving Private Ryan feel off the movie, a lone rogue squad taking on the entire Nazi?...Sith?...the entire Intergalactic Empire.It was really fun to watch and, not sense the Evacuation at Dunkirk that was the planet Hoth, did we see a Star Wars ground battle that really looked like it was a war. So this was pretty cool.And then there is Jyn. Now a lot of hate gores to her and I can't figure out why. She seemed like a real character. Rey could have been a feminist SJW transplant that was made super awesome because...reasons. But Jyn had serious flaws, she had issues, she seemed like a real person. So props to Felicity Jones for bringing that awesomeness to life.No, seriously, props to her. Outside of Solo, I really don't think I've seen a Star Wars character I thought was that, well, cool, real, just fun in the way that you could point to her and say ""I could know someone like that."" There were other cool characters in the saga...but none as realistically portrayed. And that doesn't just go for Jones.The only main character that doesn't seem like a real person was Chirrut Îmwe and, well, we can forgive him for that because he was the kung-fu movie awesome that helped make the movie not just a war movie in space. He was the guy that brought the Force into the film and made it a Star Wars flick...so, who really cares if he doesn't feel like a real person? I know I don't.And the last bit of hate is because, well, it doesn't have any of the real main characters, no Solo, no Skywalker and...well...it IS a stand alone movie, so if you came in expecting them, well, that is your fault. Disney made it clear from the get-go.What you have here is a cool science fiction war movie. It fits into the saga and it doesn't, but that isn't a bad thing--prequels, the Force Awakens--as only 3/7th of the saga movies are really any good.And, as a war movie, it stands on its own. It is actually better than a LOT of the war movies people tout as masterpieces **cough** **Thin Red Line** **cough** So, watch it, you should have no complaints......unless you are complaining about the SJW, the Fanfiction, and the lack of Skywalker or Solo, and if you are, well, there is going to be no pleasing you no matter what you watch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Star Wars Story that outclasses the sequels in every way possible.,"8.3Rogue One is my favorite recent Star Wars movie. Despite a terrible first act that even The Force Awakens can easily beat, Rogue One improves over time and finishes first in the end. What the Force Awakens lacked or did wrong, Rogue One did so much better.Firstly, the first act is not without flaws. It is slow, aimless and mostly passive. It's even worse than most other movies. This part is what I hated most about the movie and is a major problem. It's very surprising that a movie like this could make 1 billion dollars.Secondly, the second and third acts are much better. They create a more clear goal and also make the characters interesting, something that the Force Awakens failed to do. These characters are interesting enough for you to remember them even months after you left you theater.Thirdly, the movie also presents a very visually pleasing battle above and in the battle of Scarif, which was my favorite part of the movie. Gareth Edwards' direction was spot-on and the movie itself was much more fun than The Force Awakens. Rogue One was also more original and less cliche, something that I can root for.In conclusion, Rogue One is a much better movie than The Force Awakens, providing all the emotion, originality and enjoyability that it lacked before. If you want to see a good Star Wars film, watch Rogue One. It's better than all of the sequels that Disney can provide (except for The Mandalorian, of course).",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"New yet Nostalgic, Surprisingly Brilliant.","Rogue one is a perfect addition to the Star Wars saga and is exactly what it needed. It fits perfectly in between Revenge Of The Sith and the original (A New Hope).There is only a couple of iconic characters shown, which I believe was necessary and they were not over used which gave the film great in dependency. Although Darth Vader is shown within the trailer, he is seen as much as The Joker is within Suicide Squad. The main villain called Orsen Krennic played by Ben Mendelsohn was fantastic! He portrayed a great balance of fear through anger and was clearly shown as a coward too. Also, the great amount power he is given, gives him unpredictability which leaves you constantly on edge. The heroes show concentrated amounts of courage and bravery which brings you quickly emotionally attached towards them. There acting was tremendous and a lot better than the new characters in The Force Awakens in my personal opinion. The beginning is quite slow but certainly not boring and most certainly necessary as it develops story and character thoroughly. And as gets towards the final battle it becomes extremely epic and will give big Star Wars fans Goosebumps! One thing I was disappointed by was that they did not include the infamous opening credits giving a small back story. Chirrut Imwe, a blind and wise warrior played by Donnie Yen and K-2SO voiced by Alan Tuydk were very memorable characters for there brilliant lines and their awesome fighting skills. The scenes were visually stunning and the story was very well plotted. I most definitely recommend this film to anybody even if you have never seen a single Star Wars film in your life.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

In particular, you could sometimes tell that this Star Wars universe wasn't quite the same as the universe of the original trilogy. Those small differences are jarring if you hold the original in the highest regard.The second half of the film was better and the progression to the inevitable climax was very well done. It was the Star Wars universe I had wanted to see and the battles, spaceships and other elements made me happy!

Rogue 1 is a great example of a well told story,"I personally found this to be one of the better movies I've seen in a while.I thought the Force Awakens was fine, but I can't say I really got enthusiastic about any of the characters or the story.With Rogue One I thought it captured the magic of good story telling in which both the world and all the characters within it came alive so that you actually cared about what was happening.Whoever played Saw Gerrera and Orson Krennic they were fantastic characters that really boosted the background of the story and made the main character's struggle more compelling.I find the more I watch this movie, now that I have it, the more I like it while there's many other movies that have the opposite effect on me.The acting, dialogue, and the theme were all very tight and well done with little details like hand gestures and body language that made each conversation a little story in itself and so when you reach the climax you actually get excited about the action because your emotionally invested and care about the outcome.A really good example of classic fairy tale story telling with modern issues. Anyone who sees this movie and thought it should be more political or socially critical can go watch the Battle of Algiers instead, this is sci-fi fantasy.PS. I had a big argument with my friend as to which movie was better and he argued Force Awakens was better. I've seen Force Awakens 3 times and now I can't watch it without getting bored and turning it off while Rogue 1 is a movie I keep getting more and more fond of each time I see it. But I guess somehow there is something about Force Awakens people like which I don't understand.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Must see if Star Wars fan. That said, mediocre movie. Not entirely in the spirit of Star Wars","I am one of the biggest Star Wars fans out there. I love episodes 4 to 6. I also pretty much like episode 3.I am one of the fans who was terribly disappointed by episode seven (The Force Awakens). I thought it was essentially a clone of episode four plotwise. They did throw some new faces in, but the trajectory was almost entirely the same as that of A New Hope.I was pleasantly surprised, that Rogue One was an original movie. A whole new cast of characters, some of them who were quite memorable. Few tired Star Wars tropes this time around. (No Ewok-like cutesy creatures, no Jar-Jars, no mannequins, no overpowered jedi...)The tone of this movie was dark. There were moments of humour though. However, it is quite different from the other Star Wars movies.I didn't find myself feeling particularly attached to the characters in this movie/viewing. I did daydream quite a bit.However, the last 30 to 40 minutes, made the movie worth a watch. Spectacular Star Wars style space battles, Death Star, and some beautiful emotional moments made the movie worthwhile.Anyway, if you are a Star Wars fan, you must and probably will see this movie. If you are not, you probably wouldn't even be reading this review.A solid 6 to 7/10, I would give. I would rank the Star Wars Movies as follows:Episodes 4 to 6 > Rogue One > The Force Awakens > Episodes 1 to 3.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Has claim to the best Star Wars film,"While I think The Last Jedi just edges this film out for the best Star Wars film , this great film captures the essence of Star Wars in a way very few media properties do. It is not just that the film has the best ending sequence; I mean the entire 3rd act and how the sacrifice theme is realized. It is that the characters are perfectly written archetypes-the spy, the rebel, the zealot, the monk etc. Etc.-why having enough personality to not feel like archetypes. It is that the film makes The Force-via the way the plotting works-like a real character for once. It is the ragtag vibe. It is the planet hoping plot. This is a wonderful film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Honestly I only watched it for the Darth Vader scene,"I didn't know about the Star Wars anthology movies until I learnt about Solo. I didn't know anything about it, so I went in completely blind. The only thing I knew about this movie is the Darth Vader scene, and I thought if it has that scene, it must be having plenty such scenes. Turns out that scene is to this movie what Flash and Superman's slow motion fight is to Josstice League: The only one good scene in the entire movie. Most of this movie is just talking, talking and more talking.I won't complain about it though. I didn't know the ""We were on the verge of greatness"" meme was from this. I used to think that meme is about an agriculture scientist from Discovery telling how his experiment failed. So subsequently the ""Are we blind? Deploy the troops!"" meme also had to be from here, another one I didn't know where it was from. I ended up liking K2SO, he was my favourite character from the movie. I felt really bad seeing him die.The action scenes of this movie are very good, now that I think back about it, especially the one with the blind Jedi. The scene where a droid that looked like H2SO gets shot and then the actual H2SO comes from the back saying, ""I hope you knew it was not me."" was hilarious. But that's the only scene I remember, other than the Darth Vader scene of course. Most of the scenes from this movie are very forgettable. Out of the over 2 hour of runtime, I only remember barely 2 minutes from it combined.I don't see the point behind the making of this movie. It just answers a question nobody asked. I wasn't even paying attention because I was waiting for the Darth Vader scene, as I had begun thinking it isn't in this movie until the very end. I could definitely give it a rewatch whenever I get a Disney+ Hotstar connection, but that's really far from today.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Entertaining, hilarious, realistic and a great connecting link to the whole saga.","ROGUE ONE : A STAR WARS STORY - ReviewI was not so keen on this installment of the Star Wars franchise as from the trailer, it seemed an off-shoot story to me. But, man am I glad I booked its tickets on a whim on a late Friday.The movie delivers on every aspect congruent to its trailer. It exhibited the same war tactics and scenario as portrayed in the trailer. It has its great funny bits coming from the new robot K2 which exhibited some uncannily human characteristics. And it had great characters without any unnecessary baggage bogging down the plot. Everything in this movie is clean-cut and presentable - there is no ounce of unnecessary ornamentation and the length of the movie is just perfect.Every character had an explainable plot, and the actors did a great job playing them. Felicity Jones is surely a great find for Hollywood as she delivers so subtly but effectively - one consciously feels for her character. It is a bit reminiscent of the character Rey from the Star Wars- The Force Awakens movie.So it all comes down to the plot. The story is set just before/during the incidents of the Star Wars - A New Hope movie. The Rebellion acquired the knowledge and the plans of the Death Star weapon being developed by the Empire, and this movie focuses on how the Rebellion got the information regarding such weapon. It beautifully connects the dots and the plot to the incidents of 'A New Hope' - so much that you are in for a nice surprise in the end when the information is finally transferred!And yes, you see a lot more of Darth Vader in this movie than what you saw in the trailer - and it was awesome! All in all - a fine plot, great special effects and CGI, very endearing characters and an awesome climax and ending! The only negative aspect of the movie could be that it is a bit clichéd and formula driven.Rating : 4/5Verdict : Entertaining, hilarious, realistic and a great connecting link to the whole saga.

Amazing Movie With Great Moments of Humor,"This is actually my favorite Star Wars movie plot wise. I'm aware that many will disagree, but this film nails everything perfectly.

Very slight and fails to capture the feel of the originals.,"It feels very much like a side offering, what would have once been (and only deserved being) a straight to video fan offering. Slight.

By the Numbers - but quality,"Overall, an enjoyable movie. I've had an issue with Felicity Jones since the abysmal Theory of Everything.

On the other hand, nothing special occurs. While it does not live up to the high standard set by The Force Awakens, Rogue One achieves its goal: make a good Star Wars prequel. Compared to the infamous ones from years past, this is much better.For an enjoyable couple of hours, look no further.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Better than the last SW,"I like that this had a story rather than just a reboot! The story is book-ended by the original Star Wars, re titled a new hope. The story moves at a slower pace than I would have liked. Fell asleep twice near the same spots because it was slow, and the scene was dark for the prolonged night scenes. Did wake up in time to see the ending, with the actions and daylight views. Am I the few that noticed both the last two pictures were dominated by female heroine? More for girl power! They did bring back a few characters from the original Star Wars, so best to know who the original stars are. I guess they used a lot of cgi, or else those actors did not age much over 30+ years ago. I hear Disney plans to release one movie a year to recoup the expenses to buy out George, this is a better effort but I cannot see the franchise make mega bucks for the next one unless the story and special effects improve. Who wants to watch another remake?",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Force Takes a Nap,"In a year where Hollywood has failed to deliver, the stage was set for Rogue One to steal the show, unfortunately that was not the case. Instead, Gareth Edwards gave us a Star Wars rendition that, while looking absolutely stunning, lacks any character and depth. Despite on the service being a movie that is, arguably, visually superior to The Force Awakens, Rogue One offers little more than fan-service and leaves no lasting effects for audience members that have yet to be indoctrinated into this Lucas/Disney cult. What went wrong? One of the most significant flaws of Rogue One is its protagonist, Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones). Jones' performance is utterly bland, especially when compared to last years predecessor Daisy Ridley, and she serves as more of a reference point for the audience instead of the charismatic leader that this film needed. Very little motivation for Jones, as well as the rest of the clichéd ensemble, means that it becomes difficult for the audience to get invested in what was actually quite an enjoyable and action-packed final act. This is a problem that I believe persists throughout Gareth Edward's filmography, most notably Godzilla (2014). While all his films do look visually stunning, he has yet to master the art of character development and when considering Rogue One's quite standard heist plot, the lack of engaging characters does mean that the film suffers heavily. Although I enjoy Episodes 4-7, I am far from a Star Wars buff but I can appreciate the level of fan service that Rogue One contains and I can understand why fanatics seem to enjoy this film. However, the persisting thought I have about this film is; why was this made? Of course it whets the appetites of those eager for Episode 8 but Rogue One leaves no enduring moments for the Star Wars universe and with the rich history and depth of the Star Wars canon, it is a shame that this films biggest achievement is being better than the prequels. As it turns out, that's not a very difficult task.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"""A redefined approach to a well known franchise""","""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" is a redefined approach to a well known franchise. It marks the beginning of a new type of Star Wars movies - the ones told from a different perspective. ""Rogue One"" puts you in a place of more ordinary, everyday struggle of people living under the terror of imperialism. But, it does it with a twist; no longer is everything black and white, with clear villains and heroes, but it is rather more grey.And this is one of the things the movie sets up perfectly. It shows us how people adapted to a new order and how they developed within it. It shows us the grit of the galaxy far, far away. Connections that have been established between people of different species, united under the same goal. Their thoughts, their motivations and their conflicts. And it usually nails those. And the reason sometimes it fails to properly deliver becomes apparent as the movie goes on.As a standalone film, it is faced with a difficult challenge - it needs to set up a lot of new characters and tell their stories in a relatively short time (compared to previous trilogies). Hence the reason why you might end up feeling that you haven't seen as much as you wanted to.That being said, the fresh faces in the new cast were up to the challenge set before them, and delivered their roles perfectly. They successfully establish their relationship and motivations, although I would have preferred if I saw more of each character's backgrounds, which is again a sacrifice that had to be made due to shorter running time. Performance of Alan Tudyk as K-2SO was brilliant and I can honestly say that he quickly became one of my new all-time favorites in this universe.The pacing of the movie is also well executed - there wasn't a single time I felt discomfort or boredom during its run-time. Story pieces were set up properly, but at times felt rushed in order for everything to be wrapped up by the end. The movie might have benefited from leaving certain elements of the story unanswered, but as it stands, it still brought us a satisfying conclusion.Action sequences were intense and incredibly filmed, mixing both real life sets and props with CGI, creating some of the most memorable moments in Star Wars saga. Those moments show us the ingenuity of both sides that are fighting and steps they are willing to take in order to succeed.""Rogue One"", despite having some of these issues, still manages to bring to life an epic story filled with gorgeous worlds, interesting characters and memorable moments.

Horrible...humorless...boring.,"The movie was completely void of any humor or light heartedness except for a extremely few pathetic attempts. The brilliance of the very first Starwars was the action coupled with a sense of fun and adventure. This movie was SO serious that it was boring. The lead actress was quite forgettable in her role and for the first 40 minutes it was extremely hard to keep track of who was who and who was doing what!The other things that began to annoy me was the extreme fast cutting so that it was hard to follow the fights and the pretentious music in the background. The music just reeked of saying ""this movie is important because this music sounds important."" After about an hour we walked out!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"clichéd as hell, cheesy as hell, good as hell","So yeah I really liked rogue one, even though it somehow manages to hit almost all the things I hate in big budget action movies today. This film has some sh**ty characters and cheesy speeches about heroics and yadda yadda yadda. It has jokes that fall flat. It has so many moments that just are not good at all. But if you can get through all of that, this is a really great movie, especially visually. The action scenes are all well shot and exciting, preferring to use practical effects mixed with CGI rather than solely using CG. Honestly, besides one of those ""bad guy gets caught monologuing for no reason and dies because of it"" and the over the top and sappy character deaths, I pretty much love all the battle scenes/fight scenes from this movie. The costume and alien designs also work really well , just like every other Star Wars movie.The characters in this movie I found overall more compelling and funny than in episode 7 (although many of them are still very underdeveloped, I personally enjoyed them), and many of them even existed in a morally gray area, which is unexplored territory for this franchise. In fact, this movie does a good job showing that not ever rebel is good, as well as the civilian casualties that are usually cast aside in movies of this nature. ""Rogue One"" is also very funny at times, where only a few jokes fell flat. Compare that to ""The Force Awakens"", where I think I actually laughed only a single time throughout the entire movie no matter how hard they forced jokes into it. The ""easter eggs"" and callbacks in this movie are pretty obviously thrown in your face, but I still enjoyed them and am sure other fans of the series will spend hours jerking off to them, unlike me who only pleasures myself to the soft tears of orphans. The ending of this movie is also very good, and without spoilers I'll just say is a fantastic lead in to ""A New Hope"". Heck, even the CGI characters this movie ""resurrects"" from the original trilogy look amazing (although not perfect just yet). Overall I actually love Rogue One, but its glaring flaws hold it back from being anything other than a solidly good movie. Oh, and this is probably a given at this point considering even the prequels did this right, but the movie's score is pretty phenomenal I'll give it an 8/10 or maybe a 7.5/10 I'm not sure yet why am I so indecisive.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Give your code name :"" Rogue One""","So there we have a Star Wars PREQUEL, as we all know the prequels are at best boring and at the worst case scenario a disgrace to the name Star Wars. Thanks to Yoda ,the Force was strong with this one and it definitely deliver us with the best prequel in the Galaxy's Far Far way history. The story is as it follows, the Rebellion takes word of a new weapon been produced by the Empire (the first Death Star) and so an operation takes places in order to find out what it is and how to send to hell.That is more or less the story and let's be honest the whole film it is a set up for Episode IV. But it is made in such way that it makes the 1977 film even better for now you get what has happen in order for this plans to be delivered in to the Alliance hands. As for the character development, was as bit sloppy and made in a harry ,but the manage to do the needed minimum , for the audience to care for our character and it was done quite well. All the actors did their best and now to the good stuff: the effects and battle-scenes.One word ,mindblown, beautifully made, excellent mix of computer generated and practical to the point that you at times couldn't tell the difference. As for the fighting... goodness this was what we wanted needed and then some from the fight on the ground to the space battles ,it feel like watch a WW2 movie by in space. That is a compliment and quit fitting to this universe for when the first movie's space battles were made Lucas took inspiration from the air-combat in WW2, so that is a nice node to the original and the biggest war in human history.All in all forget Christmas, now we celebrate Star Wars.

It was fantastic to see the characters of Bail Organa and Mon Mothma return as played by the same actors whom played them in Lucas' prequel Trilogy. Another wow factor goes to the uncanny portrayal of General Tarkin by Guy Martin. Many high points here and I won't get into anymore.

Very bad execution by director.,"This movie had great ideas and great potential just like Godzilla. However also just like Godzilla the execution was done not terribly but pretty bad. I'm not going to spoil anything because the story line is one of the decent parts of the film. I'm also going to try and talk about real problems and subjective things that weren't to my taste. When I left the theater I thought the movie was alright, then I started thinking about everything I had just watched and realized a lot of it doesn't make any sense at all. This director is really bad at paying attention to little detail. This movie had terrible editing absolutely terrible editing. The amount of jump cuts in this film is compatible comparable sentence. At the beginning of the film inside a home with 3 characters in under 15 seconds it cuts to each character two times each in under 15 SECONDS... It hurt my eyes. There were also very many scenes where pointless 3 to 5 second clips of something that didn't need to be shown was there, which just added to the unnecessary amount of jump cuts. Other than the main character, no character had any real background. Since I'm on characters none of them had any real amount of character progression either. The main character has a personality jump out of nowhere that leads in to a generic ""I must give hope speech to convince people to fight with me"" right after the same people just did something that I'm sure would never be forgiven by anyone. Not within the time she did. Considering the stupid illogical characters in the story I would not trust any of them with my life. I'm trying hard not to go into detail so really this is all I can say. The characters were one of the weakest parts of the film. There were 3 that were likable but again they didn't have any background or character development. Them I guess the last thing I will complain about is the amount of small things that don't make any sense. Sure a couple is forgivable but in almost every scene something did not make sense. From denying logic to just characters doing very stupid things. This is a small complaint and it's a complaint about every star wars film but i do not like gun battles with the storm troopers. When the storm troopers are shot at, there is no entry or exit wound, no holes and they only take one hit to go down. However the human characters can take laser shots to clothing and flesh and still keep fighting... Yeah I""m sorry but no that's not okay. Also there was a scene where the force of a ship taking off rolled a character back off a platform but, corpses, other bodies and objects did not move an inch. I could go on and on about really stupid things that this film had going but I won't waste your time just know that really illogical things like those two examples I just gave happen throughout this entire film. I also think the main characters performance was very stale but again I think that's due to poor directing. Another quick little gripe and this is a little subjective is they felt the need to show a flashback of something that was just in a scene not even 10 minutes before the flashback. This is a personal gripe of mine but it makes me feel that the movie thinks I am incapable of following important story aspects. It makes me feel that the director thinks it's audience is retarded. Instead of a flashback why not just have a really strong emotional scene that has heavy impact on the viewers... I don't think it's the worse movie ever but it had terrible execution, bad editing, lots of continuity errors and generic story aspects and very, very stupid illogical characters. These are all the exact same problems I had with Godzilla and it sucks to see this director hasn't moved forward at all. I wanted to love this movie. If I had to actually have a positive for the film it would be the animation. There were a couple points where I didn't notice certain things were animated... Other than that everything else was just okay or poorly executed.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Rogue One proves Star Wars is in good hands.,"Audiences returned to Star Wars with Abrams' entertaining if unoriginal The Force Awakens. Gareth Edwards reminds audiences why we love Star Wars in the first place with his dark and exciting installment ROGUE ONE.The film presents us with the Rebel Alliance in full swing against the insidious Galactic Empire which is rumored to be building a doomsday weapon, described in whispers as a planet killer. They plan to contact or preferably kill the machine's creator by hiring his daughter Jyn Erso to track him down. Jyn Erso (Jones) is outfitted with a motley crew of killers, spies, saboteurs, and one very snarky but bad-ass droid (Tudyk). They are met with resistance from skeptical rebels, persistent storm-troopers, Imperial assassins, and Darth Vader himself! ROGUE ONE is not just a space opera but it is also a wartime adventure film. The ground battles, dog fights, and duels are all staged splendidly. Those felt short-changed by the more comedic action in 'The Force Awakens' will be pleased by the gripping and often dirty shootouts and skirmishes. Darth Vader himself gets in on the action in a short but fantastic sequence.As an ensemble action film, ROGUE ONE works in making its ragtag cast of rough-n-ready characters memorable, granted even if I don't remember their names. I at least know their personalities. Felicity Jones' posh accent might be off at first but she proves a resourceful and relatable protagonist. Her counterpart Cassian (Diego Luna) is a tad darker in attitude but no less heroic. Alan Tudyk is the stand-out as the burly but wisecracking droid K-2SO. Mads Mikkelsen, Forest Whitaker, Riz Ahmed, and Donnie Yen demonstrate how the Rebel Alliance (and in a greater sense bravery) can arise from any person. Ben Mendelsohn is a different kind of Star Wars villain, the pompous prick of a bureaucrat who is smarmy enough to curry favor with Darth Vader.The first half of ROGUE ONE is a tense spy thriller and by the third act, it's a full blown war epic. It's arguably the best action that we've seen in a Star Wars movie since Return of the Jedi. Although ROGUE ONE is a more brooding picture, there's still humor, heroics, and more importantly hope to be had in the movie. Especially with the closing shot.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Puts the Wars in Star Wars,"Star Wars! It is one of the biggest franchises around, spreading its tentacles to films, video games, cartoons and books. The films have been a dynastic saga about the Skywalker clan, until now! Rogue One is the first spin-off film and a bolder film then The Force Awakens which was a repeat of A New Hope.Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) saw her father (Mads Mikkelsen) being captured by the Empire and mother killed. 15 years later she had become a criminal with no allegiances until the Rebels free her so she can do a mission for them, meet a rebel extremist and Jyn's former guardian, Saw Gerrera (Forest Whittaker) who has vital intelligence about the Empire's new weapon.Rogue One is a direct prequel to A New Hope, tying into the events of the first film and the writers, director and producers pulled off a marvellous trick, making something fresh and original, expand the universe for people who only the on screen version of Star Wars and tell a story that people know the outcome to. Director Gareth Edwards perfectly recaptures the look of the original trilogy in its set-design and costumes and puts his own directional stamp on the series. Rogue One takes away the famous opening crawl and trademarks like the screen swipes: it was a risk and it paid off.Rogue One was what the prequel trilogy should have been - it was a darker tone like the prequels were meant to be and there is a clear emphasis on the 'Wars' part of the Star Wars title. It told a story where audience members knew the outcome to but still felt unique and not a carbon copy of other Star Wars film plots. It is an original story that is cleverly tied to A New Hope thanks to the screenwriters Chris Weitz and Tony Gilroy. The film also expands the mythology and science in the universe without being complete stupid i.e. midichlorians. Rogue One showed more of the culture and religion of the Jedis, with the Empire raiding their temples.Another risk of prequels is that they could be seen nothing but fan service. The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies and Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them were examples of being films obsessed with fan services and references for the sake of it. Rogue One had references to the series as a whole, some are recurring lines that are said in all the films, references that are tired into the wider series, like a certain Jedi and a few little nods for the fans. They are not forced and some even have a dramatic purpose.Rogue One also marks the first time a live-action Star Wars film has been composed by someone other than John Williams: Michael Giacchino. Giacchino is one of the most celebrated composers around, working on films like the Mission: Impossible series, the rebooted Star Trek films and many Pixar films and he was able to recreate Williams' sound - it could easily work within the other Star Wars films.The Star War series is a brand that supersedes any big name actors and Rogue One cast a collection of actors on the edge of hitting the big time, respected character actors and genre actors. Jones was cast after she was nominated for an Academy Award for her role in The Theory of Everything and along with her roles in Inferno and A Monster Calls she had a terrific year. She was convincing in the action scenes and being the jaded young woman who isn't that interested in the rebellion but deep down got a good heart. One of her biggest moments was when she sees a message her father left for the resistance and sees him for the first time in 15 years. She was overwhelmed just by a hologram.The big stand out performance was Alan Tudyk as a reprogrammed droid K2-SO. He had a dry, sarcastic delivery that was sometimes pessimistic and always bitting. Tudyk sounded similar to Anthony Daniels and his character came across as a more confident version of 3-CPO. Despite his pessimism K2-SO was loyal to Cassian Andor and was quite the badass in battle.One of the biggest controversies about the film was using technology to bring Peter Cushing back from the dead - some commentators have said it was in poor taste despite his family allowing the film to use his likeness and the effect is seamless. The use of Cushing's Grand Moff Tarkin was used sparingly. Whilst the film could have used a new character but it does add to a sense of continuity in the series, as well Jimmy Smits to reprising his role as Bail Organa from the prequels.There were rumours that Rogue One was a troubled production - it was reported that there was a large amount of reshoots and that director Edwards was kicked off the project. If any of these rumours are true it doesn't show in the final product. Edwards is establishing himself to be one of the best sci-fi directors around, having already made Monsters and Godzilla and easily one of the best special effects directors around. He was able recreate the look and feel of the original trilogy and but his own stamp on the series, making a darker war film that uses some WWII iconography. The final battle can easily go down as one of the best in the whole franchise.Whilst Rogue One had a great opening and closing act it was in the middle were the film suffered from a saggy middle. The film was just stalling to extend its runtime and try and add some extra emotional drama.Rogue One works both as a sci-fi fantasy action for casual moviegoers and as an extension to the Star Wars series, showing that the films can move beyond the Skywalkers and Solos.

Starting out with a family of farmers with secret identities hiding out on a remote planet is pretty standard fare for Star Wars, and all of the other story lines meshed with what we know. The audience is gradually led to see how all the new characters are to fit in, but soon enough figure out how it will all end. That probably didn't help this movie. The characters were likable enough or evil enough but my favorite character was the robot K-2S0, humorously played by Alan Tudyk. I was stunned by the return of Grand Moff Tarkin just as he looked in 1977 Star Wars and thrilled by appearances of four other 1977 Star Wars characters (2 were the original actors). It was amazing special effects. Better than the Terminator reappearances of a younger Arnold Schwarzenegger imo.At the end of this movie we walked out feeling like, okay, so that's what happened. We also thought it causes problems for the story that picks up in Star Wars IV: A New Hope. I would have preferred a more elated or bereaved feeling at the end of a movie like this, and to not have questions about the Star Wars story plausibility. Also, the word Hope in this movie was pretty over used now that I think about it. Still a decent movie which answers a question. A question that could have just remained a mystery.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The best Star Wars flick since the originals,"First and foremost, see this in 3d.Perhaps my high rating was influenced by low expectations. I and my son were vastly underwhelmed by the prequels of recent years. Part of the downfall of those movies IMHO was due to stacking it with known actors, e.g. Samuel Jackson, Natalie Portman, etc. and bringing back original cast. Fail. The actors here are largely unknown and therefore have to stand on their own and the story has to stand on its own. Although there are ties to the original moves, it's a natural fit, nothing is forced, and the originals aren't milked.The story is coherent, flows, and keeps moving along. The music helps with that and keeps the sense of excitement going. No forced romances, and the epic moments come and go without being overstated. Little if no one scene character development.There are minor humor angles, which were limited to a couple of scenes and done really well. One made me and the two kids bust a gut. No spoilers here, sorry.Felicity Jones nailed her part as did others. The worst of them rated a B, which is saying a lot.I gave it a 9 as Diego Luna could have been just a bit better in a couple of parts, nor does he have the charisma/engagement of Ford or Hamill.Go see it, very worthwhile.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Quite disappointing,"I just finished this film about half an hour ago, and I decided it deserved a critique. I wouldn't give the film two thumbs down, but perhaps one down and the other kind of sideways. Only Disney could take the Star Wars franchise and turn out a film that is a tragedy (as a genre). I have never seen a Star Wars film where everyone dies, even the droid. Most of the film felt like a a sequel to Apocalypse Now set in Florida. The dialogue was atrocious. If I hear someone say ""hope"" one more time, not to mention the bazillion lines they copied and pasted from the original trilogy, I'm going to do a Vader choke on someone. The only part of the film that felt authentic was the last ten minutes (Darth Vader killing rebels; and a young CGI Carrie Fisher making her escape from the dark lord). 3PO and R2 had the most awkward cameo, as did other characters. The overall feel of the movie was much too emotional. If the cast had not been tragically... eliminated, the story may have had some ""hope."" Instead the film made me want to cry and curse at Micky Mouse. To put things in perspective, let's use Episode IV: A New Hope. Rouge One was the equivalent of having R2 and 3PO killed by storm-troopers, Han Solo killed by a stray grenade, and Luke and Leia embracing on a planet as it disintegrates around them (picture Jack and Rose on the Titanic).The technical aspects also deserve a mention. There was no traditional Star Wars scrolling titles, just a bland title with no creativity. The absence of the main title score was a huge blunder, I will not speak of the Rouge One score 🤐. The use of CGI... let's just say that even George Lucas would have used less. However, the recreation of actors in their youth was quite impressive.If you and your family are looking for a fun and exciting Christmas Star Wars film, this is not it. You will feel left empty inside, with nothing but ""hope"" for a better film next year.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Star Wars 3.5, well done.","**NO SPOILERS** Another feather to add to the cap, for the Star Wars franchise, Rogue One satisfies and thrills entirely. With engaging character- building and location development, this movie seamlessly ties together pace, emotion and realism. True human flaws are depicted with delicacy, however without the loss of that grand, old valiance and righteousness that we all love, in our leading characters. Despite being introduced to them for the first time, through the course of the film, we connect and empathize with the characters and feel like we've always known them-- which is a tough feat to achieve, especially because the movie had to bear the burden of not having anyone(much) from the Episode Films. This had me wishing, (although unjustly, I know) for the ending to be different.But the little that we do get to see of our old beloved characters, is enough for at least the hardcore fans' hearts to feel content. Darth Vader is given to us in just the right quantity with it feeling neither like a repetition of Episode 4 nor a completely detached story. Jyn Erso is the perfect rogue-turned-hero and her rebel allies are just as sharp and driven. Cassian(Diego Luna) is a warrior in the true sense of the word and the war that he and his team fight is gritty, convincing and unpredictable, just like it should be. It would be unfair to leave out K-2SO from this review, as he is a delight to watch, perfectly balancing the mechanical features of C- 3PO and the sass and persona of R2D2 (**Minor Spoiler**both of whom, I'm happy to say, are given a couple of seconds on screen).It is a much required ""prequel"" and is important to the saga to bridge the events of Episode 3 and 4. The visuals, as expected, are worth watching in 3D and IMAX and reach their full peak towards the end of the movie resulting in a spine-tingling climax. For someone like me, who never really is out of the Star Wars spirit, this is just what I needed. If this is any indication of the future spin-offs to come then I can say that things are looking very bright ahead, indeed. And now, begins the wait for Episode 8 (hey, that rhymes!).",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"17 years after The Phantom Menace, Gareth Edwards and Tony Gilroy have delivered a sophisticated Star Wars prequel the franchise deserves.","It's enormously telling that, when Darth Vader makes his entrance midway through Rogue One, one is taken aback by the sheer cheesiness of his iconic costume and speech. While Vader remains one of cinema's most enduring villains, the late 1970s-aesthetic of the character is at such sharp odds with the dusty realism of Gareth Edwards' new spin-off that the contrast is truly shocking. Star Wars has come a long way, not only from the sand dunes of A New Hope, but from the infantile comedy of Phantom Menace and clustered CGI cityscapes of Attack of the Clones— George Lucas was clearly not the best person to direct Star Wars prequels; Edwards (and co-writer Tony Gilroy, who oversaw much of Rogue One's last-minute re-tinkering) have managed in one film to tell a more coherent, human story and establish the groundwork for the original trilogy better than Lucas could in 7 hours of the prequel trilogy.The existence of Rogue One highlights the divide in the Star Wars mythos between the story of the Jedi and their spiritual battle with the Sith (an undeniably fascinating subject, but one that Lucas horribly mishandled) and the on-the-ground Star War between the Rebel Alliance and the Galactic Empire. In Rogue One, there is nary a lightsaber in sight and The Force has evolved into a vague philosophical concept, spoken of by warrior monk Chirrut Îmwe (Donnie Yen). The choice to focus on the 'real' side of the Star Wars world facilitates, and somewhat obligates, the filmmakers to tell a compelling story of politics and war set against the backdrop of the Imperial superweapon: the Death Star. What Lucas and co. were forced to paint and sculpt in 1977, Edwards can create with layers of CGI: Rogue One in many ways does justice to the ambitious vision of the original Star Wars: a vision too grand for its technical era. While the constance of thrilling set-pieces in JJ Abrams' The Force Awakens, occasionally at the expense of quieter character moments, was grating, in Rogue One it feels justified: this is, after all, a war movie. Also, while several of the film's characters (Îmwe and Sheldon Cooper-esque droid K-2SO) are superbly-realised, the band of misfits at Rogue One's core feel neither deserving nor necessitating a great amount of those ""quiet character moments"": these are simpler figures than a Skywalker or a Solo, a Rey or Finn, and these are figures whose strongest moments of character development emerge on the battlefield.Though the poster-girl for the film, Felicity Jones' Jyn Erso is undeniably the least interesting protagonist a Star Wars film has ever had: despite Jones' best efforts, Jyn remains frustratingly one-dimensional throughout. She's not unlikeable, and her motives are noble, but- as the only significant female character in the film- she fails to stand out from the otherwise-male team as a memorable hero. Diego Luna's Captain Andor is drawn far too similar to Jyn, sharing her stone- faced resolve but possessing none of the wit of the great Star Wars male leads: Han Solo, Finn, Poe Dameron, Anakin Skywalker (we may be lying about that last one). Riz Ahmed's Bodhi Rook is, at the beginning of the film, incredibly energetic, but after spending some time with ""Rebel extremist"" Saw Gerrera (a distractingly wheezy Forest Whitaker) loses much of his personality: Ahmed, a superb actor, is never truly given a chance to shine. Jiang Wen's Baze Malibus, meanwhile, serves primarily as a Butch Cassidy to Îmwe's Sundance Kid. They're a formidable duo who could probably have led their own spin-off, and provide tremendous insight into the impact of Imperial rule over the unsung citizens of the Galaxy.The film's most impressive performance, unsurprisingly, comes from Ben Mendelsohn as Orson Krennic: a character of subtle villainy, highlighting further Revenge of the Sith's missed opportunity at exploring the Dark Side's complex appeal. Mendelsohn excels in every scene, particularly opposite both Mads Mikkelsen and a certain other actor in a stunning surprise appearance. His scenes with Darth Vader are the highlight of the film: the Sith Lord has never been filmed nor framed so beautifully. Michael Giacchino's score, though largely a generic mashup of John Williams' classic motifs, is at its best when introducing Vader.Rogue One's third act, much of which was reshot and reedited (several shots from the trailer are nowhere to be seen) is essentially a hybrid of the Original Trilogy's most beloved action scenes: there's an AT-AT attack, a break-in involving ladders, forest fight and the most impressive X- Wing battle in the franchise's history. The outcome of the Rebels' mission, if you've seen Star Wars, is predictable. Rogue One's final sequence is as breathtaking a tribute to Lucas' 1977 film as we'll ever see, presenting a magnificently terrifying realisation of one legendary Star Wars figure and an utterly joyful appearance by another. However, Rogue One doesn't need nostalgia and foreshadowing to succeed: as a standalone product with few links to the familiar elements of the franchise, this looks and feels like Star Wars in a whole new way. Breaking free into the Galaxy, this film establishes a new era of the Star Wars world: one of uninhibited exploration and imagination. We're hopeful for the future: after all, Star Wars is built on hope",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Great Entry to the Star Wars Universe,"First of all Star Wars has always been one of my favorite movie franchises! For that reason this was my most anticipated movie of the year. Last year I loved the Force Awakens and it was one of my favorites of the year.So going to this movie I was expecting it to be amazing knowing the basic plot. Leaving the theater I was really happy but I wasn't blown away. That's mainly because of the first 2 acts that were kind of slow, but they had some great scenes. A lot of new characters were introduced but unfortunately I didn't connect to them, mainly because they were too many and we didn't know the backstory of its character. The new droid K2SO was really funny and had some great scenes. It might be the most interesting character to me..yes..the droid! The main villain, Crenic, I thought was just good but he didn't had the impact that Vader or Kylo Ren had in the other movies.Now let's talk about the awesome stuff..Well..DARTH VADER! He was in very few scenes in the movie but when he was...he was outstandingly awesome and i had a giant smile on my face watching those scenes!! Except from Vader, the 3rd act was amazing! It emphasised WARS in Star Wars... I was blown away with the visual effects...and I think it had the best space battle in any Star Wars movie. And that ending...just...GREAT!!Overall I think this was a really good movie and different from the other Star Wars movies. If you are a Star Wars fun you will be very very happy with the movie. If you are not you are probably going to like it but you will not understand some stuff, because it has references from the other movies. Finally i believe that you should go and see the movie and I can't wait for the next chapter in the Star Wars films! Score 75/100",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Star Wars at its best,"A true original. Packed and fast paced, so you have to stay focused. Many things go on in the first hour. The new characters are very strong, loved this new crew.

Marketing Star Wars to the Millenial Generation...,"Well the story about stealing those pesky Imperial secret plans gets another re-hash but this time in AVX 3D with a few cameos by original evil villain characters and the story has a hanging ending alluding to yet another sequel... The story line, while not predictable, definitely reminiscent of Part IV right down to the farming family, cheeky android robots, space port outposts and space battle scenes. Totally dazzling CGI imagery even better on a big screen in 3D. To keep continuity a few key Imperial characters make a re-appearance and there is a somewhat surprising ending that leads the way to the opening scene of the original 1977 Part IV including an unexpected appearance by a presumably CGI generated young princess character....In some ways if you haven't seen Part IV then see Rogue One first but if you're the Over-50 crowd and remember seeing the first Star Wars then Rogue One both makes sense yet eerily follows the same basic story and plot.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

As Misguided As It Is Redunant,"Following a motley gang of rebels on the hunt for the plans to a planet-destroying super- weapon, Rogue One, the fist ""stand-alone"" Star Wars story, finally lands with a loud thud on our screens. Two films in and Disney's management of this golden franchise is already showing very troubling signs of laziness and risk-aversion. If you've come looking for something a bit more original than The Force Awakens, this will be a a very strange disappointment.By now the consensus is in that Episode VII, while entertaining, is basically a soft reboot of Episode IV, weighed down a bit by a Mary Sue heroin (despite a personable and able actress in the role). What that installment did do right, however, was nail the tone, and perform at its best when offering new ingredients. Its original characters were, for the most part, interesting and fun to be around, and you wish there were less fan-service to distract you. I mention all this because, strangely enough, Rogue One has the exact opposite problem.After a title that enigmatically promised X-Wing action, then a trailer campaign implying a kind of Dirty Dozen meets Star Wars, the resulting film is more a limp, flavorless war in space movie with bland, under-cooked characters embarking us on a mission we all know the ending to, and them peppering it very heavy-handedly with enough fan service to handicap any attempt at an original story.An intriguing new villain is introduced... but the fans want to see Darth Vader (and, supposedly Grand Moff Tarkin from episode IV), even though they have nothing to do beyond look cool and menacing and defang the main villain. Each new character stumbles in and has to be introduced with words: so much for the visual fluency of the original saga. Everyone kinda pouts their way through this, and the mood varies through different grey shades of ""subdued"" in an effort to be edgy and dark... and instead coming across as completely joyless, a real first for the Star Wars saga.Unlike Episode VII, the fan service moments will be the only ones to quicken your pulse, never mind their narrative redundancy or lack of sense. Cool! That's Vader's castle... but wait, why are we here? Wasn't Vader established as kinda subordinate to Tarkin in Episode IV? Yeah! We get to see the Death Star fire the big gun up close... Except wasn't Alderaan in Episode IV meant to be a huge surprise? Hey, there's Vader again... dispatching people nobody cares about... And on, and on... Everything ""new"" in between barely registers, with the exception of Alan Tudyk as K-2SO as a welcome but underused touch of vague humor.On the strength or these two films, we can expect much of the same coming up. More of the same with fan service coming at the expense of a satisfying narrative. This isn't as inept or ghastly as the prequels by any stretch of the imagination, but boy is it just bland.See it if you must, but if it's Star Wars in war mode you want, you'd be better off getting a used copy of the Battlefront video game, which probably has more character development and narrative cohesion. At least that will spare you the horrific site of dreadfully CGIed Carrie Fischer and Peter Cushing.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Seriously, this was a good movie. Go see it – twice!","""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" is every bit as good as you've heard; even this non-""Star Wars"" geek had great fun with it. I'd cheerfully give it a 8 out of 10, and I'd recommend you give it a try even if you don't typically enjoy the franchise.Die-hard fans are currently noting all of the things that make this film unique in the series: it's the first ""Star Wars"" movie without a Jedi, the first without the trademark opening text-crawl, the first one without a lightsaber duel.Casual fans might be more impressed with more general differences. Two stood out for me.One, this is the first Star Wars film since ""The Empire Strikes Back"" (1980) that seems aimed mainly at adults. Yes, the fairy tale elements are still there — we have an underdog orphan searching for her father, the requisite anthropomorphic aliens, and a humorous robot mascot (which surprisingly worked quite well). But those elements are absolutely upstaged by a bona fide war film, complete with tactics, strategy, panic, collateral damage and casualties. I remember thinking during a surprisingly gritty urban warfare scene that it was as though some filmmakers had taken a scene from a film like ""The Hurt Locker"" (2008) and set it within the ""Star Wars"" universe.Two, I think that this is the most human Star Wars movie we've had since ""Empire."" It wouldn't be ""Star Wars"" without the aforementioned aliens and robots, and plenty of references are made to the Force and the Jedi. But this is a movie about ordinary people. Yes, there is one larger-than-life character who appears  force-sensitive? This universe's equivalent of Marvel's ""Daredevil?"" (This was a confusing story element that didn't always work for me.) But we are presented primarily with all-too-human anti-heroes who feel fear, suffer, and die.Isn't that more exciting than watching cartoonish aliens fight armies of equally cute battle-droids? In this film's better moments, it made me feel like a was watching a ""real"" war with ""real"" people, and I was surprised to find myself actually rooting for the good guys in a ""Star Wars"" film — this has been a series that I've long half-dismissed as being essentially children's stories.Seriously, this was a good movie.

Better than The Force Awakens!,"After last year's mildly entertaining yet sometimes frustrating TFA, I was ready to give up on modern Star Wars. However, I saw the trailer for this film and I said to myself, ""why not give it a second chance?"" and I bought a ticket for a night showing the day the film was released into theaters. And I'm very glad I did. Rogue One is a fresh new take on different characters that are developed to be loved by the audience, although the same classic Star Wars feel is present with plenty of charms. For example: instead of the irritating Jar Jar Binks that doesn't fit in a Star Wars movie, a new comic relief named K-2SO is introduced as a sarcastic yet hilarious droid that doesn't need to incorporate childish fart jokes to be funny, providing the sassy humor that all OT fans adore. The CGI is absolutely seamless; everything blends in incredibly realistically with the actors and props, and the action sequences are some of the most creative I've seen at the theater this year; remember that glorious airport fight scene that Civil War showcased? Well, Rogue One tops that in as many ways as possible! Oh, and the Easter eggs, cameos and Darth Vader are just the icing on the already delicious cake- they will leave you jaw-dropped. Go see Rogue One, but make sure it's in 2D, as 3D will ruin the already amazing visuals. Have a blast!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"star wars is about faith, but its supposed to be about war","star wars has war in its title, but the films really deal more in faith. I am not saying this is bad, because there really are not a lot of mainstream films dealing with faith in the way star wars is. However, a franchise with the title star wars should include stars and be about war. Although stars are included, no movie has really talked about war. Now, with the Star Wars Anthology series existing, we can expect films with different style than the main episodes. While Han Solo film is supposed to be an action- adventure film with a western feel, then Rogue One is a film about war and its price. Not only is this film gritty, dark and includes colorless visuals, it also deals with the fact that in war, even the good guys have to do bad things, like be assassins and spies, which is not as honorable as being Han Solo or Luke Skywalker. But without this there would not be victory. In fact, one of the good guys gets killed by the rebels as a mistake. Also, all of the films main characters die. But they gave the Death Star plans to the rebels and so, victory comes. In fact, if they would have failed, Luke Skywalker would not be a legend after all. Also, I like how the film acknowledges that Darth Vader is a broken soul and does not shy away from using material from the prequels( they are part of the canon) and uses both Coruscant and Mustafar. But at its heart, it is a gritty war film bout war and its price.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

As good as people wanted.,"""These Star Wars movies are pretty much the same story each time nowadays. This one has new names for basically the same characters, played by different actors...the same bad guys. How many times can they make the same movie and get people to pay?"" read a review in Rotten Tomatoes. This is the exact opposite from the truth, and shows that the critic didn't even bother to watch it. While The Force Awakens felt overly repetitive and disappointing moments after I left the theatre, Rogue One completely outperformed my expectations.I thought it would be just a mish-mash of poorly connected CGI battle scenes and overly choreographed, ridiculous jedi combat scenes, with a recycled, overly simplistic, uninteresting plot.Instead the movie delivers a simple-yet-captivating plot with its fair share of well placed, well made twists, a fair share of good CGI mixed with action scenes, and characters with sufficient depth. It has lots of action, comedy, drama (the good kind) and tragedy. It also provides good answers to one of the most recurring questions of the Star Wars universe regarding the Death Star.And speaking about the Death Star, after the underwhelming superweapon from TFA and knowing it will be destroyed in A New Hope (and again in Return of the Jedi), I stopped seeing it as threatening. This movie surprised me showing it in all its terrifying glory, bringing a sense of dread that A New Hope and Return of the Jedi didn't have (also taking advantage of the obvious improvements in CGI to make it look truly awesome). You probably read about how they brought back Peter Cushing, and it's not just his face, it's all about him, including his technological terror.As obvious as it is that this movie draws its inspiration and ovrall soul from The Empire Strikes Back, it's not just a recycled plot (like TFA), but a new movie, with its own story and a new set of heroes and villains, rightfully taking its place as the prequel to all Star Wars movies (because they never managed to make episodes I, II and II, and nothing you say is gonna make me think otherwise).",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

2 hours 2 long,"Now I know that many of you guys will be smashing that ""Not Helpful"" button because I am giving this a bad review (because the same thing happened when I gave ""The Force Awakens"" a very positive review), but there's one thing I beg you to do. Hear me out! Read this review before deciding that I have no good taste, because I believe that I have good reasons to personally dislike this movie, even if others like it. And I will admit there are positive things about it. As a matter of fact, the performances (except for Forest Whitaker's really silly accent), directing, and visual effects are all very well done. I will not deny that this is a well made film that took some hard work and effort to create.However...It is boring! There is nothing particularly interesting about the plot, the characters all have little to no personality, I was so bored I wasn't paying any attention-I was just staring at a screen as random stuff was being thrown in my face. It is packed with uninteresting dialogue, surprisingly boring action sequences, and an overly depressing tone. I am all for dark movies, but this is just ridiculous. One of the most annoying new blockbuster movie clichés is that every movie has to be so dark and depressing for seemingly no reason, simply because it works flawlessly with Christopher Nolan's work. But, this is because Nolan is a much more talented filmmaker than Garreth Edwards, whose work I admittedly enjoyed in the past. I thought that, while very flawed, his 2014 ""Godzilla"" movie was really underrated and epic. I enjoyed that movie, even if it was dark there were still cool things about it and it didn't feel overlong or boring to me. Unfortunately, this film is DEFINITELY boring for me, and is almost factually overlong.Think about it, the whole concept of this film is stealing plans. If the characters were developed, perhaps it would be worth a 2 and a half hour runtime, but the characters each have little to no personality or backstory. This is a movie of nothingness, of a painful dullness. I attempted to eat too many Reese's Pieces during this movie so I could throw up because then something interesting would be happening. Footage of me pathetically vomiting out of boredom would be a much more powerful and engaging movie with better characters and conflict than ""Rogue One"".I watch movies to be engaged and fascinated, not to be bored. This movie is just flat out BORING. I've already stated that plenty of times in this review, but that is because I mean it with all of my heart. I could not pay attention or care about anything that was going on because of the lack of personality the film had in its writing and even in its cinematography. The visual tone of this film is needlessly dull and grey. I know many will defend this movie by calling it a ""gritty war drama"", but it doesn't work as that either. Also, ""Star Wars"" is mainly a fantasy universe, why would I want to watch a gritty war drama taking place in this universe rather than in a more realistic environment. Why do the most fantastic, wondrous concepts have to be transformed into something realistic? The original trilogy, which pretty much everyone agrees includes the best three films in the entire saga, did not try to be realistic. It tackled a few realistic themes and conflicts, but those themes were never made to be over the top. The original films were not gritty, they had much more humor and fun. They were entertaining thrill rides that also included characters and stories we cared about. They could be intense, funny, and even tragic at times, and it always worked because they were made in such a way that the viewer was always engaged in the story, the viewer always liked the characters. ""Rogue One"" is the opposite of this.Now I'm getting really controversial...So it seems that 90% of IMDb user reviewers thought that ""The Force Awakens"" was 1/10 trash, despite it being a very well made and colorful film that genuinely had some heart and soul. It was flawed, but it was also fun. The special effects were wonderful, it worked as a celebration of ""Star Wars"". The characters were likable and (for the most part) memorable. It had humor and heart, action and suspense. It may have been a very unoriginal movie due to it being so ridiculously similar to the original 1977 classic, but at least it felt like the people behind it were much more loving and joyful. It feels like the people behind ""Rogue One"" just wanted to kill themselves and make money from basement dwelling internet geeks. However, ""Rogue One"" is packed with 10/10 star reviews, people saying that it made up for ""The Force Awakens"". This is something almost impossible for me to wrap my mind around. Was it just more awesomer? Were the past references so epic that it is now a masterpiece of cinema?I am sure there are plenty of great and intelligent people that will disagree with me entirely, and I am well aware that I may have been a little unfairly mean while making fun of some members of the ""Star Wars"" fanbase, but the overall point of this review is just:This movie is boring and I do not understand the praise.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
